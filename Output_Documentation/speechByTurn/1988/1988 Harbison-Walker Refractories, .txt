    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    We'll hear argument now on Number 87-271, Harbison-Walker Refractories versus Eugene Brieck. 
    Mr. Kramer, you may proceed whenever you're--
speaker="andrew_m_kramer" startTime="12.549" stopTime="196.860">
    Mr. Andrew M. Kramer 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    This case involves a legal question under Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure of whether a reasonable jury on the basis of the entire record in this case could find that Respondent was laid off and not recalled because of his age. 
    Since the court below reversed the District Court's grant of Petitioner's motion for summary judgment, it is first appropriate to review the facts underlying this matter. 
    Petitioner Harbison-Walker provides technology and specialized refractory products to high-temperature natural resource industries, the largest of which is the steel industry. 
    As the business fortunes of the steel industry declined in the early eighties, so did the business fortunes of Harbison-Walker. 
    Between 1980 and 1982 Harbison's employment was reduced from approximately 5,400 employees to 2,700 employees. 
    In 1982 sales declined some 31 percent, the posted and net operating loss of $21 million or $20.5 million, and employment in that year alone was reduced 38 percent. 
    In making decisions as to which groups of employees would be laid off, Harbison considered among other things length of service and the skills necessary to perform work in a reduced work environment. 
    Among the employees hardest hit by the downturn were those working in the company's iron and steel marketing group. 
    Within that group were four installation specialists. 
    Respondent who at the time of this action was aged 55 with 17 years of service; Mr. Malarich, aged 59 with approximately 16 years of service; Mr. Faust, aged 39 with approximately 16 years of service; and Mr. Meixell, aged 59 with approximately two and one half years of service. 
    Because of a substantial reduction in shipments, Petitioner elected in early July 1982 to lay off, among others, two of its installation specialists, the Respondent who was 55 years old, and Mr. Meixell, who was 59 but was the least senior of the installation specialists. 
    Petitioner retained the 59-year-old, Mr. Malarich, and the 39-year-old, Mr. Faust, because they possessed more diverse or versatile skills and had higher job performance evaluations. 
    Mr. Faust, the 39-year-old, had previously worked for Petitioner as a sales correspondent, and his work duties included pricing and margin work, which work he continued to perform after he became an installation specialist. 
    The skills of pricing and margin work were skills that Respondent concedes and the courts below found he did not have and would require training to perform. 
    Faust had before his--

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Mr. Kramer, when you say, "The courts below found", this came up on summary judgment, so you're obligated, of course, to take the facts against you--
speaker="andrew_m_kramer" startTime="206.267" stopTime="206.645">
    Mr. Andrew M. Kramer 
    --Yes.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="206.645" stopTime="207.927">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    --and to the extent that they can be.
speaker="andrew_m_kramer" startTime="207.927" stopTime="398.092">
    Mr. Andrew M. Kramer 
    Yes. 
    The courts noted that there was no record evidence to support the assertion, Mr. Chief Justice, that Mr. Brieck, the Respondent in this case, had performed that work while employed at Harbison, and there is an affidavit at pages 52 and 53 in the record from the Respondent himself in which he concedes that, in fact, those were jobs that he had not performed but, to the extent he had not, he could be easily trained to perform them. 
    Prior to the layoffs in question, Mr. Faust, the 39-year-old, had spent approximately 60 percent of his time doing office work and 40 percent of his time doing installation work outside of the office. 
    Business conditions worsened. 
    In late July of 1982, Mr. Malarich, the 59-year-old, was laid off. 
    Three months later, Mr. Faust himself, was laid off. 
    In the spring of 1983, Mr. Malarich, the 59-year old, was recalled, first on a temporary and then on a permanent basis. 
    In the summer of 1983, Mr. Malarich, the 59-year-old, at that time approximately approaching 60, indicated to Petitioner that he was going to elect to retire that fall. 
    At that time Petitioner recalled Mr. Faust, the 39-year-old. 
    After his recall Mr. Faust in deposition testimony stated he performed approximately 75 percent of his work doing installation work outside the office, 25 percent doing office work, an undetermined amount of which was pricing and margin work. 
    Of the 12 individuals laid off from Petitioner's iron and steel marketing group between July and November 1982, 75 percent were under the age of 40, and one of the three who was over the age of 40 who was laid off, was subsequently recalled, Mr. Malarich. 
    Of the 21 remaining employees after the layoffs took place, over half were over the age of 40 and over half of that group were over the age of 50. 
    Within two weeks or... yeah, within two weeks, excuse me, of his July layoff, Respondent filed the charge of age discriminations. 
    Approximately two years later, he filed the lawsuit challenging among other things his layoff and his failure to recall on the basis of age discrimination. 
    Full-scale discovery commenced, and Harbison subsequently moved the District Court for summary judgment. 
    The District Court granted this motion. 
    The District Court found first in a reduction-in-force case there is not an onerous burden to establish a prima facie case of discrimination and, in fact, found that a prima facie case was made solely because of the fact that Respondent was 55 years old at the time of his layoff and had been qualified to be an installation specialist.

    Justice Byron R. White 
    Do you challenge that?
speaker="andrew_m_kramer" startTime="399.281" stopTime="407.318">
    Mr. Andrew M. Kramer 
    No, not at all. 
    And, in fact, at this stage, Justice White, it's really a question of whether a reasonable jury could conclude because at this point in time--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="407.318" stopTime="409.689">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    So, the prima facie case was made out?
speaker="andrew_m_kramer" startTime="409.689" stopTime="412.171">
    Mr. Andrew M. Kramer 
    --No, it was made out, and we have no challenge to that.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="412.171" stopTime="416.863">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    And if you hadn't said anything in response, judgment could have been entered against your client.
speaker="andrew_m_kramer" startTime="416.863" stopTime="460.541">
    Mr. Andrew M. Kramer 
    Yes, that's right. 
    And, in fact, at that time in light of Texas Department of Community Affairs v. Burdine, the burden of production then shifted to my client to produce a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its actions. 
    The District Court found that this was satisfied since, in fact, three of the five years before the layoff the Petitioner had rated Mr. Faust higher than the Respondent and that, in fact, there was no doubt that Mr. Faust possessed the diverse skills that Respondent or that Petitioner contended it was going to use as one of its guides as to who would be laid and who would be recalled. 
    The District Court then went on to reject Respondent's effort to show that these reasons were a pretext for discrimination.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="460.541" stopTime="480.085">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Is it your position that when you... when you came forward with what you said was a neutral explanation, was it your position that if they... I guess it must be... that if the plaintiff hadn't done anything, then, said anything or offered anything, that judgment should have been entered for you?
speaker="andrew_m_kramer" startTime="480.085" stopTime="481.384">
    Mr. Andrew M. Kramer 
    Yes, Justice White.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="481.384" stopTime="506.132">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    You mean after step two of the Burdine phase where the plaintiff has shown a prima facie case, and you have articulated a reason whereby the... a legitimate reason, a nondiscriminatory reason for his treatment, still if a plaintiff has introduced enough to satisfy... to prove his case to a jury--
speaker="andrew_m_kramer" startTime="506.132" stopTime="526.404">
    Mr. Andrew M. Kramer 
    Mr. Chief Justice, the... if... plaintiff has ample opportunity to show pretext. 
    That wasn't the decision. 
    And that could simply be that there was competing inferences, that a reasonable jury could conclude despite the reason that we asserted that it was still a basis for discrimination. 
    At at that time summary judgment is not appropriate, and we are not contending otherwise.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="526.404" stopTime="543.646">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    --Well, supposing the plaintiff says, you know, I have proved the following facts, and I think, Trial Judge, that a reasonable jury could infer discrimination from that. 
    Now, that should mean if he's right, that should mean a denial of the summary judgment motion.
speaker="andrew_m_kramer" startTime="543.646" stopTime="552.010">
    Mr. Andrew M. Kramer 
    If there is facts in the record which could allow a reasonable jury to conclude that he was a victim of age discrimination.

    Unknown Speaker 
    Precisely.
speaker="andrew_m_kramer" startTime="552.771" stopTime="562.378">
    Mr. Andrew M. Kramer 
    That's right. 
    And we contend in this case that a reasonable jury could not on the basis of the evidence in this record conclude that he was a victim of age discrimination.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="562.378" stopTime="580.731">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well, now, the Respondents in their brief submit a number of additional facts which don't seem to have been mentioned either by the District Court or the Court of Appeals as saying that if you take all these facts, there would have been enough evidence. 
    But, I take it your criticism is the way the Court of Appeals handled this case.
speaker="andrew_m_kramer" startTime="580.731" stopTime="607.559">
    Mr. Andrew M. Kramer 
    Yes. 
    Well, the criticism because we're on review of that decision but, at the same point, I would not, Mr. Chief Justice, the fact that there are factual disputes does not preclude summary judgment. 
    They have to be genuine factual disputes. 
    I would submit that what Respondent has attempted to do in its brief raised a number of potential factual issues are neither material nor genuine in the sense of requiring a verdict in Respondent's favor if accepted.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="607.559" stopTime="617.304">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    But you do agree that the test, the trial court and every court should have applied is, has the plaintiff adduced sufficient evidence to support a finding of discrimination.
speaker="andrew_m_kramer" startTime="617.304" stopTime="617.955">
    Mr. Andrew M. Kramer 
    Yes.

    At any of these stages?

    Mr. Andrew M. Kramer 
    At any of these stages and, in particular--

    Justice Byron R. White 
    I mean, one by one, and that's the question in any of these stages.
speaker="andrew_m_kramer" startTime="625.280" stopTime="636.837">
    Mr. Andrew M. Kramer 
    --Yes. 
    It's a question of whether or not a reasonable jury could for purposes of summary judgment in this case could conclude that the Respondent was a victim of age discrimination.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="636.837" stopTime="647.523">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    But I would suppose you would say that after you present this neutral reason that if the Plaintiff doesn't do anything else that judgment should go for you.
speaker="andrew_m_kramer" startTime="647.523" stopTime="648.364">
    Mr. Andrew M. Kramer 
    Well, it depends--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="648.364" stopTime="649.584">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Or does it have to go to the jury?
speaker="andrew_m_kramer" startTime="649.584" stopTime="650.425">
    Mr. Andrew M. Kramer 
    --It depends--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="650.425" stopTime="651.337">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Does it have to go to the jury?
speaker="andrew_m_kramer" startTime="651.337" stopTime="683.737">
    Mr. Andrew M. Kramer 
    --All right. 
    It doesn't have to go to the jury unless you conclude that if I look at the Respondent's evidence, I look at Petitioner's evidence, and let's assume that there's competing inferences that can be drawn from that evidence. 
    Then that case should go to the jury. 
    We do not dispute the fact that this Court, whether it be in Celotex, Anderson, Matsushita v. Zenith, what it established was was whether a reasonable jury could so conclude. 
    What we contend is first, the Court of Appeals was in error in terms of the legal standard under Rule 56 under which it reviewed the evidence in this case.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="683.737" stopTime="698.638">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    You're also saying, are you not, that what is a prima facie case under McDonnell Douglas, just showing you're a member of the protective class and so on, well, is not necessarily enough to get you to the jury.
speaker="andrew_m_kramer" startTime="698.638" stopTime="713.608">
    Mr. Andrew M. Kramer 
    Well, that's right. 
    In fact, this court noted in Burdine and it also stated, in fact, in McDonnell Douglas itself that a prima facie showing is not the equivalent of a factual finding of discrimination. 
    Indeed, this court in Burdine held--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="713.607" stopTime="725.826">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    But that's still a third thing. 
    A prima facie showing under McDonnell is one thing. 
    Sufficient evidence to get to the jury is a second thing, and a factual finding of discrimination is the third thing.
speaker="andrew_m_kramer" startTime="725.826" stopTime="805.207">
    Mr. Andrew M. Kramer 
    --That's right. 
    And Aikens dealt with the third thing in terms of the factual finding of discrimination. 
    What's present n this case, however, is the Court of Appeals in reversing the District Court's grant, the District Court contrary to the statements both in Respondent's brief and the brief of the United States, did not simply find, Petitioner's reason plausible. 
    The District Court reconsidered its decision at Plaintiff's request, at Respondent's request. 
    In its decision upon reconsideration it reviewed the evidentiary burdens, it reviewed the evidence, and it concluded that a reasonable jury could not find age discrimination on the basis of the evidence in the record. 
    The Court of Appeals in a 2: 1 opinion disagreed solely because the court said there was a potential inconsistency. 
    It said that since Mr. Faust had admittedly or... had been retained in part because of his admitted diverse skills, that after his recall, he only spent 25 percent of his time on office matters; 75 percent of the time, according to the court below, were spent on installation matters. 
    And since of that 25 percent only a small amount might have been the type of work that Respondent could perform, that that was, in and of itself, sufficient to send it to a jury.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="805.207" stopTime="816.406">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    The Court of Appeals really never examined the Plaintiff's case, did it? 
    It just said that you could poke holes in the stage two articulation of a neutral reason.
speaker="andrew_m_kramer" startTime="816.406" stopTime="828.384">
    Mr. Andrew M. Kramer 
    Well, no, it actually... it elevated the case immediately to the stage... it never reviewed the Plaintiff's case and, more importantly, it never reviewed the Petitioner's evidence in this case.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="828.384" stopTime="842.863">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well, why should it have reviewed the Petitioner's evidence since, you know... if you put a manager on... if you submit a manager's affidavit in a summary judgment proceeding, the jury's entitled to disbelieve everything the manager says.
speaker="andrew_m_kramer" startTime="842.863" stopTime="870.950">
    Mr. Andrew M. Kramer 
    Well, I would submit that if this Court has rejected Anderson in First National Bank v. City Services and Matsushita v. Zenith, there mere fact that there could be credibility determinations or that in Anderson the issue of intent is not enough to go before a Jury. 
    Now, It might be, Mr. Chief Justice, that a given affidavit might be susceptible to inferences in light of competing evidence from which to conclude discrimination.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="870.950" stopTime="883.168">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    You're telling me I'm wrong then in saying that a district court on summary judgment motion can disregard the testimony of an interested party who is seeking summary judgment?
speaker="andrew_m_kramer" startTime="883.168" stopTime="908.714">
    Mr. Andrew M. Kramer 
    Oh, it can disregard it. 
    But what I'm only saying is is that... I thought you were saying something else in terms of the fact that maybe a were credibility dispute is enough to say that summary judgment should not be granted. 
    It can, in fact, consider evidence with respect to the interest of the party just as it can consider the interest of the respondent to make conclusory or self-proclaimed assessments as to his or her performance.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="908.714" stopTime="920.482">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well, but the party... I thought the party moving for summary judgment had to discount all evidence adduced by him simply because if it's from an interested party, it could be disbelieved.
speaker="andrew_m_kramer" startTime="920.482" stopTime="952.854">
    Mr. Andrew M. Kramer 
    Well, under Celotex we were not required, a petitioner was not required to negate the claim. 
    However, it could and it did in this case. 
    Petitioner in this case went forward and said accept all of the evidence, and I ask this Court to. 
    You have to accept all the favorable inferences that can be drawn from the evidence that Respondent presents to you. 
    Accept that. 
    Accept all of the findings or all of the facts that can be drawn in favor of Respondent. 
    You cannot find age discrimination in this case.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="952.854" stopTime="971.316">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    But, Mr. Kramer, aren't you leaving out one thing. 
    Is it not permissible for the plaintiff in a situation like this to argue that the evidence of a neutral motive that you put forward is conflicting and is subject to the interpretation that was actually pretextual, and the pretext itself tends to provide discrimination.
speaker="andrew_m_kramer" startTime="971.316" stopTime="982.355">
    Mr. Andrew M. Kramer 
    There is no question and we've not doubted, Justice Stevens, that you can establish pretext that way. 
    However, you have to go back and look at the entire record evidence. 
    The entire record evidence--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="982.355" stopTime="998.063">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Do you agree... just so I understand... you look at the whole record, but if on the basis of the entire record what they put in initially and your defensive evidence, if the trier of fact could find that an inference of pretext could be drawn, would that not be enough to defeat summary judgment?
speaker="andrew_m_kramer" startTime="998.063" stopTime="1005.420">
    Mr. Andrew M. Kramer 
    --Yes, if the trier of fact on the basis of the record as a whole can find this pretext to be drawn, I would point out--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1005.420" stopTime="1006.439">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    In fact, there's an inference of pretext?
speaker="andrew_m_kramer" startTime="1006.439" stopTime="1010.542">
    Mr. Andrew M. Kramer 
    --An inference of pretext, but I would point, however, that's the problem here.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1010.542" stopTime="1015.595">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    So, you're saying here the record here is so clear it isn't even arguable that what you put forward was contradicted initially.
speaker="andrew_m_kramer" startTime="1015.595" stopTime="1039.882">
    Mr. Andrew M. Kramer 
    The record here can only establish one potential according to the court below in consistency. 
    It would say that in essence, and I would just point out... for example, the brief of the United States contends that we do not believe you can establish pretext because the reason is unbelievable, that that's not unworthy of credence. 
    Well, if anything, the opposite is here. 
    In a reduction-in-force situation--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1039.882" stopTime="1047.525">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Say that again for me. 
    You say that they cannot establish pretext based on the fact that your testimony is apparently unbelievable?
speaker="andrew_m_kramer" startTime="1047.525" stopTime="1053.221">
    Mr. Andrew M. Kramer 
    --Oh, no, no, no. 
    I'm saying the government says that we're taking the position that that is our position. 
    And I'm saying that is not our position at all.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1053.221" stopTime="1054.281">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    And what is your position?
speaker="andrew_m_kramer" startTime="1054.281" stopTime="1067.771">
    Mr. Andrew M. Kramer 
    Our position is, is that to establish pretext though unworthy of credence you have to show that it is reasonable to infer on the basis of the record as a whole that discrimination took place. 
    Take a look at this record.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1067.771" stopTime="1074.583">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Well, can you not infer a discriminatory motive from the mere fact that you advanced a pretextual reason for the discharge decision?
speaker="andrew_m_kramer" startTime="1074.583" stopTime="1093.968">
    Mr. Andrew M. Kramer 
    You can if the reason is itself subject to some unbelievable... or other facts would show it's either false, that it's ridden with error, that it's so questionable on its face that one can infer, perhaps, but that's certainly not this case.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1093.968" stopTime="1140.167">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Why is that? 
    See, I don't really... maybe we should be clear what we mean when we talk about pretext. 
    Some of our cases say if the plaintiff can show that it is a pretext for discrimination. 
    Well, to provide that it is a pretext for discrimination is one thing. 
    To prove merely that it is a pretext is something quite different. 
    You can prove that the excuse I give is a pretext without proving that it's a pretext for discrimination. 
    Why must one conclude that the real reason is discrimination simply because I come up with a phony reason that you don't believe. 
    Maybe I didn't have any reason to fire the guy. 
    I don't know. 
    It was an irrational thing. 
    I run a lousy business, and I fired this fellow. 
    I'm sued. 
    I come up with a reason that is implausible. 
    It's a pretext. 
    But is it necessarily a pretext for discrimination?
speaker="andrew_m_kramer" startTime="1140.167" stopTime="1145.410">
    Mr. Andrew M. Kramer 
    Well, first, Justice Scalia, all of this Court's cases say it must be a pretext for discrimination.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1145.410" stopTime="1152.725">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    No. 
    What must be proved is not mere that it's false, but that it is false and the real reason is discrimination.

    Mr. Andrew M. Kramer 
    And that you can have a reasonable jury conclude on the basis of the record that, in fact, it was for discriminatory reasons.

    Supposing you merely prove... you don't know why, but you merely prove that the reason given is totally false. 
    Then I ask you... you say, well, why did he give a false reason? 
    Could the trier of fact say well, perhaps he did it because he wanted to conceal his true motive? 
    You can prove it, but you just know he came up with a reason that's demonstrably false.

    Mr. Andrew M. Kramer 
    --But this Court in all of its summary judgment cases such as Anderson, Celotex, Matsushita v. Zenith, have clearly rejected the notion that one particular piece of evidence that you can cite is enough to be probative where you look to the substantive evidentiary burdens that are still entailed on the Respondent in this case. 
    At no time did Respondent in this case lose the substantive evidentiary burden of requiring to show that his layoff and failure to be recalled were reasons of age. 
    I would contend, Justice Stevens, that it seems to me that a record that shows that the individual first recalled was 59 years old, that the individual who was then recalled was 39, that the inference of age in terms of this record shows that what the court really was doing, was saying merely casting doubt on the employer's business decision is enough. 
    Not any language with respect that it be a pretext for discrimination. 
    Our quarrel isn't looking at the record as a whole and saying whether or not you can infer pretext... excuse me... infer discriminatory motive. 
    You have to look at the record as a whole to infer discriminatory motive.

    As I understand your description of our cases, we have held that there is a burden on the employer to produce a reason for firing someone, and if he does not produce a reason, the mere fact that you did not keep on someone who was within the protected class is enough for liability.

    The prima facie case is made out. 
    You come out with a trumped up charge... trumped up excuse which is really a nullity.

    Mr. Andrew M. Kramer 
    Because you have to look at the statutory basis of the lawsuit. 
    The statutory basis of the lawsuit isn't that you made a stupid business mistake and can be penalized for it. 
    The statutory basis for the lawsuit is I was laid off or I was failed to be recalled because of my age. 
    And if the record establishes, Justice White, that age was not a factor in that decision, even though the employer acted erroneously, the employer should not be held liable for a violation of the Age Discrimination Act. 
    It might be engaged in some other types of activity that might be in violation of some contractual rights or other rights, but it certainly isn't in violation of the Age Discrimination Act. 
    And that's the problem with the court below here. 
    The court below's focus here is not on the Age Discrimination Act. 
    The court below's focus is, is that if I can raise a doubt in the employer's reason, ipso facto, that creates a jury issue without, as we submit, following the dictates of this Court in Anderson and Celotex, which says that a reasonable jury must conclude on the basis of the entire record, not one piece of it.

    Mr. Andrew M. Kramer 
    That's right. 
    You would have questions of credibility prevail in every case. 
    So, therefore, if intent's a factor, you would never have summary judgment at all. 
    And what we contend simply in this case is, the court below's standard was a standard premise, not on looking at the issue of pretext for discrimination or discrimination because in a given case, perhaps, a false reason will... perhaps... be enough to infer on the basis of that record that the employer acted for some elicit reason. 
    And the Court noted that in Furnco. 
    What is inconsistent here is, is that the court's below focus was never on age. 
    If you take a look at the entire record and take a look at the evidence with respect to age, one must conclude that a reasonable jury could not have found age discrimination.

    Mr. Andrew M. Kramer 
    --No. 
    A prima facie case establishes a presumption of rebuttable presumption of discrimination. 
    This Court in Burdine said that the employer then has a burden of articulating a legitimate nondiscriminatory reasons. 
    If it articulates that reason, it goes to the next stage. 
    The employer runs a risk of being silent at that stage because the inference that is raised under McDonnell Douglas v. Green is that the prima facie case then has not been rebutted and while it's a rebuttable presumption of discrimination, it nonetheless exists in terms of its presumption. 
    So, its presumptive effect has not in any way been rebutted by the employer in that sense.

   Argument of Brian J. Martin
speaker="brian_j_martin" startTime="1773.856" stopTime="1809.529">
    Mr. Brian J. Martin 
    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    The question presented in the petition was whether a plaintiff in an age discrimination case can take his case to a jury if he has no evidence that the employer intended to discriminate. 
    The answer to that question, of course, is no, but we think that that answer and, indeed, that question have little to do with this case. 
    The Third Circuit following this Court's guidance and summary judgment in Title VII cases found after reviewing the evidence that a reasonable jury could find that petitioner discriminated against Mr. Brieck.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="1809.529" stopTime="1821.748">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Well, did this Third Circuit find that way in so many words? 
    It seemed to me they concentrate almost entirely on possible disbelief of the employer's second stage proof and very little on what the Plaintiff had shown.
speaker="brian_j_martin" startTime="1821.748" stopTime="1857.679">
    Mr. Brian J. Martin 
    Well, I think that's right, and perhaps it's because it's an unpublished opinion coming shortly after their en banc decision in Chipollini. 
    They may have considered it something of a footnote to Chipollini. 
    Chipollini, they're more explicit. 
    I think the legal analysis of the Third Circuit... and we have to build on a little bit... it's not as express as it should be... is that if a plaintiff sets forth a prima facie case and if there's enough evidence that a jury can disbelieve the proffered explanation, that it's really a lie or a cover-up, then a reasonable jury may infer intentional discrimination.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1857.679" stopTime="1869.656">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well, is the Third Circuit saying that every time a plaintiff makes a prima facie case, which is simply showing that in this case he's a member of the protected class and he was discharged, that is always enough to get to the jury?
speaker="brian_j_martin" startTime="1869.656" stopTime="1895.746">
    Mr. Brian J. Martin 
    No, definitely not. 
    In fact, early on in their opinion they note that Mr. Brieck made out a prima facie case. 
    It's not challenged. 
    And then they continue on to analyze the proffered explanation. 
    I believe what they're saying is whenever a plaintiff makes a prima facie case and there's enough evidence that a reasonable jury could believe that the employer is not telling the truth about its business judgment, then the jury may infer age discrimination.

    Well, I think Burdine answers that question. 
    The prima facie case may be used in two senses. 
    One, it's enough to get to a jury. 
    Two, it's really a legal technique involving burdens of production, sort of that they're-bursting-the-bubble type of presumption.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="1915.617" stopTime="1919.811">

    Well, that's right.

speaker="brian_j_martin" startTime="1922.203" stopTime="1954.353">
    Mr. Brian J. Martin 
    Well, I suspect it depends on the context of the litigation. 
    Is it a summary judgment motion? 
    Is it a motion to dismiss? 
    Is it a directed verdict? 
    It might depend on those types of cases. 
    But, I think the language in Burdine in that the presumption drops from the case would mean that once in this case, as in Aikens, when you have the evidence from both sides in, the fact that there was a prima facie case is really not very relevant. 
    The question is whether a reasonable jury could find on the basis of all of the evidence intentional discrimination.

speaker="brian_j_martin" startTime="1989.497" stopTime="2065.415">
    Mr. Brian J. Martin 
    We think that the Third Circuit's legal analysis that a reasonable jury may infer, may find intentional discrimination based on a prima facie case, plus enough evidence to disbelieve the employer follows directly from this Court's decisions in Furnco Construction Corporation and in Burdine. 
    The Court in Furnco noted that when all legitimate explanations for the employment decision are eliminated, it's reasonable to infer intentional discrimination. 
    We don't believe that inference is mandatory. 
    The plaintiff would not get a directed verdict. 
    They may be covering up some other legal motive. 
    You can imagine perhaps they didn't want to hurt the employee's feelings at the time, so they made up some story. 
    It's not a mandatory inference. 
    It's a reasonable one, and that's all that's required in this case to get to a jury. 
    We noted in our brief that this is an unexceptional case, and we believe that. 
    We do not think that this is a case about a court or a jury second-guessing a legitimate business judgment. 
    Was it fair? 
    Was it efficient? 
    Did it work out? 
    The question in this case, as the Third Circuit recognized, is whether Petitioner really made such a legitimate business judgment.

    Mr. Brian J. Martin 
    What is required is what is required in any summary judgment case, enough evidence to prove your case, that a reasonable jury could find that you've proved your case. 
    In this case that means proof of intentional discrimination. 
    We can imagine some prima facie cases where the evidence that the plaintiff presents is very strong at that stage and will be enough to get to a jury. 
    We can imagine other cases where it would not be.

    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Is proof that the person is in a protected class and was discharged enough to require the employer to come forward with a reason?

    Mr. Brian J. Martin

    Mr. Brian J. Martin 
    Yes, Your Honor. 
    I agree. 
    To return to my point, this is not a case about a court or a jury second-guessing a legitimate business judgment, was it fair or was it efficient. 
    The question is whether Harbison-Walker acted on the basis of a legitimate business judgment. 
    Of course, to answer that question you have to examine the judgment. 
    You cannot take it at face value, nor assume that it's false.

    Not whether it had--

    Has the employer then won or must the case go to the jury? 
    I take it on what you say the bare bones case that wouldn't itself get to the jury, I don't know why it would... I would think the plaintiff would have to do something more when the employer comes up with this excuse.

    If it's merely a bare bones prima facie case, the weakest possible evidence that you can imagine, which would qualify as a prima facie case, there's a totally legitimate explanation... for instance, the employee--

    Mr. James H Logan 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and if it please the Court: 
    The issue in this case is whether there are, whether there exist genuine issues as to any material facts so as to preclude the entry of the summary judgment. 
    On the record in this case there are implausibilities and inconsistencies in the employer's stated reasons as to four different factors, and also evidence that has been proffered by the Respondent that would directly contradict the reasons put forth by the employer.

    All three of those people were laid off in the initial layoffs in July 1982. 
    The younger man with less seniority than the two... two of the older people laid off was retained and not laid off until November 18, 1982, and he was the only one who was permanently recalled.

    Mr. James H Logan 
    That's according to only one individual, and that is Mr. Faust himself. 
    He's the only one that came forth with any evidence as to what, in fact, he did after the recall and after he was initially retained. 
    100 percent of the people in the protected age group were adversely affected by this decision.

    Now, you've limited your response to that affirmative evidence.

    Mr. James H Logan 
    When it talked about the... what... the duties that Mr. Faust actually performed after his initial retention and after his layoffs.

    It is the employee's burden to do something with that. 
    They can cross-examine the witness, have the witness--

    If he didn't, that would be sufficient to refute the prima facie case.

    It would be something for the jury to consider, depending on how bare bones it is.

    It is or it isn't.

    Mr. James H Logan 
    I'd be willing to concede the point under the hypothetical you posed.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="2820.491" stopTime="2826.035">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    That if the employee doesn't come in with something to refute that, it would not go to the jury; you could have summary judgment?
speaker="james_h_logan" startTime="2826.035" stopTime="3191.263">
    Mr. James H Logan 
    Under that... narrow hypothetical, yes. 
    In this case the Petitioner has asserted as to the ratings that they've asserted as undisputed that the younger man had higher ratings in the years in question than the Respondent in this case. 
    That is not what the record reflects. 
    The record reflects that the... according to the testimony of an employer witness, the immediate supervisor of the Respondent in this case that for a period of seven years from 1975 to 1982, he had always... that is always rated him a 3. 
    If you look at Mr. Sekeras' affidavit, he indicated that for several years Respondent had been rated a 2. 
    This is a direct conflict between the employer's own witness as to a very important... one of the proffered reasons. 
    In addition, you have a June 17, 1982 memo that antedated the implementation of the decision to make the July layoffs. 
    It was from a Mr. Shonkwiler, a vice president of marketing, to the personnel manager. 
    This is at the joint appendix, page 146, where he indicates that for 1981 and '82, the Respondent and the younger man were rated exactly... exactly the same, fully satisfactory. 
    In that same document it indicates that the Respondent had more seniority than the younger man, 15 months more seniority. 
    There's a direct conflict in the testimony of the employer's own witnesses in that regard. 
    The company also indicated that seniority was one of the major reasons it relied upon in deciding which employees to lay off. 
    This is according to a senior vice president, Ytterberg. 
    According to the testimony of three of the employer witnesses, Mr. Sekeras, Mr. Sheatsley, and Mr. Nicolella... and this is all set forth in our brief... they either ignored or gave no weight whatsoever to the employers having more seniority in the company and 14 more years in this particular job of installation specialist. 
    And in the briefs the Petitioner said well, that's about the same. 
    Well, seniority, a jury could reasonably conclude that an employer meant what it said and its seniority meant seniority. 
    It's plausible, it's reasonable for a jury to draw that inference. 
    The Petitioner itself... and Mr. Nicolella, I might add, the personnel manager who reviewed the decision before it was made final... the recommendation before it was made final... was just plain out wrong when he said that Faust had more seniority than did the Respondent. 
    As Petitioner indicates in its reply brief at page 10, and its original brief at page 15, a jury could infer from the employer's failure to follow its own established company policy and procedure, they could infer discrimination from that and that's what the petitioner concedes. 
    In addition, in the June 17, 1982 memo that was entitled 145... they said that Mr. Brieck, the Respondent, had limited expertise. 
    Well, this is directly contradicted by the March 24, 1982 memorandum that appears at the very last page of the joint appendix from Mr. Jamison, Respondent's own immediate supervisor, where he commended him for his fine work, gave him a merit raise, said you're doing... he commended him for his good work, thanked him for his fine efforts, and sent him out on another international assignment. 
    Respondent has come forth with evidence that he was the only one of all these installation specialists who had ever been sent out on international assignments. 
    Chile, Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, Canada, and he said dozens of times. 
    A jury could reasonably infer that they wouldn't send out the least qualified installation specialist to go out and do international assignments. 
    You wouldn't send out somebody with limited expertise. 
    The record is also full of evidence, even in Mr. Faust's own words, that he was the office gofer. 
    A jury could conclude that these allegedly versatile skills were hardly more than clerical in nature. 
    A jury could infer that. 
    We're not saying it necessarily leads to that conclusions. 
    All we want is the chance to get this case to a jury. 
    We think that there are genuine issues as to material facts. 
    Rule 56(c) does not require the employee in order to survive a motion for summary judgment to effectively raise a doubt as to all issues of material fact, but as to any issue of material fact which are in this case the employer's proffered reasons. 
    They attempted to introduce statistics. 
    Well, the statistics will show that three out of five people aged 55 or over, that is, 60 percent, were laid off in July 1982. 
    And if you look at four of these people, 100 percent of them were laid off. 
    A hundred percent of them were not permanently recalled. 
    So, I think there are plenty of issues of fact in this particular case under this record. 
    We request that the Court affirm the decision of the Third Circuit and remand for further proceedings.

   Rebuttal of Andrew M. Kramer
speaker="andrew_m_kramer" startTime="3194.846" stopTime="3220.094">
    Mr. Andrew M. Kramer 
    Just quickly, Your Honors, the issue here is whether a reasonable jury could conclude that there was age discrimination. 
    We would submit you have to look at the entire record and the facts from which the Court of Appeals inferred that a jury could determine age discrimination was insufficient. 
    They took one particular piece of evidence, held it up to a probative value that can't rise to any inference in light of the entire record of age discrimination.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3220.094" stopTime="3222.735">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    So, this is just a fact-bound case involving no principle of law?
speaker="andrew_m_kramer" startTime="3222.735" stopTime="3251.023">
    Mr. Andrew M. Kramer 
    It is involving two important principles. 
    The court below said you could look at one piece of evidence and not the entire record as a whole. 
    As a dissent of the court below said, that was inconsistent with this Court's opinion in Anderson and in Celotex. 
    Number two, the standard that the Court would apply into the ADA is one which really does not deal with the ultimate question of discrimination, but simply whether or not you can raise a sufficient question of the judgment itself so as to allow a jury then to infer discrimination. 
    Thank you very much.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="3251.023" stopTime="3278.351">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    I'm sorry that that wasn't the question you presented to us when you asked us to take this case. 
    The question presented is set forth in your petition is whether a plaintiff who alleges intentional discrimination can survive summary judgment merely... merely by questioning his employer's business judgment without presenting any evidence, direct or indirect, that his employer's judgment was, in fact, motivated by an intent to discrimination. 
    That's an interesting question. 
    What you've just been talking about isn't.
