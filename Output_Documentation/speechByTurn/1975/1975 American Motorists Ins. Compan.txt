    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Now the first of these cases comes to us from the Court of Civil Appeal in Texas. 
    Under the Texas law when a domestic corporation challenges the venue of a seat brought against it, the plaintiff amongst other things has to prove by a preponderance of the evidence and he has a cause of action against the domestic corporation. 
    Where a foreign corporation is sued and challenges the venue of action against it, a similar requirement is not made by Texas law. 
    And this difference between the situations of the domestic and foreign corporations was challenged as a denial of equal protection and violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. 
    The Court of Civil Appeals of Texas rejected as without merit that equal protection claim, we affirm. 
    Chief Justice has filed an opinion concurring in the judgment in which Mr. Justice Rehnquist joins.
