Liberty Mutual Insurance Company v. Wetzel

    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    The third of this trilogy is Liberty Mutual Ins. Co. against Wetzel, number 74-1245. In this case, respondents filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania in which they asserted that petitioner's employee insurance benefits and maternity leave regulations discriminated against women in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. 
    The District Court ruled in favor of respondents on the issue of petitioner's liability under that Act, and petitioner appealed to the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. 
    That court held that it had jurisdiction of petitioner's appeal and proceeded to affirm on the merits, the judgment of the District Court sustaining the plaintiff's claims. 
    We granted certiorari and we heard argument on the merits. 
    Though, neither party has questioned the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals to entertain the appeal, we are obligated to do so on our own motion and for the reasons stated in an opinion filed today we conclude that the District Court's order was not appealable to the Court of Appeals. 
    We therefore vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals with instructions to dismiss the petitioner's appeal to hear. 
    Mr. Justice Blackmun took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.
