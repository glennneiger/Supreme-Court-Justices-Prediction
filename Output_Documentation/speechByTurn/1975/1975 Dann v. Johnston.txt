    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    This case is here on writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Customs and Patent Appeals. 
    The respondent developed a machine system for automatic record keeping of bank checks and deposits. 
    Under that, the system, checks and deposits are labeled by the Customs with code categories which are read and then processed by data processes such as programmable electronic digital computer having data storage files and a control system. 
    The system allows the bank to furnish customers with an individualized and categorized breakdown of their transactions with appropriate subtotals for the periods involved. 
    The Court of Customs and Patent Appeals held the respondent's system to be patentable, be reversed. 
    Title 35 of United States Code Section 103 mandates that a patent not be given when the differences between the subject matter sought to be patented and the prior art are such that the subject matter as a whole would have been obvious at the time of the invention was made, to a person having ordinary skill in the art to which said subject matter pertains. 
    We hold that under this standard, respondent system was obvious and hence unpatentable.
