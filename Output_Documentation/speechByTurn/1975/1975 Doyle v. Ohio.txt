    Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. 
    These two criminal cases, involving identical circumstances are here on certiorari to the Court of Appeals of Ohio. 
    When the defendants were arrested, they were given the customary Miranda warnings. 
    These included advice that they had the right to remain silent, that anything they said could be used against them and that and they had a right to counsel before submitting to interrogation. 
    At that trial, the defendants took the stand and offered for the first time a novel explanation of their conduct. 
    If believed, this explanation would clear them of criminality. 
    On cross examination, the prosecutor pressed defendants as to why they had not advised the police at the time of arrest of exculpatory facts. 
    The inference sought to be drawn by the prosecutor, was that defendant's silence at the time of arrest indicated that, their present story was a fabrication. 
    The Trial Court allowed the cross examination, the Ohio Court of Appeals affirmed the conviction. 
    We now reverse. 
    When as required by law an arrested person is advised of his right to remain silent. 
    We think it fundamentally unfair and a denial of Due Process to allow the arrested person's silence to be used to impeach exculpatory testimony offered at the Trial. 
    Mr. Justice Stevens has filed a dissenting opinion in which Mr. justice Blackmun and Mr. justice Rehnquist have joined.
