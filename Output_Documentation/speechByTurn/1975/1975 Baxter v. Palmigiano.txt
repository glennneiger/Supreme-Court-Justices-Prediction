    Justice Byron R. White 
    Baxter case, sir, is here from the Court of Appeals from the First Circuit and the Enomoto case is here from the Ninth Circuit. 
    Both cases involve questions of constitutional dimension with respect to disciplinary proceedings in state prisons and these issues in turn involve questions of interpretation application of our decision of a term or two ago in Wolf against McDonald. 
    We reverse both judgments. 
    The reasons are given in the opinion which we have filed with the clerk. 
    Mr. Justice Brennan along with Mr. Justice Marshall has filed an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part. 
    Mr. Justice Stevens to fill part in the consideration or decision of the cases.
