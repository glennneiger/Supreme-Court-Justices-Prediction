    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    This case involves the question of whether the refusal of the petitioner, the City of Charlotte, North Carolina to allow a dues check-off for the Local 660 and its members violating the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. 
    The District Court for the Western District of North Carolina found the City's refusal violated the Equal Protection Clause. 
    The Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed. 
    We granted certiorari and we now reverse. 
    The City of Charlotte refuses to allow check-offs unless the check-off benefits all City employees or all employees of a single department. 
    Since the Union represents only 351 of the 543 uniformed members of the Fire Department, it is not eligible for check-off under this policy, and we find the policy is sufficiently reasonable to survive a Equal Protection attack. 
    The policy is a legitimate method for avoiding the burden of withholding money for all purposes or organizations that request a check-off. 
    Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed and the case remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion. 
    Mr. Justice Stewart has filed a statement, concurring in the judgment.
