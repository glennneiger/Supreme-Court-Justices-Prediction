New Hampshire v. Maine

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    The other case is an original action, No. 64 Original, brought by the State of New Hampshire against the State of Maine to locate the lateral boundary separating the states between the mouth of Portsmouth Harbor and the entrance to Gosport Harbor in the Isles of Shoals. 
    Now that boundary had in fact been fixed by a decree 236 odd years old of King George II of England, but the states weren’t sure exactly where it was located. 
    In this proceeding before -- it came to trial before the Special Master, the states agreed on that location and they submitted a consent decree, fixing the location. 
    The Special Master thought that a consent decree should be entered provided its entry was consistent with this Court’s Article III functions in cases of this character. 
    For reasons expressed in an opinion we have filed, we think that the entry of that decree does comport with our Article III functions and therefore direct the entry of the consent decree. 
    Mr. Justice White has filed a dissenting opinion in which Mr. Justice Blackmun and Mr. Justice Stevens join.
