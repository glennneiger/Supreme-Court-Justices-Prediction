    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    This case is here from the Court of Appeals of the Seventh Circuit. 
    In this case a Republican Sheriff of Cook County, Illinois lost out to a Democrat in an election for that office. 
    The democratic Sheriff promptly dismissed all the Republican non-civil service employees, not covered by any law protecting them from arbitrary discharge. 
    The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit held that the democratic Sheriff's dismissal of the republicans solely to enable him to give the jobs to deserving Democrats deprived the dismissed Republicans of constitutional freedoms of belief and association secured by the First and Fourteenth Amendments. 
    We affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals. 
    Our judgment is supported by two opinions, I filed one in which Mr. Justice White and Mr. Justice Marshall have joined. 
    Mr. Justice Stewart joined by Mr. Justice Blackmun has filed the other. 
    The Chief Justice dissents in this filed a dissenting opinion. 
    Mr. Justice Powell also dissents and joined by the Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Rehnquist has filed a dissenting opinion. 
    Mr. Justice Stevens took no part in the consideration or decision of the case.
