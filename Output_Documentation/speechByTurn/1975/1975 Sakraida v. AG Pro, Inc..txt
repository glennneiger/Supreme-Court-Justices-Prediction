    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    This case is here from the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. 
    The District Court for the Western District of Texas held invalid a patent entitled Dairy Establishment, holding that the patent does not constitute invention, is not patentable, is not a valid patent, it being a combination patent, all of the elements of which are old and the combination of them is described being either new nor meeting the test of non-obviousness. 
    The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed and ordered that a Judgment be entered, holding the patent valid. 
    We agree with the District Court and disagree with the Court of Appeals. 
    We, therefore, reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals for reasons stated in the opinion filed with the clerk.
