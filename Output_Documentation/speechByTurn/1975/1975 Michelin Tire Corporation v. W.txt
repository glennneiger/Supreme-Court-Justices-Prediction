    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    In this case the petitioner Michelin Tire Corporation imported auto and truck tires from France and Nova Scotia and stocked them in its Georgia warehouse awaiting sales to its hundreds of franchised retail tire outlets in the Southeast States. 
    Georgia assessed ad valorem property taxes against tires and the Georgia court's sustained the tax. 
    The opinions of the two Georgia courts involved recognized that over 100 years ago this court in Low. v. Austin held that even a nondiscriminatory ad valorem property tax was a state imposed duty prohibited by Article I section 10 of the constitution which provides that no state shall without the consent of congress lay any imposts or duties on imports or exports, say what may be absolutely necessary for executing its inspection laws. 
    The Georgia courts concluded however that the tires had lost their status as imports on the tax date and thus had become subject to the Georgia tax. 
    Today we affirm the Georgia Supreme Court but not on the ground on which it sustained the tax. 
    Rather, we overruled Low v. Austin and hold that Georgia's nondiscriminatory ad valorem property tax levied against the imported tires did not constitute the laying of an impost or duty on imports within the prohibition of Article I section 10. 
    Mr. Justice White has filed an opinion concurring in the judgment of the affirmance. 
    Mr. Justice Stevens took no part in the consideration and decision of the case.
