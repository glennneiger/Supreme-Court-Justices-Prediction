    Justice Byron R. White 
    In the Hines case which is here from the Sixth Circuit on writ of certiorari, the petitioners were discharged and their discharge was upheld by a Joint Arbitration Committee. 
    They then brought suit claiming breach of contract by the employer and a breach of its duty of fair representation on part of the union. 
    The District Court gave summary judgment for both, the employer and the union. 
    Court of Appeals reversed the judgment and sent back for trial the case against the union, but affirmed the judgment in favor of the employer. 
    We, in turn, reverse that judgment in favor of the employer. 
    Under our cases, if the employees -- if the discharged employees, prevail against the union, they will be entitled also to a remedy against the employer. 
    Our reasons are set out at greater length in an opinion which is on file with the clerk. 
    Mr. Justice Stewart, while joining the opinion, filed a concurring opinion. 
    Mr. Justice Rehnquist has filed a dissenting opinion and he is joined by the Chief Justice. 
    Mr. Justice Stevens took no part in the consideration or decision of the case.
