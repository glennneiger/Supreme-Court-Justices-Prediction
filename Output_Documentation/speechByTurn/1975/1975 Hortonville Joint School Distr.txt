    I have four opinions to announce for the court. 
    In 74-1606 Hortonville Joint School District against Hortonville Educational Association. 
    For reasons stated in an opinion filed with the clerk today, the judgment of the Supreme Court of Wisconsin is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings, not inconsistent with our opinion.
