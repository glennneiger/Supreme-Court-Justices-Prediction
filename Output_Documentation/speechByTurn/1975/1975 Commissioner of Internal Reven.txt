    Justice Byron R. White 
    This case concerns what showing a tax payer must make to escape the bar, the Anti-Injunction Act and recover his property which the Commissioner of Internal Revenue has seized pursuant to a jeopardy assessment, pending for hearing in the Tax Court. 
    The District Court in this case dismissed the tax payers suit. 
    The Court of Appeals reversed ordering for the proceedings of the District Court. 
    We agree with the Court of Appeals that there are unresolved questions that the District Court should address and the hence we affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals. 
    We have filed an opinion which states our reasons at a much greater length. 
    Mr. Justice Blackmun has filed a dissenting opinion and he has been joined by Mr. Justice Rehnquist. 
    Mr. Stevens took no part in the consideration or decision of the case.
