    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    This case comes to us from the Eastern District of Washington where the respondent, one Josephine Powell, was convicted of mailing a firearm capable of being concealed on the person to with a sawed-off shotgun in violation of Title 18 United States Code, Section 1715. 
    The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed her conviction on the ground that this act of Congress was unconstitutionally vague. 
    In an opinion filed today with the clerk, we conclude that the statute of Congress was not unconstitutionally vague and we, therefore, reversed the judgment of the Court of Appeals.
