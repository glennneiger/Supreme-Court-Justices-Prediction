Lavine v. Milne

    Justice Byron R. White 
    The Lavine is here on appeal from a three-judge District Court for the Southern District of New York. 
    Here under a New York welfare statute, a person is disqualified for 75 days from receiving home relief, if he quits his job in order to go on relief. 
    The statute also presumes that he has left his job for this purpose, if he applies for welfare within that 75-day period. 
    The three-judge court though this seeming resumption was violative the Due Process of Law and entered a judgment to this effect. 
    We reverse that judgment. 
    In our view this so called resumption there is no more than to place the burden on the applicant to prove his qualification in this respect just like he must prove his other qualifications and we hence reverse the judgment of the District Court. 
    Mr. Justice Stevens took no part in the considerations or decision of this case.
