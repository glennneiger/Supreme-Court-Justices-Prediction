    Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. 
    This case is here on appeal from the United States District Court to the District of Maryland. 
    The appellee owns a scrap metal processing plant in Alexandria, Virginia. 
    In 1917 Maryland adopted a program to clear its landscape, have abandon automobile hulks. 
    The state pay its vendors for the delivery of the hulks to processors. 
    Appellee, though located in Virginia, participated in the boundary program. 
    The Maryland legislature amended the program in 1974, making it virtually impossible for out of state processors to continue to participate. 
    Appellee brought this suit, alleging that the 1974 Amendment violated the commerce clause and the equal protect clause of the constitution. 
    The District Court agreed with appellee and invalidated the amendment. 
    We conclude for the reasons stated in an opinion filed today that the amendment neither burdened in the state commerce nor denied appellee equal protection of the laws. 
    Accordingly we reverse the judgment of the District Court. 
    Mr. Justice Stevens filed a concurring opinion, Mr. Justice Brennan filed a dissenting opinion in which Mr. Justice White, and Mr. Justice Marshall joined.
