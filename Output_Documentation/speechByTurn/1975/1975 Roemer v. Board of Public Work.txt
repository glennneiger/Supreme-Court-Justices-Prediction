    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    This case comes to us from a Three Judge Federal District Court for the District of Maryland, and we are asked once against to police the constitutional boundary between Church and State. 
    In a situation where a state by legislation seeks to provide financial assistance to education of institutions, including those that are affiliated with religious denominations. 
    This time it is the State of Maryland, that is endeavor to afford relief and it seeks to benefit private colleges not secondary or elementary school. 
    The statute in question calls for annual fiscal year grounds that are subject to the requirement that they not be used for "sectarian purposes". 
    The statute requires that the institution be accredited by the State Department of Education, that it shall have been established in Maryland before July 1970, that had maintained one or more "Associate of Arts or Baccalaureate degree" programs, and that it refrain from awarding "only seminarian or theological degrees. 
    Funding amounts to about 15% of the state's per-full-time-pupil appropriation for a student in the state college system. 
    The statute was amended in 1972, to provide flatly that none of the money shall be utilized by the benefit against institutions for sectarian purposes." 
    The administration of the program is entrusted to the Maryland Board of Public Works assisted by the Maryland Council for Higher Education. 
    And during each of the challenge years in question 1971 and 1972, something less than $2 million was dispersed to about 17 or 18 institutions. 
    And others amount about a half million was year marked to go to the Church related institutions. 
    The plaintiffs in this suit who are appellants here are four Maryland tax payers. 
    They sought a declaration of the statue in validity and injunctive relief. 
    And they claim that five institutions were constitutionally ineligible for the state aid. 
    Western Maryland college of Methodist affiliate, and Four Roman Catholic affiliates, the College of Notre Dame, Mount Saint Mary's College, Saint Joseph College, and Loyola College. 
    Western Maryland, however has since been dismissed as a defendant appellee in the litigation. 
    The District Court by divided vote ruled that the amended statute was constitutional, and that injunctive relief was not in order. 
    This appeal followed and we noted probable jurisdiction. 
    We affirm the judgment of the District Court. 
    The members of this Court are not uniform in their views as is often the case in recent litigation in this area. 
    I have filed an opinion that is joined by the Chief Justice and by Mr. Justice Powell. 
    And in that opinion we endeavor to trace the recent pertinent decisions and we conclude that under those decisions and the standards they set forth, the Maryland statute and system does past constitutional muster. 
    Mr. Justice White has filed an opinion concurring in the judgment and he is joined in that opinion by Mr. Justice Rehnquist. 
    Mr. Justice Brennan has filed a dissenting opinion. 
    He would reverse the judgment of the District Court would enjoin the Board of Public Works from implementing the Maryland Act. 
    And would require the appellee institutions to refund all payments made to them under the act. 
    Mr. Justice Marshall joins the opinion of Mr. Justice Brennan. 
    Mr. Justice Stewart has filed a separate opinion dissenting from the judgment. 
    Mr Justice Stevens has also filed a separate dissenting opinion.
