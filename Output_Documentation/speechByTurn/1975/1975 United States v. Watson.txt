    Justice Byron R. White 
    This case is here on certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. 
    It presents questions under the Fourth Amendment as to the legality of a warrantless arrest and of the ensuing search of an automobile. 
    We find that the arrest was authorized by federal statute and did not violate the constitution. 
    In our view, the resulting search was also consistent with the Fourth Amendment. 
    Because the Court of Appeals had a different view and on that basis set aside a criminal conviction, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals. 
    I am authorized to say that Mr. Justice Powell, while joining the opinion of the Court, filed a concurring opinion. 
    Mr. Justice Stewart has filed an opinion concurring in the result. 
    Mr. Justice Marshall has filed a dissenting opinion in which Mr. Justice Brennan has joined. 
    Mr. Justice Stevens took no part in either the consideration or decision of the case.
