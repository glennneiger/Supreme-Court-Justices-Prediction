    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    This is No. 74-54, Transamerican Freight Lines against Brada Miller Freight Systems. 
    The case comes to us from the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit in Chicago. 
    We granted certiorari because of the parent conflict in holdings and in the underlying legal theory among the federal courts and some state supreme courts. 
    The Interstate Commerce Commission in connection with its regulation of motor carriers, who are operating in interstate commerce, has issued regulations applicable to the leasing of equipment between authorized carriers. 
    On of these regulations states that the lessor carrier and the lessee carrier must agree in writing that control and responsibility for the operation of the equipment shall be that of the lessee. 
    The lease between the lessor, Brada Miller, and the lessee, Transamerican, for a tractor trailer for a single trip between Detroit and Kansas City did in fact recite the Transamerican was to have control and responsibility for the operation of the equipment in respect to the public. 
    The lease also provided, however, that Brada Miller, the lessor, agreed to indemnify Transamerican for claims arising out of Brada Miller’s negligence. 
    An accident occurred on the trip allegedly due to the negligence of the lessor and a person was seriously injured. 
    She sued both carriers, and in the litigation, Transamerican offered the defense to Brada Miller. 
    It was refused and thereafter Transamerican settled the lawsuit with the plaintiff, and then it sought to enforce the indemnification agreement against Brada Miller. 
    This was resisted on the ground that it was contrary to the control and responsibility provision of the regulation and hence was against public policy. 
    The District Court and the Court of Appeals granted Brada Miller’s motion for summary judgment on the ground that the indemnification clause contravened the regulation. 
    We reverse. 
    We hold that the indemnification agreement does not contravene the Interstate Commerce Commission’s control and responsibility requirement. 
    And on the facts before us, the lessee had the required control and responsibility for the leased vehicle, and this was so, despite the indemnification clause, relating to the lessor’s negligence. 
    We also hold that the indemnification provision does not conflict with the Commission’s safety regulations. 
    Indeed it may promote rather than deter safety. 
    Consequently, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings. 
    I am authorized to say that Mr. Justice Douglas concurs in the judgment.
