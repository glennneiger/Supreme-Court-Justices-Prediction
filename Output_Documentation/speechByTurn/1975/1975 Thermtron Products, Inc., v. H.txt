    Justice Byron R. White 
    The District Court in this case remanded to the State Court a diversity case that had been removed from the State Court. 
    The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit held that that decision to remand was not reviewable by mandamus. 
    In the circumstances of this case and for the reasons that we stated in the opinion, that judgment was wrong in our opinion and is reversed. 
    Mr. Justice Rehnquist has filed a dissenting opinion and the Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Stewart have joined in that opinions. 
    Mr. Justice Stevens took no part in the consideration or decision of the case.
