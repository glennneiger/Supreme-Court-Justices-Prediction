    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    This case involves the constitutionality of a regulation limiting the length of a policeman's hair. 
    Respondent policemen is the president of the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association in Suffolk County, Long Island, New York. 
    In 1971, his predecessor brought an action in the District Court under the Civil Rights Act of 1871, against petitioner's predecessor, the Commissioner of the Suffolk County Police Department, claiming principally that the commissioner's order establishing hair-length standards violated his liberty under the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. 
    The District Court dismissed his complaint but the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in New York reversed saying that the choice of personal appearances is an ingredient of an individual's personal liberty protected under the Fourteenth Amendment, and that the police department had the burden of establishing a genuine public need for the regulation. 
    When the case went back to the District Court, the District Court ruled in favor of respondent policeman and that judgment was affirmed by the Court of Appeals again. 
    Because we hold that the hair-length regulation challenged here did not violate any right guaranteed respondent by the Fourteenth Amendment, we reverse; respondent has sought constitutional protection from the hair-length regulation not as an ordinary citizen but as an employee of the police force of Suffolk County. 
    This status affords the state wider latitude in imposing restrictive regulations as part of a mode of organization which it has chosen as the most efficient in enabling the police force to carry out the duties assigned to it under state and local law. 
    This choice of organizational structures entitled to the same sort of the same sort presumption of legislative validity as their choices designed to promote other aims within the state's police power and the burden is therefore on respondent, the policeman in this case to demonstrate that there is no rational relationship between the regulation based as it is on the state's method of organizing its police force and the promotion of safety of persons and property. 
    The District Court's initial dismissal was therefore correct. 
    We believe that matters not whether the choice of a uniform police force reflects a desire on the part of Suffolk County to make police officers readily recognizable to the public on the one hand, or foster its predictor on the other hand. 
    Either justification is sufficiently rational to defeat respondent's claim based on the liberty guarantee of the Fourteenth Amendment. 
    Mr. Justice Powell has filed a concurring opinion. 
    Mr. Justice Marshall has filed a dissenting opinion in which Mr. Justice Brennan has joined. 
    Mr. Justice Stevens took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.
