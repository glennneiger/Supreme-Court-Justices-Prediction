    Justice Byron R. White 
    This case is here from the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit and it arose when the respondent union called a strike in support of certain sister unions involved in negotiations with the same employer. 
    The employer claims that the strike was in violation of the no-strike clause contained in the contract between the company and the union. 
    On the other hand, the union said that sympathy strikes werenâ€™t reached by the no-strike clause. 
    The contract also contained arbitration provision, admittedly reaching the issue whether a sympathy strike did violate the promise of the union, not to strike. 
    The issue in the case is whether a federal court may issue an injunction against a strike, pending the decision of the arbitrator as to whether the union has breached it's promise not to strike by calling a sympathy strike. 
    Court of Appeals said that federal court had no such power and we agree with the Court of Appeals. 
    For the reasons that we have stated in the opinion on file with the clerk, we hold that the Norris-Laguardia Act debars the issue of some injunction, pending arbitration of the issue that I have described. 
    Mr. Justice Stevens has filed a dissenting opinion. 
    He is joined by Justices Brennan, Marshall and Powell.
