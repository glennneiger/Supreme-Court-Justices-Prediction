    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    This case is here on writ of certiorari for the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit. 
    It is a citizen suit brought under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act. 
    That act makes it unlawful to discharge pollutants into navigable waters without a permit issued by the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. 
    The issue in this case is whether the nuclear waste materials subject to regulation by the Atomic Energy Commission and its successor agencies are pollutants within the meaning of the Water Act. 
    We hold that they are not. 
    In an opinion filed with the clerk, we hold that the regulation of these nuclear waste materials is controlled exclusively by the terms of the Atomic Energy Act. 
    So as the talk reveals out to the contrary, the judgment is reversed. 
    Mr. Justice Stevens took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.
