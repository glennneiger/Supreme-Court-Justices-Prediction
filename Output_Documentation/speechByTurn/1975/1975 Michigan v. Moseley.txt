    Justice Potter Stewart 
    This case is here by a way of writ of certiorari granted to the Court of Appeals of the State of Michigan. 
    The respondent, Richard Moseley, was arrested in Detroit, Michigan on the early afternoon of April 8, 1971, in connection with robberies that had recently occurred at Blue Goose Bar and the White Tower Restaurant on that city's lower east side. 
    The arresting officer, Detective James Cowie of the Armed Robbery Section of the Detroit Police Department, brought Mosley to the Robbery and Breaking and Entering Bureau of the Police Department, which was located on the fourth floor of the departmental headquarters building. 
    The officer advised Mosley of his rights under this Court's decision in the case of Miranda against Arizona, and he had him read and sign the department's constitutional rights notification certificate. 
    After filling out the necessary arrest papers, Officer Cowie began questioning Mosley about the robbery of the White Tower Restaurant. 
    When Mosley said he did not want to answer any questions about the robberies, Cowie promptly ceased the interrogation. 
    At no time during the questioning did Mosley indicate a desire to consult with a lawyer, and there is no claim that the procedures followed to this point did not fully comply with the strictures of the Miranda opinion. 
    Mosley was then taken to a ninth-floor cell block. 
    Shortly after 6 o’clock in the evening, Detective Hill of the Detroit Police Department Homicide Bureau brought Mosley from the cell block to the fifth-floor office of the Homicide Bureau for questioning about the fatal shooting of a man named Leroy Williams. 
    Williams had been killed in January of 1971, during a holdup attempt outside the 101 Ranch Bar in Detroit. 
    Mosley had not been arrested on this charge nor interrogated about it by Detective Cowie. 
    Before questioning Mosley about this homicide, Detective Hill carefully advised him of his so-called Miranda rights. 
    Mosley read the notification form both silently and aloud, and Detective Hill then read and explained the warnings to him and had him sign the form. 
    Mosley at first denied any involvement in the Williams murder, but after the officer told him that and accomplice had confessed to participating in the killing, and had named him Moseley as the trigger man, Mosley made a statement implicating himself in the homicide. 
    The interrogation by Detective Hill lasted approximately 15 minutes, and at no time during its course did Mosley ask to consult with a lawyer or indicate that he did not want to discuss the homicide. 
    In short, there is no claim that the procedures followed during Detective Hill's interrogation of Mosley, standing alone, did not fully comply with the strictures of the Miranda opinion. 
    Moseley was subsequently charged with first degree murder. 
    Before the trial, he moved to suppress his incriminating statement on a number of grounds, among them a claim that under the doctrine of the Miranda case, it was constitutionally impermissible for Detective Hill to question him about the Williams murder after he had told Detective Cowie that he did not want to answer any questions about the robberies. 
    The trial court denied the motion to suppress after an evidentiary hearing, and the incriminating statement was subsequently introduced in evidence against Mosley at his trial. 
    The jury convicted Mosley of first-degree murder, and the court imposed a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment. 
    On appeal to the Michigan Court of Appeals, Mosley renewed his previous objections to the use of his incriminating statement in evidence. 
    The appellate court reversed the judgment of conviction, holding that Detective Hill's interrogation of Mosley had been a per se violation of the Miranda doctrine. 
    Accordingly, without reaching Mosley's other contentions, the Court remanded the case for a new trial with instructions that Mosley's statement be suppressed as evidence. 
    After a further appeal was denied by the Michigan Supreme Court, the State filed a petition for certiorari here and we granted the petition because of the important constitutional questions presented. 
    For the reasons elaborated in some details in the Court’s written opinion, we conclude that the admission in evidence of Mosley's incriminating statement did not violate the principles of Miranda versus Arizona. 
    Accordingly, the judgment of the Michigan Court of Appeals is vacated, and the case is remanded to that court for further proceedings not inconsistent with the written opinion filed with the clerk today. 
    Mr. Justice White has filed a separated opinion concurring in the judgment. 
    Mr. Justice Brennan has filed a dissenting opinion which Mr. Justice Marshall has joined.
