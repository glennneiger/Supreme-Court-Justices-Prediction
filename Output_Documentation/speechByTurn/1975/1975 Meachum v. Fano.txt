    Justice Byron R. White 
    These two cases raise a common question. 
    In the Fano case which is here from the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, Fano was a state prisoner in a medium security institution. 
    He was transferred to a maximum security prison. 
    In Haymes, which is here on petition to the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, the prisoner was transferred from one medium security prison to another. 
    In each case the inmate brought suit, claiming that the transfer violated his right to liberty under the Due Process Clause and that he was, therefore, entitled to more procedural due process than he had received in connection with his transfer. 
    Both Courts of Appeals agreed to the inmate and ordered the transfer canceled. 
    We reverse both judgments, since in our view no cognizable rights to liberty of either inmate were violated by the transfer. 
    Our reasons are given at greater length in the opinions on file with the clerk. 
    Mr. Justice Stevens has filed a dissenting opinion in these cases. 
    He has been joined by Justices Brennan and Marshall.
