    The situation in these cases maybe briefly stated. 
    In each case, a taxpayer obtained from his accountant, the accountant’s work papers that have been used in the preparation of the taxpayer’s tax returns. 
    Taxpayer then delivered the papers to his attorney where they were subpoenaed by Internal Revenue Service agents who were investigation the taxpayer. 
    The issue is whether the papers were immune from the subpoena by reason of the Fifth Amendment’s privilege against compelled self-incrimination. 
    The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit held that they were not immune. 
    We agree with that court and affirm that judgment. 
    In the other case, the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit held to the contrary and hence we reverse the judgment in 74-611. 
    Mr. Justice Brennan and Mr. Justice Marshall have each filed opinions concurring in the judgment. 
    Mr. Justice Stevens took no part in the consideration or decision of the case.
