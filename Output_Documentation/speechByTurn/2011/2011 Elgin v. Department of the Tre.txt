    Justice Clarence Thomas 
    This case comes to us on a writ of certiorari to United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. 
    The Civil Service Reform Act or CSRA established a comprehensive system of administrative and judicial review for federal employees who wished to challenge adverse employment actions, including removals from federal service. 
    A removed employee may appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board which is authorized to order reinstatement, back pay, and attorneys fees to prevailing employees. 
    If the employee is not satisfied with the Boards decision, he may seek judicial review in the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. 
    Petitioners are former federal employees who were discharged pursuant to Section 3328 of Title 5, a statute that bars from federal employment, persons who fail to register for the drafts. 
    Only petitioner Elgin appealed his termination to the Merit Systems Protection Board. 
    Elgin argued that Section 3328 was an unconstitutional bill of attainder and unconstitutionally discriminates on the basis of sex since only men are required to register for the draft. 
    The Board dismissed Elgins appeal for lack of jurisdiction, concluding that a person, whose employment was absolutely barred by statute, was not an employee with a right to review before the Board. 
    Rather than seek judicial review before the Federal Circuit, Elgin joined the other petitioners in filing this action in Federal District Court. 
    Petitioners raised the same constitutional claims to Section 3328 and sought reinstatement to federal employment and back pay. 
    The District Court denied petitioners' claims on the merits. 
    On appeal, the First Circuit vacated the judgment and remanded, instructing the District Court to dismiss petitioners suit for lack of jurisdiction. 
    In a holding that neither party challenges here, the Court of Appeals first included that despite the statutory bar to their employment, petitioners were federal employees entitled to review under the CSRA. 
    The Court of Appeals then concluded that the CSRA review scheme is the exclusive remedy for employees challenging removal, even those who do so by challenging the constitutionality of a federal statute. 
    The Court of Appeals acknowledged the Merit Systems Protection Board's past holding that it lacks jurisdiction to consider a statute's constitutionality, but the Court concluded that this did not exempt petitioners from the CSRAs exclusive scheme because the Federal Circuit could adjudicate -- Federal Circuit could adjudicate petitioners constitutional claims. 
    In an opinion filed with the clerk today, we affirm the judgment of the First Circuit. 
    Whereas here, a statute challenged -- channels judicial review of constitutional claims to a particular court that can perform meaningful review, we conclude that Congress intended that avenue of judicial review to be exclusive when Congress intent is fairly discernible in the statutory text structure and purpose. 
    The CSRA sets out an elaborate -- in elaborate detail the system of review before the Board and the Federal Circuit and this indicates that Congress did not intend employees to access another avenue of review in District Court. 
    There is no textual support for petitioners contention that Congress intended to exempt covered employees and employment actions from the CSRA scheme simply because the nature of the employee's claim is a constitutional challenge to a federal statute. 
    Under the CSRA, the availability of review turns on the type of employee and adverse action, not on the type of legal claim at issue. 
    Furthermore, the purpose of the CSRA was to provide a streamline review scheme that would eliminate employee challenges in federal courts across the country. 
    That purpose would severely undermined if employees with constitutional claims to challenge adverse employment action in District Courts. 
    We reject petitioner's contention that their claims cannot receive meaningful review within the CSRA scheme, even assuming that the Board cannot decide their constitutional challenges, the Federal Circuit can do so. 
    We also disagree with petitioner's argument that their claims are wholly collateral to the CSRA scheme and outside of the Boards expertise because they have nothing to do with supervisor employee disputes that the Board ordinarily adjudicates. 
    Petitioner's claims are the vehicle by which they seek to overturn their removal from federal employment and obtain reinstatement and back pay. 
    The Board routinely addresses challenges to removal and requests for such relief and petitioner's appeals present issues such as constructive discharge to which the Board may apply its expertise. 
    For these reasons, we conclude that the CSRA precludes District Court jurisdiction in this case. 
    Justice Alito has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justices Ginsburg and Kagan join.
