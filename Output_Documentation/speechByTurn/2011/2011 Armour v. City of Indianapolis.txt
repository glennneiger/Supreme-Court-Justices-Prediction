    The case concerns payments for sewers. 
    Before 2005, the City of Indianapolis typically and in this particular case paid for new sewer lines by assessing the cost against the individual property owner whom the new lines benefited. 
    Some paid the entire assessment upfront, others paid in installments. 
    Soon after completing the project now before us, the City changed its sewer financing system to one based on bonds, a change that spread the responsibility to pay for individual projects more widely throughout the City. 
    In the process, the City forgave all those old system sewer assessment debts that had not yet been paid, including all the installments not yet due, but the City did not refund any money to those who would already paid their assessments. 
    The petitioners in the present case are homeowners who had paid their sewer project assessments in full. 
    They point out that the City's forgiveness decision means that each of them will have paid about $9000 for a new sewer connection while identical homeowners, who chose installment plan payments, would have paid close to nothing. 
    This, they say, is basically unfair to the point where it violates a Federal Constitution's promise of equal protection of the laws. 
    We don't agree with that point. 
    In cases such as this one, essentially involving tax classifications, the Equal Protection Clause grants States broad leeway to draw lines that make distinctions. 
    The line satisfies the Clause as long as there is “any reasonably conceivable state of facts that could provide a rational basis for the classification”. 
    And there is such a reasonably conceivable state of facts here. 
    The City has created a kind of amnesty program. 
    Any such amnesty program requires line drawing among roughly similar groups of individuals. 
    And the City says that the line it has drawn in part reflects administrative considerations. 
    The line reflects the fact that after the financing system switch, it would be too expensive to maintain an administrative system for collecting and processing old debts not still outstanding while it cost nothing at all simply to keep the funds already paid, i.e., not grant a refund. 
    Indeed, to administer a refund program would simply increase administrative cost. 
    The weight to give these reasonably conceivable facts is a matter primarily for the City to determine. 
    We, in this Court, need only decide whether the resulting determination is rational and we find that line drawing, based upon these administrative considerations, is rational here. 
    Basically, for these reasons, as elaborated in our opinion and for others that we set forth, we conclude that the City's forgiveness program does not violate the Federal Equal Protection Clause and we affirm the similar conclusion of the Supreme Court of Indiana. 
    The Chief Justice has filed a dissenting opinion, in which he is joined by Justices Scalia and Alito.
