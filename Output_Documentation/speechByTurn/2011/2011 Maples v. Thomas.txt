    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    The first case is Number 10-63, Maples v. Thomas. 
    Petitioner Cory Maples was sentenced to death after an Alabama jury found him guilty of capital murder. 
    On direct appeal, the Alabama Supreme Court upheld his conviction and sentence. 
    Maples then filed a habeas corpus petition in the Alabama trial court. 
    He alleged that the State failed to secure his constitutional right to an effective trial attorney. 
    The two attorneys appointed to represent him at trial, Maple stated, lacked experience and were minimally paid, and as a result he asserted his counsel made crucial errors. 
    Maple state court petition was prepared and submitted by two New York attorneys serving pro bono both associated with the same New York based law firm. 
    Because the two New York lawyers were not admitted to the bar in Alabama, they enlisted an Alabama attorney to move their admission and serve as local counsel. 
    The Alabama attorney agreed with the caveat that he would undertake no substantive work in the case. 
    Maples' attorneys filed his state court petition in August 2001. 
    In the summer of 2002, while the petition was still pending, the two New York lawyers left their law firm and commence employment that precluded them from service as Maples' counsel. 
    Neither attorneys sought the Alabama trial court permission to withdraw and neither told Maples' they would no longer able to represent him. 
    No other attorney at the law firm entered an appearance on Maples' behalf. 
    Several months later, the Alabama trial court denied Maples' habeas petition. 
    The court clerk set notice of the denial to the two New York attorneys. 
    Those notices were returned unopened by the law firms' mailroom. 
    The clerk also sent a notice to a local counsel who assumed the New York lawyers would pursue an appeal. 
    He therefore took no action in response to the notice. 
    With no attorney of record in fact acting on Maples' behalf, the time to appeal ran out. 
    The Alabama courts subsequently refused Maples' request to file an out-of-time appeal. 
    Maples then filed a habeas corpus petition in federal court, again asserting he had been denied his right to an effective trial attorney. 
    The District Court and the Eleventh Circuit rejected the petition relying on Maples' procedural default in state court his failure to file a timely notice of appeal. 
    The sole question before this Court is whether on the extraordinary facts of this case, there is cause to excuse Maples state court default. 
    We hold that there is and therefore reversed the Eleventh Circuit's judgment. 
    Attorney negligence or oversight, we have held, does not provide cause to excuse a procedural default and we do not hold otherwise today. 
    But Maples alleges something graver than attorney oversight. 
    He contends that his attorneys abandon him. 
    "I was unknowingly left without an attorney of record," he complains or still, he pleads, "I have no right to receive and in fact did not receive notice myself because on the record, I had counsel. 
    Absent any reason to believe I was unrepresented and therefore would have to act personally to preserve my right to appeal," Maple stated, no just system would hold him accountable for the default. 
    We agree, the attorneys Maples thought were vigilantly representing him had abandoned his case. 
    They did not so informed Maples or the Alabama court nor did any other lawyer at the New York firm timely seek the Alabama court's permission to serve as substitute counsel. 
    To no fault of his own, Maples and inmate on death row was left unrepresented at a critical time for his state habeas petition. 
    And he lacked any clue that he better fend for himself. 
    The uncommon combinations of mishaps in Maples' case, we hold, provide just cause to excuse the procedural lapse in state court. 
    Justice Alito has filed a concurring opinion. 
    Justice Scalia has filed a dissenting opinion, in which Justice Thomas joins.
