    Justice Clarence Thomas 
    This case comes to us on a writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. 
    George Corson worked as a welder and a machinist in loco in the locomotive repair and maintenance facilities. 
    His duties included installing brake shoes and locomotives -- on locomotives and stripping insulation from locomotive boilers. 
    Corson was diagnosed with cancer following his retirement. 
    Corson and his wife filed suit in Pennsylvania State Court against various defendants, including respondents here, alleging that Corson was injured as a result of exposure to asbestos during the course of his employment. 
    According to the complaint, respondents' manufactured or distributed locomotive parts containing asbestos that were handled by Corson. 
    The complaint asserted state law claims that respondents' products were defectively designed and that respondents failed to warn of the dangers posed by asbestos. 
    Corson passed away after the complaint was filed and Gloria Kurns, the executrix of the estate, was substituted as a party. 
    She is the petitioner here along with Corson's widow. 
    Respondents removed the case to federal court. 
    The District Court granted summary judgment to respondents, holding that petitioner's state law claims were preempted by the Federal Locomotive Inspection Act. 
    The Third Circuit affirmed. 
    In an opinion filed today with the clerk, we also affirm. 
    The Locomotive Inspection Act is silent as to its preemptive effect, but this Court held in Napier versus Atlantic Coast Line Railroad Company that the Act manifest an intention to occupy the entire field of regulating locomotive equipment. 
    Petitioners do -- and ask us to overrule Napier and we find that Napier compels the conclusion that petitioner's tort claims were preempted. 
    We first reject petitioner's claim that a subsequently enacted statute, the Federal Railroad Safety Act narrowed the Locomotive Inspection Act's preemptive scope. 
    The Railroad Safety Act leaves preexisting statutes like the Locomotive Inspection Act intact. 
    We, therefore, conclude that the Railroad Safety Act left the preemptive reach of the Locomotive Inspection Act in place. 
    Petitioners -- petitioners alternatively contend that their claims do not fall within Napier's definition of the field preempted by the Locomotive Inspection Act. 
    They argue that the state law claims arising from the repair or maintenance of locomotives as opposed to claims arising from the use of locomotives on the railway do not fall within the preempted field. 
    That argument is inconsistent with Napier's holding that Congress “Manifested the intention to occupy the entire field of regulating locomotive equipment.” 
    Napier did not distinguish between hazards arising from repair and those arising from use on the line. 
    We are also unpersuaded by petitioners' argument that their failure to warn claims do not fall within the preempted field. 
    A failure to warn claim alleges that a product itself is unlawfully dangerous unless accompanied by warnings or instructions deemed sufficient by a state law. 
    Petitioners' failure to warn claims are therefore directed at the equipment of locomotives and fall within the preempted field. 
    For these reasons and other reasons discussed in our opinion, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed. 
    Justice Kagan has filed a concurring opinion. 
    Justice Sotomayor has filed an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part in which Justices Ginsburg and Breyer join.
