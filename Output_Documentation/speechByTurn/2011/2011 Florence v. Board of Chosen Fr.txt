    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    In this Case, the Court considers the extent to which the Constitution imposes restrictions on jail officials who search incoming detainees. 
    The petitioner is Albert Florence and he presses claims for himself and a larger class. 
    In 1998, Florence was arrested after attempting to flee from police officers. 
    He pled guilty to two offenses and was sentenced by a New Jersey state court to pay a fine in installments. 
    When he fell behind on his payments and failed to appear, a judge issued a warrant for his arrest. 
    Florence then paid the balance but the warrant remained in a state-wide computer database. 
    Some seven years later, the events that give rise to this case occurred. 
    Florence and his wife were stopped in their car by a New Jersey state trooper. 
    Based on the outstanding warrant, Florence was arrested and taken to the Burlington County Detention Center. 
    He was held there for six days and then transferred to the Essex County Correctional Center. 
    He was released a day later after the charges were dropped. 
    At the outset of his detention in each of the two facilities, Florence was subjected to a thorough -- thorough search, sometimes called a strip search. 
    The searches did not involve any touching or probing of the unclothed detainee, yet the two searches were thorough and no doubt intrusive. 
    At the Burlington Facility, jail policy required every arrestee to shower with a delousing soap. 
    Officers would check for scars, gang tattoos and contraband as the arrestee or detainee disrobed. 
    Florence claims he was also instructed to open his mouth, lift his tongue, hold out his arms, turn around and lift his genitals. 
    After being transferred to the Essex Facility, he was subject to a second similar search and the details are set out in the opinion. 
    Florence alleges that during this second search, he was required to lift his genitals, turn around and cough in a squatting position. 
    Florence brought a Section 1983 suit for violations of his Fourteenth and Fourth Amendment rights alleging an awful search. 
    He maintained that persons arrested for a minor offense cannot be required to remove their clothing and submit to a close visual inspection as a routine part of the intake process. 
    Rather he contends officials make -- conduct this kind of search only if they have reason to suspect a particular inmate of concealing a weapon or drugs or concealing other contraband. 
    The District Court agreed. 
    The United States Court Appeals for the Third Circuit reversed. 
    It held that a search -- that the search procedures at issue struck a reasonable balance between inmate privacy and the needs of the two jails. 
    This Court now affirms the judgment of the Court of Appeals. 
    The difficulties of operating a detention center must not be under estimated by the courts. 
    Jail officials have a responsibility to ensure the security of their facilities when detainees are admitted. 
    This is not an easy task. Jails admit 13 million inmates a year. 
    Now, the largest facilities process hundreds of people everyday, even smaller jails can be crowded on weekend nights or after a large police operation. 
    Some detainees are gang members, others may have contagious infection, and some of them possess a knife or drugs or other contraband. 
    Correctional officers have discretion to use their expertise to devise reasonable solutions to the problems they face. 
    Now, the precedents of this Court have established that deference was given to the judgment of correctional officers that these thorough searches serve not only to discover but also to deter the smuggling of contraband into detention facilities. 
    The cases have recognized that this deterrence depends in part on the ability to conduct search without predictable exceptions. 
    It is true that some people are held in jail for a minor offense. 
    And Florence argues they should be exempt from the general search policies here at issue. 
    He argues that absent a reasonable suspicion, officers should be prohibited from conducting a so-called strip search of someone who is not been arrested for an offense that involves a weapon or drugs or as otherwise considered serious. 
    It is reasonable, however, for correctional officials to find this framework unworkable, but one thing, people detained for a minor offense can turn out to be the most dangerous criminals. 
    Timothy McVeigh was stopped for a traffic offense before it was determined he was a perpetrator of the Oklahoma City bombing. 
    And there are many examples of people arrested for minor offenses, trying to bring contraband into jail, sometimes by using their body cavities. 
    In fact, an exception for the standard search protocol for minor offenders would increase the risk of their being coerced by others into hiding prohibited items. 
    Another problem is that it may be difficult to classify inmates by their current and prior offenses before the intake search. 
    Criminal history records may be inaccurate, incomplete or difficult to obtain. 
    And even with all the facts, it could be difficult for officers to know on the spot whether a prior offense is a constitutional matter serious enough to authorize the searches here. 
    The Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments do not require the restrictions Florence proposes. 
    The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit is affirmed. 
    Justice Thomas has joined all but Part IV of the Court's opinion. 
    The Chief Justice and Justice Alito have filed concurring opinions. 
    Justice Breyer has filed a dissenting opinion, in which Justices Ginsburg, Sotomayor and Kagan join.
