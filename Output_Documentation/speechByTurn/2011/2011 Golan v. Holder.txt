    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    The second case I have to announce is Golan v. Holder, No. 10-545. 
    The Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works, established in 1886, is the principal accord governing international copyright relations. 
    Berne's 164 member states agreed to provide a minimum level of copyright protection and to treat authors from other member countries as well as they treat their own. 
    Of central importance in this case, Berne's Article 18 requires countries to protect existing foreign works whose term of protection has not yet expired either in the country of origin or the country where protection is claimed. 
    The United States finally joined Berne in 1989, but initially deferred compliance with Article 18. 
    In the following years, other Berne members objected to our incomplete adherence, some refused to protect existing U.S. works, others threatened enforcement by recourse to the then new World Trade Organization. 
    In 1994, Congress put to rest any question about U.S. compliance with Article 18. 
    Section 514 of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act extended a copyright protection to foreign works that enjoyed protection in their country of origin, but not the U.S. protection for any of three reasons. 
    The country of origin had not maintained copyright relations with the United States, the work was a pre-1972 sound recording or the author failed to comply with U.S. statutory formalities. 
    Under Section 514, the foreign works term of protection expires at precisely the time it would have expired had the work enjoyed U.S. protection from the outset. 
    These newly protected works previously were part of the U.S. public domain which means they had been freely available for use with no need for permission from the author or copyright owner. 
    To cushion the impact of the works' transition to protect this status, Congress provided accommodations for those who have previously used the foreign works. 
    Petitioners are musicians, conductors, publishers and others who formally enjoyed free access to works 514 removed from the public domain. 
    They maintain that Section 514 is invalid under both Constitution's Copyright Clause and the First Amendment. 
    Because the works previously entered the public domain, they assert, they must forever remain there. 
    The Tenth Circuit rejected this narrow view of Congress' copyright authority and so do we. 
    The Copyright Clause does not place beyond Congress' reach works that never enjoyed U.S. copyright protection or enter the public domain prematurely. 
    Neither congressional practice nor our decisions treat the public domain in any and all cases as untouchable by copyright legislation. 
    The First Amendment likewise provides no exceptional solicitude for works in the public domain. 
    As we held in 2003 in Eldred v. Ashcroft, copyright law's built-in safe guard for free expression, the fair use doctrine and the idea expression dichotomy generally accommodate a speaker's right to free expression regarding copyrighted works. 
    Section 514 respects both limits. 
    The provision simply brings certain foreign works under the very same legal regime that applies to domestic and most of the foreign works. 
    That alignment does not unconstitutionally abridge free speech. 
    In sum, we are satisfied that neither the Copyright Clause nor the First Amendment bars the unstinting adherence Congress gave to the Berne Convention. 
    Justice Breyer has filed a dissenting opinion, in which Justice Alito has joined.
