    Justice Sonia Sotomayor 
    This case is about the Sixth Amendment right of jury trial. 
    In Apprendi versus New Jersey, we held that this right requires that other than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the maximum punishment for criminal defendant cases must be proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt rather than to a judge under a lower standard of proof. 
    We have reaffirmed the Apprendi's rules numerous times in cases where the punishment at issue was imprisonment or the death sentence. 
    The question here is whether Apprendi also applies when the punishment is a criminal fine. 
    We hold that it does. 
    This case arises from the conviction of Southern Union Company, a natural gas distributor. 
    A jury found the company guilty of violating a federal environmental statute. 
    The statute authorizes a fine of up to $50,000 for each day of violation. 
    The jury, however, did not specify the length of the violation. 
    Southern Union argued that the judge must, therefore, assume the violation was for just one day because any longer violation would expose the company to a larger maximum fine and thus amount to judicial fact finding in violation of Apprendi. 
    The District Court, however, imposed a fine of $6 million and a community service obligation of $12 million, amounts much larger than the one day penalty of $50,000. 
    The United States Courts of Appeals for the First Circuit recognized that this would violate Apprendi, if Apprendi applied to criminal fines but held that Apprendi does not so apply. 
    We disagree. 
    For purposes of Apprendi, there is no basis to distinguish criminal fines from imprisonment or the death sentence. 
    As we have said in Oregon versus Ice, the core concern of Apprendi is to ensure that the jury finds facts that weren't punishment for a specific statutory offense. 
    That concern applies just as much to fines as to imprisonment and the death sentence. 
    Like these other forms of punishment, fines are frequently imposed penal sanctions. 
    Their amounts are often determined by particular facts and they can be very substantial ranging into the tens of million of dollars or greater. 
    To allow judges to find facts that set the maximum amount of a fine would subvert Apprendi's purposes. 
    Our holding today is rooted in historical practice. 
    At the time of the founding, judges often have much discretion in choosing what fine to impose, but when as here, the amount of a fine depended on a particular fact, those facts were typically alleged in the indictment and proved to the jury. 
    This requirement manifested the common law rule that all accusations against the defendant that go into determining the punishment must be proved to the jury otherwise the defendant would be punished on the basis of facts that he has never been accused of. 
    The Government makes several policy arguments for why Apprendi should not apply to criminal fines and we reject them for reasons fully discussed in the opinion. 
    Because the First Circuit held that Apprendi does not apply to criminal fines, we reverse that Court's judgment and remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion. 
    Justice Breyer has filed a dissenting opinion in this case in which Justices Kennedy and Justice Alito join.
