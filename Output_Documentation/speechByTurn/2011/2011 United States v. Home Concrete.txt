    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    Well, this is tax case and the Tax Code provides that ordinarily, the Government has to assess a deficiency against a taxpayer within “three years after the return was filed,” but that three years can be extended to six years, where the taxpayer “omits from gross income an amount that's pretty large.” 
    Now, the question here is, does this extension omits from gross income an amount that's 25% or whatever? 
    The question is whether that extension applies when the taxpayer overstates the basis in property that he sold and that has the effect of understating his income. 
    Well, we hold that this overstatement of basis is not within the word of the statute, an omission of an amount from the taxpayer's gross income. 
    So, it does not apply, I mean three years, not six. 
    In a -- the previous case, Colony v. Commissioner, which this Court decided in 1958, the Court considered a similar question, involving similar language in a similar provision of the earlier Code, the 1939 Internal Revenue Code rather than 1954. 
    The Court there held that the language of the statute, in particular, that word omit when read in light of its history showed that the extended six-year period did not apply when the taxpayer understated his income by overstating his basis. 
    Considerations of stare decisis lead us to reach the same conclusion here. 
    Now, to reach that conclusion, we have -- we considered the Government's claim that later changes in -- related that other parts of the statute require a different conclusion, but we weren't convinced by that claim. 
    The Government also pointed out that we should defer to a Treasury regulation, interpreting the language and it interprets the language in the way favorable to the Government namely, that the six years should apply, but we don't accept that argument either. 
    We think that the Court in Colony meant its interpretation of that word “omit” to constitute a definitive understanding of what Congress meant by those words which then reappear in the 1954 Code and that fact that it was meant to be definitive by Congress in the Court's view forecloses the agency's more recent and different interpretation of the words. 
    We explain this further in our opinion. 
    We affirm the similar conclusion of the Fourth Circuit. 
    Justice Scalia has filed an opinion concurring in part and concurring in the judgment. 
    Justice Kennedy has filed a dissenting opinion joined by Justice Ginsburg, Justice Sotomayor, and Justice Kagan.
