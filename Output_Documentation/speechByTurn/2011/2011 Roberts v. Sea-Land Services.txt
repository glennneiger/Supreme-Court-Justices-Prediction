    Justice Sonia Sotomayor 
    A federal statute, the Longshore and Harbor Workers’ Compensation Act, entitles employees who are injured on the navigable waters of the United States to receive disability benefits from their employers. 
    The amount of benefits depends on both an employee's preinjury salary and the severity of his disability. 
    For example, a totally disabled employee is entitled to receive two-thirds of his salary as long as he remains disabled, but the Act also set some maximum rates for benefits. 
    The maximum rate is twice the national average weekly wage. 
    That national average weekly wage is a figure calculated by the Secretary of Labor each year based on the average earnings of workers across the country. 
    The question in this case is which national average weekly wage is used to determine an employee's maximum rate of compensation. 
    The Longshore Act says to apply the national average weekly wage for the year in which an employee is "newly awarded compensation." 
    So, the precise question before us is, when is an employee newly awarded compensation, when he is disabled by injury or, when he receives a formal compensation order awarding him benefits? 
    In 2002, petitioner Dana Roberts was injured while working at respondent's Sea-Land Services Marine Terminal in Alaska. 
    In 2007, an administrative law judge or ALJ issued a formal compensation order awarding Roberts' benefits. 
    Roberts argued that his maximum rate of compensation should be twice the national average weekly wage for 2007, the year of the ALJ's award. 
    Instead, the ALJ set a maximum of twice the national average weekly wage for 2002, the year when Roberts became disabled. 
    The Department of Labor’s Benefits Review Board affirmed the ALJ's decision, so did the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, and so do we. 
    We hold that employee is newly awarded compensation when he first becomes disabled and thereby becomes statutorily entitled to benefits no matter whether or when he obtains a formal compensation order. 
    Although Roberts' interpretation is, at first blush, appealing only ours is consistent with the structure of the Longshore Act and leads to rational results in its administration. 
    The Act requires employers to pay benefits voluntarily without formal orders and the vast majority of employers do. 
    For the reasons we explain in our opinion, Roberts' readings would upset this system and would lead to absurd consequences and we reject it. 
    The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit is affirmed. 
    Justice Ginsburg has filed an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part.
