    Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr. 
    The first case is Williams versus Illinois, Number 10-8505. 
    This case involves DNA evidence and the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment. 
    The petitioner, Sandy Williams was convicted in state court in Illinois for abducting, raping, and robbing a young woman. 
    At his trial, the victim identified Williams as her attacker and the State also attempted to show that Williams' DNA matched the forensic sample obtained from the victim at the hospital after the rape. 
    Williams subjected to the testimony by the DNA expert who testified for the State. 
    After petitioner was convicted, he filed an appeal claiming that the DNA expert's testimony violated the Confrontation Clause. 
    The State Court of Appeals rejected this argument and the Supreme Court of Illinois affirmed. 
    We granted certiorari and we now affirm. 
    Anyone interested in understanding the Court's holding will have to read our opinions. 
    I have filed an opinion in which the Chief Justice, Justice Kennedy, and Justice Breyer join. 
    Justice Breyer has filed a concurring opinion. 
    Justice Thomas has filed an opinion concurring in the judgment. 
    Justice Kagan has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justices Scalia and Ginsburg and Sotomayor have joined.
