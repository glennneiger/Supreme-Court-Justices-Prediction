    Justice Sonia Sotomayor 
    The Torture Victims Protection Act or TVPA authorizes a cause of action against “an individual” for acts of torture and extrajudicial killing. 
    The question in this case is whether the term individual as used here means natural persons or whether the term is used more broadly such that the Act authorizes liability against certain organizations. 
    In 1995, Azzam Rahim, a naturalized U.S. citizen, traveled to the West Bank. 
    There, according to the allegations in the complaint, he was arrested by Palestinian Authority intelligence officers imprisoned, tortured, and ultimately killed. 
    Ten years later, his relatives, petitioners here, brought suit against the Palestinian Authority and the Palestinian Liberation Organization asserting claims of torture and extrajudicial killing under the TVPA. 
    The District Court dismissed the suit on the ground that only natural persons could be sued under the Act. 
    The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit affirmed and we now affirm as well. 
    Petitioners concede that foreign states may not be sued under the Act, namely, that the Act did not create an exception to the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976. 
    They argue however, that the Act does not similarly restrict liability against other entities. 
    In petitioner's view, by permitting suit against an individual, the TVPA contemplates liability against natural persons and non-sovereign organizations. 
    We decline to read individual so unnaturally. 
    As explained in more detail in our opinion, the ordinary meaning of the word “individual” and the statutory context in which it is used persuades us that the Act authorizes suits against natural persons alone. 
    The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit is affirmed. 
    The opinion of the Court is unanimous as -- except as to Justice Scalia who joins the Court's opinion except as to part 3(b). 
    Justice Breyer has filed a concurring opinion.
