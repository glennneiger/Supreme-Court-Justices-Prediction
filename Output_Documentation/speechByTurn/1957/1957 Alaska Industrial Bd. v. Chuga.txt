Alaska Industrial Bd. v. Chugach Elec. Assn., Inc.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Number 303, Alaska Industrial Board and Carl E. Jenkins, Petitioners, versus Chugach Electric Association, Inc. 
    Mr. Dimond, you may proceed.
speaker="john_h_dimond" startTime="22.203" stopTime="187.865">
    Mr. John H. Dimond 
    May it please the Court? 
    This case rises under the Alaska Workmen's Compensation statute. 
    In September 1951, the petitioner Carl Jenkins while in the course of his employment with Chugach Electric Association got a 1200 volt arc into his arm on the high power line, and it exploded out both his feet. 
    Within one month following this accident, three amputations had been performed because of the electrical burning. 
    The left arm had been amputated near the shoulder, the right leg below the knee, and four toes of the left foot. 
    Within one year after the accident, the medical reports in the record show that Jenkins had been fitted with artificial limbs. 
    He had an artificial left arm and artificial right leg and had it not been for the injury to the left foot where four toes were amputated. 
    He could have sought and probably obtain some type of employment. 
    But, the left foot failed to heal and this failure continued on for a period of over three years. 
    At the conclusion of the case before the Industrial Board and when this case went to the District Court, the evidence showed even then in December 1953 that the foot had not healed. 
    If the case were remanded to the Board, I suspect that a finding could be made now that healing process was completed in 1954, early part of 1955. 
    Now, right after his injury, the insurance carrier commenced paying Jenkins what they called temporary compensation specifically provided under the Alaska statute. 
    That statute provides that for all injuries causing temporary disability, the injured employee shall be paid 65% of his daily average wages during the period of the disability, and that has always been construed by the Industrial Board and by Alaska Courts as meaning that he gets, during the healing period until his wages, I mean until his injuries have stabilized or have been healed, 65% of his average wages whatever the board finds him to be, and in the average case at the end of that healing period, if there's any permanent injury, the Industrial Board makes a finding of what percentage permanent injuries involved and also gives employee an additional award under the permanent injury schedule of the Alaska Act.

    Award for permanent disabilities is not related to wages.

    Sir?

    It's a lump sum?
speaker="john_h_dimond" startTime="198.437" stopTime="223.286">
    Mr. John H. Dimond 
    It's a lump sum, it's not related to wages, it has no relation -- it's not computed on wages. 
    A man might for example Your Honor, a man might lose the hearing in both ears and receive the maximum award for total and permanent disability and yet he might go back to employment and earn just as much as he did before, so it's not related directly at least to loss of wages.

    Mr. John H. Dimond 
    I don't think you have to determine that issue Your Honor, no. 
    The only issue I think the Court has to determine is whether the Court of Appeals was correct in saying that when a man has received the maximum permanent award that he has conclusively presumed not to have any further or remaining earning capacity.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="255.367" stopTime="260.173">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    And basically is this a question of the construction of the Alaska Act --

    Mr. John H. Dimond 
    That's the case in a nutshell Your Honor.

    Yes.
speaker="john_h_dimond" startTime="263.800" stopTime="272.595">
    Mr. John H. Dimond 
    It's based on the construction of those two provisions of the act; the permanent scheduled award section and the temporary compensation section.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="272.595" stopTime="279.648">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    I gather his one foot had not -- was still under treatment, was it not, that hadn't reached the point of --
speaker="john_h_dimond" startTime="279.648" stopTime="301.461">
    Mr. John H. Dimond 
    Yes, after the left arm and right leg had been fitted with artificial limbs, he couldn't go back to work because the left foot wouldn't heal. 
    There was an ulceration and all kinds of trouble there, causing by electrical burns and the doctors said they have to do further amputations, and skin grafts and plastic repairs and so on.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="301.461" stopTime="311.435">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    So that even though perhaps with the artificial limbs he might have been able to do some limited kind of work, he was disabled by reason of the foot conditions from even doing that, is that --
speaker="john_h_dimond" startTime="311.435" stopTime="327.877">
    Mr. John H. Dimond 
    That's exactly our position Your Honor that he had some remaining earning capacity after he got his artificial limbs. 
    That earning capacity was temporarily impaired by an injury to a left foot which just happened to happen with the same accident.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="327.877" stopTime="337.921">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    So that he should be under your view entitled a temporary compensation until a period of finality or judgment of finality as to the leg injury had been reached?
speaker="john_h_dimond" startTime="337.921" stopTime="342.464">
    Mr. John H. Dimond 
    That's correct Your Honor. 
    That's precisely the position of the petitioner in this case.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="342.464" stopTime="362.618">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    As I understand you're saying Mr. Dimond, it was the practice under your act to pay the petitioner compensation until he was healed, and then after he was healed to make the permanent award.
speaker="john_h_dimond" startTime="362.618" stopTime="379.530">
    Mr. John H. Dimond 
    Generally Your Honor, the Industrial Board I think almost in every case does not decide what degree of permanent injury had been incurred until after the healing period is over, and the man has returned to work or until the doctors say there's nothing further we can do with you.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="379.530" stopTime="381.653">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Courts have sustained that --
speaker="john_h_dimond" startTime="381.653" stopTime="419.392">
    Mr. John H. Dimond 
    I don't think it's ever -- I did mention Your Honor that it's been the practice of the board and the courts, I don't think that question has ever come up as an issue in a case as to whether that was proper, I think that (Inaudible). 
    The act says that for all injuries and I emphasize the word all causing temporary disability, there shall be paid during the period of the disability and I contend that the period of the disability is the entire period and not just the period preceding the amputations of two limbs.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="419.392" stopTime="420.046">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Well, may I ask –-
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="420.046" stopTime="429.067">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Is there any indication here why they didn't follow that practice and wait to lose till that left foot has healed?
speaker="john_h_dimond" startTime="429.067" stopTime="460.210">
    Mr. John H. Dimond 
    Well Your Honor, the respondents took this position. 
    They paid him temporary compensation from the date of injury until July 1951, about a year later, and I think they finally looked at the law and said that this man lost an arm and a leg, therefore he is totally and permanent disabled, we've been paying him too much. 
    In other words, at the time of the amputation they contend that he was totally and permanently disabled, and therefore, he couldn't get any temporary disability. 
    They thought those two things were inconsistent.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="460.210" stopTime="461.420">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    So they quit –-
speaker="john_h_dimond" startTime="461.420" stopTime="474.560">
    Mr. John H. Dimond 
    They paid him $8100 maximum less the amount they have paid him for temporary disability for the preceding 38 weeks. 
    So the total – excuse me?
speaker="charles_e_whittaker" startTime="474.560" stopTime="482.553">
    Justice Charles E. Whittaker 
    Does your statute make the loss of an arm and a leg permanent total disability?
speaker="john_h_dimond" startTime="482.553" stopTime="509.151">
    Mr. John H. Dimond 
    Yes Your Honor, the statute on page 6 of the petitioner's opening brief in the appendix, that's roman numeral 6, the loss of both hands or both arms or both feet or both legs and so on shall constitute total and permanent disability and be compensated according to the provisions of the act with reference to total and permanent disability.

    Justice John M. Harlan 
    So they -- so what's your claim now is that he was entitled to something over and above the $8100 by reason of the temporary disability?
speaker="john_h_dimond" startTime="537.406" stopTime="556.373">
    Mr. John H. Dimond 
    Yes Your Honor, the Court of Appeals held that and as much as the insurance carrier had voluntarily paid this temporary disability for 38 weeks without questioning this business of having an arm and a leg loss, that they should have at least paying that much, at least up to the time that he was classified to follow the classification.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="556.373" stopTime="559.681">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Now the Court of Appeals to that extent overruled the District Court.
speaker="john_h_dimond" startTime="559.681" stopTime="565.316">
    Mr. John H. Dimond 
    To that extent, they said Jenkins was entitled to $3645 but nothing beyond that point.

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    I gather from the date of the accident until some particular date that was the time of the second amputation, there's no question that he was entitled to temporary allowance.

    Mr. John H. Dimond 
    That's the bottomline, yes, no question about that.

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    That was just one month?

    Yes sir.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="582.693" stopTime="587.867">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    And then it was that they continued paying him after the second amputation for 38 weeks.

    Mr. John H. Dimond 
    Yes sir.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="588.565" stopTime="596.912">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    And it was at that time that they classified him as permanent total, they tried to relate it back to the date of his second amputation and Court of Appeals said, no, they couldn't.
speaker="john_h_dimond" startTime="596.912" stopTime="597.198">
    Mr. John H. Dimond 
    That's right.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="597.198" stopTime="597.757">

    Is that right?

    That's right.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="598.245" stopTime="609.607">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    But the Court of Appeals nevertheless did for the purposes of construction of the statute relate back to the time of the second amputation, the interpretation of the statute as well as the sum in total.
speaker="john_h_dimond" startTime="609.607" stopTime="614.607">
    Mr. John H. Dimond 
    No we relate it back the time of the insurance carrier said you are totally disabled.

    For the time out to the classification.

    For the classification.

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Now if you are right, how long after that date of classification would he still be entitled to temporary disability.
speaker="john_h_dimond" startTime="624.439" stopTime="638.456">
    Mr. John H. Dimond 
    He was classified by the insurance career in July 1951, and in December 1953 which is the last medical evidence in the record, he was still unable to go back to work, his foot is still not healed.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="638.456" stopTime="640.920">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr.

    Mr. John H. Dimond 
    Well if the healing was completed or else the doctor said we can't do anything more, the board would stop the temporary compensation because it's no longer temporary.

    Yes.

speaker="john_h_dimond" startTime="789.083" stopTime="929.959">
    Mr. John H. Dimond 
    Yes, Your Honor by the industrial board, which is the fact finding body. 
    I wanted to emphasize the provisions of the temporary compensation provision which is somewhat unique and not like the state statutes on this provision. 
    I think most states have your partial permanent and total permanent awards which go over a number of weeks. 
    Here you get a lump sum provision for permanent injury whether it's partial or total and I suppose the legislature had in mind that to -- that in the average case a man who has -- loses an arm or a leg has some adverse effect on his future earning power and perhaps this was the only way they could compensate him in some measure for what may be an adverse effect, whether it is or not. 
    Whereas the other section which is entirely separate says for all injuries throughout the temporary disability, not just those injuries which are without a loss of two limbs. 
    They should be paid daily average wages and then the second sentence of that provision I think requires some emphasis and attention. 
    It says in all cases where the injury develops or proves to be set as to entitle the workman to some compensation under any other provision of this schedule; then the two awards shall be paid at the same time. 
    In other words the Court of Appeals admitted that other cases are cases of permanent injury, and so if a man loses his arm Your Honors, and is paid temporary compensation during the healing period, he can also receive the permanent award for the loss of an arm. 
    Of course the Court of Appeal stops when you get two limbs gone and say that after the second amputation and in fact or after the classification when they make up their mind that he's permanently and totally disabled, even though he's not healed, even though it might be two years before he can go back to work and earn wages, he can't receive any more temporary compensation. 
    And I respectfully submit that that is contrary to the clear express language of the Alaska legislature in temporary provision statute.

    Well that's what did disturb me Your Honor about the decision by the Court of Appeals. 
    I thought logically the Court of Appeals if it were going to hold the way it did, would say that after the second amputation he was -- he should be then totally and permanently disabled and should receive no further compensation. 
    But the Court of Appeals said that if the insurance carrier continues to pay him temporary disability, mistakenly for another 38 weeks that they're stuck with that payment.

    (Inaudible) this section of the statute on page 4 of your appendix, this Page 6 of your appendix which provides that the loss of both hands or both arms or one of each constitutes total and permanent disability?
speaker="john_h_dimond" startTime="1016.652" stopTime="1027.234">
    Mr. John H. Dimond 
    Your Honor, it constitutes total and permanent disability so far as the amount of money the man gets, but it may not totally disable him for earning the living as a matter of fact.

    Or does it -- can he recover, can he be both temporarily disabled and permanently disabled at one and the same time?
speaker="john_h_dimond" startTime="1046.180" stopTime="1143.353">
    Mr. John H. Dimond 
    He can not, in literal sense be temporally and permanently disabled at the same time Your Honor, but if the man loses an arm and a leg, it's true the legislature said he's totally and permanently disabled. 
    But I think you have to read this in the context of the whole statute which indicates that for a total and permanent disability the total amount of money you can get is $8,100, and the legislature must have recognized the fact that people who lose arms and legs are not necessarily completely unable to earn a living. 
    Now the facts in this case show that after this man had lost his arm and his leg a year later, he could have gone back to work, except the fact that his other injury didn't heal, and so he had some remaining earning capacity despite the conclusive presumption assumed by the Court of Appeals that he had an earning. 
    He actually did have some and that was temporarily impaired by this second injury. 
    I think an example Your Honor of why this must be the case is let's assume Jenkins lost the hearing in both the ears in his employment, and he went back to work a month a later as the line man again, now he was totally and permanently disabled because he's lost the hearing in both the ears, and yet if he received an electrical burn and hurt his left foot under the theory of the Court of Appeals he could receive nothing, even though the act says for all injuries causing temporary disability he shall receive so much money.

    Mr. John H. Dimond 
    In the average case that happens Your Honor, but then the Court of Appeals said in effect that when it's determined it's permanent he can't draw anymore temporary, but my contention here is, the petitioner's is that if he loses an arm and a leg, right away they can classify him as permanent the day of the injury even though the facts show that he can't go back to work for two years, because of the slowness in healing. 
    So the Court of Appeals modified the words, so paid or due by the word theretofore. 
    In other words, up to the time of the classification of the permanent injury, he can get both types of compensation, but as soon as he is classified as a total and permanent disability then that's the case is restricted to that he is no longer temporarily disabled and that's why he can't draw any compensation. 
    That's the precise position of the Court of Appeals and the respondent. 
    But my contention is that the provision for temporary disability very clearly contemplates that a man should be compensated for loss of wages during the healing period regardless of what finding is made in that period as to the degree of permanent impairment of it's earning power or as to what scheduled allowance he is limited to have.

    I don't know how to answer it. 
    Literally speaking, that's what it means of course total and permanent disability, the understanding is he is permanently and totally disabled and yet the facts are, in every case almost, there is some remaining earning capacity after a man loses two eyes or two ears or two hands.

    Mr. Frederick O. Eastaugh 
    Yes, I think I should pass on to that now. 
    I'd like to start out with just a very brief review of the Alaska Act. 
    A comment has been made that the scheduled payments are not in lieu of, are not based or related to earning capacity and I think that's an important distinction. 
    It is true that the lump sum payments are not computed by the earning capacity of the worker, but they are related to it. 
    Now generally under a State Compensation Statute, the worker for a permanent partial disability, the worker would get two-thirds of his earnings for a stated period of time usually expressed in weeks. 
    It's true that that system relates it to earnings. 
    The higher paid worker gets a little bit more than the others, but the legislature in effect, regardless of the ratio use has determined that the compensation will be paid for certain of time. 
    Now in Alaska, we have lump sum payments and possibly that might relate back to when we had more itinerant workers going back and forth. 
    I don't think it's material. 
    I think the thing is that the legislature has taken from the Board the prospect of computing benefits for permanent partial and permanent total, and said this is what they shall get and those payments are in lieu of the earnings that they would have otherwise received during the period of their disability.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2583.028" stopTime="2591.826">

    What language do you rely upon for the last interpretation?
speaker="frederick_o_eastaugh" startTime="2591.826" stopTime="2599.074">
    Mr. Frederick O. Eastaugh 
    I think that the citation in Volume two of Larson's Workmen's Compensation where --

    Was he dealing with Alaska?

    they are different as you just stated?
speaker="frederick_o_eastaugh" startTime="2608.385" stopTime="2611.168">
    Mr. Frederick O. Eastaugh 
    They are different to that respect but I --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2611.168" stopTime="2614.736">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    I thought you said, it wasn't a material difference.
speaker="frederick_o_eastaugh" startTime="2614.736" stopTime="2730.095">
    Mr. Frederick O. Eastaugh 
    But I don't see how any other interpretation could be. 
    We don't subscribe to petitioner's interpretation of that difference. 
    Now on the temporary disability, Alaska Act has quite a unique provision or did at this time, 65% of the Workers' wages without limitations in time or in amount. 
    Most of the states as you, the Court will know, have a weekly limitation. 
    For example, a very highly paid worker might by reason of the computation of 65% of the earnings be entitled otherwise to maybe a $102 a week. 
    In Alaska he would have gotten that. 
    In for example, in most of the Western states they generally have about $30 or $35 a week maximum which can be obtained and of course under the modification of the Longshore Act, we have $54 in addition. 
    Counsel has always spoken of the modification of the Alaska Act of 1953 and later in 55. 
    When they doubled the schedule payments in 53, they put a $75 a week limitation on temporary which is still twice as much as any of the western states had at that time. 
    In 55, we now have a $100 a week limitation. 
    So I think that those explanations of the Alaska Act might be of assistance in looking into this problem.

    I can't answer that question, I don't know Justice Black, but this particular section you've been interested in, has been in review and the Court of Appeals in the (Inaudible) cases which were cited in the respondent's brief, stated that the temporarily disability payments, when the result that is the end medical result, whatever we want to call it is fixed, maybe followed by permanent partial or permanent total payments and that is the ruling to date on that language.

    Mr. Frederick O. Eastaugh 
    Yes! 
    I think that -- my answer is still the same Mr. Justice Frankfurter. 
    I believe that when the act was first passed in Alaska and I believe the year was 1917 as an Employers' Liability Act, the legislature found it incumbent to make lump sum settlements for permanent, partial and permanent total rather -- and indeed as many states did in those days, many of the states then went over to the weekly payments. 
    It was apparently found out that the legislature that didn't fit the Alaska (Inaudible)

    No Mr. Justice Frankfurter, there is two ways of looking at these lump sum payments.

    Now, for example, you take two injured workmen, one earns 100 a week, and one earns 50 a week. 
    If they both receive the identical, permanent partial injury, the poorly paid worker will receive the identical amount as the well paid worker. 
    Now, he thinks that's good. 
    This other fellow doesn't think it's so good.

    Mr. Justice Black, I think it's all through the act. 
    We have the case of a death case. 
    We have a case of a man that is permanently totally disabled that would never be able to work under any conditions, and the legislature fixed that amount. 
    Here we have a man that presumably will some day be able to work -- enter the labor market again. 
    Now if he does so, after he gets the maximum benefit and he is again hurt he can start in on total disability -- temporary disability payments, when his condition becomes fixed, they can ripen again into total, permanent total --

    Yes, whenever there is a permanent injury of any nature, the person against, that is the carrier pays in addition to the injured workman a 2% of the award, and that goes in to the second injury fund and is used for those cases where before this accident, there is a pre-existing condition and --

    Right. 
    So, it is quite possible that if this goes back to the Industrial Board and Jenkins' left foot never heals, that he could be having, could well have been paid permanent total disability, the maximum under the act, and temporary total for 8 years or 7 years for an indefinite period of time. 
    There is nothing in the record to show that he has reached his --
