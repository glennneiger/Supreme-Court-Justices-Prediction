    Number 146, United States of America, Petitioner, versus Howard A. McNinch et al. 
    Mr. Doub you may proceed.

    Mr. George Cochran Doub 
    If the Court please. 
    These are three separate cases decided by the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. 
    Each involves the proper scope of the Civil False Claims Act. 
    In the McNinch case, originating in South Carolina, the Fourth Circuit held that the Civil False Claims Act did not apply to fraudulent applications for loans guaranteed by the Federal Housing Administration. 
    In the Toepleman case, originating in North Carolina, the Fourth Circuit held that the Civil False Claims Act did not apply to fraudulent applications for loans to the Commodity Credit Corporation because it was a wholly owned government corporation, and a wholly owned government corporation, according to the Fourth Circuit, is not a part of the Government of the United States. 
    And in the Cato case, originating in the Eastern District of Virginia, the same decision was made. 
    Now, the facts in the McNinch case were these, the defendants where the officers and -- and the salesmen of an unincorporated home construction business. 
    They presented to a South Carolina bank, an FHA approved lending institution, a false and fraudulent FHA loan application on the forms of FHA for the purpose of obtaining FHA guaranteed loans for the construction or repair of homes. 
    Now, the applications were fraudulent and fictitious. 
    They included false credit reports in order to bring the applications within the eligibility provisions of the statute. 
    Our complaint under the Civil False Claims Act alleged, the applications or claims were filed with the intent that they should be reported to and accepted by FHA for insurance. 
    That is the guarantee. 
    Well, in reliance upon the integrity of the applications, the bank approved the loans, reported them to FHA, FHA guaranteed payment of the loans to the bank in the event of a default and the bank made the loan as guaranteed by FHA to these applicants. 
    And those actual payments were obtained. 
    Now, the compliant further alleges a conspiracy by the defendants to defraud the United States under this -- the same provisions of the Civil False Claims Act and it alleges in that connection that the defendants obtained 2000 counterfeit credit report forms of a credit company for this fraudulent purpose. 
    Now, I might say, because great significance is attached to -- to this fact by the lower court and by the defendants, after the discovery of the fraud, but before these suits were instituted and before criminal suits were instituted, the defendants bought back these -- these notes, so there's been no default on the notes and there has been no loss by FHA. 
    Now, the facts in these cases are typical of thousands referred by the FHA to the Department of Justice originating all over the United States. 
    As a matter of fact, this type of fraud, our experience shows that my division is more prevalent numerically. 
    We have more cases numerically of this type than under any government program. 
    Now under --

    Mr. George Cochran Doub 
    [Laughter] 
    I don't recall that, I don't believe I can answer that point. 
    Now, let me remind you of the provisions of the Civil False Claims Act. 
    It provides for the payment to the United States of the sum of $2000 as liquidated damages or imputed damages or forfeitures, as to each fraudulent claim, and in addition, double the amount of actual damages. 
    It's applicable to anyone who makes or causes to be made or presents or causes to be presented a false claim, for payment or for approval, by any person or officer in the civil -- civil service of the United States. 
    And it covers any claim upon or against the Government of the United States or any department or officer thereof, and it also applies to obtaining or aiding to obtain so it is a broad, comprehensive statute and there are no qualifying or exclusionary clauses. 
    Now, in the --

    Justice John M. Harlan 
    May I ask you a question? 
    When you say -- you said that they made restitution (Inaudible) going to report back to denounce prior to that point. 
    What was it (Inaudible)
speaker="george_cochran_doub" startTime="407.764" stopTime="749.574">
    Mr. George Cochran Doub 
    Well, the record doesn't show that, Your Honor. 
    In Marcus against Hess, Mr. Justice Black said for the -- for unanimous Court on this point in interpreting the Civil False Claims Act. 
    He said if -- the Court said it is a civil remedial statute and not a penal statute. 
    It's to be accorded the fair meaning of its intent. 
    It was immaterial that the false claims were filed against a third party and not directly with the United States. 
    In other words, there, they were filed with their municipality. 
    And here, they were filed with a South Carolina bank. 
    It was also -- you also held that the object of a statute was to provide protection against those who would cheat the United States and to reach any person without regard to whether that person had direct contractual relations with the Government, and that is also true here. 
    The Court also held that the test of application of the Act was whether, ultimately and eventually, there might result payment of government money. 
    I might say that in that case, that was a case where fraudulent claims were asserted by contractors against a municipality which was under contract with PWA. 
    In other words, PWA was supplying a great deal of the funds for the construction of this municipal public improvement. 
    And so, though the false claims were presented to the municipality, the loss was ultimately born by the Treasury of the United States, although not in -- in its entirety, only in part. 
    Now, the Fourth Circuit followed the opinion of the Third Circuit with Chief Judge Biggs dissenting in the opinion in the Cochran case of the Fifth Circuit with Judge Reed dissenting, holding that such fraudulent applications did not constitute claims against the Government within the meaning of the False Claims Act. 
    Now, the -- these circuits strictly interpreted the word “claim” in the False Claims Act as a demand for money or property as a right, and since no demands were made for the payment of the loans, the Act did not cover the transaction. 
    And the opinion suggests that if there had been an actual default on the loans, and if there had been an actual payment by FHA, then the Act would apply. 
    But here, these applications were made upon FHA titled loan credit forms, here the defendants made the fraudulent applications with the objective and intent in understanding that they would be reported to and accepted by FHA for guarantees. 
    Here, they knew the bank wouldn't have made these loans except for the Government's guarantee. 
    Now, what was the essence of this transaction? 
    Upon FHA approval of this bank, which happened before these applications were filed, and upon the filing of these applications on these FHA forms, with the representations made in -- in them, that brought them within the scope of the Act and entitled them to the loan, and entitle the bank to the guarantee of the Government. 
    And when the bank made that guarantee, it became unqualifiedly committed as the guarantor of any future losses. 
    So, we say that these applications were in reality and practically in -- in substance directed against the assets of the United States. 
    And it's our position that the word “claim” under the statute goes beyond a simple demand for the immediate payment of money. 
    Here, the claim, the fraudulent claim was to the pledge of the credit of the United States and it was that guarantee which we made, and we say that guarantee was a property. 
    Now, you'll notice this no restrictive language in the statute as to the word “claim”. 
    It says, any claim, which would ordinarily mean all claims. 
    It refers not merely to payment, but payment or approval of a fraudulent claim. 
    Now, the Third Circuit and the Fifth Circuit interpret this statute as directed the claims for money or property. 
    We don't object to that. 
    And -- and I think that's undoubtedly so, but we say the word “property” shouldn't have been restricted by those circuits to tangible property, that, of course, it covers property in its ordinary sense, tangibles or intangibles.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="749.574" stopTime="758.725">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Does the Government remain or the FHA remain on the hook, once it is discovered that there has been a fraudulent application for a loan?
speaker="george_cochran_doub" startTime="758.725" stopTime="951.512">
    Mr. George Cochran Doub 
    If the bank is at -- if the bank did not know of the misrepresentations, the -- the Government has logged on its contract to guarantee. 
    So, all we're -- the -- the real issue in this case we -- we submit is this, is a contract of guarantee -- is a pledge to the credit of the United States property, if so, this was a claim for property under the Civil False Claims Act. 
    Now, we say property should be deemed to include a franchise, a patent, a copyright, a contract of insurance, a contract of guarantee, a contract of indemnity, any that shows an action of any legal right. 
    I might remind you of what this Court said in the Arenz case in 290 U.S. 66, which I don't think is on our brief, in construing the word “property” in a statute. 
    We said -- it's Fidelity and Deposit Company against Arenz, 290 U.S. 66. 
    And this is a way you construe the word “property” in a federal statute. 
    Property is a word of very broad meaning and when used without qualification, expressly made or plainly implied, it reasonably may be construe to include obligations, rights and other intangibles as well as physical things. 
    And then in Lynch against United States in 292 U.S., and an opinion by Justice Brandeis who held at War Risk Insurance policies being contracts for property and created vested rights. 
    And so, we say here, that FHA applications, fraudulent ones, that these defendants for a loan guaranteed by FHA were a claim for a contract of indemnity. 
    Now, the -- the Third Circuit and the Fifth Court and the Fourth Circuit has made -- made another false distinction, we believe. 
    They say that the test of liability is whether that's what's involved on the loan, which suggest that the Government, after discovering a fraud, would sit idly by to ascertain whether a default occurred before the six-year statute of limitation as far as the action, or see whether the defrauders -- would accord the defrauders an opportunity to buy the notes in case of a default to prevent a call upon the guarantee. 
    Of course, it would be practically an invitation to fraud. 
    It would be an engine of fraud. 
    It would be an invitation to take a gamble. 
    If the fraud isn't discovered, there's no problem. 
    If fraud is discovered, buy the notes back, and you could have a loss of evidence, the Government has to wait after it discovers the fraud for -- for perhaps years.

    Where do you find the word “property”, according to Government of property in the statute?
speaker="george_cochran_doub" startTime="957.951" stopTime="959.703">
    Mr. George Cochran Doub 
    I did not say it was in the statute. 
    I said --

    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Oh, I'm sorry.
speaker="george_cochran_doub" startTime="960.221" stopTime="965.397">
    Mr. George Cochran Doub 
    -- that the Third Circuit and the Fifth Circuit have interpreted the statute as --
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="965.397" stopTime="965.483">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    I see.

    Mr. George Cochran Doub 
    -- applying the claims for money or property.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="968.512" stopTime="968.784">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    I see.
speaker="george_cochran_doub" startTime="968.784" stopTime="1181.303">
    Mr. George Cochran Doub 
    And I accept that. 
    Now, it's not necessary under this statute, if the Court please, that the Government suffer a pecuniary loss. 
    The statute isn't in terms of loss. 
    The wrongful act is not the obtaining of money or property by fraud, it's not defrauding the Government. 
    The wrongful act, the offense is not cheating the Government, but it is attempting to cheat the Government. 
    Then Mr. Justice Black said in his opinion in Marcus against Hess, it applies to those who would cheat the Government of the United States and then the -- the $2000 liquidated damage, a forfeiture provision. 
    Obviously, it designed to cover, to impute damages to the Government, although, it maybe unable to prove any. 
    Though the statute assumes an injury by that forfeiture provision, it imputes liquated damages and that -- are desirable, because whenever there is an attempted fraud, though not successful, is investigative expense and clerical expense and legal expense. 
    So, we say there is no requirement statutory or judicial that specific damages be shown. 
    In Rex Trailer Company, Mr. Justice Clark said for the Court in -- for unanimous Court in that case, and that the language of that statute, the Surplus Property Act, was somewhat similar to this, it can be distinguished but he said the fact that no damages are shown is not fatal. 
    And we say his language there should be applied here. 
    So, we suggest respectfully that there is no valid distinction between default and pre-default claim. 
    The distinction made is artificial. 
    It's unrealistic. 
    And so, it follows that when there is a fraudulent application, a fraudulent claim for a guaranteed FHA loan, the statute has been violated, and that is the wrongful act, filing the claim. 
    And that wrongful act, which is its basis, is the same, whether there is a loss, actual loss by the government or not, default is not critical, but the filing of the false claim is. 
    Now, that brings me to the Toepleman case and the Cato case, one is in North Carolina and one from Virginia. 
    There, the Government brought suits under the same Civil False Claims Act for alleged frauds upon the Commodity Credit Corporation. 
    Commodity Credit had authorized the defendant corporations as Commodity's agents to make non-recourse loans to purchasers of eligible 1948 crop cut. 
    Now, the defendants submitted to Commodity Credit Corporation hundreds of notes, fraudulent notes of alleged cotton producers.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="1181.303" stopTime="1183.385">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    What do you mean by fraudulent?
speaker="george_cochran_doub" startTime="1183.385" stopTime="1305.095">
    Mr. George Cochran Doub 
    Well, if they falsely certify that the note makers had produced cotton. 
    As a matter of fact, the note makers had sold their cotton to the defendants and had no further interest in the cotton. 
    And the defendants persuaded and are induced the producers of the cotton to sign these notes or -- or rather applications, these false statements that they had produced the cotton even after they had purchased their cotton and they had no further interest in it. 
    They also falsely certified that the benefit of the loan would accrue solely to the note maker and that was untrue because they -- they weren't going accrue to the note makers, they were going to accrue to the defendants who had purchased this cotton. 
    They also falsely alleged the benefits below, and it had not been transferred to any other party. 
    Now, on the basis of these false statements, the defendants obtained payment of these fraudulent notes from the Commodity Credit Corporation. 
    Now, actually they made no dispersement to the purchasers or rather to the producers, the latter having no interest in them and they retained these commodity payment. 
    In other words, here was just a fraudulent scheme of some cotton brokers to protect themselves from loss. 
    The price of cotton went up, and probably that was one thing. 
    But if the price of cotton fell, this cotton they had bought from the real producers, then they would be protected by obtaining these payments on these fraudulent notes from the Commodity Credit Corporation.

    No actual loss, because these defendants bought up these notes and I think they bought them up after they -- they discovered that we had discovered the fraud. 
    Now, the Court of Appeals held that the civil False Claims Act did not apply to frauds upon the Commodity Credit Corporation of the type I have just described on one simple single ground and that is that Commodity Credit was a wholly owned government corporation. 
    And a wholly owned government corporation is not a part of the Government of the United States.

    Even there, the Government didn't own all the stock. 
    Anyhow, but certainly between 1878 and down to 1940, beginning with the Panama Canal and so on, you had a vast number, proliferating phenomenon in regard to government owned corporations.

    That's a very different -- not the immunity statute, but the immunity assumptions.

    Mr. George Cochran Doub 
    Through our answering the defendants' contention, as I have stated it, we submit that's not equality. 
    It's not necessary for the Government to show that Congress in 1878 determined to include a specific form of government activity which is not then developed. 
    The true inquiry, we say is, did Congress then intends by the use of this broad language of the Act to include all fraudulent claims against the Government regardless of the type of Government agencies which existed then or might develop thereafter. 
    In another words, did by using this broad language, Congress intend that the Act should be applied not only to existing known departments of the Government, but to any new types of government agencies, to any new corporate forms of activity provided, then in reality and in substance, they were a part of the Government. 
    Now, we're unable to find sufficient distinction to be drawn between commodity credit and the Government itself. 
    Let me explain what commodity credit is. 
    It's defined in the statute to be an agency, an instrumentality of the United States. 
    Within the Department of Agriculture, it was created for the purpose of stabilizing foreign income and prices, so it has a public purpose. 
    It's not a private banking venture, for instance like, a national bank incorporated under federal law. 
    It's manned entirely by officers and employees of the Department of Agriculture.

    Mr. George Cochran Doub 
    No, but they are -- there are agencies and instrumentalities of the United States with certain purposes. 
    But what's involved here is something very different from that -- before I'd like to -- before I leave the Commodity Credit, I want to point this out, the Agricultural Act of 1949 direct the Secretary in making cotton loans to support the price of cotton through the use of Commodity Credit Corporation and other means available. 
    The 1948 Act is similar language. 
    Now, in Rainwater, the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit held that commodity credit was nothing but a book keeping device for the handling of government money. 
    It was a matter of form which should not be allowed to obscure substantive realities, and in view of your functional interpretation of this False Claims Act in Marcus against Hess. 
    And the Eighth Circuit could find no material distinction between your decision as to the Reconstruction Finance Corporation and this situation, because in Cherry Cotton Mills against United States where you permitted the United States to sue on obligations due the RFC, this Court said that the Congress chose to call it a corporation. 
    It does not honor its characteristic so to make it something other than what is actually is, an agency selected by the Government to accomplish purely a governmental purpose. 
    Now, we say that the restrictive decision of the Fourth Circuit, which is in direct conflict with the Eighth Circuit, limiting the scope of the False Claims Act, we think it ignores the realities of the situation and the substance of the situation in adhering their corporate section formalism. 
    And we think it's at variance with your decision in Marcus against Hess. 
    Remember, there, you held that the statute applied, the claims against the municipality where the laws ultimately was born by the Treasury of United States.

    Mr. George Cochran Doub 
    My answer to that is this, that amendment goes far beyond what we are contending for. 
    If it -- it extended the False Claims Act to any corporation in which the United States had a stock interest. 
    Now, we're not going that far. 
    We're not contending for that, we are not contending that if the United States had a stock interest in a railroad or some other venture and there's a private capital in that venture, perhaps, a private management, courses that you wouldn't cover but that that amendment would, that amendment would apply to such corporation.

    It applies to any corporation in which the United States has a stock interest and that could be a majority stock interest or a minority stock interest or 10 shares.

    Mr. George Cochran Doub 
    Yes. 
    I don't believe that -- I don't believe that that's enough to -- to -- for you to accept, the -- the notion that the Commodity Credit Corporation, a mere shell -- within the Department of Justice is not a part of the Government of the United States, suppose it became desirable and Congress deemed it efficient and desirable for the -- for us to incorporate veterans administration or federal housing administration or perhaps the Department of Justice. 
    Functions are performed in the same way, only then to be said we are outside the Government, we've been pushed through the door, we've taken on some sort of debts of a -- of a private corporation, I think it's an emphasis upon artificial formulas and it goes beyond what I could accept. 
    So, we contend that, first, that all wholly owned government corporations fulfilling a public purpose in utilizing treasury bonds could be deemed a part of the Government of the United States or a department thereof, and this is an appropriate time at long last to override to override -- to override several decisions made when there were a few pioneered corporations created, that is United States Fleet Corporation in 1918. 
    And the Court did accept them as separate entities.

    Mr. George Cochran Doub 
    Well, Mr. Justice Brennan, I took a different position from that, in Western Union Telegraph Company against United States Fleet Corporation. 
    There, he held a wholly owned government corporation. 
    It was a department of the United States.

    Mr. George Cochran Doub 
    That was for the -- in interpreting a contract between Western Union and the United States, and the question was whether the Fleet Corporation was entitled to favorable government rates under a contract that provided it would be applicable to the Government of the United States and its departments. 
    Now, the -- the language of that contract is identical with the language in this statute by coincidence and yet you said for unanimous court, you said for unanimous court that the United States Fleet Corporation was a wholly owned government corporation and that was a department of the United States. 
    But if you don't accept that theory, you're not prepared to go that far, and to say that wholly owned government corporations, operating exclusively for a public purpose, exclusively with public funds is not -- are not part of the Government of the United States, then we ask you to hold that in any event, the Commodity Credit Corporation, merely a creature or agency within the Department of Agriculture without any independent office or directors or any office of its own, that in any event, that mere conduit to fulfill the Secretary's programs should be deemed a part of the United States and within the statute.

   Argument of A. C. Epps

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Epps.
speaker="a_c_epps" startTime="2665.348" stopTime="3031.967">
    Mr. A. C. Epps 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    I, in this case, am counsel for Cato Brothers, the two individual Cato men and Mrs. Dunn nee Stone, that's one of these three cases, they are three separate cases from three separate districts in three different States being heard. 
    I say that because a -- a portion of the argument only deals with my clients. 
    I must say that the petitioner's argument, while I find it persuasive and powerful, is addressed, I think, to the wrong form. 
    I think they could be talking to Congress and not to this topic. 
    The Hess case has been referred to and I refer to certain language of this Court in the Hess case, page 542, sound rules of statutory construction exist to discover and not direct to Congressional will. 
    The Government presses upon those strong arguments of policy against the statutory plan. 
    But the entire force of these considerations as directed solely at what the Government think Congress should have done, rather than what it did, and then finally on 547, and finally their conditions have changed since the Act was passed in 1863. 
    But the trouble with these arguments is that they are addressed to the wrong form. 
    Conditions may have changed, but the statute has not. 
    Now, I was talking about this statute and I think that that is the point. 
    Now, the Government has known about this government corporation technicality since 1938. 
    They were held against in the Southern District of New York in the Salzman Salant case, in 1938 in the Southern District of New York in the Gilchrist case. 
    They have had us on the griddle since 1948, there -- this is our 10th anniversary in this case. 
    And they haven't done anything so far as Congress is concerned. 
    We think that 20 years is time enough for the problem to go to Congress. 
    Now, they are found to argue that a functional approach or expediency, if you will, is to make a note, the Act of Congress which Mr. Justice Harlan referred to in 1918, and to change the intent of Congress in 1878 which was the last time the statute was amended. 
    This case involves, if you please, the construction of a criminal statute, 5438 of the Revised Statutes, as they'd existed in 1878 and that criminal statute, if you please, should not be extended by interpretation and in line with fundamental principles, it must define a criminal act with certainty. 
    Now, how do we get to that and why do I say that? 
    This is a case upon the case of the incorporation by reference, if you please. 
    The Government has now graciously conceded that they misquoted the statute. 
    They did so -- they -- perhaps, my purpose is very important. 
    The Revised Statutes, 3490, unchanged since 1878, if you will, is on page 2 of our brief and this doesn't say anything about the Government, it doesn't say anything about the Government, it doesn't say anything about the problem. 
    And this was the statute which they are suing us on. 
    Any person, not in the military or naval forces of the United States or in the militia called into or actively employed in the service of the United States who shall do or commit any of the acts prohibited by any of the provisions of Section 4400 and 38 Title Crimes, shall forfeit and pay to the United States the sum of $2000, and in addition, double the amount of damages which the United States may have sustained by reason of the doing or committing such acts together with the cost for suit and such forfeiture and damages shall be sued buying the same suit. 
    That is the civil statute which is unchanged. 
    And that is the incorporating statute, if you please. 
    Now, Revised Statutes 5438, which were incorporated as we have seen, define the crime, and this is a criminal statute which we say cannot be extended by interpretation and must define the crime of reasonable service. 
    As it existed in -- in 1878, that statute did not say anything about the government corporation. 
    It didn't know anything about government corporations, except the Smithsonian Institute which merely said. 
    But this is -- part of the fact that that statute has been off, it has been amended, repealed, reenacted and as Mr. Justice Harlan pointed out in 1918, they came in and included a government corporation. 
    And incidentally, it was not a partially owned government corporation because Mr. Justice Holmes in U.S. against Walter, if it please the Court, said it was such a corporation that -- that was totally owned by the Government and it had to be or else the law would have been unconstitutional, the amendment would have been unconstitutional. 
    And it specifically held that it was limited to such corporations as were instrumentalities of the United States, so I think that put such questions to rest.

    That is the case which you give maybe but -- and I would think there would be.

    Mr. A. C. Epps 
    With certain qualifications, if you please sir, a criminal statute since this is a criminal statute and that's the only thing that has been amended, must define a crime with certainty and must not be extended by interpretation. 
    Now, the case of the proprietors of the Bridge against --

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Warren.
speaker="a_c_epps" startTime="3268.713" stopTime="3552.615">
    Mr. A. C. Epps 
    That say as that when you say bridge in -- in 1790, you don't mean railroad bridge 70 years later and so it took -- there has the limitation on the point Mr. Justice Frankfurter, makes I believe. 
    Now, we say that this modern trend argument is trying to put an amendment now into this criminal statute which is not there. 
    But it was put there in 1918, put there by Congress, which meant that it wasn't covered before Congress put it there. 
    Now, one comment about our facts that I want to go into the legislative history and the judicial decisions, it was found as a matter of fact that our claims were submitted to the Commodity Credit Corporation, not the United States Government, and it was found as a matter of fact that the Government suffered no legally recoverable damages in our case. 
    With the amendments which I shall take, Mr. Justice Frankfurter, it seems highly important that we must search the meaning of Section 5438 of the Revised Statutes. 
    As it existed, or what it meant in 1878, as it has been shown to have been interpreted since that time, and we look to the legislative history and we look to judicial opinion. 
    Now, the -- this legislative history shows clearly that Congress did not intend to cover a government corporation, about 5438 in 1878 and that their cases show that they -- it didn't -- it didn't cover, it did not cover. 
    Now, it's already been pointed out that 5438 makes it a crime to present a claim against the Government of the United States, Department of the United States or any officer that govern, that's all. 
    Now, while it's true that this was 3490 should be construed broadly to protect the Treasury, still in 1918 after 5438 had gone through various amendments and become Section 35 of the Criminal Code, if you please, in 1918, Section 35 was amended by Congress to include or any corporation in which the United States of America is a stockholder, and that means as we have seen that it must be such a corporation as to be an instrumentality of the United States, not just any corporation. 
    Congress was too broad, it would have been unconstitutional if it had been that board. 
    Now, was this amendment an extension of the terms of the law or was it just a clarification? 
    We think that we can show clearly that it wasn't extension. 
    Now, the committee reports in talking of that amendment had this to say, representative guard says, the amendment served to fully reenact and reinforce the provisions of Section 35 of the Criminal Code, so that it will include all the offense heretofore contained there in, and an offense against any corporation in which the United States is a stockholder. 
    Again, when it was explained the Bill, Mr. Representative (Inaudible), said, "The only amendments to the existing laws are the extension of the penalty of this Act to false and fraudulent claims that are presented against corporations in which the United States is a stockholder," an extension if you will. 
    Once again, when the Bill was received from the Senate, Mr. (Inaudible) said, “This amendment”, and I have to quote him, “At Section 35 as amended to extend the law to false and fraudulent claims made against a corporation in which the United Stated is a stockholder. 
    Well, if they were going to extend the law to the corporations in which the United States was a stockholder, it could never applied prior to 1918."

    And in doing so, the Government tried to prosecute him for pretending to be an officer of the United States. 
    The particular words of the statute in 32 are just about identical to the words here using government or officer of department thereof. 
    And this Court said that the crime could not be proved under Section 32 of the Criminal Code and by way of passing and pointed out the extension of 35 that it was similar.

speaker="a_c_epps" startTime="3757.777" stopTime="4136.991">
    Mr. A. C. Epps 
    All right sir. 
    As I say, this man had been pretending to be or was charged with being a -- officer of the TVA. 
    Now, after he was indicted and before the case got to this Court, Congress changed Section 32 to include all any corporation in which the United States of America is a stockholder. 
    This Court, speaking to Mr. Justice Reed said, “The statute in effect at the time of the commission of the alleged defenses did not speak of pretenses of acting under authority of corporations owned or controlled by the United States.” 
    It was passed in 1884, six years later than (Inaudible). 
    It was passed in 1884 before the United States owned or controlled corporations operating hotels, boat lines of generating plants. 
    The amendments, subsequent to the occasion fixed by the indictment, extended its scope first to the Home Owners' Loan Corporation and later to all corporations owned or controlled by the United States. 
    These legislative extensions of the scope of the Act were in accord with the growing importance of the administrative corporation but a comparable judicial enlargement of a criminal act by interpretation is at war with the fundamental concept of the common law that crimes must be defined with appropriate definiteness. 
    Now, we say sir that 5438, as it existed in 1878, cannot be extended by interpretation. 
    I have already cited the Salzman and Salant and the Gilchrist cases decided in 1938, 20 years ago. 
    Now, the Rainwater case says that the Section 5438 should be liberally construed, and I think there is a little bit of confusion in that decision, because while we admit that 3490, a civil remedy must be liberally construed, 5438, the criminal section, the incorporated statute, if you please, cannot be and should not be liberally construed. 
    Now, the Hess case has been cited and rightly so, we cite the Hess case to show that you cannot say that 5438 has one meaning when it is incorporated in the civil statute and another meaning when you read it as a criminal statute. 
    Mr. Justice Black's opinion there amply shows that. 
    He says, “True, 5438 is criminal and for that reason, in interpreting so much of its language as it shares in common with 3490, we must give it careful scrutiny lest those be brought within its reach who are not clearly included.” 
    Then again, on page 542 of the opinion, he says, "This qui tam policy, allowing informers to institute civil suit under Section 3490,” which incidentally has now been written over the law, “cannot be used to detract from the meaning of the language in the criminal section and we cannot say that the same substantive language has one meaning if criminal prosecutions are brought by public officials and quite a different meaning whether same language is invoked civilly by an informant.” 
    Now, the Hess case is not the same case as our case, in the first place, the Hess case did not involve a government corporation. 
    The Hess case announces a rule of construction of Section 3490 and the informer statutes, if you please. 
    But we say, in our case, you don't have to construe it. 
    Why, because Congress itself has said what it meant when dealing with a government corporation. 
    We read the -- the legislative history, Congress said what it meant. 
    The cases have said that it did not prior to 1980, and 5438 did not reach a – this crime of a false claim against the government corporation. 
    It is interesting to note that in the opinion, in the Hess case, the Court deals with the fact that in 1863, which was the time this informer's act first started and that federal aid to states was known, it was in the minds of Congress and it dwells on that. 
    On the other hand, I point to the opinion in the Pierce case, which says in 1884, six years after our statute, the concept of the government corporation was not in the minds of Congress and it could not be. 
    Now, –-
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="4136.991" stopTime="4147.514">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Is the phrase "government department or officer thereof."

    Mr. A. C. Epps 
    That is correct sir and the instrumentality in the Walter case has shown that it was not covered because Mr. Justice Holmes says that in 1918, they included the instrumentality of the Government, that's what they did in 1918. 
    Now, I have co-counsel, I must respect that time. 
    In closing, I'd like to say that the Government is now seeking a judicial amendment to an Act of Congress and would nullify the one Act of Congress and would change the meaning of another Act of Congress, and finally that a criminal law should not be extended by implication and that a crime should be defined with appropriate definiteness. 
    Finally, we think the Government should go to another part of Washington, namely, Capitol Hill with its argument and not to this problem. 
    Thank you. 
   
   
   
   Argument of Edwin P. Gardner
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="4256.217" stopTime="4258.595">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Gardener.
speaker="edwin_p_gardner" startTime="4258.595" stopTime="4434.685">
    Mr. Edwin P. Gardner 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    I represent the McNinch portion of the case. 
    I'd like to clarify a few factual situations for the purpose of -- of dismissing the complaint, of course, we had to admit the allegation. 
    What happened actually in the McNinch case was that the McNinch people were contractors operating and repairing houses, and in turn, they finance their customers to Title 1 policies ensured by the FHA. 
    Now, the direct question we have here is whether or not an application where they actually ballooned the -- the financial resources of the applicant, who owned the house, who was getting the loans, the loans made in his name, not in McNinch's name, but then went to the bank. 
    Our sole question here, as I see it, with the exception of what Mr. Epps has put forward and I believe FHA as far as they intend one of the statute go is the same as the government corporation. 
    But the main question here is the question of whether or not the ballooning of an application for loan to be made by bank to a third party constitutes a claim within the contemplation of the statute. 
    Now, this case has been decided by United States versus Cochran, 235 F.2d 131 certiorari denied 352 U.S. 941, and also by United States versus Tieger, 234 F.2d 589, certiorari denied 352 U.S. 941. 
    The facts are the same. 
    I think, hereto, we've got to look to what Congress meant. 
    Now, two of our people were prosecuted under Section 1010 Title 18 U.S.C. 
    It appears on page 8 of the McNinch's brief. 
    Now, in the 5438, which is the False Claims statute, a criminal statute, the penalties were five years or $10,000, and that was a claim. 
    In 1010 to which two of our people plead guilty, the criminal penalty is two years or $5000. 
    Now this statute was enacted, as I understand in 1939, and deals entirely with what we have here, statements to the FHA --

    Justice William O. Douglas 
    That's one of your --
speaker="edwin_p_gardner" startTime="4436.005" stopTime="4436.381">
    Mr. Edwin P. Gardner 
    Sir?
speaker="william_o_douglas" startTime="4436.381" stopTime="4439.224">
    Justice William O. Douglas 
    It's in dispute, is it?
speaker="edwin_p_gardner" startTime="4439.224" stopTime="4721.014">
    Mr. Edwin P. Gardner 
    No sir, 1010 is not here. 
    I was trying to point out that what our people were convicted of was a lesser crime and a statute much broader in scope than the original False Claims statute and the civil count for it as is here now, 1010 deals primarily with exactly what happens and the whole essence of it says, anything that you do to influence FHA to make somebody else a loan so that it can be ensured is criminal. 
    And as was said in the -- in the Cochran case, certainly our people were properly prosecuted. 
    Well, what is said in the Cochran case, I believe, is true here. 
    What the Government is trying to do is to read into Section 538 which is now Section 231, the civil portion of the 3349, is to read into 231 that same language as is contained in 1010. 
    And that isn't possible because in order to be guilty under the Hess case, and Mr. Justice Black so stated, “In order to be guilty under the civil portion of the False Claims Act, you had to have committed the Act under the criminal act.” 
    So, actually, you have to have the same counterpart for both the civil act and the criminal act. 
    Now what our people did was an act -- criminal act under Section 1010. 
    I would assume that the Government thought that the acts that our people committed were not such that could have been -- they could have been prosecuted under the False Claims statute. 
    Certainly, Congress didn't apparently think that on this representation as concerns on influence for an FHA loans to a lending institution certainly didn't think that that fell within the False Claims statute or act they -- or else they wouldn't have enacted the Act. 
    Now, I think Mr. Hastie in Tieger hit the nail right on the head and I might -- I would like to point out here that I believe Mr. Doub said that all three of the cases are both the Third, the Fifth and the Fourth Circuit seem to think that this might have someday become a claim if there had been any loss of money by the Government. 
    I think the only reference that I can find and remember is the statement in the Tieger case where Judge Hastie said, “True, the contract, Tieger, induced might have led to what undoubtedly would be considered a claim against the United States but it never did.” 
    And he goes on further to say, “Tieger did the same McNinch did.” 
    He says, “And certainly, there is no indication that Tieger intended or even anticipated any default by the Bar and a consequent claim on the guarantor.” 
    Now, what the Government is saying here is that an application made by a third party probably prepared by McNinch, what it was -- I think what happened was McNinch knew that you had to have a certain amount of income and when he filled out these application banks, he boosted their income a little bit, the man signed it, sent it down to the bank along with the other necessary papers, the bank made him the loan and then the bank for a premium that pays FHA, sends it off to FHA and ask them to insure it. 
    Now, FHA, true, is bound if the bank acted in good faith. 
    But the bank does not have to go against the insurance, doesn't have to make this claim, most of the time, in small amount as like this, if there is a default, they prefer to collect how much security they have. 
    But the question is, can the ballooning on that application in any sense of the meaning of the statute in 1878 be a claim? 
    Cochran says it was not, Tieger says it was not, there wasn't intended to be one. 
    Certainly, it have to be within the purview of the statute --

    I -- I think Tieger had some merit there because in order to have a default, you would first have to be -- the man that ballooned it would have to know that there was a default. 
    He'd also have to or not pay it because he intended to defraud. 
    I think you have to have the intent there Mr. Justice Douglas. 
    But here, sir? 
    But here, the mere ballooning of application, certainly in my opinion, was not contemplated by Congress at the time they enacted the Civil False Claims Act. 
    And it certainly indicated that they later came along and if I would like to pull from the 1010 statute and it says the main body of it, 1010 says, and for -- or for the purpose of influencing in any way the action of such administration. 
    Now I think it's also to be noted that --
speaker="william_o_douglas" startTime="4848.216" stopTime="4852.208">
    Justice William O. Douglas 
    Well, that was in progress of the things that are present here (Voice Overlap) --
speaker="edwin_p_gardner" startTime="4852.208" stopTime="4958.400">
    Mr. Edwin P. Gardner 
    That's what it was called sir, reading it says, if I might read it to you, “Whoever, for the purpose of obtaining any loan or advance of credit from any person, partnership, association, or corporation with the intent that such loan or advance of credit shall be offered to or accepted by the Federal Housing Administration for insurance, or for the purpose of obtaining any extension or renewal of any loan, advance of credit, or mortgage insured by such administration, or the acceptance, release, or substitution of any security on such loan, advance of credit, or for the purpose of influencing, in any way the action of such administration.” 
    And then it goes to say, he will be fined $5000 or two years whereas your False Claim statute says, if you claim, then you to be are fined $10,000 or five years. 
    Certainly, Congress in enacting 1010, realized that these acts of these, our defendant, then they will properly prosecute because they did rather a false statement. 
    They were properly prosecuted but I think the Government, if they had thought this was true, it would have prosecuted on the Civil Claims Act, I think that's true because of this, they have prosecuted since 1939 numbers of cases under 1010. 
    And this is the first series of cases brought under the False Claims Civil Act as the late Judge Parker said, that they seem to have taken the little Jack Horner theory, somebody stuck his finger in the pie and come up with a plum.

    Tieger says both the legislative history and certain language of the False Claims Act point to the soundness of the construction which thus restricts the claim against the United States to this conventional meaning of demand for property or money. 
    And then the court there goes on to cite the Cohn case where it said that it is a claim for property or money. 
    And of course as Judge Hastie said, the Government has said that this is dictum and I would like to quote from what he says, he says, “Seeking to minimize the force of this construction, the Government calls it 'dictum', meaning, a parament of the construction was more restrictive than the exigencies of the case required." 
    But he goes on to say that “to an inferior court, it's been pointed out to us that it's a claim for property or money.” 
    And he thinks in, as I -- believe that such was not contemplated within the meaning of the original Act. 
    Of course, Mr. Epps has explained the history behind and of course Mr. Justice Black has pointed out in the Hess case that sound statutory interpretation of both the Acts require that they'd be considered together. 
    I might add --

    Mr. Edwin P. Gardner 
    No sir, it would not. 
    Our statute is exclusively for FHA, Mr. Justice Black, and I believe that is a strengthening part. 
    It deals with -- I believe the Government in their brief said they have thousands of these things. 
    I think that's why FHA put it in there. 
    They realized it wasn't a claim but is a deterrent. 
    I don't know under commodity whether there are any parallel criminal statutes, Mr. Justice.

    Oh, I think there is quite a distinct difference between the claims and the two, Mr. Justice Black. 
    There was money paid out in commodity, actually paid to the defendants --

    Mr. Edwin P. Gardner 
    Yes sir, a false note, that's -- that's correct. 
    In -- in the FHA proposition, the only thing that was falsified, Mr. Justice Black, was the ballooning of credit application.

    So it plainly comes under the new Act?

    Mr. Edwin P. Gardner 
    Yes the criminal act. 
    I don't think it comes under civil counterpart of the False Claims Act which we have here now. 
    And, it's then seen by three courts, Third, Fifth and Fourth Circuits. 
    I would also like to point out that as in Cochran -- I mean in Rainwater and Cato, there is a conflict on this particular point being the same in both Tieger, Cochran and McNinch here, there has been no conflict between the four. 
    Thank you.
