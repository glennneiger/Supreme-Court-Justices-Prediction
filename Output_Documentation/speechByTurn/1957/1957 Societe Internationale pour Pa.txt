    Mr. John J. Wilson 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    The complaint in this case was dismissed with prejudice by the District Court at the pre-trial stage, the failure to comply with the discovery order in a situation in which due to no cause in the part of the petitioner, the petitioner was unable to comply with the order. 
    I should like to discuss a few of the procedural facts first before I come to the principles of law which I think are controlling here. 
    This petitioner is a Swiss Holding Corporation which filed suit in 1948 under the Trading with the Enemy Act to recover most of the stock of General Aniline &amp; Film Corporation, an American Company. 
    The respondents filed answers in which they alleged that the petitioner was "enemy tainted" and did not own the property. 
    The requirements being that the petitioner was holding the property as "for IG Farben of Germany". 
    Shortly after the complaint was instituted, cross motions were filed for discovery. 
    And the Court -- the District Court required the custodian to disclose to the petitioner a quantity of some 23,000 relevant documents in its -- his possession. 
    At the same time, the respondents had moved not only for the discovery of the petitioner's own records and those of a wholly owned subsidiary but the records of a private Swiss bank known as Sturzenegger &amp; Company in Basel, Switzerland with which the petitioner had close business relations. 
    It was the position of the petitioner that its records were relevant. 
    It made no resistance to the motion for the production of its own records. 
    It resisted vigorously the request that it produced the records of the Swiss bank upon the ground that it did not have possession, custody or control of those records as required by Rule 34 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. 
    We also raised the point with the Court invoking the exercise of a benign discretion that due to the banking secrecy laws of Switzerland, it would be difficult if not impossible even should the bank voluntarily produce -- would be willing to give up the records for us to obtain them for inspection. 
    We also resisted the imposition of this discovery order as far as the Sturzenegger Bank was concerned upon the ground of an inadequate designation of the records. 
    And so it happens that this element of control, which we say was never properly resolved against us and the proper designation of the records to be produce are basic difficulties here that appointed us throughout in this whole case. 
    Judge Laws heard arguments in our position to the production of the Sturzenegger records. 
    Now, Sturzenegger who was the managing partner of this private Swiss bank is one of the principal directors of the petitioner.Now, I think that had a great influence with the district judge in imposing upon the petitioner a requirement that it produce not only its own records but the records of this private Swiss bank. 
    Now, prior to the institution of our suit, an agency of the Swiss government known as the Swiss Compensation Office had made an investigation into the national character of both Sturzenegger and the petitioner and several reports were issued in which it was determined that these companies were Swiss in character. 
    The principal reason I believe why the respondents urge the Court to include in its discovery order against us, the requirement that we produce, the records of the private Swiss bank partnership, was because this business relationship which the petitioner had with the Swiss bank was not only that of having the Swiss bank as its house bank but it also had a participation in the partnership of this bank. 
    Now, the bank was a -- had two partners and the participation of the petitioner in this case, not the Sturzenegger. 
    It was the unlimited partner, the general managing partner was a small Swiss Franc investment. 
    A corporation known as "Industry Bank," which was not a bank but a Swiss corporation, was a limited partner with a large Swiss Franc investment. 
    And the petitioner in this case had what is known as a "sleeping participation,” a thing which is unknown to Anglo-Saxon law but has its roots perhaps in German law. 
    And we have maintained throughout that it is more akin to that of an investment than it is to a sound partner or any kind of a partner. 
    Now fortunately for us, we did not have to rely upon oral testimony as to the terms of the so-called partnership agreements.There were successively three or four, they have been before the Court, they had written out great detail. 
    No one has suggestion -- suggested that they are any wise not genuine. 
    And those agreements spell out this very limited participation of the petitioner, practically no say in the management, a veto on certain kinds of unusual loans. 
    And upon the point of the ability to see the books and records of the partnership, a very unusual provision exists and that is it provides that the delegates of the respective participants, Industry Bank, the limited partner on the one hand, the petitioner with the participation on the other. 
    Their delegates could examine the books and records of the partnership but they had to keep secret in which they saw. 
    Now, a very unusual provision to the point of view of Anglo-Saxon law but one which my implication spells out something of very great importance to us, namely, that the petitioner had no control over the books and records of the bank. 
    And thus, it was unable to produce them by contract or by law or by any other arrangement in Switzerland. 
    Despite our resistance of this imposition of this order upon us for discovery, we were ordered in 1949 to produce our own records and those records and the records of the Sturzenegger Bank.We made our examination of the Government's records first. 
    The deposition of Dr. Sturzenegger which had been in progress prior to that time was resumed and completed to the extent of over 6000 pages of testimony. 
    We are now reaching the summer of 1950. 
    At this time, the gentlemen from the Department of Justice are proceeding to Switzerland for the purpose of making inspection which the Court directed. 
    Before they arrive there about the 15th of June 1950, the Swiss Federal Attorney who is the second man in command of the Justice Department of Switzerland, issued a confiscation order based upon what's called Preventive Police Power in Switzerland and referring to the Bank Secrecy laws and the Economic Espionage laws of Switzerland and expressly seizing and confiscating all the records of the Swiss bank to prevent their disclosure to the Attorney General of the United States in this case. 
    Now, respondent's counsel examined the records of the petitioner.Now, there is some contest as to whether they saw all of them but that's not in dispute in this proceeding. 
    In the fall of 1950, a motion to dismiss was filed on the ground that we had not complied with the order for discovery. 
    And in the hearing before the District Court at that time, the district -- the issue was raised as to whether the petitioner in this case had denied and conspired with the Government of Switzerland for the purpose of procuring this seizure order. 
    It was also argued that this was an illegal order. 
    It was also argued that the petitioner had done little or nothing to be relieved of the order.

    (Inaudible)
speaker="john_j_wilson" startTime="663.395" stopTime="1056.696">
    Mr. John J. Wilson 
    It was a constructive seizure only, Mr. Justice Whittaker. 
    But I think that the parties in this case have clearly dealt with the proposition as if it were an actual physical seizure.I think that this Court should regard it as the equivalent of an actual physical seizure. 
    Justice Laws -- Judge Laws referred this matter to a special Master to take testimony but then ensued a very long proceeding in the cause of which it was found that there was oddly no evidence of any conspiracy between the Swiss Government and the petitioner in this case. 
    It was found that the seizure was valid under the Preventive Police Power of Switzerland. 
    It was found that the petitioner in this case had done everything which he could be expected to do to try and have them relieved of the order. 
    And on the basis of that report, the petitioner moved for its ratification. 
    The respondents came in and filed exceptions but renewed their motion to dismiss upon the ground that even if it were found that the petitioner were in entire good faith that our inability to produce these records had disrupted the established procedures which were in effect that when a litigant comes into court, it should be prepared to make full disclosure. 
    And despite our complete inability and our innocence in the situation, the suit should be dismissed. 
    In February of 1953, Judge Laws wrote an opinion in which he had adopted that philosophy. 
    He announced however that this was a novel doctrine and that he would give the petitioner an opportunity to try to get the records. 
    And so he extended the time for approximately three months. 
    In the meantime, certain petitions have been filed with the Swiss Federal authorities in an effort to try to pry these records loose. 
    And it began to develop that if we could obtain the waivers and consents from the bank customers who in Swiss -- one of the owners of the banking secret. 
    Under the supervision of the federal government, these records might be released or some of them might be released. 
    So we pursued that course for several months in 1953 and we're able to ship over here some 63,000 records within -- sought more time because this is a very tedious process. 
    And it began to develop but not only did we need the primary records of the custom of the bank -- primary consents of the custom of the bank. 
    But if to payee of the check was involved, we call that a "secondary waiver." 
    We needed his waiver and his will. 
    So in the fall of 1953, on one of our motions to extend the time ought to be relieved upon -- of the order upon the basis of substantial compliance, the Court asked whether we could give any assurance as to whether we could then get full compliance. 
    I told the district judge that I could not give him that assurance but that I'd never given up hope and that was the opportunity to continue. 
    Strangely enough and this is a paradox in a case which is full of paradoxes that the district judge said I think from this situation in Switzerland where you lack control that you will never be able to get these records. 
    So we might as well save you this frustrating effort which you have been making for years and we have just dismissed the case finally. 
    Now, mind you if the Court please. 
    The paradox that I referred to is this element of control which Judge Laws had find -- found only prima facie to exist when he issued the order in July of 1949 and which he had defined in order to support the legality of the discovery order under Rule 34. 
    He found later on that the absence of that control was the reason why we couldn't produce and why we should be dismissed. 
    Now, as a result of that, we took an appeal to the Court of Appeals and the case was argued and submitted and decided in June of 1955. 
    It was affirmed in its entirety with the modification allowing us six months from the time that the mandate came down in which we tried to get the records. 
    Now, we intended to apply for certiorari and we stayed the mandate and did apply to this Court for certiorari.Certiorari was denied in January of 1956. 
    The six months began to run on the 24th of January 1956 and so we began again previously to -- by this waiver and consent method to get records. 
    And by June of 1956, we had produced in this country and tendered for inspection almost 200,000 banking records of the Sturzenegger Bank. 
    Now, I said earlier and I don't want to take too much time on it, our brief is clear on it, that the Court's designation was unclear. 
    There was no designation of all the records of the bank. 
    There was a designation based upon certain language in the Swiss compensation and all the reports. 
    There's a great controversy about how many records we had to produce. 
    There'd be a great controversy as to when we had made full production.I 
    can't assure this Court for 200,000 of the full production but I don't have to use any argument to submit that 200,000 are substantial compliance for the discovery order.

    Of course that's always the practical inquiry. 
    My opponents argue that quantity is not important. 
    It's quality. 
    And my answer to that is take a look at what we've given you, what we've offered you. 
    You see my opponents have never looked at these pages. 
    They have stood by with the assurance of the District Court that with this quantity of papers was now -- it's about a quarter of a million but they do not have to look at these records until every jot and tittle is produced. 
    Now, let me say that the question of production, substantial production is a secondary question in this case. 
    The constitutional question is by far, I submit, a more important question. 
    But I wanted to give you these factual details in order that you may understand what's coming in the way of this constitutional argument.

    Mr. John J. Wilson 
    I don't know. 
    Because you see, when we run into these secondary waivers and we weren't sure that the waiver of Farben for example would release all of Farben's records. 
    We think that it did 98% of it but there might be a few left there. 
    I do not wish to represent to this Court that we made a total production. 
    But I do want to represent to this Court that we made a very substantial production and that until these records are examined, we should not be kept in this position of dismissal until it is determined how serious, if it all, the omissions are. 
    Now, we have a plan if you please for the production of the balance. 
    In June, when we began to see that the six months were lapsing, we moved for more time, we reported this production. 
    By this time, we've had our Swiss associates who had certain contacts with the Swiss government and a plan was evolved whereby the Swiss government propose that a neutral investigator selected with the approval of the American court, the Swiss authorities, the Department of Justice and ourselves would go into the Sturzenegger Bank, see the balance of the records that are relevant, seek waivers of those people and in cases where they did not succeed then we might proceed by letters rogatory which would have the effect of invoking judicial assistance in the Swiss courts. 
    Now interestingly enough, the courts of the different cantons of Switzerland vary on this point but the Court of Basel where the Swiss Bank was located, would permit the invasion of banking secrecy in a court proceeding. 
    And so the scheme or plan which was proposed was one which would get us into the judicial stream in Switzerland by letters rogatory. 
    And thus, we hoped produce the remainder of the relevant Sturzenegger documents. 
    That plan was rejected by Judge Laws. 
    It was affirmed by the Court of Appeals and it was from the judgment of affirmance that we came to this Court. 
    Now by this time, we had produced as I say a quarter of a million papers. 
    The Government had made other elaborate discoveries. 
    They had taken Dr. Sturzenegger's deposition as I said or 6000 pages. 
    They had made discoveries of their own. 
    We made a tender to the Department of Justice of these records remove the judge to hold a hearing to determine if these were not substantial compliance. 
    He summarily disposed of the matter by not granting our motions. 
    Now, the Sturzenegger books are very much in the minds of the Department of Justice. 
    And there were 110 Sturzenegger books involved which were never brought over but which we tendered to them to the extent that the waivers and consents permitted inspection. 
    So on about the 3rd of August of 1956, we made a tender of these records and of the Sturzenegger books to the extent available.And we asked Judge Laws to determine that this was substantial compliance, as I say, he refused to do it. 
    He maintained the same attitude that he did before as did the gentleman from the department that it wasn't necessary for them to look at one paper until they could be assured of all of it. 
    Now, that's my factual basis which I think will be adequate for my presentation of -- of certain law points. 
    When the Court granted certiorari in this case, in its order it asks us to discuss amongst other things, the power of the Court -- to dismiss and the propriety of the dismissal under Rule 37 for failure to obey in the absence of evidence and the finding of refusal to obey. 
    Now, we find the gradual thought with the basic findings in this case. 
    Time will not permit me to discuss those but we have set forth in our brief and in the appendix to our brief why we think Judge Laws made inadequate findings and no findings at all on the original order of discovery. 
    But if there is one thing about which there is no dispute in this case, it is that we had no power to produce these records.

    Mr. John J. Wilson 
    Well, from the composite of everything that's said, Mr. Justice Black, I say without much fear of contradiction that the position of the respondent is that we did not have the physical capacity to produce these records after the seizure order if you understand.

speaker="john_j_wilson" startTime="1717.657" stopTime="1867.732">
    Mr. John J. Wilson 
    Exactly. 
    Now, there are three -- there are three points of control in this case. 
    We attack control at the original level, the factual control, the lack of contractual control. 
    We also raised the question of lack of control as a result of the seizure by the Swiss Federal Attorney. 
    That's the main element of control which I'm arguing today to this Court. 
    Now in this Special Master's findings and conclusions, he reported also that the cause of the Swiss secrecy laws which made it necessary that the customers of banks shall consent to the release of banking secrets but there was a third reason why we lack control. 
    Now, we had no -- neither the bank nor ourselves had the power to release those records without the consents of the customers. 
    Now, let me say at this point, if the Court please, that we are not invoking Swiss secrecy law here as a privilege. 
    We are well aware of the universal Anglo-Saxon doctrine that the law of the forum will determine the extent of the privilege. 
    We concede readily that there is no privilege of the United States with respect to banking secrecy. 
    And we are in no wise invoking banking secrecy as an excuse for production here. 
    Now, there's a wide difference between us on that point because the Solicitor General I'm sure will argue to the direct contrary and he will use that as a premise as he does in his brief from which a series of conclusions to the opposite of our position as argued. 
    So we say that control that that the effect of Swiss secrecy laws here was to establish a fact of lack of control just the same as if these records had been burned or hidden otherwise destroyed. 
    The Swiss secrecy laws are of only secondary importance in this case. 
    Their effect is remote. 
    They created a condition upon these records which made them physically inaccessible to us.

    Yes, sir, I certainly do.

    They use it and we use it in the -- in the Judiciary Act of 1789, possession and power. 
    And I'd like to think of control in the sense of the power to produce, the ability to produce. 
    Now, going back to your -- the Court's invitation as to what to discuss, we find that we deal with three elements here, Rule 37 which is the sanction rule for failure to comply in the discovery package of rules. 
    We find Rule 41 which is the rule for involuntary dismissal itself, the one which keeps the Court operating orderly. 
    And then we find the question of how much inherent power does the Court have. 
    Now interestingly enough, the district judge went on all three points. 
    The Court of Appeals (Inaudible) on the 37 point because the Rule 37 (b) on which he relies uses the words "refuses to obey." 
    Judge Laws walked the word refusal into the word failure. 
    The Court of Appeals could not accept that. 
    The Court of Appeals found a simple premise to their way of thinking in Rule 41 (b) where the word "failure" appears without the word "willful" or without any connotation of willfulness. 
    The Court of Appeals also invoked the inherent power of the Court. 
    My opponents in their brief seemed to have abandoned 41. 
    They gave lip service to 41. 
    They have gone back and attempted to support Judge Laws on refusal on this stupid definition that refusal means declination and declination means failure.

    Mr. John J. Wilson 
    I would think that actually Rule 41 is the dismissal rule. 
    I think 37 provide the ground rules, Mr. Justice Whittaker, for when to impose the sanctions. 
    I think the machinery for dismissal is in 41 (b). 
    Now -- then all the parties were embracing this nebulous undefined inherent power because willfulness was not written into that and it looked like this was something that was most simply dealt with. 
    Now, my answer is twofold. 
    My answer is that whether it'd be under 37, whether it'd be under 41 or whether it'd be under inherent power, there must always be the element of willfulness. 
    And if the element of will --

    Dr. Sturzenegger's refusal that that would be the (Inaudible)
speaker="john_j_wilson" startTime="2075.139" stopTime="2083.101">
    Mr. John J. Wilson 
    We -- we had an affiliation. 
    And of course the judges found prima facie that we had control over the Sturzenegger plan. 
    So I think his refusal would have been regarded as our refusal.
speaker="william_o_douglas" startTime="2083.101" stopTime="2084.650">
    Justice William O. Douglas 
    Yes, so if he stopped there that would be the end.
speaker="john_j_wilson" startTime="2084.650" stopTime="2470.723">
    Mr. John J. Wilson 
    That would have been the end of it. 
    What -- as I -- as I want to emphasize while we do not abandon our attack on the original discovery order, our main predicate here today is that the seizure order by the Swiss Federal Attorney had deprived us of control. 
    Now, when Judge Laws made his final order of decision of dismissal, he found conclusively said he that we had control over the Sturzenegger papers but for the seizure order of the Swiss Federal Attorney. 
    So he recognizes the same predicate upon which I rely here today. 
    Now, I was saying to the Court that all three of these sources of power are dependent upon willfulness. 
    If you go back to Rule 41 (b) where this -- it says "if you fail to obey an order," that's the order under which cases are dismissed for one of prosecution. 
    But certainly, if a lawyer and his client knows that a case is called -- to be called at 10 o'clock tomorrow morning. 
    On the way to the Court as tomorrow morning, they have to do an automobile accident and they end up in the hospital at 09:50. 
    And the judge dismisses the case because they're not there at 10. 
    It had passed 10 if he's told that he will vacate the dismissal. 
    The absence of the word "willfulness" from the word "fail" in Rule 41 (b) is not going to change the inherent moral requirements that there shall be some kind of deliberate action or its equivalent wanting this or something of that sort. 
    So one cannot flee from 37 to 41 to inherit power and get away from the inherent proposition here that there must be willfulness. 
    Now, I was interested in an opinion that was rendered by the Eighth Circuit in the case in which they made a quick distinction between two cases which I'm going to discuss. 
    I'm talking about the Hovey against Elliott case decided by this Court in 167 U.S. and Hammond Packing Company against Arkansas in 212 U.S. 
    Written 12 years apart by the late Chief Justice White. 
    In the Hovey case, one of the parties was ordered to pay money over to the other party which was in a semi-custodial allegiance. 
    The party willfully refused to pay the money over and the Court struck his answer from the case. 
    And this Court held that that wasn't unconstitutional deprivation of due process. 
    This Court said that that was punishment and punishment may not be imposed so as to deprive a litigant of his day in court. 
    They could have fined Elliott in Hovey against Elliott. 
    They could have sent him to jail perhaps but they could not strike his answer because that -- that deprives him in his day in court. 
    Now 12 years later in Hammond Packing Company against Arkansas, the question came up of an Arkansas antitrust statute which provided in Section 8 for discovery and which provide in Section 9 for striking the answer of the respondent if he disobeyed the discovery. 
    Hammond Packing said they thought the law was invalid and they refused to make discovery and the answer was struck and that case came to this Court. 
    And that case came to this Court on the basis of Hovey against Elliott saying that this was punishment. 
    This Court said that's not punishment. 
    This time we deal with presumptions. 
    We pass upon the merits in effect of the case. 
    We do not strike the answer. 
    The answer was not struck because of punishment. 
    The Court went on to say that a bona fide effort to comply and inability to comply would exonerate the defendant. 
    And therefore he had nothing to worry about it and the sanctions of the statute could not be imposed in that kind of a situation. 
    But if he deliberately refused then what the law does is to raise a presumption that he hasn't got a good defense, a presumption of the untruthfulness of his defense and in striking the answer under those conditions. 
    He's had his day in court. 
    It's the same as sustaining a demurrer to an -- to a declaration. 
    It's the same as sustaining a motion for a directed verdict at the end of the plaintiff's case. 
    The presumption which this Court recognized and espoused in Hammond Packing Company against Arkansas was to the effect that a man who willfully disobeys in that situation, it must be because he has it in the defense. 
    It's something like flight in a criminal case. 
    It's those reasonable inferences that can be drawn. 
    And the striking of the answer there was held not to be punishment but to be a perfectly valid disposition of that case having met the requirements of due process by having given that defendant his day in court. 
    Now, that's our situation.We stand before the bar of this Court completely innocent. 
    We have been held by the -- all the lower courts to be free from guilt in this connection. 
    It has been determined that we were in good faith, that we were incapable of producing these records and I remind the Court what I said a few moments ago, which is to the effect that when the judge finally dismissed us in this case, he did so because he said, “I might as well bring this thing to an end.” 
    You can't produce these records.

speaker="john_j_wilson" startTime="2472.238" stopTime="2815.460">
    Mr. John J. Wilson 
    I'm coming to that. 
    That case by the way is cited in the margin in National Union against Arnold with this Court which I wanted to discuss next before I sit down. 
    I want to save a few moments of my time, Mr. Chief Justice if I may for rebuttal. 
    The case is Peitzman against City of Illmo, 141 F.2d 956. 
    It's cited by this Court in the majority opinion in the -- in the National Union case. 
    Now, the -- the Court in that case reached the right result and I'm a little unfair in cutting them off at one sentence. 
    But I do want to read the one sentence to -- to demonstrate my point. 
    The Court said defendants urge that the order in fact punishes them for a contempt of court but there's a distinction between striking a pleading as punishment for a contempt of court and striking it for violation of a rule of procedure. 
    Now, that's hardly a full disposition of this problem. 
    It isn't whether it's a rule of the procedure which did it. 
    It's not whether a statute authorized the striking. 
    It's whether the circumstances under which the pleading has struck is such that the party has had his due process, has had his day in court before that occurred. 
    Now, National Union against Arnold in 254 U.S. written by Mr. Justice Burton as I remember is cited by our opponents for the proposition of the inherent power of the Court. 
    I welcome the arrival of National Union against Arnold. 
    I think it speaks more eloquently than I could ever begin to speak in support of the reasons why dismissal was improper in this case. 
    In National Union against Arnold, a defendant had a verdict against him and a judgment against him for several hundred thousand dollars. 
    He took an appeal without a supersedeas. 
    And during the appeal, there was a supplemental proceeding which located certain assets. 
    He was ordered to turn those assets over to the winning party. 
    He refused to do so. 
    The appeal was struck. 
    And the question came to this Court on the basis of Hovey against Elliot that that was the punishment and the punishment was a deprivation of due process. 
    Now, this Court -- and the Court was divided upon it. 
    There was a dissenting opinion by Mr. Justice Black and per curiam by Mr. Justice Douglas. 
    On the main point, once you've got over the main point, the other points were easy as they point. 
    The main point was, is the right of an appeal part of the due process package.And the majority of this Court held that it wasn't. 
    So you brushed aside and probably brushed aside Hovey against Elliot as not being of value in that case because due process was not involved. 
    The man you said had had his day in court but the other facts of the case are equally eloquent. 
    In the Arnold case, there was willfulness of the grossest character. 
    In our case, we have no willfulness at all. 
    In the Arnold case, not only were you satisfied about the day in court but you said, “We do not think that this is the imposition of punishment for a criminal contempt but only a coercive measure to enforce the judgment.” 
    Now, take those words and try to apply it into the case at bar and not one of them thinks. 
    The District Court in this case said you can't comply. 
    Therefore, dismissal was not for coercive purposes. 
    It has been the feeling of both courts that we -- below that we couldn't comply. 
    The result is that you end up very squarely with the imposition of punishment on the Hovey against Elliot. 
    And that's what we are suffering here. 
    We haven't had our day in court, our day in court on the issue over whether or not this possession of control is not the question I'm arguing. 
    Our day in court as to whether there was a lawful vesting in this case of this property. 
    Why the very bottom of the Trading with the Enemy Act, the very basis for the Trading with the Enemy Act is that one who says that he is not an enemy shall have his day in court to litigate the validity of the seizure. 
    There was no administrative hearing in this case. 
    There was an ex parte determination that this vesting should take place. 
    And for 10 years now while we've been accused a very kind of effort and delay which I deny in every sense of the word. 
    I will reply to my very worthy opponents for whom I have great respect. 
    But 10 years, every effort has been made to deprive the judiciary of an opportunity to look into the merits of this seizure.

    Mr. J. Lee Rankin 
    Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    Before going further, I'd like to call the attention of the Court to the fact that the interveners involved in the Kaufman case are expressly not covered by this order that is Judge Laws expressly provided that this order of dismissal would not affect the interveners who are not in custody or control of these records. 
    Secondly, I think that we need some more facts in order to be able to examine the problems in this case. 
    We start off with the proposition first that there is no question, there is no debate about the proposition that these concerns were with -- were controlled by Germans, by I.G. Farben up to 1940. 
    There is no issue between us on that. 
    It's clear the record is without dispute.

    You mean by these findings, Mr. Solicitor, both the Petitioner and the Swiss Bank?
speaker="j_lee_rankin" startTime="2893.057" stopTime="3019.523">
    Mr. J. Lee Rankin 
    The -- the control in the -- is in -- is combined as to the Swiss Bank and Chemie, the petitioner, and Sturzenegger. 
    And Sturzenegger appears over with his predecessor, Greutert, who also was the manager of the bank before he died. 
    As one of the directors of the petitioner, Chemie, and then there was Gadow, who was the director of the petitioner, Chemie. 
    And Gadow was the brother-in-law of Hermann Schmitz, the Chairman of the Board of I.G. Farben. 
    And the set up was that Gadow or Sturzenegger and one other signature, either Gadow and Sturzenegger together or Greutert, his predecessor or Sturzenegger and one of his clerks could always bind the petitioner as to any action on behalf of the petitioner. 
    Now until 1936, this bank which was just a small private bank only had 50 to 100 customers. 
    And all of these customers, mind you, all of them were I.G. Farben connected. 
    They were either I.G. Farben or they were connected with I.G. Farben. 
    So I want you to see the picture here of the interlocking of this private bank that's used in all of these transactions. 
    And the petitioner and why these courts in examining this matter over a period of almost 10 years now saw fit to say that you can't come into court in this country and try out this case without producing all of the records that will show the enemy taint that appears in this picture.

    No, I got -- Mr. Justice Harlan, we got findings that they were not in bad faith in collaborating or acting with the Swiss to hold the papers back. 
    What I want to point out to the Court and have you understand is that the whole plan of this program, this conspiracy of cloaking that's involved in this case was to first use this private bank and have the benefit of these secrecy laws and not have to develop or present the records because of these laws.

    And it is though they put themselves in a deliberate position of using these laws in their business and now claiming that the laws keep them from supplying the facts in this case.

    And therefore, there cannot be a fair trial of this case without that production and since it's apparent that they're not going to produce from their failure for this long term of years, after a number of extensions.

    These documents, physical documents in the possession of the Swiss Bank had been destroyed, had been physically made non-existence by somebody for reasons of its own, some official of the bank wanted to cover up their falsification and whatnot. 
    But it's all in there that he would have to concede the present petitioner had no relation or whatever not to the remote to the unavailability, the physical unavailability of the documents. 
    But it is a fact that they did utilize in the way which was indicated this fact as a means of doing this interlocking cover up business. 
    Would you say there that what before their fact of having done business with the bank is not -- that it wouldn't be there and therefore they wouldn't have been destroyed?

    Even -- the record even shows that back in 1937, the German government inquired in regard to some of the transactions of Farben with this bank and Farben directed Greutert, the manager of the bank on how to answer their letter and say that Swiss secrecy laws will not permit the disclosure of such information.

    But the difficulty we have in this case is that they didn't run their transactions in 1936 as I've told you. 
    They got Chemie out of being just a desk drawer transaction in the private bank. 
    From that time on, they moved it into another street backing up to the private bank so they could go backdoor to backdoor.

    Mr. J. Lee Rankin 
    Yes, the -- the record is even beyond that. 
    It has discussions in which Farben tells the Finance Ministry of Germany exactly the kind of plan that they want to follow about cloaking some of these transactions, about helping to build up the German armament program under -- with the Norsk Hydro in light metals in Norway after they occupied Norway, how they used Paris' concern that -- that this petitioner had in occupied France to transact business of Farben. 
    And Farben managed it all the time. 
    These records replete with that and it shows that Sturzenegger cloaked transactions in various countries that he suggested one of his associates to cloak for South American transactions that they cloak for India, Britain, Australia and England and they even had a transaction in Holland where they had a cloaking and where they operated in occupied territory. 
    All of those things are indications of enemy taint. 
    Now beyond that, all of these various transactions, they were bear shares up to 1945 and they will run through this bank even when Chemie after 36 when it was fully established. 
    They didn't run these transactions in regard to the stock through Chemie. 
    Beyond on their books, they're in the bank's books according to the -- the Swiss Compensation Office.

    Can you conclude -- there's no answer to say that the findings of present inability because of the Swiss law to produce these papers instantly when by design preceding in an -- and possible anticipation with this very situation.

speaker="j_lee_rankin" startTime="4584.246" stopTime="4754.414">
    Mr. J. Lee Rankin 
    We have the additional factor in the case that they come with their claim in 1940 to the Treasury in which they asked to have certain of the stocks sent over to them and recognize their ownership, the Treasury in the United States. 
    And they attached to that claim a large number of papers including about half of them in which they are papers of the bank to support their claim before this Government asking for a certain prop, the recognition of their ownership of certain shares. 
    Now, when they file their administrative claim in this case, there are some 40 different papers that they file and better than a half of those are papers, purported copies of papers with this very bank, joint transactions in order to make their chain of title. 
    Then when they -- they present their claim to the Allied Military authorities in -- in Berlin to try to get back the title to their stock and lender bank, the Farben House Bank, there that was taken over by the Government when we occupied Germany. 
    They put about -- they put some 50 papers there and involved 17 different people there in transaction with this very bank in support of that claim. 
    Then when they -- Sturzenegger testifies before the -- in his deposition, he proceeds to say that he will waive on behalf of some 75 different persons, any claim of secrecy in connection with that. 
    Then he backs up on that waiver and says that he doesn't want to agree to that after he goes along with his deposition for a while. 
    And he asserts later during the deposition that the secrecy laws prohibited even answering questions. 
    And we take that to the Court and Judge Bailey held that that was no excuse that he had to answer the questions so that we find that as a matter of fact whenever they can use the Swiss secrecy laws for their benefit, they seemed to be no handicap at all. 
    They can produce the papers for their claim. 
    They can produce them for the Treasury. 
    They can produce them for the Allied Military authorities. 
    But when we need them to trace out step by state -- step, the ownership of the stock and the enemy taint that's replete in this record of cloaking of all kinds, we can't have them.

    Mr. J. Lee Rankin 
    Yes -- no, the order -- there had been an order by the federal attorney that the -- the records could not be delivered up and that was not a physical taking but it was an order that the federal attorney had made and the Court recognized that these nationals were bound by it by his finding but if the hearing was limited to that. 
    Now, what all was done in regard to how they set up this whole matter and that they were planning to use this very device was so apparent in the record. 
    There was -- it didn't appear there'd be any reason for a hearing in regard to that. 
    The -- they've -- even after they got the petitioner established as a holding company in 1936, they continued to run every single stock transaction through this private bank and the only possible purpose, the only inference you can possibly draw from it is that they want to have this covered. 
    And of course it's revealed by their own letters to their Finance Ministry when they say they hardly want to cloak all these various transactions. 
    So it's -- it's very apparent that there are all kinds of enemy taint that appears in these records that have been produced. 
    We can't trace out the ownership of the stock but there's no question that went up to 1940. 
    It was Germany and that's clearly established. 
    Then the question is what happened between 1940, in April of 1942 when the investment took place. 
    How in the world did it get to be? 
    This is $100 million we're talking about. 
    How did it become Swiss all of a sudden after it was German until 1940? 
    And then we have --

    Well, it seems that the record is so clear on this point because here is the lender bank, that's one -- the private bank of Farben in Berlin. 
    Now -- and so part of the scheme, they put 64% of that bank in this Swiss banking concern. 
    Now, certainly this -- anybody that's working with this case, any court has got a right to assume there's plenty of banking arrangements available in Germany for Farben to use without having to go into the Swiss bank and a private bank that only has Farben people in it at that. 
    But in addition to it, they had their own house bank, this lender bank, which they ran through a lot of transactions. 
    And also this record shows that they instructed all the remittances to be sent through this bank and not even have a sign on it that they had any connection with Farben. 
    That's clear in this record that they gave it, it's an expressed instruction to everybody that remitted one cent to them during the war period that they shouldn't even indicate who had -- that Farben had any ownership whatsoever. 
    Now, why in the world would they do that if they weren't trying to hide and keep secret exactly what they were doing the -- for the purposes of their currency, taxation and all the rest? 
    And then they tell this banker just how to answer the question when their own government inquires.

    Mr. -- Mr. Solicitor, the risk of redundancy and I can bring together the questions of Justice Black and Justice Harlan and my own because I think this is so far as I'm concerned, part of the whole problem.

    You say and I can understand that argument well. 
    This is a dispute between Swiss nationals and the American government, interest of the United States that are being pursued in a litigation in the United States necessary for the fair determination of that litigation of some documents located in Switzerland. 
    As to those documents, the Swiss Government consulting its own national policy and says, "We won't allow you to produce it," and you say that's too bad. 
    You have to choose between the interest of the United States and (Inaudible). 
    And the Swiss national will also be entitled to due process in the United States that these documents are essential and this Government for his own interest refuses to give him that support to vindicate his interest and this Government, the judiciary of the United States has a right to say in the interest of fair administration of justice gives (Inaudible).

    Two, because you're the plaintiff, efforts were made in good faith as where the plaintiff made the effort which a reasonable man was made to decide and to choose effective compliance that this Court ordered.

    Well, I'm not -- I'm trying to adhere to the line, Mr. Justice Harlan that we don't -- we think the findings are against us on the proposition that there was any collusion that -- that they produced this federal attorney's order. 
    Well, we do think the record is replete with a showing that that -- the whole plan was to use this private bank and the secrecy that could be obtained not only for this purpose which they were smart enough to anticipate too as this record shows but also for the day by day benefits. 
    I'll show you how it worked instead of running it through the regular bank accounts. 
    They also ran it through what they called "custodian accounts" or sort of joint venture accounts in which they wouldn't even have to set that up on the bank records when they made their public statements about the assets and the liabilities of the bank. 
    And then they would run these various -- these items through the account in that manner and they wouldn't have to account to the petitioner's stockholders for the earnings on those items. 
    So that they held those -- those amounts in those special custodian accounts and the record, there's no dispute about this that they would keep that amount never account to their stockholders until they were short on earnings otherwise and then they would pull it out of the special account and pay a dividend out of it so that they got out of accounting to their stockholders, accounting to the tax authorities, accounting to the public generally for -- in regard to the bank statement and whatever obligation they would have to German authorities and its currency control. 
    All of those things they got out by using this bank, this device instead of running it through the ordinary way.

    Am I wrong in that?
speaker="j_lee_rankin" startTime="5891.757" stopTime="6012.646">
    Mr. J. Lee Rankin 
    Well, I think that the Government would not want to claim that it had the record to trace out that there was no change in ownership that ever occurred before this got over to be a Swiss in these papers. 
    And I don't think that a court would want to hold in this case without examination of these other records that the claim of these -- that the petitioner that it -- that the Swiss own the stock now would be determined on this record as it is because there's no question about the German ownership up to 1940. 
    The Swiss Compensation Office report would indicate that as much as $100 million of Farben money ran through this bank at various times and whether or not how it ever got over to be Swiss is only explained by a very short statement in the report in which they indicate that this -- a large sum of money about $130 million francs was made by the Swiss by using Farben assets and getting special tips on what investments to make and so forth. 
    And that's all there is and they don't break it down to show how the transactions were or anything about it. 
    Now, I would think that any court would hesitate on this record alone to decide that the claim of the Swiss that they did somehow get to own the stock was untrue without these records in which they say it's clear from this record, these various transactions --
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="6012.646" stopTime="6019.587">

speaker="j_lee_rankin" startTime="6048.800" stopTime="6244.329">
    Mr. J. Lee Rankin 
    Well, let me tell you what happened to us when we got -- when we got the petitioner's records. 
    We found that he -- they manufactured their books and they had -- they had record books that clearly showed that when they had the originals they had 13 journals and it showed references back and forth. 
    It's all set out in the record. 
    The ones they gave us were only 11 books. 
    And on the cover page, the inside cover page of each one of these journals, it says the date -- that the stationer delivered the book to the petitioner and the date of the delivery is anywhere from one month to 22 months after the dates of the entries inside. 
    Then when they delivered the other papers to us there are over 9000 we were able to check on, but they didn't deliver it all. 
    They came up later with some 5000 additional. 
    Now, you -- in this kind of a matter where you're trying to run out cloaking transactions, you're trying to run out items of investment in stocks and bonds over a long period of time from at least 1936 and it goes back at least 1931 on. 
    You could take any item down the line. 
    They even talked about giving us book and they'll blank out the lines they can't get consent to. 
    And if I could do that in any kind of a case and just blank out the lines where the transaction ran back the other way could be absolutely meaningless. 
    You just can't run out of cloaking transaction in that manner. 
    Now, they suggest to us that we should -- the other thing they suggest is that we have a -- a person that's appointed by the Swiss Government sworn to assist the Swiss secrecy law.He's going to abide by that. 
    He's going to examine these records and then he's going to determine relevancy. 
    Now, just think what that means to American Court. 
    Here's a man, a Swiss, he's going to determine relevancy for an American Court. 
    And If I could determine relevancy, I don't think the judicial function would amount too much for the Court but he is going to decide that. 
    And then we're going to try according to plan. 
    We'll go into the Court and see if by letters rogatory we can force them to give these up in spite of the Swiss laws and we'll see how many we get and then we run down the various transactions. 
    And of course, if anybody is going to give us manufactured books because there isn't any question for what we have here, we're not going to get the key transactions that tell what they did in the cloaking. 
    And that's the reason we haven't got these books and did it -- this isn't -- all these just happened in six months ago.This is going on for practically 10 years. 
    And if they could afford to let us see these books in every piece of paper and it would sustain their claim, they've been here long ago. 
    There's $100 million involved.

    It seems to me like a practical matter on the subject of what you are arguing with this. 
    The Government believes this is enemy tainted. 
    They can't prove it without these papers that they should not be allowed to speak though or should be allowed to get a judgment against it because they have (Inaudible) of the Government in placing the papers beyond the control of the Government. 
    And if that can prove it, that is kind of a separate and distinct cause of action from your (Inaudible) one that should be litigated before you should have a judgment rather than have it dismissed on (Inaudible).

    Mr. J. Lee Rankin 
    Well, the difficulty is that the discovery rules, the whole concept of our trial procedure under discovery rules is to try to get at the facts and the truth. 
    And the reason for allowing discovery in advance of trial is to try to search out what the real issues are and the facts are so that you can prepare for trial. 
    Now, we --

    That is the point here where you've had their papers and they say we can't produce it. 
    You have no way to get it. 
    You say that there's evidence in the record from which somebody could find if they look at it that it is because of a fraud they're perpetrating on the Government and that they have placed this all into a special situation to disable the Government from proving its case.

    Well, we also say that if they're perfectly innocent that the Swiss law of secrecy is contrary to the law of the United States, they have to -- they have come into this forum to sue. 
    They're coming affirmatively here. 
    Therefore, they have to comply with the law of the forum in regard to procedure and the law that forum is that you make discovery not only that you have a trial on the merits but before you get to that point you've got to let the other fellow have the record so he can prepare for trial.

    Mr. John J. Wilson 
    May I dispose of a question of Mr. Justice Brennan of the implications of it. 
    The petitioner here has gotten no paper from the Sturzenegger Bank after the seizure order. 
    Is that -- I want the Court to understand that beyond any question. 
    The suggestion that the petitioner can get records when it chooses and must be divided -- I don't concede it but at least the point must be divided chronologically.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="6646.296" stopTime="6650.722">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Well, now you say no paper. 
    I thought you told us there were 200,000 pieces of paper that's given.
speaker="john_j_wilson" startTime="6650.722" stopTime="6699.187">
    Mr. John J. Wilson 
    Through the waiver system. 
    But the suggestion of the Solicitor General that the petitioner can always get the documents from the bank that it wants in its own favor but can't get these for performance of this discovery order. 
    I want to clear up immediately the proposition that we have gotten no document except by the waiver procedure since the Swiss Federal Attorney levied his confiscation order in 1950. 
    Now with respect to documents that we've gotten earlier than that, they were principally documents which had to do with our own business and us getting them from the bank was naturally in effect a waiver of consent by ourselves of the Swiss secrecy.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="6699.187" stopTime="6702.894">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    What about the books that seemed to have been printed after the entry?
speaker="john_j_wilson" startTime="6702.894" stopTime="7152.469">
    Mr. John J. Wilson 
    Yes, I -- I want to take those up in -- in several sequences. 
    I wouldn't want to miss commenting upon that for the world, Mr. Justice Brennan. 
    If you'll let me come to it in my regular order, I'll promise to do it before my time is up. 
    My greatly respected friend here, the Solicitor General, has naturally had to absorb a very large record in a very short time. 
    And I mean no reflection upon him when I criticize some of his allusions to the record. 
    I do not have to remind the Court there's been no trial here. 
    I do not have to remind the Court that there's been no findings of enemy taint. 
    But I would like to remind the Court that I disagree with many of the factual statements that the Solicitor General had said. 
    And believe me when I say it. 
    I suggest nothing but pressure time it is (Inaudible).He speaks about the communications from the Farben to the Financial Ministry of Germany as evidence in this case. 
    I want to remind the Court that the reason that's in this record is that when Sturzenegger was on the stand, he was showing one of those documents which our Government had gotten out of Germany after the fall of Germany. 
    And he was asked if he could identify it and he said that he couldn't. 
    And I say to the Court that there is printed in this record literally hundreds of pieces of materials that are no proof of anything in this case, that have not been offered in evidence, that have not even been identified by the witness who was shown here. 
    And I've given you some examples of it at the bottom of page 7 in foot -- 7 (a) of our appendix of a footnote to our brief. 
    Now in the Appendix of 7 (a), I could stand here for hours if the time permitted and the Court permitted to demonstrate that most of what the Solicitor General has offered here as enemy taint has not been established. 
    Why I was -- I was astounded to hear him say that our client was German up to 1940. 
    There isn't a word of truth in support of that statement. 
    The only event that happened in 1940 was that there was a cancellation of a contractual relationship between Farben and the plaintiff having to deal with reciprocal rights. 
    Farben had an option to acquire the investments of Chemie in exchange for which Chemie was guaranteed by Chemie's stockholders, they are guaranteed by Chemie, the same dividend rate as Farben was. 
    But it was not the question of Chemie being German until 1940. 
    I don't deny for one moment that the inception of Chemie in this case was largely German. 
    What the admitted evidence in this case and by that I mean the deposition, the credible depositions that are not in dispute show the evolution of the Swiss. 
    And then as the years went by, they began to throw off this German (Inaudible). 
    And long before 1940, this corporation seized to be controlled by the Germans. 
    And the single event that occurred in 1940, which the Solicitor General points to as a date when they seized to be German was only this dividend guarantee contract that I spoke to you about. 
    About the books, the duplicate set of books, Mr. Justice Brennan, about the 9000 missing records that issue is yet unresolved. 
    What happened was this. 
    With the Justice Department took the position that the plaintiff had failed to produce these proper books and some 9000 documents. 
    They didn't move to dismiss which always surprised me. 
    I never knew -- I wonder why they didn't at that time move to strike this down for some kind of a simple act. 
    They moved for a second discovery order against Interhandel, Chemie, the petitioner. 
    And at that time, we were fighting over whether this was a duplicate set of books and we were fighting over whether there were 9000 documents missing when Judge Laws issued his decision of February 19, 1923. 
    At that point, I moved that we stay everything until we get through this main battle. 
    Now, we've never gotten back on that fight. 
    We don't concede there's any duplicate set of books here. 
    With regard to the 9000 records that we -- that is claimed that we withheld, we went back and looked again. 
    Mind you, if the Court please, we produced 41,000 documents, 70,000 microfilms were taken of our client's records. 
    Isn't there a margin for error there that's possible that it won't be denominated bad faith of crookedness? 
    We went back when we said that we had given them 9000 documents and we began to dig. 
    And what did we find? 
    We found that other 9000, some 5000 were second and third and fourth carbons of documents of which they've gotten the first carbon already. 
    And we were in the middle of explaining the absence of the other 4000, some of which we were producing piecemeal when that proceeding was stopped. 
    I submit the Solicitor General has no right to mention that matter to this Court. 
    That matter is in the lap of the District Court for decision. 
    Now, if I have several moments later -- left, I would like to return to the observations of Mr. Justice Frankfurter when he posed two complementary observations. 
    One was with respect to the national being responsible for the conduct of its nation. 
    That's -- that problem is -- that question is in this case. 
    I wouldn't be fair with the Court if I didn't face up to its existence. 
    What we have on the one hand, no charge that the Government of Switzerland has acted in bad faith. 
    And we have on the other hand, no proof that the petitioner has acted in bad faith. 
    And we've searched the authorities and I'm sure that our respondent's have searched the authorities. 
    And there isn't a case that we found in the books wherein peacetime. 
    In the course of Anglo-Saxon jurisprudence, a national in a transaction of this sort would be responsible for the conduct of its nation.

    The Victoria, if the Court please, is a very simple case in which there was not even a discovery order. 
    The -- in the -- in the Kronprinzessin Victoria, one of the British prize cases, in that case, the claimant to the cargo has leave to produce and be given time and he was given time and he didn't produce. 
    And the case was decided on the merits because of the absence of the evidence. 
    The case is simply easily distinguishable --

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    There were for those -- there were very important observations by Lord Sumner about the -- the difficulties of Swiss -- Swedish law not allowing the production of those documents which might have sustained the case of the claimant against the captain.

    Mr. John J. Wilson 
    Yes, sir. 
    There's no doubt about it and I -- I'm -- I'm glad, Your Honor, brought up the British cases. 
    I hope the Court will bear with me a moment or two that I may discuss it. 
    I think that one of the British cases is extremely troublesome to us. 
    It is not the Kronprinzessin Victoria, it's the Antilla. 
    The Antilla -- and I think we misstated our position in our brief on the Antilla. 
    I think the Antilla was decided not on the merits because we argued in our brief that all the British prize cases despite the fact that the claim was struck. 
    The Court went on and decided on the merits.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="7255.348" stopTime="7270.864">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    There is that difference.

    Mr. John J. Wilson 
    In every one of the British prize cases including the Kronprinzessin Victoria, including the Antilla, including the Stjernblad, including the Margareta and all of those cases, they did not have the factual problem -- questions they have here. 
    The Swede and every one of those cases had possession of his own records. 
    He declined to produce them because he was afraid of the Swedish War Trade Law. 
    That was the imposition of the foreign privilege. 
    That is now the problem here.We have lost possession. 
    Also Mr. Justice Frankfurter, I want to remind you that the British cases on Prize were not troubled with due process one bit. 
    And yesterday morning, I was troubled about the Antilla. 
    I thought we had overstated our position in our brief in the Antilla and we discovered strangely enough, another citation to Antilla that was not called to the Court's attention by either side. 
    The Antilla went to the -- went to the -- to the Privy Council and it will be found in 1919 A.C. at 250.

    Mr. John J. Wilson 
    1919, Appeals Cases 250, October 15, 1918 and that case, clarified somebody's thinking on my part as to whether the Antilla was decided on the merits or not. 
    I don't concede any defeat, if the Court please, as a result of this discovery because I still say the British prize cases do not hurt us for several reasons. 
    What I do want to remind the Court when you do read the Appeals Case in 1919, you will find the Privy Council said there was first of all the step taken by the Court of punitively striking out the claim. 
    Now, if anybody says in this case that we maybe punitively struck out then Hovey against Elliot raises its hand in opposition to that. 
    And we are suffering the loss of due process. 
    Thank you.
