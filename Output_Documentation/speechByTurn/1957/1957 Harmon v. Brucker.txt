    Mr. Shapiro, you may continue.
speaker="david_i_shapiro" startTime="9.355" stopTime="111.579">
    Mr. David I. Shapiro 
    Thank you, Your Honor. 
    May it please the Court. 
    Two questions were asked to me yesterday by members of the Court which I think either, one I was unable to answer or two which I don't feel that I have answered adequately. 
    And I'd like to address myself first before continuing with my argument to those questions. 
    The first one was the question of Mr. Justice Black as to whether or not the Uniform Code of Military Justice contained a provision similar to the one with respect to conduct on becoming an officer or a gentleman for enlisted personnel. 
    There is such an article in the Uniform Code of Military Justice, it's the general article, Article 134. 
    So it seems and as a matter of fact, the case is so whole that an individual who commits a crime while he is a soldier and he gets in trouble with the civilian authorities would be subject to the court-martial jurisdiction under Article 134 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice. 
    Equally true is the situation where the enlisted man writes scandalous letters to his commanding officer's wife. 
    That too would come under Article 134 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice. 
    So we see that in every --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="111.579" stopTime="119.008">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Is that because -- is that because the commanding officer's wife that he wrote to some civilian outside, would that make a difference?
speaker="david_i_shapiro" startTime="119.008" stopTime="131.160">
    Mr. David I. Shapiro 
    I think it would not make any difference at all, Your Honor. 
    I think it would have any scandalous conduct which would reflect adversely on the Army would come within the provisions of Article 134.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="131.160" stopTime="135.001">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Writing a private letter isn't a scandalous conduct in the ordinary sense, isn't it?
speaker="david_i_shapiro" startTime="135.001" stopTime="137.377">
    Mr. David I. Shapiro 
    No, sir. 
    I don't think that it would be at all.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="137.377" stopTime="143.184">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    But if you have to -- he couldn't -- if he wrote a letter, private letters like that, they can't do anything about that.
speaker="david_i_shapiro" startTime="143.184" stopTime="146.335">
    Mr. David I. Shapiro 
    I don't think that they could with – under Article 134.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="146.335" stopTime="152.471">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    I'm not suggesting they couldn't court -- they could court-martial, but they couldn't take note of the fact he is that kind of a person.
speaker="david_i_shapiro" startTime="152.471" stopTime="154.449">
    Mr. David I. Shapiro 
    I agree with you, sir, on that.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="154.449" stopTime="155.933">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Well, what do you agree with?
speaker="david_i_shapiro" startTime="155.933" stopTime="158.672">
    Mr. David I. Shapiro 
    I agree that I don't think they could take notice that he was that kind of a person.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="158.672" stopTime="160.821">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    What is that? 
    They could not.
speaker="david_i_shapiro" startTime="160.821" stopTime="161.190">
    Mr. David I. Shapiro 
    No, sir, I don't --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="161.190" stopTime="162.869">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    All right.
speaker="david_i_shapiro" startTime="162.869" stopTime="170.011">
    Mr. David I. Shapiro 
    Now, I think from the answer to this question, it now becomes clear that army regulation seeks --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="170.011" stopTime="173.413">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    You mean they couldn't discharge him?
speaker="david_i_shapiro" startTime="173.413" stopTime="183.285">
    Mr. David I. Shapiro 
    No, sir. 
    They couldn't discharge him if he wrote such kind of letters. 
    I mean they could discharge him for any reason that they wanted but the question here is --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="183.285" stopTime="188.720">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Well, I'm not reaching the question here. 
    I just want to know what the -- what the powers are not what the question --
speaker="david_i_shapiro" startTime="188.720" stopTime="191.106">
    Mr. David I. Shapiro 
    Well, I think the Army can discharge an individual for any reason it sees fit.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="191.106" stopTime="192.770">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Just because they don't like his face.
speaker="david_i_shapiro" startTime="192.770" stopTime="196.726">
    Mr. David I. Shapiro 
    Yes, sir. 
    If they don't like his face, they can discharge him.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="196.726" stopTime="211.087">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    But if they discharge him because he wrote a systematically scandalous letter to private people, they could not -- they -- you said they could discharge him but they couldn't make public that fact.
speaker="david_i_shapiro" startTime="211.087" stopTime="225.679">
    Mr. David I. Shapiro 
    Well, I think -- well, I think the answer to that question would be that they could discharge him and they could not make public that fact. 
    Now, I think we can see then that --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="225.679" stopTime="227.840">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    They ought to give him an honorable discharge?
speaker="david_i_shapiro" startTime="227.840" stopTime="382.852">
    Mr. David I. Shapiro 
    I would think so, Your Honor, yes. 
    Now, with respect to Army Regulation 615-360, we now see that unless the man has been subject to a general court-martial, unless he has been subject to more than one special court-martial, and if he has ratings of excellent as to character and ratings of excellent as to efficiency, he must receive under 615-360 an honorable discharge with of course the exceptions spelled out in the Army security risk regulation as set up and established by Department of Defense directive 5210.9, which we are challenging here. 
    The second question which I would like to address myself to is the one asked to me yesterday by Mr. Justice Frankfurter. 
    And that question was whether or not our position in this case could be analogized to the situation of an individual who had been fired from government civilian employment. 
    And the question I think was whether or not it was our position that the Secretary of the Army could not make a public statement saying why the individual had been discharged. 
    I would agree with that position but that's not this case. 
    An army discharge certificate is not a notification of personnel action which terminates a federal civilian employee from his job. 
    An army discharge certificate, that is an honorable discharge certificate, is much more than that. 
    Not only does it record the fact of the separation of service but it is in the words of this court, a formal final judgment by the Government on the military record of the soldier. 
    And from that document comes certain very valuable rights, community respect and honor are established by it, and those rights are conclusive, property rights, rights for example to various benefits provided by the state, provided by the Federal Government, flow from that document. 
    And a certain kind of personal honor, a personal status of community respect and honor are inherent within the document itself. 
    And I think --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="382.852" stopTime="385.169">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    When you say inherent you mean that --
speaker="david_i_shapiro" startTime="385.169" stopTime="386.530">
    Mr. David I. Shapiro 
    Inherent in the honorable discharge.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="386.530" stopTime="391.994">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    What you mean is that an honorable discharge carries certain representations to the public, is that it?
speaker="david_i_shapiro" startTime="391.994" stopTime="392.937">
    Mr. David I. Shapiro 
    Yes, sir. 
    With respect --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="392.937" stopTime="396.290">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Now, what are those representations?
speaker="david_i_shapiro" startTime="396.290" stopTime="409.940">
    Mr. David I. Shapiro 
    Those representations are as follows. 
    That during the time the individual was in the service, he comported himself honorably and he left the service in a status of honor.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="409.940" stopTime="420.412">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    How about the case you put earlier? 
    writing a lot of scandalous -- obscene letters to people.
speaker="david_i_shapiro" startTime="420.412" stopTime="420.502">
    Mr. David I. Shapiro 
    I would say --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="420.502" stopTime="426.793">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Do you say that that has nothing to do with his carrying a sword and shooting and polishing his shoes et cetera, is that it?
speaker="david_i_shapiro" startTime="426.793" stopTime="427.407">
    Mr. David I. Shapiro 
    That's correct, Your Honor.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="427.407" stopTime="428.299">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    I thought it would.
speaker="david_i_shapiro" startTime="428.299" stopTime="435.935">
    Mr. David I. Shapiro 
    I would say if that did not come under Article 134, it could not be used to stigmatize his discharge certificate.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="435.935" stopTime="444.391">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    He may have been found cheating at cards in all powers. 
    I don't know whether that would be court-martial attempt, probably not, would it?
speaker="david_i_shapiro" startTime="444.391" stopTime="445.917">
    Mr. David I. Shapiro 
    I really don't know, Your Honor, but I would think not.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="445.917" stopTime="459.288">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    (Voice Overlap) 
    but he -- suppose it was found he done that all the time, that has nothing to do with the fact that he might be a very brave and rather even if you plea a distinguished soldier in action.
speaker="david_i_shapiro" startTime="459.288" stopTime="459.348">
    Mr. David I. Shapiro 
    That's correct.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="459.348" stopTime="463.727">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    That would be proper. 
    Those are not inconsistent as we know about this.
speaker="david_i_shapiro" startTime="463.727" stopTime="463.743">
    Mr. David I. Shapiro 
    No, sir.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="463.743" stopTime="465.612">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Nonetheless, he would have to be given honorable discharge.
speaker="david_i_shapiro" startTime="465.612" stopTime="470.608">
    Mr. David I. Shapiro 
    I would think so, Your Honor, unless he was subject to court-martial jurisdiction under 134. 
    Now --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="470.608" stopTime="475.755">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Now, could -- could the Congress of United States take a different view of this?
speaker="david_i_shapiro" startTime="475.755" stopTime="516.392">
    Mr. David I. Shapiro 
    I would think that they very well might but they haven't yet. 
    As a matter of fact, it has been our position that when Congress reenacted Article 108 of the Articles of War and now it's set forth in the present statute which is the statute of May 5, 1950, which is the reenactment of Article 108 and they reenacted it without material change. 
    It is our position that they -- that they incorporated all of the rulings of the judge advocate general and the attorney general of the United States within their reenactment.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="516.392" stopTime="555.441">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    What your position is as I understand it yesterday and today that as a matter of statutorylimitation upon the defense services or the Army, that as a matter of statutory limitation, statutory requirement, there are only two kinds of discharges that they'd be given, one honorable and one dishonorable. 
    And the dishonorable discharge requires certain conviction or offenses or misconduct in the actual soldiering in its technical, narrow restrictive meaning of that word, is that right?
speaker="david_i_shapiro" startTime="555.441" stopTime="564.981">
    Mr. David I. Shapiro 
    No, Your Honor, that's not correct. 
    The army has the right, I think, by statute to give a number of various kinds of discharges.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="564.981" stopTime="565.913">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Such as?
speaker="david_i_shapiro" startTime="565.913" stopTime="645.135">
    Mr. David I. Shapiro 
    They can give an honorable discharge, they can give a general discharge under honorable conditions, they can give an undesirable discharge, they can give a bad conduct discharge and they can give a dishonorable discharge. 
    The dishonorable discharge is by sentence of general court-martial, the others are through administrative regulation which have been established by the Secretary and have been within his power since the time the Articles of War were first enacted. 
    Now, this is the point I'm trying to get at and I think that this is really the key issue with regard to the statutory construction. 
    It's just this. 
    The Army, in issuing the kinds of discharges that they issue have to take into account and be limited by those things which are relevant to the discharge itself. 
    For example, a discharge certificate is not a certification by the Army, that a man was for example or was not a bank robber, before he was inducted, and it's not a certification either that he may not become a bank robber after he's released from the military service and goes into civilian life.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="645.135" stopTime="659.891">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    But you're not restricting your argument as you indicated yesterday to pre-service disqualification because you said in your case there is an element of conduct under scrutiny during --
speaker="david_i_shapiro" startTime="659.891" stopTime="659.971">
    Mr. David I. Shapiro 
    That's correct.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="659.971" stopTime="661.640">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    -- during service.
speaker="david_i_shapiro" startTime="661.640" stopTime="662.128">
    Mr. David I. Shapiro 
    That's correct.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="662.128" stopTime="673.252">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    But you're now drawing a line between activities and conduct, call it what you will, what you regard as unrelated to soldiery.
speaker="david_i_shapiro" startTime="673.252" stopTime="673.547">
    Mr. David I. Shapiro 
    Yes Your Honor.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="673.547" stopTime="678.493">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    And you say the mere quality of his character is unrelated to soldiers.
speaker="david_i_shapiro" startTime="678.493" stopTime="698.455">
    Mr. David I. Shapiro 
    No, I say that the quality of his character is very much related to his soldiering because the Army provides a system whereby his character can be rated. 
    And as a matter of fact, in this particular case, wherever there were ratings as to this man's character, he was rated as excellent.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="698.455" stopTime="701.830">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    But it can't show on the -- on the discharge.
speaker="david_i_shapiro" startTime="701.830" stopTime="703.653">
    Mr. David I. Shapiro 
    Well --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="703.653" stopTime="709.177">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    In this case, we're dealing with a discharge that is general discharge with -- what is (Voice Overlap) --
speaker="david_i_shapiro" startTime="709.177" stopTime="711.882">
    Mr. David I. Shapiro 
    Under honorable -- general under honorable conditions discharge.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="711.882" stopTime="717.151">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    And -- and your objection to that is that it's not explicitly stated an honorable discharge.
speaker="david_i_shapiro" startTime="717.151" stopTime="720.071">
    Mr. David I. Shapiro 
    It is not an honorable discharge. 
    That is correct, Your Honor.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="720.071" stopTime="743.785">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    And it was given in this form because the Army thought that that which took place while he was in the service or on his conduct as a soldier or his qualification as a solider or the kind of authentication the Government wanted to make which barred them, which led them to prefer general discharge under honorable conditions rather than honorable discharge.

    I don't think that's the Army's position.

    We think that because of the two letters which he wrote, the Army could consider this as part of an overall question of conduct.

    Justice Hugo L. Black

    Suppose they did it for that reason, and they did it for other reasons, I assume other reasons that were improper for them to consider.

speaker="david_i_shapiro" startTime="788.540" stopTime="803.812">
    Mr. David I. Shapiro 
    Well, I -- I would think that it would depend upon whether or not the conduct which occurred subsequent to induction was de minimis or not and I think that would be a question for this Court to decide on the basis of the record.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="803.812" stopTime="825.316">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    How could you decide it line of this general position in connection with agencies and are with verdicts of the conviction. 
    And if there are several reasons given, some are bad, it might not -- consequence might not have resulted and had been limited to the good reasons.
speaker="david_i_shapiro" startTime="825.316" stopTime="830.467">
    Mr. David I. Shapiro 
    Well, I think really, Your Honor, we're not limited to that question here for this additional reason.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="830.467" stopTime="876.097">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    I -- I want to talk about being limited. 
    I was wondering why both questions are not present in your case, maybe they are none. 
    So, I was wondering why both questions are not present. 
    Number one, whether it's legal to consider a man's past character as, I understood you to say was done here, investigated, rely on that. 
    Secondly, whether it's legal to consider what happened after he was in the Army. 
    Now, assuming that one should reach the conclusion that the discharge was justifiable on one of the two causes, how could we know that it would have occurred had they not relied on both?
speaker="david_i_shapiro" startTime="876.097" stopTime="899.379">
    Mr. David I. Shapiro 
    Well, with respect to the question of findings, Your Honor, I think perhaps it might have to be sent back for a determination as to what the Army relied on. 
    But I really feel and it's our position in this case that the two letters that this man did write after he was inducted had nothing whatever to do with the actual character of the service he rendered.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="899.379" stopTime="904.166">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    I understand that's your argument with reference to it as to why it was wrong to rely on it.
speaker="david_i_shapiro" startTime="904.166" stopTime="905.268">
    Mr. David I. Shapiro 
    Yes, sir.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="905.268" stopTime="910.553">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    But do you concede it was right to rely on the other part as to what happened before he got into --
speaker="david_i_shapiro" startTime="910.553" stopTime="937.078">
    Mr. David I. Shapiro 
    No, sir. 
    We do not concede that all. 
    We say that with respect to pre-induction conduct, number one, and with conduct antedating induction, having nothing whatever to do with the character of the service, none of these factors can be considered with respect to the kind of discharged issue. 
    Now, let me go into the jurisdictional question for a moment, the question of this Court's power to review.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="937.078" stopTime="938.717">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    To review what?
speaker="david_i_shapiro" startTime="938.717" stopTime="1057.361">
    Mr. David I. Shapiro 
    To review the issuance, the action of the Army in issuing this man the kind of discharge he was issued on the basic facts of this case as they stand admitted before the Court. 
    We think that under this Court's holding in Perkins against Elg, even if the District Court had no power to compel the Army to issue the petitioner here an honorable discharge certificate, certainly, we think it had the power to declare invalid or unconstitutional the kind of discharge he did get if the reasons for the action were invalid or unconstitutional. 
    Nevertheless, the respondent argues that the legislative history of the statutes providing for the Board -- the Army Discharge Review Board and the Army Board for the Correction of Military Records, demonstrate a congressional intent to preclude judicial review of this kind of case. 
    We disagree. 
    We think that the legislative history of the term "final" as used both in Section 301 of the Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944 and in 207 of the Legislative Reorganization Act, indicate that Congress did not preclude judicial review of arbitrary or capricious administrative action by the military. 
    Of course, if Congress had said that the administrative determination not only should be final and conclusive but that no court of the United States should have jurisdiction to review such determination, of course, the army's position would be much stronger. 
    But here, so far as Section 207 is concerned, such words were specifically deleted from the statute by committee amendment. 
    Now --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1057.361" stopTime="1059.887">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    In this -- this statute and even the bill.
speaker="david_i_shapiro" startTime="1059.887" stopTime="1128.907">
    Mr. David I. Shapiro 
    From the bill, that's right, Your Honor. 
    Now, the second half of the Army's attempt to sidestep what we consider the basic issue here, is the contention that Harmon has not suffered injury to a legally protected right. 
    The Army says that since the general under honorable conditions discharge entitles Harmon to virtually all federal veterans' benefits. 
    He hasn't suffered the kind of injury which would give him the standing to raise the issues he seeks to raise in this case. 
    Now, while it's true that the general discharge will not automatically deprive Harmon of federal veterans' benefits, he will be deprived of a number of veterans' benefits provided by the laws of the State of New York. 
    The New York statutes make marked distinction between an honorable discharge and a discharge under honorable conditions and I call the Court's attention specifically to the Education Law of the State of New York and the distinction between Section 609 of the Education Law and Section 608 as it's discussed in our brief.

    But we think more important than the loss of these state veterans' benefits is the stigma which attaches to anything --

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Before -- before you move on to that.
speaker="david_i_shapiro" startTime="1170.678" stopTime="1172.706">
    Mr. David I. Shapiro 
    Yes, Your Honor.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1172.706" stopTime="1183.387">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    I understood you to say that the New York Education Law makes a distinction between an honorable discharge and a general discharge under honorable conditions.
speaker="david_i_shapiro" startTime="1183.387" stopTime="1188.796">
    Mr. David I. Shapiro 
    No, just a discharge under honorable conditions, they don't use the word general in the statute.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1188.796" stopTime="1191.860">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    To make it -- what is the distinction between?
speaker="david_i_shapiro" startTime="1191.860" stopTime="1193.898">
    Mr. David I. Shapiro 
    The distinction between the two is --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1193.898" stopTime="1197.878">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    No, what is the distinction that the New York Education Law makes?
speaker="david_i_shapiro" startTime="1197.878" stopTime="1250.214">
    Mr. David I. Shapiro 
    Well, I think Section 608 has to do with soldiers who have been -- educational benefits for soldiers who have been discharged under honorable conditions. 
    And Section 609 has to do with scholarships for the children of veterans who have been honorably discharged. 
    The types of discharge, a discharge under honorable conditions and an honorable discharge are very, very much different. 
    The --the army regulations themselves indicate that the general discharge is basically a substandard discharge for those who do not meet the qualifications of an honorable discharge.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1250.214" stopTime="1257.069">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Is this discharge under honorable conditions? 
    When does that get into the -- in the former military law?
speaker="david_i_shapiro" startTime="1257.069" stopTime="1264.934">
    Mr. David I. Shapiro 
    I think that's been in, Your Honor, since some time after the First World War, but I don't think that I'm quite sure on that.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1264.934" stopTime="1268.585">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    So that the -- what is it, regulations or -- or --
speaker="david_i_shapiro" startTime="1268.585" stopTime="1271.115">
    Mr. David I. Shapiro 
    It's established by army regulation.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1271.115" stopTime="1274.364">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    And the New York Education Law responds to that record
speaker="david_i_shapiro" startTime="1274.364" stopTime="1274.430">
    Mr. David I. Shapiro 
    No.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1274.430" stopTime="1275.512">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    It's on that distinction?
speaker="david_i_shapiro" startTime="1275.512" stopTime="1293.514">
    Mr. David I. Shapiro 
    I don't think that they make that kind of distinction but I think that they've inherently made that distinction in the statute so that if the statute would be applied to Harmon's children, he would not be entitled to an educational scholarship for those children under Section 609.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1293.514" stopTime="1302.348">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    What I want to know is -- the New York statute take cognizance of this distinction made in the army regulations.
speaker="david_i_shapiro" startTime="1302.348" stopTime="1419.223">
    Mr. David I. Shapiro 
    I think it would, Your Honor, there have been no rulings on it, but I do think they would. 
    Judge Frank indicated they would in the case of Schustack against Herren which was in the Second Circuit, and he thought they would. 
    And I think the statute shows a marked distinction between an honorable conditions discharge and an honorable discharge. 
    As a matter of fact, there is an Air Force regulation, Air Force Regulation 39-10 Section 3, which provides that a general discharge may be a disadvantage to an airman seeking civilian employment. 
    And we say that much more important than the state veterans benefits, is this stigma which attaches to anything other than an honorable discharge and much more important in Mr. Harmon's case is the fact that as a law student and perspective candidate for admission to the bar, he may find by reason of the general and honorable conditions discharge, a great deal of difficulty with the Committee on Character and Fitness for the first judicial department of that State. 
    Judge Bazelon in his dissent below, we think, put it very, very succinctly when he said, "But whatever may be said of the technical legal equivalence or difference between the two types of discharge from a real life point of view, they are vastly different. 
    The portion of our population holding honorable discharge certificates from the armed services is now so great that an adverse reflection is inherent in a certificate which is other than honorable." 
    This is of course confirmed by the statement of appellee's counsel in oral argument, that every soldier gets an honorable discharge unless there is some blemish on his record on account of which he receives the discharge other than honorable. 
    Now --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1419.223" stopTime="1442.600">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    How -- how does one reach that conclusion? 
    I mean speaking for myself if I hadn't read that and read all this, it never would have occurred to me that the fellow has a piece of paper that he's discharged under honorable conditions, that honorable doesn't mean the same thing as an honorable discharge. 
    I know that isn't so but how do -- how can one be so sure that inherently there is a difference?
speaker="david_i_shapiro" startTime="1442.600" stopTime="1442.905">
    Mr. David I. Shapiro 
    I think --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1442.905" stopTime="1446.626">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Do honorable, do the words honorable mean different things, as -- as they're differently used?
speaker="david_i_shapiro" startTime="1446.626" stopTime="1465.660">
    Mr. David I. Shapiro 
    Because the term is general, Your Honor. 
    It's an administrative discharge which -- I mean the normal type of discharge is an honorable discharge. 
    It says in big letters on it, "Honorable Discharge." 
    Those are the standard words which are used on the discharge certificate. 
    Anything other than that immediately catches the attention.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1465.660" stopTime="1467.104">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Well, I just wonder if that --
speaker="david_i_shapiro" startTime="1467.104" stopTime="1467.294">
    Mr. David I. Shapiro 
    Now --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1467.294" stopTime="1473.864">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    I take notice of that as a psychological fact so I myself -- it never would have occurred as to my stupid mind.
speaker="david_i_shapiro" startTime="1473.864" stopTime="1474.517">
    Mr. David I. Shapiro 
    Now, if --
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="1474.517" stopTime="1481.250">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    There is nothing on the face of the certificate that indicates that he was discharged for security reasons.
speaker="david_i_shapiro" startTime="1481.250" stopTime="1515.729">
    Mr. David I. Shapiro 
    Yes Your Honor and that's exactly the point I'm coming to now. 
    Now, it's true that the term “Army Regulations 604-10”, that's the army security risk regulation, does not apply on Harmon's discharge certificate or on his official report of separation. 
    However, both the Department of Defense Director and AR 604-10 itself require that the discharge certificate be so marked. 
    Now, since clerical mistakes --
speaker="charles_e_whittaker" startTime="1515.729" stopTime="1517.000">
    Justice Charles E. Whittaker 
    Is this not on this one?
speaker="david_i_shapiro" startTime="1517.000" stopTime="1518.629">
    Mr. David I. Shapiro 
    Not on this one, Your Honor. 
    But --

    Justice Charles E. Whittaker 
    (Inaudible) to it at all.
speaker="david_i_shapiro" startTime="1519.934" stopTime="1545.636">
    Mr. David I. Shapiro 
    No, sir. 
    But since clerical mistakes or omissions can always be corrected on the separation certificate even after its issue, we cannot presume unless of course this Court reverses the court below that the army will fail to correct this omission or mistake from its own -- in accordance with its own regulation, and of course the Director from the Department of Defense.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1545.636" stopTime="1549.700">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    But isn't the separation certificate a different thing from discharge certificate?
speaker="david_i_shapiro" startTime="1549.700" stopTime="1552.852">
    Mr. David I. Shapiro 
    No, Your Honor, it's sometimes used in lieu.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1552.852" stopTime="1559.376">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Doesn't every soldier get a summary, a brief of his war -- of his military record?
speaker="david_i_shapiro" startTime="1559.376" stopTime="1560.422">
    Mr. David I. Shapiro 
    That's right. 
    It's --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1560.422" stopTime="1563.028">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    And that's a very different thing from the discharge certificate.
speaker="david_i_shapiro" startTime="1563.028" stopTime="1564.986">
    Mr. David I. Shapiro 
    Actually, no, Your Honor, it is not.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    It's surprising.
speaker="david_i_shapiro" startTime="1569.182" stopTime="1628.244">
    Mr. David I. Shapiro 
    The official report of separation from the Armed Forces of the United States is today given for those who are released from active military duty and placed in the inactive reserve. 
    They actually do not get an honorable discharge certificate until they have completed their required eight years of two years active service, six years inactive service. 
    So that for -- in the large part of those people who are inducted under the Universal Military Training and Service Act, they get when they are released to the inactive reserve what is know as an official report of separation, the DD Form 214, which in most cases serves in lieu of the honorable discharge. 
    Now here, this man was discharged before his 24 months of active military duty. 
    So he did get a discharge certificate as well as an official report of separation.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1628.244" stopTime="1634.099">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Did you say he gets -- you get this 214 in lieu of a discharge?
speaker="david_i_shapiro" startTime="1634.099" stopTime="1634.922">
    Mr. David I. Shapiro 
    Yes, Your Honor because --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1634.922" stopTime="1666.407">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    And are you saying in that separation, in that 214, the Army can't put down why he was separated. 
    We haven't got that question before us at all. 
    But I'd suppose, unless you correct me -- unless I'm corrected that that's a very different thing from the piece of paper called a discharge. 
    And that gives a summary history of his -- of his military record and that is -- may be called for if he seeks to re-enlist, isn't that right?
speaker="david_i_shapiro" startTime="1666.407" stopTime="1668.017">
    Mr. David I. Shapiro 
    That's correct, Your Honor.

    We say that that has -- that statement on the record has nothing whatever to do with a man's service, because in box one, the first box you come to on the official report of separation, is the box which says "Character of separation." 
    And it seems to us that if a man was an excellent soldier, the character of separation has got to be nothing less than honorable.

    If I may ask the Court to turn again to page 112 of the record, which is the photostatic copy of the actual discharge certificate received by the petitioner. 
    This is the document which is stated to impose such horrendous consequences upon petitioner that it violates his constitutional rights.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1906.974" stopTime="1927.368">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    No, not his constitutional rights to the person -- as I understood Mr. Shapiro's argument is that the terms under which an honorable discharge must be given and defined by a statute and that he comes within the terms of the statute.

    Mr. Donald B. Macguines 
    Well, as I understand it --

    Mr. Donald B. Macguines 
    Yes, but that is an alternative contention which he makes, I believe. 
    Now, the only difference in form --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1937.156" stopTime="1939.234">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    You don't start with the constitutional proposition.

    Oh, I certainly do not intend to, Your Honor.

    All right.
speaker="donald_b_macguines" startTime="1942.045" stopTime="2017.768">
    Mr. Donald B. Macguines 
    The only difference in form and content between this general discharge certificate which petitioner holds and the honorable discharge certificate which he asked this court to compel the Secretary of the Army issue to him is the heading, first, instead of the large type general discharge would be the words "honorable discharge." 
    And then there is an additional statement in the honorable discharge certificate that it is awarded as a testimonial of honest and faithful service. 
    Now, that testimonial is omitted from the general discharge certificate and that is the only distinction in the two types of certificates upon which petitioner bases his whole case. 
    Now, to clarify the statements of petitioner's counsel with respect to the report of separation form, the DD 214, the original of that form is the official army record maintained in the War Department, the official record of the soldier's service. 
    It is a copy of that record which is given to the soldier as well as the formal discharge certificate.

    Mr. Donald B. Macguines 
    Yes, thank you. 
    As we read 175 years of legislative practice in this country running back to before the revolution, Congress has never intended to vest in the civil courts discretion to decide what types of discharges shall be prescribed by the armed forces, that is to say what categories of discharges, nor has it attempted to vest the courts with jurisdiction to decide what established form of certificates shall be given to a particular soldier under any particular circumstances. 
    The British Articles of War at the time of the revolution required that a soldier be given a discharge.They did not specify honorable or dishonorable or other types of discharge. 
    That has been carried forward through the continental Congress in the Articles of War and after the Constitution was adopted through the early Congresses in the Articles of War and it has been carried forward to date. 
    Specifically, the statute which is applicable to petitioner's discharge is an Act of 1920 which provides that no --

    Mr. Donald B. Macguines 
    That may be found at the back of our main brief, Your Honor, at page 78, paragraph number two.

    This is the basic statute under which the discharge was given to petitioner. 
    And the Court --

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Is this -- is this the only one to which we need look --

    No, I will --

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    -- for the authority for this particular discharge?
speaker="donald_b_macguines" startTime="2553.188" stopTime="2604.702">
    Mr. Donald B. Macguines 
    I will in a moment refer to one other subsequent statute. 
    But the Court will observe that under that statute, first, every enlisted man must, upon his discharge, be given a certificate of discharge. 
    And secondly, that no enlisted man shall be discharged prior to expiration of his term except in the manner prescribed by the Secretary of the Department of the Army or by court-martial. 
    Note again that Congress, even to this date, has never specified whether there shall be honorable discharges, general discharges, undesirable discharges or so forth, nor has it ever set forth the conditions under which the man receives one type of discharge rather than another.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="2604.702" stopTime="2607.611">

speaker="donald_b_macguines" startTime="2609.101" stopTime="2626.438">
    Mr. Donald B. Macguines 
    And that is my point, that Congress has left in the military establishments, the full discretion to prescribe by regulation, what types discharge that shall be and under what circumstances a particular type shall be given to a particular soldier.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="2626.438" stopTime="2630.010">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Now, was Harmon discharged before his term of service expired?
speaker="donald_b_macguines" startTime="2630.010" stopTime="2752.190">
    Mr. Donald B. Macguines 
    Yes, Your Honor. 
    So this statute has direct application to petitioner. 
    Now, the only other statute which has direct application to petitioner is -- is the following paragraph on page 78 of our brief. 
    The Universal Military Training and Service Act. 
    And -- and when that Act was enacted, there was the Secretary of Defense, super imposed upon the three military establishments. 
    So it provides that no soldier shall be discharged prior to expiration of his term of service except in accordance with procedures prescribed by the Secretary of Defense, which I take it means super imposes a general discretionary authority of the Secretary of Defense upon the Secretary of the Army. 
    But Congress again had stayed completely away from the whole problem of what types of discharges there shall be and how -- and under what circumstances they shall be given. 
    Now, in the Armed Forces Reserve Act of 1952 which is directly applicable to the next case to be argued, the Abramowitz case, there is a similar provision providing for discharge in accordance with regulations promulgated by the appropriate Secretary of the military establishment. 
    Now, Mr. Justice Black asked about the regulations. 
    And the types of discharges have been for generations prescribed by the heads of the military departments. 
    At the present time and at the time applicable in this case, there were five types of discharges given by the army. 
    The first, the appellate as I put it is the so called honorable discharge. 
    The second, the one which petitioner received is the general discharge under honorable conditions.

    Well, not that sole paragraph. 
    It is an applicable one but there are others that have bearing on the question. 
    But counsel for petitioner has pointed out that under paragraph eight of that regulation, a soldier gets the honorable discharge if his character and efficiency ratings have been very good and excellent, and he has not been convicted by court-martial, except as otherwise provided in the regulations. 
    Now, of course here, there is an except as otherwise provided because the reference there to paragraph 13, except as provided in these regulations and pertinent regulations listed in paragraph 13, paragraph 13 is regrettably not printed by either side, but I have it here.

    Well, that is an element. 
    Certainly, that is an important element in this case. 
    Now, the statute which set up the Army Discharge Review Boards provided that the discharge given should be final subject only to review by the Secretary. 
    That is one instance of a congressional statement of finality. 
    And further more in 19 --

    Mr. Donald B. Macguines 
    No. 
    Every finality clause should be read in the light of its history.

    Well, this that -- that precise case has not been decided by this Court.

speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="3367.907" stopTime="3374.686">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Well, that is my notion of your responsibility if I may say so.
speaker="donald_b_macguines" startTime="3374.686" stopTime="3626.040">
    Mr. Donald B. Macguines 
    But of course in the cases which have come before this Curt and the lower courts, in large part, they have been habeas corpus reviews of court-martial proceedings. 
    And the test there which the Court has laid down is that if it is conceded that the man is in the military establishment and if it is conceded that the court-martial which tried him was constituted in accordance with law and it had jurisdiction to pass on the offense with which he was charged, that's the end of it. 
    That for considerations of army discipline, the fact that the military establishment is an entirely separate community, as this Court has put it, from the civil community, that -- and for separation of powers consideration that the courts do not at all take the same type of review of military action as they do of course of governmental action which affects civilian rights. 
    And piecing together all of those things, the consistent course of congressional action, the extremely limited review which this Court has given even in the habeas corpus case where a statute expressly confers upon this Court -- pardon me, and on the District Courts, jurisdiction in habeas corpus. 
    Taking all of those things together, we consider that Congress did not intend to make the matter of a man's discharge the kind of a legal right which was proper subject matter for the civil courts to pass on. 
    Now, Congress has recognized the distinction between the various types of discharges in this sense. 
    The so-called punitive discharges, the bad conduct and the dishonorable discharges may, under the Uniform Code of Military Justice, only be given by sentence of court-martial. 
    In other words, that is a form of punishment imposed upon the soldier where he has been found guilty of a violation of offenses formerly prescribed by the Articles of War and now carried forward into the Uniform Code of Military Justice. 
    But on the other hand, the so-called administrative types of discharge, the honorable discharge, the general discharge under honorable conditions and the undesirable discharge, those are not given for the commission of offenses in the same sense at all. 
    They are not given because the man has been found guilty by a court-martial offense, they are given because the army has decided that from the standpoint of the efficient operation of the army, it's better off not to have Private John Jones in the Army. 
    Now, the general discharge under honorable conditions which is given here is given for many things which have nothing whatever to do with security considerations. 
    It's specifically given, for instance, if the soldier lacks physical stamina. 
    It's given if he is psychologically ill-equipped for combat conditions, and many other thing, it is merely a determination of the Army, that although the man has served under honorable conditions for one reason or another and may be wholly beyond his fault or anything that he can correct, the Army is just better off not to have that man in the service.

    Mr. Donald B. Macguines 
    No, the Court of Appeals referred to Department of Defense Directive 5210-9. 
    Now, the explanation for that as I understand it, and this is a point on which petitioner has never brought forward. 
    The -- the Department of Defense Directive 5210.9 was promulgated in April of 1954. 
    That same month, petitioner was given his first discharge, the then undesirable discharge. 
    Up to that time, the army had not promulgated its implementation of the Department of Defense Directive. 
    That implementation is Army Regulation 604-10.

    Mr. Donald B. Macguines 
    We -- we take the -- we take the position that the Department of Defense Directive in itself was sufficiently self executing so to speak, that it would justify action by the Army even in advance of the promulgation of its formal security regulation.

    Is it that you're suggesting that the 604-10, I gather now that this -- whatever the other one was, I'm so confused about all this now. 
    But my understanding is that as to the Department of Defense, security regulation is appropriate, upon which you justify the action taken as to Harmon.

    Mr. Donald B. Macguines 
    Well, that defense directive represented the promulgation of a new policy with respect to discharges, to wit a specific basis for discharging a man because his retention in the service was not deemed to be clearly consistent with the national interest.

    Mr. Donald B. Macguines 
    Well, I -- I thought I indicated that the particular form of honorable discharge under general conditions goes back to 1921, I believe it is, and it is true that prior to that time, there were other forms of discharge given by the military service which was not the honorable discharge and yet was not a dishonorable discharge, an intermediate form of discharge.That sort of thing goes back at least to the Civil War and the -- the precise characterization of the discharge has changed in accordance with change in regulations from time to time.

    Well, Mr. -- Mr. MacGuineas, I -- I -- under those circumstances, I can't get away from -- from number 8, regulation 8 of 52 of petitioner's brief and regulation 9 on the next page. 
    Now, 8 says that except as provided in these regulations and pertinent regulations listed in paragraph three, an honorable discharge certificate will be furnished when the individual meets the following qualifications. 
    One, as character ratings of at least very good. 
    Has efficiency ratings of at least excellent. 
    Three, has not been convicted by a general court martial, and four, has not been convicted more than once by a special court martial. 
    Now, number 9 says, general discharge, individuals discharged under honorable conditions which do not qualify them for an honorable discharge will be furnished a general discharge except as provided below and then below they make exceptions where they can even give them a general -- an honorable discharge under those circumstances. 
    Now, I want you if you will please, to read me the language of any statute which govern his case at the time he was released from service in the Army. 
    You say it isn't relevant, the kind of discharge he got when he was separated from the service, but I want to know what conditions -- under what conditions he was discharged and I want to know the statutory or regulatory power that you rely on to vary these two regulations.

    Mr. Donald B. Macguines 
    Well, that's true within the terms if the man comes under paragraph eight.

    That talks about the circumstances under which you will get an honorable discharge if you are under paragraph eight.

    But is there anything in 13 that would indicate that ratings of unknown are not disqualifying?

    13 doesn't --

    What -- what in 13 would indicate that there is any -- any retreat from that statement that ratings of unknown and ratings for periods of less than two months are not disqualifying?
speaker="donald_b_macguines" startTime="5489.950" stopTime="5523.383">
    Mr. Donald B. Macguines 
    Because 13 provides other grounds for discharge and as to which as I understand it, the -- the Army man's formal rating is immaterial. 
    In other words, a man might have been rated by his commanding officer as excellent and yet the army discovers that he is a homosexual. 
    He nonetheless maybe discharged under their exception regulation without being given an honorable discharge.
