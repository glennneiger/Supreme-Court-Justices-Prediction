Wiener v. United States
speaker="i_h_wachtel" startTime="0.000" stopTime="312.210">
    Mr. I. H. Wachtel 
    Chief Justice, prior to the recess, I had set forth the historical basis for our view that this agency was a legislative and judicial body. 
    I'm aware of the language of this Court and other tribunals the use of the term quasi, quasi legislative, the quasi-judicial, the tendency to label. 
    I suggest that the Court -- that War Claims Commission in this case was truly an offspring of the legislative -- legislature performing its functions, performing duties traditionally those of the Congress, performing in the cause with those activities functions of a judicial character. 
    In the Humphrey's case, this Court had held that -- that Congress had us an appropriate incident of its power, the power to fix the period during which they shall continue and to forbid their removal except for cause in the meantime. 
    In all respects, we suggest to the Court that the agency here is far more, if I may use the term a quasi-legislative and quasi-judicial agency then in the Federal Trade Commission situation. 
    We think the sole distinction in this case, not in the Federal Trade Commission case, the Humphrey's case was that in the Humphrey's case Congress fixed the term -- they fixed the term here. 
    But in the Humphrey's case it enumerated certain causes for removal. 
    In the instant case, the statute is completely silent. 
    It enumerates no causes for removal. 
    We say -- we suggest to this Court that in this case, it's evident and it should be considered evident that Congress intended that there'd be no power of removal in the present. 
    The lesson we feel that must be learned of the Humphrey case teaches us is that the President has no inherent power, no implied power over this type of agency by virtue of the vesting of the power of appointment in it. 
    We feel that he has over such agencies only such power as Congress gives him because if as this Court said he does not possess an illimitable power. 
    In order to possess any power, it must come from some place. 
    It cannot come solely from the vesting of the power of appointment because Congress could easily have vested the power of appointment in the head of the department. 
    We say that the mere vesting of the appointment does not imply the power to remove because the whole concept of the implied power of removal was its necessity, the need for it for the President to carry out his duties and obligations. 
    But the duties and obligations other than those fixed in the Constitution that the President possesses what Congress gives him. 
    I suggest the -- to the Court that this isn't a case of Congress limiting or failing to limit power. 
    That in this area in dealing and creating this type of agencies, what Congress does is fix the conditions under which this agency shall operate. 
    It fixes the conditions under which the President may impinge on the functions of this agency. 
    The sole power given to the President was the power to nominate and with the advice and consent of the Senate appoint. 
    Having performed that duty, this agency under the basic concept of the functions and separation of power was to remain free and unhampered by any action or activity of the President in performing truly legislative and judicial powers.

    The disposition of the fund is covered by the Trading with the Enemy Act.

    Congress --

    That's correct.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="464.756" stopTime="475.078">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    -- had made -- made no such provision. 
    Could -- Congress had provided there's all claims against that fund should be determine by the Secretary of the Treasury or the Attorney General?
speaker="i_h_wachtel" startTime="475.078" stopTime="476.639">
    Mr. I. H. Wachtel 
    I think it could, yes.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="476.639" stopTime="512.899">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Well, the answer, it could because in other such claims it has done so. 
    As Congress had done variously about claim against funds in the Treasury of the United States it catered from a foreign country, as you indicated. 
    It did it as to Mexican and all other international conflicts and it has done so as to special claims against foreign governments asserted by this Government on behalf of some individuals, like the famous case, the La Abra Company. 
    And did they -- that's one of three things, it self decided that John Smith is entitled to it, promised to do that, couldn't he?
speaker="i_h_wachtel" startTime="512.899" stopTime="513.857">
    Mr. I. H. Wachtel 
    Yes, he could.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="513.857" stopTime="517.193">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    He could decide that the Secretary of State should determine that, couldn't he?

    Mr. I. H. Wachtel 
    Well, it could. 
    Now, the question whether that would --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="519.669" stopTime="520.770">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Well, it does -- done so in the past.
speaker="i_h_wachtel" startTime="520.770" stopTime="526.817">
    Mr. I. H. Wachtel 
    Yes, sir. 
    But I don't think we've had it determined whether that was a valid delegation of authority.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="526.817" stopTime="544.632">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Well, I thought the decision in La Abra which instead indicated that -- that Congress did one of three things. 
    It could make a disposition. 
    It could -- it leaves the disposition for determination by some executive officials or it could make it a matter of going to Court, usually with the Court of Claims, is that true?
speaker="i_h_wachtel" startTime="544.632" stopTime="545.884">
    Mr. I. H. Wachtel 
    Yes. 
    Yes, precisely like --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="545.884" stopTime="547.937">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Now, that could've been done as to this fund, wouldn't it?
speaker="i_h_wachtel" startTime="547.937" stopTime="548.985">
    Mr. I. H. Wachtel 
    Yes, it could have.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="548.985" stopTime="550.924">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Is that affect your argument?
speaker="i_h_wachtel" startTime="550.924" stopTime="650.825">
    Mr. I. H. Wachtel 
    No, I -- I don't. 
    It does not, Your Honor, for this reason. 
    Congress has time -- time delegated many activities to the executive branch of the Government. 
    These activities may necessarily not have been truly legislative functions. 
    I think every time that the Congress enacts any law when it provides by statute that certain Acts are in violation of the Robinson-Patman Act. 
    The definition to what is a violation of the Robinson-Patman Act is a legislative function. 
    The enforcement to that function, it delegated to the executive branch. 
    It could just as well have delegated the determination of those facts to a Court and that wouldn't have made it any the less a judicial function. 
    The mere fact that Congress in its wisdom delegates some of its functions to the executive branch of the Government and gives the President full power over that agency or that individual isn't precisely the situation we have here because when it delegates that function, it can also set forth the conditions under which that function shall be performed.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="650.825" stopTime="668.558">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Are you suggesting that what is legislative, what is executive is determinable by so-called a natural law, that those are pitched -- that it were (Inaudible) that there they are and no amount of (Inaudible) could change their meaning or their -- their use or their function, is that what (Voice Overlap)?
speaker="i_h_wachtel" startTime="668.558" stopTime="670.357">

    No, no I'm not Your Honor, because --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="670.357" stopTime="677.201">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Well then there must be some deeper problem here than putting a label and saying this is legislative because I find, isn't it?

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    I'm suggesting to you that the cases that I fought, that isn't a hypothetical case. 
    Those are cases in the book, the La Abra Company and Mexican company. 
    Congress from time to time does it and one of three ways, it itself as this fellow has a lawful claim and the Mexican Government is paid over to the United States, so many thousands, a hundreds of thousands of dollars and John Jones can get it. 
    Or it leaves it to the Secretary of State to determine whether his claim is bona fide or not. 
    Or it says, you go to the Court of Claims (Inaudible)

    Mr. I. H. Wachtel 
    Well, I have been unable, if Your Honor please, to find legislation where the Congress has delegated to the Treasury or to the Secretary of the Treasury the definition and the determination of the rights of an individual. 
    Its Congress which created -- creates the right to get the funds and it's Congress which sets up the remedy. 
    Until Congress creates the right and provides the remedy and there have been classic illustrations where Congress has given the right without a remedy.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Now, as to the District and Circuit judges, execute -- are they legislative? 
    Are their legislative people? 
    Do you decide that they can't be ruled by the President because they are legislative? 
    Would that make intelligent talk?

    Mr. I. H. Wachtel 
    Well, if Your Honor is talking now about the District Court judges in the same category as the Court of Claims or the Tax Court, I -- I think we have to define and point out that there is a fundamental difference.

    Mr. I. H. Wachtel 
    Its -- it's my view, if it please the Court, if I give my view. 
    I say that following the philosophy that I think underlies the Court's decisions in the few cases that we've had of territorial judges. 
    The direct question wasn't met because in those cases, in the case of the Minnesota judge and the case of the Alaska judge, the issue wasn't raise in Minnesota, the Act specifically gave the President power to name his -- to remove him by naming his successor. 
    I think in the Alaska case, the McAllister case, all that the judge was interested in there was his salary from the time of his removal to the time of the appointment of the successor. 
    But other cases have indicated -- indicate that this Court has felt that the Congress in creating the courts and the territories was not creating a Court under Article 3 of the Constitution but rather under the provision of the Constitution which gives the Congress the power to pass all laws needful for the operation of the territories. 
    And I --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="883.649" stopTime="888.382">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    I -- I'd supposed there's no doubt about that, the territory judges were not Article 3 judges.
speaker="i_h_wachtel" startTime="888.382" stopTime="893.906">
    Mr. I. H. Wachtel 
    Well, as this Court has so held and has so indicated in the O'Donoghue case and in the Williams case.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="893.906" stopTime="906.428">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Well now, what I want to know is because of that fact, the President of the United States in the light of the decisions that you have brought dismissed the territorial judge who has only a tenure of eight years.

    Mr. I. H. Wachtel 
    Well, except this, Your Honor -- if Your Honor please, the Congress in -- in setting up this territorial codes in the past except in the cases of Puerto Rico and Hawaii and the Virgin Islands.

    Mr. J. Lee Rankin 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    The only addition that the Government would like to make to the statement of the case made by counsel for the petitioner is that the Court of Claims made it very clear in its judgment that it was not satisfied to all that there would be no power to remove this petitioner that it found that there was no intent on the part of Congress to interfere with the presidential power and that it could not delete that it was Congress' purpose or intent in connection with this legislation that the only resort should be to the cumbersome and very difficult and unusual procedure of impeachment. 
    And therefore, although the Court of Claims concluded that the function of this Commission was both legislative and judicial with which conclusion the Government disagrees. 
    It held that the petitioner could be removed by the President because there was no intent on the part of Congress to leave this -- this man without any control in connection with this work. 
    On the question of what power is in the President seems to us resolves around the question of the character of the functions of the office. 
    The Myers case holds up an executive office in general terms that the President has a power that cannot be interfered with to remove. 
    And the Humphrey case holds that if the functions are legislative and judicial and if the Congress has made it clear that it intends that there'd be no interference by the executive by the President in the removal that -- the removal cannot be made except in accordance with the terms defined by the Congress in the legislation. 
    And you recall in that legislation they found that there wasn't desired by the Congress to have this Commission be independent, that it was made bipartisan, that it was to exercise chancery functions like a court and carry out some of the legislative process in making rules and regulations and because of all of these various things that the Congress had clearly indicated its intention and purpose and also by providing express provisions on the ground of negligence and failure to malfeasance, properly carry out the acts of the office and the three grounds prescribed that the Congress had shown that it should not -- the President should not have the power of removal except as defined expressly in the Act itself. 
    In the Ruberoid case, this Court in a dissenting opinion by Mr. Justice Jackson which was not disagreed with in this particular by the rest of the Court wing into at some length as to what is the nature of administrative body that is carrying on a legislative function. 
    And in that opinion, he develops a considerable length, the fact that in such -- in carrying on such a function, Congress generally lays down a statute which is more or less in skeleton form and it -- you might say it's the high spots that describes the general provisions and then it oppose upon the administrative body the duty to try to define and go into detail as to the application by rules and regulations that are developed under that. 
    And that is the nature of the function that the Federal Trade Commission in a case that's just been illustrated before the Court before this one. 
    Now, in regard to the judicial or quasi-judicial functions of such an administrative body, we think that in this kind of a problem, we are getting into the question of the separation of powers and is where the administrative body is exercising the function under Article 3, that is the judicial function of the courts that this Court has said that there could not be a removal because in that area the administrative body is carrying on a decision and judgment, a feature that is the very nature of the principles of separation of powers should not be under the control and dictate of the President. 
    Now, if we examine the statute to see what kind of authority this Commission had, we find that the statute gave the petitioner full guidance that he did not have to implement the statutory standards. 
    He did not have to have a skeleton statute but he had clearly defined provisions in the statute which told him just how he was to decide about these claims. 
    And by the way, this was a fund that was developed out of the Trading with the Enemy Act which was amended from time to time but was passed during the first World War in regard to enemy assets and large number of assets of both the Japanese and Germans had been taken over and it was estimated by the courts to Congress that they -- this fund amounted to some $300 million that was going to be disposed of depending upon the amount of the claims by these Commissioners. 
    So, it was a task that had a great deal of responsibility and the country had very genuine and great interest in its proper administration.

speaker="j_lee_rankin" startTime="1536.134" stopTime="1574.641">
    Mr. J. Lee Rankin 
    Yes. 
    There was a provision for internees who were detained during the war to receive specific benefits and they would receive $60 per each calendar month of interned and compensation on the basis of weekly wage and also compensation on the basis of weekly wage of $37 and a half. 
    Then there was a further provision for prisoners of the war, a set of categories in the Sections 5 to 8 of the statute.

    Is the statute set up but not in that respect in your brief, Mr. Solicitor?
speaker="j_lee_rankin" startTime="1578.415" stopTime="1677.271">
    Mr. J. Lee Rankin 
    Yes. 
    The detail language is set out in the appendix on page 76, Section 5 and then it goes on to Section 6 on page 80, 7 on page 83, and 8 is the provision for the report on page 84. 
    Then a summary of those provisions were set out in our brief on pages 47, 48, and a part of 49. 
    Section 6 provides for prisoners of war or their survivors to receive a dollar a day for each day the enemy government failed and this is the language, “To furnish him the quantity or quality of food to which he was entitled as a prisoner of war under the terms of the Geneva Convention of July 27th, 1929 which was regarded to the treatment of prisoners of war.” 
    So you see the amount that could be awarded under both of those Sections and the criteria for determining in that amount were expressed so all that the Commission had to do would determine whether or not the particular claim came within the definition of the statute.

    And these were specifics so that the -- all the Commission had to determine was whether or not they came within those specific requirements.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2025.632" stopTime="2087.311">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    May I ask you one more question then I'll try to stop for a while. 
    I speak as one whom was -- it comes relevant, not sympathetic to the result in the Myers case. 
    I want to know, disclose my attitude, I want to know if -- if I gathering -- I haven't read your brief but I had paged it. 
    Why this case seems to you so important in the conduct of affairs of this Government? 
    Because I think those considerations are from my point of view is relevant to this kind of a problem? 
    You -- you almost -- I don't mean to say you reargued the Myers case, but you go in heavily on the whole problem of the presidential removal power. 
    And perhaps before you get through it, you will say something about why you deem this case is so important. 
    I don't mean to say it's unimportant but why do you think it has a reach such as your brief implies, I, for one would be much interested.
speaker="j_lee_rankin" startTime="2087.311" stopTime="2270.714">
    Mr. J. Lee Rankin 
    Well, the -- the interest of the Government in the case is the -- in the basic principle of the conduct of the executive branch of the Government. 
    And the authority or power of the President to protect the public interest in the -- the ability to remove and substitute other officers in the executive branch that will respond to carrying on that -- the business of that branch of the Government in the best management possible. 
    And it's our belief that under the take care that the laws will be faithfully executed the President has to have this power in order to carry out the obligations imposed upon him by the Constitution. 
    Now, I do not say that the -- he has to have the power that's denied him in the Humphrey case. 
    But in this type of situation, here you have a question of whether or not he is -- the Commission is actually executing or carrying out the legislative or judicial function, we do not think that he -- he was in this case. 
    But even assuming that he was, it seems that there should be a power in the executive to remove any officers whose conduct he is responsible for. 
    If the Congress has not seen fit to say this cannot be done because the impeachment process is so unrealistic to handle that kind of a problem in the area of the executive branch itself and the responsibility of the President that it can't be assumed that it's adequate. 
    And furthermore, the Congress itself has, in most cases provided expressly for the removal on various specific grounds of negligence or malfeasance or failure to carry out the -- those responsibilities in the three different manners time after time. 
    Now, its hardly conceivable that Congress would have been intended that these War Claims Commission with this -- involving this $300 million fund that they would pass upon these claims and they're also passing upon not only that aspect of whether the man is entitled to it. 
    But they're also passing upon the questions of foreign relations all the time and whether or not some foreign country violated the Geneva Convention because if they don't find that, the man is entitled to the blame and several of these categories. 
    And if they do find it, then they're in -- they're right down in the heart of -- of foreign relations problems like Congress had seen fit in -- before and time after time provide the Secretary of State or the State Department shall have control of that situation for obvious reasons.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2270.714" stopTime="2271.730">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    But it didn't in this case.
speaker="j_lee_rankin" startTime="2271.730" stopTime="2273.360">
    Mr. J. Lee Rankin 
    It -- it didn't in this case.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2273.360" stopTime="2342.506">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    That's why -- perhaps to get further like to the -- when I said I wasn't sympathetic with the Myers case, my lack of sympathy derived from declaring unconstitutional the limitation such as Congress have placed upon it which this Court nullified. 
    Then along come Humphrey, and it goes on to my reading of it the consideration of the intrinsic things that these functionaries do and he seems to make a distinction between executive in the sense, a part of the President's business. 
    The fellows who -- in this vast establishment of ours, who are his various agencies, his functionaries, means of carrying out his job for the improvement? 
    And therefore, I should think Humphrey's (Inaudible) you got to look to the intrinsic kind of the thing that a body does. 
    And if it is -- doesn't -- is charged with determining issues not unlike extensions, what courts do that if -- a federal case -- to the Humphrey, they didn't.
speaker="j_lee_rankin" startTime="2342.506" stopTime="2343.463">
    Mr. J. Lee Rankin 
    Yes.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2343.463" stopTime="2414.066">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Then -- then if you've got a Commission, a bargain, making these positions, the vastness of the firm doesn't make him different. 
    The fact that Congress could as you say and has done in the past that the Secretary of State do all this because it does involve foreign relations. 
    When Congress hasn't done that, has appointed a Commission, did on fact, the way the Court of Claims has -- do all the time and make awards and doesn't give corrective means, doesn't make the determination subject to the final determination of some functionary or some completed function as the President, the Secretary of State whom he could fire at will. 
    That's not a nice word to use by the way, (Inaudible) displace at will. 
    But (Inaudible) what they say in passing on whether John Smith has a good claim final, then -- then I am much interested to have it differentiated from what is the heart, to me at least, and what was also a surprise, I was surprised by both of the decisions, if I may say so. 
    Yes, the heart of the Humphrey's case.
speaker="j_lee_rankin" startTime="2414.066" stopTime="2485.526">
    Mr. J. Lee Rankin 
    Well, I -- I can go a long with you quite of ways on your statement and that seems to me that Myers does hold that where you're dealing with the executive branch itself and the officers that the President is responsible for that there cannot be a limitation to power. 
    And then it seems to me that Humphrey goes into the question of the function of the activity, but it also analyzes the function with regard to being quasi legislative and quasi-judicial and you will recall that Justice (Inaudible) said, “There is no executive activity or a power exercised of any kind.” 
    And there might be some question about whether that went a little too far in such a statement as that. 
    But here, this is not by its nature, a court action. 
    This is not exercising the judicial power of the United States. 
    This is exercising the -- the preliminary question of whether do the claim comes within the standards of the statute.

    And if they established whatever the statute provides in regard to that, there -- it's presumed that they will be paid. 
    But that's entirely different from the case or controversy in the judicial system. 
    And therefore, it's an entirely different problem as to whether or not the President should have the power of removal of the Commissioner. 
    Now, there was a provision in this statute that was comparable to that in the Federal Trade Commission case and that was a requirement, a report to the Congress which was made through the President. 
    And we think if that was made to the President, is no -- makes no real difference about that being a function as an agency of the Congress, but that report was all completed before this petitioner entered to find his office at all. 
    And so, we think that that cannot be relied on in any way. 
    Now, in regard to the quo warranto, this action as --

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr.

    Mr. J. Lee Rankin 
    That's right. 
    Now, this quo warranto proceeding was brought by the petitioner in the District Court against the new appointees to the Commission that the President substituted. 
    And in that proceeding, the Court held that there was no limitation by Congress upon the power of removal and an appeal was taken and after the appeal was taken, the Reorganization Act was approved by the Congress and it expressly did brought to an end this -- this particular Commission and substituted a new one that combined -- that a Commission then in being and this particular Commission under a new name and that became moot at that time then. 
    And the case was -- the appeal was stipulated to be dismissed and we think that that is a collateral estoppel and conclusive upon the petitioner in this case with regard to the fact that there are no limitations by the Congress on the power of the President to remove in this case. 
    And this Court has held to that effect in the Munsingwear case where it applied this rule to the Government.

    Yes. 
    We -- we presented the question in our answer and briefed it in the Court of Claims and we think that it is conclusive, not on -- on the question of whether he can sue for payment which is a different claim than the quo warranto but is conclusive on the question of whether or not there was any limitation on the power of the President to remove because that's exactly what the quo warranto proceeding involved and we say it's a substance rather than a form of a proceeding that counts. 
    And that in fact the United States was the -- the real party or at least of privity in that proceeding.

    Mr. J. Lee Rankin 
    Well, because the -- the incumbents were claiming they had a right to the office and the petitioner was claiming that they had no right because he was occupying it and it was that question that the United States of course was the -- that party of real interest as to the proper construction of this principle on the right of removal.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="3200.014" stopTime="3213.823">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    In other words, the best way, it was predicated on the President's power of removal and the verdict favorable to the defendants necessarily had to determine that issue favorably to the Government's position because that did have a power, is that right?

    If -- it isn't a square res judicata because the Courts of Claims has held in a number of case that we cite in the brief that they're still free to bring this action, not this -- in this particular case, but a similar type of action for the amount of salary they would have received even though they do not win their case about reinstatement before the District of Columbia.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Wachtel.
speaker="i_h_wachtel" startTime="3676.683" stopTime="3884.713">
    Mr. I. H. Wachtel 
    I don't mean to be suspicious about a very important case like this, but I might say to the Court that some 75 or a 100 regular practitioners in the Court of Claims would like very much to know that this is the position the Government takes on res adjudicata, because scores -- scores, literally scores of paid cases in the Court of Claims determined in the Courts, the District Courts in favor of an employee of being re-litigated in the Court of Claims on the very question of the first right to remove him. 
    And if the Government is right that this is res adjudicata, then I can say that every case where the Government has won in the District Court and the District Court has upheld the right to discharge that all of these people are going to lose their cases. 
    Because in the Court of Claims today, the Government takes the position that in the District Court proceedings, the United States of America is not a party. 
    I hesitated before to render a judgment in response to an inquiry from Mr. Justice Frankfurter, but if we are going to continue to maintain the fiction that when a suit was brought against Mr. Sawyer, the Secretary of Commerce is -- was in the Steel case, that it was not a suit against the United States. 
    It was going to follow the concepts that we did in Lukens Steel and Larson versus foreign and domestic commerce. 
    But these are suits against an individual for failure to comply with the law and these suits are not binding on the United States of America. 
    This is the position this Court has taken and it's a position which the Department of Justice takes consistently in the Court of Claims that every time a veteran, a Government employee is successful in the District Court, the District Court has no authority to order him back to work. 
    All it can say, he was improperly removed, failure to comply perhaps with the Veteran's Preference Act or any one of a number of reasons. 
    When that employee wins in the District Court, he knows inevitably he can't get back on the payroll, but all he can do is now go into the Court of Claims and get a judgment for X dollars from that time on until the date of judgment. 
    And the Government has regularly as it did in this case, as it does all the time come into the Court of Claims and take the position, “We were not a party to the suit in the District Court. 
    You didn't sue the United States of America because you couldn't sue the United States of America.” 
    It didn't give its consent to be sued.

    Well, if a person or a defendant dies, is that case used to a basis on the ground of mootness on the background of death?

    Mr. I. H. Wachtel

    Mr. I. H. Wachtel 
    In the -- in the Munsingwear case, if Your Honor please, what had happened was that the Government, the price control administrator had withdrawn the regulation. 
    He had a suit pending in the District Court for treble damages and for injunctive relief. 
    He held up the suit for treble damages trying to get injunctive relief to try to stop Munsingwear from allegedly violating an OPA regulation.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="3932.495" stopTime="3933.901">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    The law was changed.
speaker="i_h_wachtel" startTime="3933.901" stopTime="4004.989">
    Mr. I. H. Wachtel 
    While the case was on appeal, pending in the Court of Appeals, OPA withdrew the regulations that there was nothing to enjoin. 
    There was no stipulation on the Court, the Court itself in its decision dismissed on the grounds and mootness. 
    When they went back to try the fundamental question of treble damages, the alleged violator raised the question as to whether or not the decision of the District Court which had held that there had been no violation warranting injunctive relief was not res adjudicata on the treble damage count. 
    This case came all the way up to this Court and this Court held that there was a method of vacating the District Court judgment. 
    The Government should have done it. 
    It didn't do so. 
    Now, I say to the Court that this case is different. 
    The United States' Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia has this rather peculiar Rule 21. 
    Ordinarily, we know that where you --
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="4004.989" stopTime="4006.153">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    That's just a local law.
speaker="i_h_wachtel" startTime="4006.153" stopTime="4208.887">
    Mr. I. H. Wachtel 
    That's -- it's a local rule. 
    It doesn't tie in to any federal rule that I know of and -- and the reason for it is that if I may speculate for a moment, it results primarily from the tremendous volume of -- of personal injury cases where during the course of an appeal when the -- perhaps the transcript is in one of the briefs, sir, and the case is settled and rather didn't have to go to the Court and have the Court prepare -- have order prepared. 
    The Court by Rule 21 authorizes the clerk to -- it says dismiss. 
    I think really what it is, a strike from the calendar, but I'm not prepared to debate that with you -- with the Court or with the Government. 
    The clerk then takes and sends a certified transcript of this stipulation back to the clerk of the Municipal Court. 
    This of course is not in the record, but I'm advised that the clerk of the District Court, he simply doesn't know what to do with it. 
    He just enters it in the docket. 
    But this particular stipulation has been filed in the Court of Appeals and that is the evidence. 
    I've been unable to find any cases in the District Court construing this. 
    I -- I understand that the Court of Appeals is aware of the Munsingwear case and it has been as I observed. 
    I can't cite you the specific case. 
    It's careful on cases that come up that are dismissed from a -- mootness in the case of death or things of that sort, to send it back to the District Court with specific instructions to dismiss finally so that this problem of mootness does not come up. 
    But here, I think there's a more important question than the -- the strict question of res adjudicata, to have this type of a question raised at this late stage and have a determination made on a matter that I suggest to Your Honors a cursory reading of the docket at the Court of Claims will show pay case after pay case where the Government comes in and says, “We're not bound by that.” 
    And it may not surprise Your Honors that most times when they do re-litigate the question in at least two cases in the Levee case and in the O'Brien case when the Government re-litigated the question in the Court of Claims, the favorable decision of the District Court was in fact reversed. 
    And an employee who came to the Court of Claims thinking he had nothing more to do than what we call a 39 (c) proceeding to determine how much salary was coming to him finds himself confronted with the defense that his discharge was proper or that there was good cause for it and he losses this case. 
    That is precisely what happened to the O'Brien case. 
    This is to those who practice in the Court of Claims, the leading case in the Court of Claims on this subject that we don't have res adjudicata when we bring an action in the District Court and if successful and then go to the Court of Claims.

    This appendix was prepared after the War Claims Commission went out of existence. 
    The statutory appendix purports -- sets forth the War Claims Act of 1948 -- sets forth the War Claims Act of 1948 as it existed at the time this congressional document was prepared in January of 1956. 
    The War Claims Act as it existed at the time the petitioner was removed and as it existed as it was at the time it went out of business by virtue of the Legislative Reorganization Act is different. 
    It is not different from substantially in substance, but it is a different Act and I'm sure that the Solicitor would join with me in suggesting that in studying the War Claims Act of 1948, that the Court (Inaudible) said at the very public law and not the Act as it appears in this Court.

    I mean, what (Inaudible) are different?
speaker="i_h_wachtel" startTime="4436.683" stopTime="4481.381">
    Mr. I. H. Wachtel 
    The Act as it appears in -- in the appendix Mr. Justice Black talks about the Fund Claims Settlement Commission. 
    It has no reference to the provisions which are the key provisions in this case and that is that he shall be appointed, as term shall expire when Commission's function shall expire. 
    I haven't in the few weeks that we've had to prepare this case since the receipt of the Government's brief. 
    I've been able to go over the language word for word, but I'm quite sure that as I say that the Act should be read in its context and in its form as it was when the Commission expired.

    Mr. I. H. Wachtel 
    Yes, it is, Your Honor. 
    I would like to just in the few moments left of me to suggest to the Court that the argument made by the Solicitor is the old argument that we've heard ever since this country established that the founding fathers might have set up a much more efficient way of running this Government. 
    Certainly, the impeachment procedure is cumbersome. 
    Certainly, the procedure of having Congress enact laws and giving the President the right to veto them, there are more efficient ways to adopt laws. 
    There are more efficient ways to enforce crime, but this is not the issue in this case. 
    I suggest to the Court that the question is not what is the most expeditious way to remove these people, but what is the best way of keeping the three great departments separate. 
    Truly, there may be arguments made that -- and we hear them from time to time in recent years that some of our judges should be removed or some of our courts should be eliminated that we might perhaps run our Government. 
    We might uncover subversives and criminals and put the dope addicts in jail with much more dispatch, but that isn't the question. 
    I suggest to Your Honor that what we have here is an agency performing legislative and judicial powers, functions, effectuating them. 
    It doesn't handle them incidentally the way the Secretary of the Treasury might if Congress delegated it to him. 
    If the Secretary of Treasury were to exercise one of these functions, this would be incidental to its other functions, but it isn't the Secretary that makes Section 8 reports. 
    It isn't the Secretary that carries out Congress' function to pay the debts and to create rights and to adjudicate them. 
    Thank you very much.

    With reference to this collateral estoppel point, I noticed on page 7 of your reply brief, you say that the stipulation was made to dismiss the appeal. 
    Then you set forth in the agreement and the agreement says that the cause is to be dismissed. 
    Do you make any distinction out of that fact?
speaker="i_h_wachtel" startTime="4647.745" stopTime="4717.057">
    Mr. I. H. Wachtel 
    I may make public confession that I say sometimes that's good for the soul. 
    Had we been aware, and I think my adversary, Mr. Hickey (ph), had we both been aware of the importance of the Munsingwear case, this stipulation never would have been drawn in its fashion because both Mr. Hickey (ph) and myself knew that this case was going to the Court of Claims. 
    What we wanted to do is to get this case out of the Court of Claims -- out of the Court of Appeals because under 28 U.S.C. 1500, you can't bring an action in the Court of Claims while there's another action pending in another Court. 
    We knew that we could never get a decision out of the Court of Appeals because if we didn't get rid of the case, the Court of Appeals would have done it on its own motion and we would've had to go forward, print up the record, print briefs, and go forward with the whole case. 
    So, again, I say this is not part of the record and -- but that was the intent that the parties go right back to where they were at the beginning.

   Rebuttal of J. Lee Rankin
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="4726.865" stopTime="4745.734">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    General, would you tell me please what the difference is in the position that the Government in this wage cases that Mr. Wachtel told us about in the Court of Claims and this one so far as your collateral estoppel is concerned.
speaker="j_lee_rankin" startTime="4745.734" stopTime="4918.225">
    Mr. J. Lee Rankin 
    All I can relate is what I was told about it when I inquired about the difference between this being a equitable estoppel and the collateral estoppel and res judicata. 
    And res judicata would dispose of the cause while the equitable or collateral estoppel might very well not dispose of the entire rights. 
    The problem is that they're asking for reinstatement in the District Court, as I understand the procedure, I handled those cases. 
    And that is an independent right that they have under the law whether they later sue for amount of salary or wages during the interim or not and if they're denied the reinstatement, they might still obtain the payment depending upon the action which is not the same action. 
    It's an independent right that is -- has been denied them, they claim in the Court of Claims. 
    So, res judicata would be if it was exactly the same right is being demanded in both Courts then the proof. 
    I'm advised by Mr. Davis who has worked for this matter that the Court of Claims has held there is no res judicata and we have acquiesced in that position of the Court of Claims. 
    But there is a difference in regard to collateral estoppel. 
    And we have tried to make it very clear in this brief that we think that the petitioner is bound by the decision of the Court, the Court, the District Court of the District on this element that there was no limitations on -- on the President's power. 
    Now, insofar as that is an element in this case, we think that's decided, but it may not be decisive with the Court if I make that point clearer. 
    We did call the Court's attention to it in our opposition as far as a footnote but it wasn't adequate for the development it made here (Inaudible).
