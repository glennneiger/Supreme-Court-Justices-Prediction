    Mr. Joseph Forer 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    This is a deportation case. 
    The petitioner, Frank Bonetti, was born in France of Italian parentage. 
    In 1923, when he was 15 years old, he entered to the United States and then was admitted for permanent residence as a quota immigrant. 
    In the depression year of 1932 in Los Angeles, he joined the Communist Party of the United States. 
    And sometime during 1936, he dropped out of the Communist Party. 
    He understood that communism meant the public ownership of the principal means of production. 
    And he did not believe that the Communist Party stood for the violent overthrow of the Government. 
    It is interesting that in both 1932 when Bonetti joined the Communist Party and 1936 when he left the Communist Party, the presidential ticket in California, in those election years, included candidates on the Communist Party ticket. 
    Some months after Bonetti left the Communist Party, on June 28, 1937, he left the United States and went to Spain to fight on the side of the Spanish Republic in the Abraham Lincoln Brigade. 
    He did so as he testified because he felt that Franco, in the Franco rebellion, was an instrument of Mussolini and Hitler and he felt that the Rome-Berlin Axis were not stopped in this particular aggression in Spain, they would persist in aggression until the a World War would start. 
    Bonetti was in active combat in Spain, was wounded and lost a foot. 
    Late in September of 1938, he returned to the United States with a visa and was stopped (Inaudible). 
    He was given a hearing before a Board of Special Inquiry to determine whether or not, he should be admitted. 
    At this hearing, he testified fully to his having been a member of the Communist Party between 1932 and 1936 and he testified that he had fought in Spain on the side of the Spanish Republic. 
    The Board of Special Inquiry ordered him excluded. 
    That was appealed and that decision by the Board of Special Inquiry was reversed by the -- in Washington, by the Immigration and Naturalization Service. 
    So that on October 8, 1938, for the second time, but that he was admitted for permanent residence, under the new quota of for that year, as a quota immigrant and as a new resident. 
    Since that day, of October 8, 1938, when he was readmitted, he has resided in the United States, in California.

speaker="joseph_forer" startTime="210.384" stopTime="228.111">
    Mr. Joseph Forer 
    He could've been excluded in 1938 for just about any reason that the immigration authorities wanted to exclude him. 
    He could not have been -- there was no provision of law in 1938 which excluded persons who had previous -- who had before been the members of the Communist Party.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="228.111" stopTime="230.235">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Is that the law now, or wasn't been --
speaker="joseph_forer" startTime="230.235" stopTime="688.686">
    Mr. Joseph Forer 
    That is correct. 
    Now, he has resided in the United States since his second entry in October 1938. 
    In the summer of 1939, he did leave the country for a one-day trip to Mexico and returned the same day or the next day. 
    He has not belonged to the Communist Party since he left it in 1936, so the -- he has not belonged to the Communist Party at any time since he came back to the United States and for some time before that. 
    In 1942, Bonetti married a native born American citizen, to whom he is still married and he became the stepfather of her two children. 
    In 1940, Bonetti obtained his first citizenship papers and in May of 1943, he filed a petition for naturalization. 
    The Immigration and Naturalization Service interviewed Bonetti in 1944 and 1946, about his citizenship application. 
    In those interviews he testified to having been a member of the Communist Party in the period mentioned and to have been fought in Spain. 
    His application was not further processed, and it wasn't passed, and he just never became a citizen. 
    On September 23rd, 1950, 14 years after Bonetti left that party, the Congress enacted over the President's veto, the Internal Security Act. 
    Also known as the McCarran Act, Section 22 of that Act, "Provided for the first time, for the expulsion of any alien who was at that time was entering the United States or has been at anytime thereafter, a member of the Communist Party of the United States." 
    A year or so later in October of 1951, the Immigration and Naturalization Service instituted deportation proceedings under this provision against Bonetti and he was ordered deported under that provision. 
    In the deportation proceeding, the sole evidence of his past membership in the Communist Party, which was the ground on which he was deported, consisted of Bonetti's own admission, namely, the testimony that he gave before the Board of Special Inquiry at his exclusion hearing in 1938, the statement that he made on his alien registration form which asked the question what organizations had he ever belonged to. 
    The statements he made to officials of the immigration in -- of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, when they interviewed him in 1944 and 1946 on his application for naturalization and the statement he had made to an Immigration and Natural -- Naturalization Service Investigator. 
    After Bonetti had exhausted his administrative remedy, he filed suit here in the District of Columbia for declaratory judgment and to enjoin the deportation, the District Court gave summary judgment in favor of the Government. 
    This was affirmed by the Court of Appeals. 
    Now, the statute under which petitioner was ordered deported, that is the Internal Security Act, as well as the current Immigration and Nationality Act, which the court below mistakenly could apply, but which technically does not apply, but we make no point to that because obviously, both acts should have to be interpreted the same. 
    But both statutes provide for the expulsion of any alien who was a member of the Communist Party at the time of or after entry. 
    Neither statute provides for expulsion of an alien merely on account of Communist Party membership before entry. 
    In this case, the alien made three entries, in 1923, 1938 and 1939, respectively. 
    He was a member of the Communist Party after his first entry. 
    He was not a member of the Communist Party after or at the time of, either of his last two entries. 
    So the precise question of statutory construction, which is involved here, is which of petitioner's three entries is included in the statutory phrase which expels aliens for Communist Party membership, "After entering the United States." 
    Now, we believe that the statute refers only to Communist Party membership after the last of several entries and if we are right, then the petitioner is obviously not deportable under the statute. 
    But before turning to the affirmative reasons in favor of this interpretation, I want to deal first with the grounds on which the court below held that after entry or after entering in the statute, means after any of several entries or after any (Inaudible). 
    The court below pointed out that the word "entry" is defined by the Immigration and Nationality Act, to mean subject to limitations that don't apply here, "Any coming of an alien into the United States from a foreign place." 
    This definition corresponds to and was derived from the case definition which had evolved prior to the Immigration and Nationality Act. 
    The court below said, â€œWell, since an entry is any coming, a statute which expels for a membership after entry means membership after any entry." 
    Now, this is plainly a non sequitur. 
    The statutory definition of entry merely describes what kind of an arrival constitutes an entry. 
    The phrase, "any coming" is used in the section qualitatively, as it were to mean a coming of any kind subject to certain specified exceptions. 
    For example, it means the coming for permanent residents or as a visitor, or as a seaman, or in transit, or as stow away. 
    The exclusions from the definition are also qualitative. 
    For example, an entry doesn't include a coming preceded an involuntary departure, nor does it include a coming which consist of a passage by sea from one American port to another, although exceptions being -- having been first developed by cases in this Court. 
    Now, it's simply a distortion of language to treat a definition of what kind of conduct, what kind of coming constitutes an entry as -- is positive of which particular coming of several comings, is referred to by other sections of the Act. 
    The fact that a -- an entry is any kind of coming just does not mean that every statutory reference to entry means any entry.

speaker="joseph_forer" startTime="766.106" stopTime="779.195">
    Mr. Joseph Forer 
    Well, as far as I know, this -- the Immigration Nationality Act is the first time that Congress defined the phrase in so many words. 
    Up to then the phrase was defined by this Court. 
    Now --
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="779.195" stopTime="785.158">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    If the case is that had defined the phrase did not give it to connotation that you call a qualitative connotation.

    Does it --
speaker="joseph_forer" startTime="785.982" stopTime="860.112">
    Mr. Joseph Forer 
    That's my point and that's what I'm coming to. 
    The case definition was spelled out in litigation which centered about the question of what kind of arrival constitutes an entry. 
    It did -- did not center about the question presented here which is -- which of several entries is critical for determining status. 
    And this includes the Volpe and Claussen cases on which the Government relies. 
    In the cases in this Court, which developed the meaning of the term, "entry", it was always assumed that the last entry was the critical entry in determining status and the question which was always argued and considered was whether or not, a second coming was by its nature, an entry. 
    For example, the original problem was an assertion that when an alien who has resided in this country left the country without giving up his domicile, and tending to come back, stayed out for a brief period and then returned. 
    And it was argued that his return was not a coming because -- it was not an entry, because entry meant coming in for a permanent stay.

    This man made reentries by any definition, by the statutory definition and by the case definition. 
    But the statute says "Refers the membership after entry and that therefore, the question is, which entry does it refer to and the only point I'm trying to make is that the court below oversimplified the matter by thinking that it could discover the meaning of the phrase, "after entry", merely by discovering the meaning of the word, "entry".

    Now, I -- I want to get on to the affirmative reasons why we think that after entering in the statute, refers to following the last entry and only the last entry. 
    First of all, this is in accordance with the general scheme of deportation legislation. 
    It is a general feature of the immigration statute that -- and this particularly true of the deportation statutes referring to the expulsion of political radicals. 
    It's a general scheme of these statutes that once an immigrant has satisfied the admission requirements, he is not thereafter expelled for pre-entry conduct or pre-entry characteristics. 
    As a general rule, when new causes for expulsion were enacted specially for radicals, they were given retroactive effect only to the time of entry or the period after entry. 
    This represents the policy not to upset a governmental determination of the alien suitability on the count of pre-entry conduct, which did not disqualify them under the law existing at the time of entering. 
    It recognizes that once the Government has adjudicated the alien's suitability, it would be a breach of good faith if after the alien has rooted himself in this country. 
    The determination of suitability is changed because of conduct which preceded the determination. 
    But it is also established that the governmental determination of suitability is made with each entry made by an alien. 
    A resident alien who leaves the country even for only a day is under the theory of the immigration laws, a newcomer on his return, so these two principles therefore, operate together. 
    First, a governmental determination of suitability protects the alien against expulsion for pre-entry conduct. 
    Second on each entry, there is made a governmental determination of suitability as if the alien were a newcomer. 
    It follows that the latest governmental determination of suitability that is the last entry provides -- protects the alien against expulsion for conduct which preceded that, namely the last entry. 
    Now normally, these principles operate to the disadvantage of the alien. 
    For example, the alien maybe expelled for committing a crime involving moral turpitude within five years after entry. 
    Under the principle that a returning alien is a newcomer, this five year probationary period starts afresh everytime the alien steps across the boarder and back. 
    But there is no reason for applying the theory that the reentering alien is a newcomer whenever it makes the alien verso and discarding it in the more unusual case like here in which it makes him better off. 
    This principle that it is the latest entry which is critical is -- manifested in the text of Section 241 (a) which is the deportation section of the Immigration and Nationality Act. 
    Subdivision 6 to that section provides for expelling persons who are members of the Communist Party after entry. 
    But subdivision 1 of that section expels aliens who were excludable at the time of their entry, including persons who are excludable at the time of entry if they entered without a valid immigration visa. 
    And subdivision 2 expels aliens who entered without inspection. 
    Now, it is impossible to contend and I am sure that the Immigration Service would not contend that an alien who is lawfully admitted on a proper visa and after inspection is expellable because on some earlier occasion, he had stole it into the country and then left on his own volition. 
    If that were the case, a privilege of voluntary departure which maybe extended to illegal entrance who have been ordered deported, in order to allow them to reenter lawfully, would be of no or little of value. 
    So it's clear and I don't think that the immigration service could contest it that subsection (1) of the deportation section, when it says that "Aliens shall be expelled if they were excludable at the time of entry," means excludable at the time of last entry. 
    And subsection (2), when it says that "An alien is expellable if he entered without inspection," means he is expellable if he last entered without inspection. 
    It should follow that subsection (6) when it says, "An entry is expellable -- an alien is expellable for Communist Party membership after entry," means after last entry. 
    Moreover, there is one subsection, subsection (13) of this deportation section in which Congress, for reasons of its own, chose to depart from the statutory scheme that is the last entry which counts. 
    And here Congress expressly used the words, "any entry". 
    So under one occasion in which Congress meant any of several entries to count and to be critical rather than just the last entry, it was able to and did expressly say any entry.

    Mr. Joseph Forer 
    It seems to me, can cite in the history of the Act, of any real relevance. 
    Now, at the very least, the statute is ambiguous and it is an accepted principle of construction often announced by this Court that deportation laws, because of their harshness, should be construed in favor of the alien. 
    Also, we believe that this construction avoids a serious question as to whether the statute is being unconstitutionally applied. 
    It was only with great misgivings that this Court sustained the validity of the statute expelling aliens for past Communist Party membership. 
    This case contains all the dubious features of the typical case under the statute and then adds others of its own. 
    Here, as in the preceding cases, an alien is being banished under a statute enacted years after the cause. 
    And what was this cause? 
    The peaceable exercise of constitutional rights of association and political advocacy, in these cases and the others, it is hard to see. 
    I think it is impossible to see any rational connection between the legislation and any of the powers delegated to Congress. 
    But here we also have something more. 
    We have here a breach of governmental good faith because that's what it is to expel an alien for a cause which she divulged on seeking entry and which was held not to exclude him. 
    This man came to our shores 20 years ago, crippled by having fought and risked his life in an antifascist war. 
    He disclosed to the Government his former connection of the Communist Party, a connection which arose from his idealism and doesn't fit some stereotyped conspiracy. 
    The Government decided that he was fit to reside in this country. 
    That decision shaped his life. 
    He took an American spouse. 
    He worked here, thereby, contributing to our society. 
    He fixed his roots here. 
    He permanently estranged himself from the country of his origin.

    It makes him excludable and if he comes back anyway, as -- because of negligent inspection or lack of inspection or because he doesn't make a full disclosure, if he comes back anyway, he is then deportable because he entered at the time of his last entry in violation of the exclusion laws.

    So the actual holding read the statute as if it read last entry, although they said that the prior entry was also an entry. 
    I truly admit that all three entries made here by Bonetti were entries, but that doesn't solve the problem of which entry Congress was referring to when they used the words, "Having been a membership in the Communist Party, after entering the United States."

    There's no more reason to read the word "any in", than to read the word, "last in". 
    And as I tried to show -- if you look at the current deportation section, you can't make any sense at all or can't reconcile yourself the practice with regard to aliens who came in without inspection or illegal entrance. 
    If you mean that an -- an alien can never come back with a visa without being expellable for a prior entry.

    Mr. Roger D. Fisher 
    The statute is harsh and it's for the Government and the Court to conclude the statute. 
    The -- there are four statutes involved here. 
    There is the 1918 Act, which Congress first made deportable aliens who had after entry become members of organizations advocating the violent overthrow of this Government. 
    At the basic act those persons who had after entry become members of such organizations. 
    In 1940, the statute was amended to make it apply to persons who have become but no longer were members of subversive organizations. 
    In 1950, the Communist Party of the United States was named in the statute as a party of which former membership were the grounds for deportation. 
    And then in 1952, the Immigration Nationality Act would (Inaudible) definitions were adopted. 
    This proceeding is governed by the 1950 statute of legislation, in effect, at that time. 
    The basic operative language as to going back and getting ex-members, however, was that putting the Act in 1940. 
    Petitioner's position in substance says that in 1940, when Congress was reaching back to make deportable ex-members of subversive organizations, organizations advocating to overthrow by force and violence, that at that time, all ex-members who had since leaving the party, decided continuously in this country, were to be deported. 
    All ex-members who at some time seem since (Inaudible) party had taken a trip and left the country and come back, were not to be deported. 
    We can -- you can take the ex-members of subversive organizations and put them in the two classes. 
    Those who since -- leaving the party, one of these organizations but not the Communist Party by name at that time as organizations advocating violent overthrow, take ex-members who had left the organization and resided continuously here, petitioner concedes all those persons must be deported under the legislation. 
    Aliens who had left the party years before, but who at some point had taken the trip or had left the country for good and come back and again, this -- this category of aliens with an additional foreign connection, were to be not deported. 
    Now, this is wholly inconsistent with every other provision of the Immigration and Naturalization laws in which in every case, the person who continues -- continuously resides in the United States and aliens who continuously reside here is preferred over the alien who has left the country and returned, who has had traveled. 
    Who was deported from the country and come back in.

    Mr. Roger D. Fisher 
    He is an alien in the United States who after entering the Untied States became the member of the Communist Party. 
    That -- but I -- I the -- the issue is far more -- I think the issue must to be resolved in terms of what Congress intended in the other legislative materials bearing on it, which petitioner says are not illuminating and which he totally ignores. 
    The -- I might also point out the time of his -- the problem of Mr. Justice Whittaker mentioned, the time -- the 1950 legislation, there were two other grounds for deportation under the 1940 Act then in effect, which had multiple acts." 
    An alien who at anytime after entry, shall have on more that one occasion, knowingly aided and assisted another alien from entering the United States, on more than one occasion." 
    Now, reading the statute as petitioner would have us read it, that alien once he's got one these occasions to his discredit, he can go into Canada and come back in. 
    A single such incident is not a grounds for exclusion. 
    He wipes that one off, comes back in and he can then go on, if he gets the other one. 
    Then he can go -- go outside the border and come back in, because this single one after entry is not a ground for deportation or not a ground for exclusion. 
    The same is true when -- of the then legislation and the present legislation as any alien who shall have been convicted more than once of violating the provisions of Title 1 of the Alien Registration Act. 
    Here again, are two convictions under the meaning given to the after entry by petitioner, after last entry. 
    Once an alien has one such conviction, he can take a trip and come back in. 
    I might say a single such conviction is not a ground for exclusion under the legislation.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Is that right?
speaker="roger_d_fisher" startTime="2713.736" stopTime="3225.780">
    Mr. Roger D. Fisher 
    It would've been illegal for him to enter the United States under the 1952 law as a former member of the Communist Party. 
    And under the legislation as drafted, an alien who enters and who is excludable at the time of his entry as such, then would -- he must be deported thereafter found to be, so that if he had made the same statements here, it would been an error to admit. 
    We do not have the case of whether, the administrative decisions, making a mistake, combined the Government thereafter from deporting. 
    We have the case here, I might say there are two alien, both of them were ex-members. 
    One of whom always stayed in this country. 
    There was no question raised about his right to resign here. 
    The law unquestionably requires a deportation as an ex-member. 
    Another alien who -- an ex-member went to Spain, came back. 
    No, there's no impropriety in going. 
    No impropriety in coming back. 
    Once he's here, he is -- certainly, we submit, no better off for having been legally admitted the second time, than the alien who continuously resided in this country. 
    Now, whether Congress intended aliens who took a trip, went abroad and reformed to -- intended to give them a different treatment I think is clear right from the beginning. 
    In the 1918 Act to which the provisions are printed in the supplemental memorandum made available for the Court, given the text to some of this law, that's on page 3. 
    The two line -- two sentences were put in there, the bottom sentence on the page 3 indicating the provisions on this section shall be applicable to the class of aliens mentioned in this act, irrespective to the time of their entry in the United States, has been carried forward continuously showing it is meant to apply to entries and long time back. 
    But the Section 3 of the 1918 Act appearing on page 4 of our supplemental memorandum, "Suppose that any alien who having been deported so thereafter returned, shall deemed guilty of a felony and deported again." 
    And there was some debate on that. 
    Mr. (Inaudible) thought this was pretty rough. 
    This was very severe. 
    He spoke of the alien who had some really and sincerely reformed having left the country and wanted to come back. 
    They asked at the end of his speech, is there anything that permit him to come back and of the country under existing law under this proposed law. 
    Mr. Burnett I think not and I do not think we should adopt anything that would, because it would open the door to too many cases of pretended reaffirmation. 
    Now, this was dealing with persons who were actually been deported, but it does indicate the total was that the fact person left the country and sincerely reformed and wanted to come in on a fresh start the proposal Mr. Burnett sponsored of the then bill, thinking in behalf of it, opposed the suggestion that he be allowed any reaffirmation. 
    Now, turning to -- and between 1918 and 1940, there are three cases decided by this Court, which I think are particularly significant, I'll discuss here in -- in connection with the -- the history of this legislation. 
    First of these, in 1929 is, Claussen against Day, which is -- where the question a -- an alien entered in 1912 and reentered in 1918 and in three years later was convicted in manslaughter and the problem was whether this is a conviction in fives years, after entry. 
    This Court held that it was and there was not -- the issue there and the issue in the Volpe case was not, I submit, a one of equality. 
    What kind of an entry in the sense of was it a visit or was it arrival. 
    The -- the Court projected the argument that the word, "entries" should be modified or limited in any way and said one petitioner landed at Boston and is returned from South America. 
    He made an entry within the meaning of the Act and the Court construed after entry as meaning after an entry and the second entry there accounted. 
    But the theory was not that it was after the last entry. 
    The theory was that it -- what he did prior to this deportable conduct was an entry, that's coming in. 
    Now, in the Volpe case, it was a -- it was a matter of a conviction of the crime involving moral turpitude prior to entry. 
    Volpe came to the United States, was here convicted of counterfeiting, left the United States and came back in. 
    This Court held that his -- his conviction of counterfeiting in this country was a -- a conviction of a crime of moral turpitude prior to entry -- prior to an entry. 
    We -- in the Court's opinion there, quoted in page 12 of our brief, "We accept that view that word, "entry" includes any coming of an alien from a foreign country into the United States, whether such coming be the first or any subsequent one." 
    Now, the -- the petitioner in his brief, in his footnotes, suggest that Volpe was not really arguing. 
    He was questioning whether the second coming was in fact, an entry. 
    Petitioner's brief in the Volpe case which I respectfully refer to the Court, does not make any such argument. 
    He speaks of this two comings as two entries, as they reentry and argue the question here that the word, "entry" should defined in one way so that pre-entry conduct should be pre first entry conduct rather than just any pre any entry, pre any entry conduct. 
    Now the -- in the third case, 1939 was Kessler against Strecker which this Court interpreted in the 1918 statute, as requiring the deportation only of those members of subversive organizations who were still members at the time the -- the warrant of deportation was served upon them. 
    They -- they found the statute had no -- the 1918 Act was not intended to reach persons who had left the party. 
    In 1940, right after that statute -- if I have that case was decided by this Court. 
    Congress amended and adopted the language -- the retrospective language we're here concerned with today. 
    In the 1940 Act, Congress repeatedly used the phrase, "entering in the concept of after entry", as they had before. 
    Now, that phrase it since then been defined clearly as meaning the first or any subsequent entry for purposes of grounds of deportation. 
    There was no attempt to modify, limit or change that broad definition. 
    However, in the Kessler and Strecker problem of former members, the Court -- the Congress did enact legislation to change the law as to that situation. 
    The purpose of the change was to deport former members of subversive organizations. 
    Now, the -- in supporting former members, the Senate report quoted on page 17 of the Government's brief, summarizing that proposed amendment and to also provide that any alien, I'm reading from the bottom, two lines of that page -- page 17, "Any alien who has been a member of such classes at any time after the admission to the United States for no matter how short a time or how far in the past, so long as there was act of (Inaudible) entry, shall be deported. 
    That we -- we regarded it's inconsistent for them to read providing he had not taken the trip abroad in the meantime, as being a reasonable legislative construction of the -- of the intent at that time. 
    That -- that if you read the way petitioner says that anytime after his admission, for no matter how short of time or how far in the past, so as long as after the date of his first entry and so long as he has not taken a trip abroad or left the United States, at any point since then.

    And I submit that -- in saying, "Oh, were just putting after last entry in there, you are changing congressional -- a policy of no -- no recovery for any ex-members of the subversive organizations. 
    They were not to be able to -- to reform and live in this country -- I could to the rest to the debate and other comments on the 1940 Act make this even more clear.

    Mr. Roger D. Fisher 
    I do not know, I couldn't find out. 
    I tried to find out why he done it that way and why this is happening, I'm unable to find out. 
    Now, there are two argument -- two reasons why I cannot accept your suggestion. 
    One is that the statute in the entire law used entry as meaning any coming and it's very hard to distinguish between the alien who -- who -- or they might come from a country such as alien with a quota has long backlog and who could not afford to leave the country and come in on a new quota with that long wait. 
    And the alien from a country which has no backlog on the quota list and could leave voluntarily and come in new quota, easily, they could come back in on a -- on this old one. 
    I -- I think the distinction that any such decision this Court would made would be making paper formalities of which type of paper came back in on that they get a reentry permit after his 16 months, or did he come in on new visa for 16 months? 
    As determinative when there's no indication that it should be and there is nothing in the statutory language or the regulations to slam any support to such a distinction. 
    The petitioner --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="3465.080" stopTime="3498.560">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Even if I don't understand that you say it's (Inaudible) suppose a man has come in (Inaudible) three days and went back, lived that 10 years and then he went through all the process in the American consulate and all that. 
    Finally, they gave him that is -- he's saying he came back told -- wrote the consul and people over here, came in and said where he had been, that -- that's more than a paper, isn't it?
speaker="roger_d_fisher" startTime="3498.560" stopTime="3566.865">
    Mr. Roger D. Fisher 
    It -- I don't know whether it take more time to fill out these forms or wait. 
    It would depend on what country it was coming from. 
    But what I'd like to call your attention to, Your Honor. 
    This statute here excluded henceforth all such persons from entering thereafter. 
    So there was not to be any forgiveness anybody coming in. 
    And the question we're -- we're examining is, did they mean as to that group who theretofore prior to the 1940 or 1950 amendment, theretofore had been members and no longer work. 
    It's only retrospective in this that's the only issue we're concerned with. 
    There's no more -- no one else can now save himself by going out and coming in from this particular clause, because they're excludable. 
    So, when Congress was dealing backwards with ex-members, do they mean to say all those who continuously resided in this country who had no additional foreign connection whatever, must be deported? 
    Whereas all those who had a foreign connection, whether it's one day or in the case you suggest, a longer period of time, a substantial foreign connection since being a member of the party, they can be allowed to remain.

    "We want those who have never sent, those aliens who have never been a member of such organization."
