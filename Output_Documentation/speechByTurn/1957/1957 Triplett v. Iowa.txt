Triplett v. Iowa

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    -- 47, Ernest Triplett, Petitioner, versus the State of Iowa. 
    Mr. Tacy.
speaker="thomas_o_tacy" startTime="15.608" stopTime="273.822">
    Mr. Thomas O. Tacy 
    Chief Justice Warren, Honorable Justices of this Court, may it please the Court. 
    This seemed to the petitioner to be a case where in the factual situation is infinitely more important than the legal situation. 
    In other words, the petitioner does not propose to spend a great deal of time on the legal questions involved here unless something new is raised by the respondent concerning the law. 
    I think it's conceded by both sides that this Court has the right in certiorari to review de novo the entire proceedings in a state court in a criminal case and to determine and make an independent determination as to whether the Fourteenth Amendment has been violated in due process of law, denied to the accused. 
    The -- without going to an extended argument now about the law, the recent decisions and the past decisions going back many years indicate that there should be no question about this proposition. 
    And now, to the facts of this case. 
    On August 31st, 1954, a little boy by the name of Jimmy Bremmers disappeared from his home, Sioux City, Iowa. 
    And about 29 days later, his body was found after extended search in a pasture about 6 miles from Sioux City out on a winding country road. 
    It happened at this time that Mr. Ernest Triplett who is the petitioner in this case was soliciting music lessons from parents in the vicinity where Jimmy Bremmers lived on the night he disappeared and on other occasions. 
    Now, a neighbor out in that vicinity called the Police Department in Sioux City and said there was a music salesman out here soliciting music lessons the night Jimmy disappeared. 
    And on that suspicion alone, Ernest Triplett was requested or his employer was requested to have Mr. Triplett wait for the police because they want to question him. 
    Now, this request for Mr. Triplett to wait at his employer's office, the Flood Music Company in Sioux City for the police came in about 9:30. 
    Mr. Flood testified as he didn't appear nervous at all. 
    He said, “Yes, I'll wait for them.” 
    He waited for them until 1:30 in the afternoon, went out and got his lunch and came back. 
    And then about 1:30 in the afternoon, they came to get him. 
    And Detective Dennison and Matousec, Sioux City Police, took him into custody where as the record shows here, he was detained without a warrant for a total of 20 or 21 days by the police and that interval of detention was interrupted twice by sending him down to the state hospital for mental treatment at Cherokee, Iowa near Sioux City. 
    Now, the first instance he was sent down there by the request, he says detective -- one of the detectives in Sioux City and that was on September 15th, 1954.

    Mr. Thomas O. Tacy 
    Well, that's -- that's what the record shows. 
    He says he went down there because he could rest better on the beds down there, he thought, than on the steel mattress, steel mesh in the jail of Sioux City. 
    Now, the question here -- the whole question here is whether this confession which was obtained and I want to make this a little bit short now at the present time. 
    This confession was obtained when he was taken to the mental hospital for the second time. 
    Now, after he was been jailed and questioned practically everyday for 20 days in the Sioux City Jail without being taken before a magistrate and there was one in the same building down the hall, the detectives admit that they questioned him everyday. 
    And when asked that when he reiterated over and over that he wasn't guilty, he wouldn't take no for an answer, and they said, “No.” 
    And the defendant testified, the accused testified. 
    That after he reached a certain point, that he didn't deny anything further, he -- and this is his language -- and showed you the character of the education or lack of the man. 
    He testifies there wasn't no use to deny nothing. 
    “You tell him and they would turn right around and shove it back in your mouth.” 
    That's his language in the record here, both in the briefs and in the -- in the record itself.

    Mr. Thomas O. Tacy 
    No, he was a long ways from his family, it seemed. 
    He had a brother in Oregon who is a preacher but he wasn't out there. 
    And he testifies he was trying to earn enough money in the music solicitation business to go up where his brother was. 
    But now, he was visited. 
    We'll, get this now. 
    He was visited after he was 29 days either in police custody, 20 days and in the hospital a part of the time. 
    He was approached by Stanley Corbett who was then the President of the Sioux City Bar Association and Stanley Corbett asked him if he wanted a lawyer. 
    And his reply was that he wasn't guilty of anything.He didn't know that he wanted a lawyer.

    I understood Mr. Corbett testified, and he went to see this (Inaudible) that he -- that he told him, all through that that was held against his will. 
    The department of police solved the murder.

    Mr. Thomas O. Tacy 
    That is what Mr. Corbett testified to. 
    Mr. Triplett testified he didn't, remember that. 
    But also, Mr. Triplett testified the reason he didn't want to get out on the street now was that the -- a detective --

speaker="thomas_o_tacy" startTime="570.119" stopTime="594.554">
    Mr. Thomas O. Tacy 
    Well, the reason why he said that Mr. -- a detective in Sioux City, the record will show his name, told him that it would not be good for him to get out on the street and let the public get a hold of him because what they want to do to you. 
    Now, that's in the record and it is uncontradicted. 
    And the detective who is supposed to have told him that was in the courtroom and so was the prosecutor and it isn't denied in the record.
speaker="charles_e_whittaker" startTime="594.554" stopTime="605.988">
    Justice Charles E. Whittaker 
    Well, is that consistent with that he is being detained against his will. 
    The -- that implies to me he was free to get out on the street but they didn't (Voice Overlap) --
speaker="thomas_o_tacy" startTime="605.988" stopTime="775.146">
    Mr. Thomas O. Tacy 
    No, the -- no, the -- Your Honor. 
    The implication there is that this detective that told him it wouldn't be safe for him on the street and the only thing that Stanley Corbett a lawyer, he was suggesting, was whether he wanted a lawyer. 
    Now, he wasn't advised to his rights to a lawyer and, Your -- Your Honor, I take -- we take this position. 
    Those men are not in position to set themselves up as a magistrate and decide whether this man wants a lawyer or not. 
    They're holding him there against the Iowa statute which is similar to the statutes of other states that they must take him before a magistrate without unnecessary delay and they're not doing that. 
    They're holding him there. 
    Now, he -- he testifies that he was afraid there. 
    That is that Mr. -- the detective had told him what would happen if he got on the street. 
    Now, here's something significant, Your Honor. 
    You'll find all through the record, in the -- in the brief and argument quoting the record that this man was not free to go. 
    He was always under police custody and was under arrest without a warrant all this time. 
    He was not free to go. 
    You will find that in the record. 
    And when this confession was taken, here was the circumstance. 
    Stanley Corbett visited him on October the 1st. 
    Then, according to the respondent's version of the defendant's testimony, he was then taken to the state mental hospital. 
    Then, now here's what happened after Stanley Corbett offered legal help. 
    The man was taken to the Commission on Insanity in Sioux City and committed to the state mental hospital again, and only three days elapsed before they got this confession from him. 
    And when this confession which is the gist of this case, whether it was voluntary or not, is the gist of this case, this confession was taken from him. 
    Now, on the 6th of October -- so between the 1st of October and the 5th of October, they took him to Sioux City and having him committed to Cherokee again where the lawyer couldn't have done anything if he'd wanted to. 
    And on the 6th of October now, five days after Stanley Corbett offered to help; his confession was gotten from him by chief of -- not chief detective but rather the psychiatrist within the -- the same hospital by the name of Dr.Azordegan.

    Yes, that's right and then they immediately took Mr. Triplett from the jail and took him out into the country where the boy's body was found and showed him a blanket covered body and -- and such as that. 
    Now, there is one thing I want to call the Court's attention to and I want to save a little of my time for rebuttal if necessary. 
    The reason they held this man is expressed in one sentence by William Dennison, the man who arrested him, and I asked him on cross-examination, “Why didn't you take this man before a magistrate as the law requires you to do before you got the confession instead of afterwards hold him in for some 20 days in the police custody?” 
    He said "Because I still thought he was guilty." 
    Now, they can say what the police about why they held him but that's the testimony of the chief detectives under whose custody was because he still thought he was guilty. 
    I'd like to save the rest of my time.

   Argument of Freeman H. Forrest

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Forrest.
speaker="freeman_h_forrest" startTime="1222.227" stopTime="1426.624">
    Mr. Freeman H. Forrest 
    Chief Justice, Associate Justices, may it please the Court. 
    This Court has recently interested itself in a number of cases similar to the one now before it. 
    The gist of these cases, that is those cases which pertain to state criminal prosecutions, has been to determine -- for this Court to determine whether or not and a confession obtained in the period of custody was obtained in such a manner as to violate the -- the petitioners or the defendants rights under the Fourteenth Amendment, that is whether or not the -- the confession was obtained by physical or mental coercion. 
    The test as recently reaffirmed in the Payne case on Monday remains. 
    It's the contrasting of the pressures that are applied to the person confessing as opposed to his power to resist. 
    That question as pointed out by the respondents certainly can -- or by the petitioner can certainly best be answered by a close examination into the facts. 
    I'd like to talk first about the general fact background and later, more particularly about some of the specific testimony given by both police officers, the trial court and specially the defendant himself. 
    The general facts in chronological order went about as follows. 
    On August 31, the lad disappeared. 
    At that time, the defendant was employed as a door-to-door solicitor and salesman on behalf of the Flood Music Company in Sioux City. 
    He was operating in the neighborhood in which the boy lived and from which he disappeared on the day that he did disappear. 
    When the disappearance of the boy became generally known, a search was instituted. 
    Also, word was passed to the police, to the Sioux City Police and thereupon on September 2nd, took him to the police station. 
    Shortly after he got to the police station, a private detective in Sioux City by the name of Matousec appeared and asked for a permission to question Triplett. 
    This was granted and there is no showing in the record that he was kept or in any way, inhibited from seeing the defendant. 
    Matousec's testimony was that he attempted to elicit information as to the crime by suggesting to the defendant that he would procure counsel for him, and this is substantiated by the defendant's testimony. 
    At that --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1426.624" stopTime="1429.776">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Isn't it before he was taken into custody, Mr. Forrest?

    Mr. Freeman H. Forrest

    Yes.
speaker="freeman_h_forrest" startTime="1435.417" stopTime="1479.676">
    Mr. Freeman H. Forrest 
    I am sorry that I do not enjoy the same circumstance as the petitioner for the -- that the petitioner's counsel does and that he tried the case in the lower court and I did not get it until it came to the United States Supreme Court. 
    But I'm -- I feel confident that the record will bare -- bare out that in the first few days of his custody, he was approached by Matousec and refused Matousec's in effect offer of counsel. 
    On September 15th, he volunteered to go to and was taken to the Cherokee Mental Health Institute for observation. 
    This is the wording of the record, “For observation and treatment of syphilis.”

    Mr. Freeman H. Forrest 
    Perhaps it may have, Justice Black. 
    And I do not -- I just don't know. 
    I'm not that well acquainted with the trial court situation which was in 1954. 
    While there, the body of Jimmy Bremmers was located. 
    The defendant was brought back from the mental health institute, taken to a place on the highway adjacent to the field in which the body lay. 
    The roadway there is considerably below the --it's -- in other words, it's a cut in a hill. 
    The defendant without instructions from anyone walked diagonally directly up bank. 
    I believe he went across to a point outside the fence, pointed to the body and said, what is that? 
    There was some evidence that he turned pale at the time that he did that. 
    After he viewed the body, he was returned to the Sioux City Police Station, kept there for a few more days. 
    It was at this time that the visit of the then Sioux City Bar Association President Stanley Corbett took place. 
    Mr. Corbett came in, asked to see the defendant. 
    Again, there was no inhibition. 
    He was allowed to see him. 
    And at that time, he -- in substance, what he asked him was, "Are you being held against your will?" 
    And he said, he was not being held against his will because he wanted to help the police solve the murder. 
    He was also asked or offered counsel to take his choice of counsel in the Sioux City area. 
    This, he steadfastly refused as he had done previously. 
    I should probably point out also that detective Dennison testified that on numerous occasions, three or four times in the period between 2 and 15th of September. 
    The first period of incarceration or custody that he asked him about -- if he wanted an attorney and he steadfastly refused the services of an attorney.

    Yes, sir. 
    Corbett's testimony was that he was not being held against his will and that he steadfastly refused the offer of services of counsel in the Sioux City area. 
    The defendant then was returned again at his own request to the Cherokee Institution, the mental health institute, and it was on this period that the confession was obtained. 
    As near as I can gather from what is in the record, what happened was that the mental institute people who help people down there called the Sioux City Police, had them come down. 
    They test -- the Sioux City Police testified that they did not know a confession was to be gotten that afternoon. 
    When they got there, they were taken in a room, there were three or four police -- two -- two police officers present. 
    Azordegan, the psychiatrist, who -- whose voice you will hear on Exhibit P which is with the Court.

    I would like to go at -- into some detail into the facts which -- most of which I have set out on pages 4, 5 and 6 I believe of -- well 4 through 10 of the State's brief beginning with Police Officer Dennison. 
    He testified that Mr. Triplett wasn't kept when he was in custody. 
    He slept regularly, was not interviewed for any sustained period of time that he said, quote, "I want to go along with you boys, I want to cooperate with you." 
    That Triplett volunteered to go to the Mental Health Instituted Charity. 
    Now, the volunteering on those things I think is better brought out by the fact that the petitioner does not contend that he was in custody any of the time that he was in the mental health institute.

    I think I should also point out this. 
    That under the Iowa statute, I believe it's 783.3, the Court is required to stop the trial and have a trial on the insanity issue if any evidence is presented to it either on its own motion or on the part of either party as to insanity of the defendant.

    No, sir. 
    You have considered a number of factors previously as the kind of pressure that when exerted on a certain personality, are sufficient to have violated the petitioner's rights under the Fourteenth Amendment. 
    Among those are age, comparative youth as you had in the Fikes case, education, you had in the Fikes case, mentality, you had in the Fikes case again. 
    But contrary to this, we have a 52-year old white man. 
    The Flood's testimony, that is, the people who employed him was that he was alert and active and a good salesman for them. 
    The testimony of the police was that he was alert. 
    Certainly his own testimony bears out the fact that he was articulate. 
    There is no problem on legality of arrest which you considered in Chambers versus Florida. 
    No problem on conditions of incarceration as in the Watts case.

    This is a question of delay of arraignment as in my classification. 
    In other words, the conditions at the time of his arrest were not violent in any way, shape or form. 
    That's what I meant to refer. 
    There was no period to prolong questioning. 
    Certainly, the record that the trial court made on page 16 verifies that there was no physical violence. 
    There was no deprivation of food and rest. 
    Triplett himself admitted he was given coffee and so forth. 
    There were no relays of long -- long relays of police officers, no emotional exhaustion that's shown in the record. 
    Triplett bragged about the fact that he was able to wear out the -- his questioners. 
    Counsel and friends were certainly admitted to see him. 
    He refused to take advantage or to use them in any way.

    Didn't he, Matousec?
speaker="freeman_h_forrest" startTime="3158.484" stopTime="3311.248">
    Mr. Freeman H. Forrest 
    Yes, sir. 
    He was subsequently employed by the defense counsel. 
    So that what we have is a lengthy delay. 
    The State does not -- does not deny that the delay was lengthy. 
    It does not deny that it was unlawful. 
    758.1 of the Colorado requires that he be taken forth with two magistrates. 
    What you have held in Stein, you have held in Alliance, that delay in arraignment alone is not sufficient. 
    That there must be something to -- to make a composite and we do not think the State's position is that there is no composite available here. 
    All there was, was the delay. 
    Additionally, we feel that the pressures that were exerted against this defendant as opposed to the kind of a defendant he was, and I do feel I must allude briefly to some of his testimony. 
    For example, “The only voluntary statement I made to seeing Jimmy Bremmers was that I -- that I saw some children playing in a nice yard but I thought one of them might have been him but I gave them a fabulous story on that. 
    I gave them a fabulous story on that other.” 
    Question, Mr. Triplett, “Do you have any reason why should -- why that you, under serious questioning for day after day that you were out rather easily?” 
    Answer, “Well, I wouldn't say that I wore out too easily. 
    I put a few of the big boys to sleep down there in the desk after I got on the desk. 
    After I got down to Cherokee, they appeared to take this tape recording. 
    I got the same amount of sleep there.” 
    “That's right, I'm denying everything I told the police. 
    Now if you want the truth, have doubts there.” 
    “Are you lying now or when you talked to the police?” 
    “I'm sworn in here. 
    You're not going to get me for perjury”. 
    We think that this shows the kind of a personality that it's going to take considerable pressure to be exerted on to take it to have deprived of him his -- of him -- him of his rights and we feel further that the only pressure that was exerted was this half-hearted almost voluntary custody of 20 days. 
    Thank you.

    And evidently induced Mr. Corbett to see him.

    Mr. Thomas O. Tacy 
    That's right.

    Not to offer himself as a lawyer he disavowed that completely and you accepted that disavowed. 
    What he said to the Bar, members of the Bar that he want a lawyer.

    Mr. Thomas O. Tacy 
    I consider Mr. Corbett a very reputable member of the Bar. 
    His intentions were good. 
    But I say that when he had a suspicion that this man's rights were being invaded, due process denied him, I think it was his duty if he was going to give the man any advice. 
    I think it was his duty to tell the officers to arraign him right there. 
    There were some (Voice Overlap) --

    May I suggest that he replied to your questions by saying he concluded after talking with Triplett.

    Yes.

    Mr. Thomas O. Tacy 
    He wasn't being held against his will. 
    That's -- yes, he concluded that.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="3656.420" stopTime="3658.374">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    I mean, did you ask him that question?
speaker="thomas_o_tacy" startTime="3658.374" stopTime="3659.360">
    Mr. Thomas O. Tacy 
    Yes, sir. 
    And he --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="3659.360" stopTime="3667.697">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    And he has very clearly answered. 
    He says, “No, I didn't think that,” he didn't say there was a violation of disregarding the local statute of proper arraignment.”

    Yes.

    It wasn't a voluntary confession. 
    It was a grueling cross-examination by four different people. 
    One attendant in the hospital had him in charge, one detective and two doctors got part in it. 
    There was no voluntary expression on his part.
