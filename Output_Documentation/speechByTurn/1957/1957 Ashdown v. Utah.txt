Ashdown v. Utah

    Mr. Walter L. Budge 
    -- your question without proper thought -- saved by the bell. 
    I think the law in the State of Utah is that you can -- a police officer can and may interrogate a witness whether or not they have asked for a lawyer. 
    So long as they do it in a proper manner consistent with procedural due process and the guarantees of the constitution, I would rely upon the case of Rust and Sullivan. 
    The Utah decision cited in my brief for that proposition.

    Including a failure to apprise, to tell the interrogated person what his rights are? 
    In other words, may the police suspect somebody, take him to whatever they take him to and begin to ply with question for hours if you will. 
    Never tell him that you don't have to talk if you don't want to talk, you may get a lawyer if you want a lawyer. 
    And yet allow your juries to find that that's voluntary, although there's an explicit absence of informing the questioned person that he has any rights of protection of that kind. 
    That's the basic thing I want to know about the law of Utah.

    May they then take him to police headquarters or in the -- the amenities of a courtroom and ply him with questions for five hours and allow the jury to find that that was voluntary, although at no time was he told, but if he chose, he could keep his mouth shut.

    Well, as I understand it would be the law in Utah. 
    That the mere refusal of counsel, when requested by a police officer would not be per se an infringement upon the constitutional right, that the Court would still want to know, the reviewing Court would still want to know how that it -- that was -- how the information was obtained and whether the -- it was coercion or threat or anything in that.

    Mr. Walter L. Budge 
    Well, it's -- it's my personal view, Your Honor, that an officer may do so, and that if he is denied the right to do so, that most crimes or murders premeditated at least will go unsolved. 
    And so, I feel that the officer should be able to interrogate even though the counsel has requested it. 
    I thank the Court. 
   
   
   
   Argument of J. Vernon Erickson
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="472.022" stopTime="478.553">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Judge Erickson.
speaker="j_vernon_erickson" startTime="478.553" stopTime="682.399">
    Mr. J. Vernon Erickson 
    I never really got at this case, but I certainly disagree with the counsel as to the procedure that was used in this case. 
    Then on, I think, the case I cite is Justice Sutherland, Powell versus Alabama, from that case, Justice Sullivan or Justice Sutherland says, “Even the intelligent and educated lay -- layman has small and sometimes no skill in the science of law. 
    If charged with a crime, he is incapable of determining for himself whether the indictment is good or bad. 
    He is unfamiliar with the rules of evidence. 
    Left without the aid of counsel, he may be put on trial without proper charges, and convicted upon incompetent evidence, irrelevant to the issue or otherwise admissible. 
    He lacks the skill and he lacks knowledge to prepare his defense, even though he have a perfect one. 
    He requires the guiding hand of counsel of every step in the proceedings against him." 
    That was our form of justice. 
    Now, I disagree very much with the Attorney Budge. 
    If Judge -- Budge had deprived this case or Callister, never would they use the procedure that was used by those officers. 
    Now the record discloses, I can give your record off. 
    I have in my record clear, if I can get this Court to read this record, there is no question in my mind whether there was coercion, we take this when -- was she advised over constitutional rights? 
    The record will tell you that. 
    They said they talked 15 or 20 minutes about family affairs. 
    That isn't true. 
    The record bears me on that. 
    Sherriff Nelson testified on direct examination that she was sought by this a few minutes after the questioning began. 
    Record 57, that's as soon as she arrived, mind you at the courtroom, at the courthouse, this lady wasn't in -- she thought she was in the trial. 
    They didn't go in the sheriff's office.

    She had -- said no. 
    She didn't know anything more about it and she did. 
    I know whether she used the words or not, but she admit that she didn't know anymore about it. 
    Well I said, "Mrs. Ashdown, the doctor still claims that Ray has been poisoned and we'd like to find out what happened and asked her if there was any chance that she made a mistake of any kind and put poison, lemon juice and thought it was salt." 
    And she didn't think she'll (Inaudible). 
    I asked her if she knew of any poison that was around the premises, then questioned Sheriff (Inaudible) asking Mrs. Ashdown if she had made a mistake. 
    Was Mrs. Ashdown informed as whether or not she needed to answer your questions? 
    Answer “I don't believe at that time. 
    I believe it was a little later when we advised her.” 
    When you advised her of her constitutional rights? 
    I don't believe that was right on the start -- start record shows page 56 and 57. 
    And you kept (Inaudible) in there, three hours questioned her by reading the statutes to her, defining manslaughter and she didn't even -- wasn't even charged with murder.

    He advised her of her constitutional rights that was later on.

    "Would it be three?" 
    "I wouldn't say that." 
    "Could you guess at that time like you could two minutes?"

    Now, regarding Patrick Furman, the District Attorney who was present at the hearing the past -- the time has set forth in the brief. 
    There's no question. 
    I can't figure when that law -- that was our jury. 
    But that was supposed to be her constitutional rights (Inaudible) 
    There's no dispute about that at all. 
    He brings out the statutes of the State of Utah and he reads those statutes to Mildred Ashdown. 
    She would no more know what those statutes were. 
    And at that time, he says he defined the crime before he knew anything about it. 
    He says, “Mildred, you better tell the truth that I was in the Army and I killed five men,” and thereby telling the truth, “I was exonerated. 
    I might have faced a firing squad. 
    I will tell you the truth. 
    It helped me. 
    It helped me because I suspect now, I only read two statutes,” he said to her. 
    That's in the record pointed out to the Court and said, “Was man -- was murder in the first degree or voluntary manslaughter?” 
    That could've happened in this case. 
    There was only one verdict should be given, couldn't have been manslaughter. 
    It was an accident trying to make her believe that she'd know a man. 
    She -- she just said, "Well, it was just an accident." 
    And then that concluded that he could bring an action for manslaughter, which was -- which is about reading the statutes to her.

    That is -- no, it wouldn't be double jeopardy, but this goes back for a new trial. 
    That's correct. 
    Now -- now, we will take the -- directly, after the funeral, she was taken in to be questioned, that was directly. 
    The sheriff had notified her brother-in-law to bring her to Court and they did bring her there. 
    I -- there isn't a record for just how long the funeral lasted, but I think the Attorney General and I could agree that it's a -- Mormon funeral is -- is quite wrong. 
    She was taken there after. 
    She remained there and was questioned. 
    We'll leave the record to this and so I can pick it up and show it was a quarter to 10, but we'll say -- as the record say, "Continuous questioning, I've had, then asked for counsel." 
    She asked for counsel. 
    She's there maybe, but she was in there an hour or so but there's only one more question that's in that Court that she get (Inaudible). 
    Now, there were no stenographic reports. 
    How I wish there have been or a tape recording machine because all the officers, they differ as to the constitutional rights. 
    And as I read the testimony of (Inaudible) and Sheriff Nelson on direct examination was R.H. Benson and other deputy sheriff present during the conversation. 
    Nor, he was out on the hall started taking care of the door. 
    There was people trying to come in and out and we try to keep everyone out of the courtroom. 
    That's record 56. 
    Did he say he would like to talk to her alone? 
    Answer, “Yes.” 
    Her sister is with her at the time and her sister was in the sheriff's office that time, “Yes, sir.”

    Assuming that the record shows as the States as it does, that she was advised of her right to counsel. 
    Forget about 10 minutes, 15 minutes or what was said before that, but she was advised of her right to counsel on an early stage of this proceeding.

    Justice John M. Harlan 
    There get us -- forget about those new lawsuits in the testimony and let's suppose the case was clear in the record, that 20 minutes after she -- they started to interrogate her, she asked for counsel, that she was advised of a regular counsel and then didn't raise the question again until four hours later just after she confessed. 
    How does that affect your case?

speaker="j_vernon_erickson" startTime="1876.124" stopTime="2010.561">
    Mr. J. Vernon Erickson 
    That wouldn't affect it unless there is a waiver by her of counsel, a waiver. 
    Now the case they cite is Rust versus Sullivan, that isn't the endpoint at all. 
    We have a poor law in Utah on counsel. 
    We don't have a public defender at all. 
    We have a preliminary hearing, which the Court will not appoint an attorney even impunity; they don't have to do it. 
    That's the preliminary hearing. 
    He deprived the counsel. 
    Salt Lake City, we have three or four courts who lawyers presides over and then you see that they get lawyers. 
    They do that, but our Justice of the Peace is just a matter -- they'll advise him well. 
    We've got this preliminary hearing. 
    You can waive it and you can have a lawyer when you get to the District Court. 
    Now, that's Rust versus Sullivan case, but those boys, if you read Rust versus Sullivan, they waive their right to counsel. 
    They were intelligent but Mildred didn't. 
    It didn't. 
    Now the record -- the record bares me out in this case so it's not in point in my mind, but here we have a different situation at all where she was denied the right of a counsel. 
    How could the Court admit the -- the oral confession there when she makes the statement, he makes the statement, we didn't like to take the advantage of her that day, she was irrational and we wanted to know what she was doing.

    Mr. J. Vernon Erickson 
    Well, they were complaining out being hot. 
    It was hot so we served them a glass of lemonade and we go on further with Mr. R. H. Benson, the Deputy Sheriff present during the conversation. 
    No, he is out in the hallway, sort of taking care of the door. 
    There was people trying to come in and out and we tried to keep everyone out. 
    Now, go ahead and tell us what you said in the courtroom. 
    Well, I can remember most things. 
    I believe that I said, "I don't believe I could remember the things you said and the things that Wells said. 
    It's pretty hard to remember all of those things. 
    Will you tell us Sheriff the part of the conversation that you remember?" 
    "Well, I said to Mrs. Ashdown again and again, the doctors still claim Ray's has been poisoned and we'd like to find out what happened and asked her if there was any chance she'd made a mistake or any kind food poison or lemon juice and thought it was salt and she -- she didn't think so. 
    I asked her if she knew of any poison that was around the premises. 
    Sheriff, prior to asking Mrs. Ashdown if she had made a mistake was Mrs. Ashdown informed, as to whether or not she needed to answer your questions -- questions. 
    I don't believe at that time. 
    I believe it was later when we advised her -- when you advised her for constitutional rights. 
    I don't believe it was right on the start. 
    Pardon me for interrupting go ahead and tell us what happened to his folk. 
    We talked to her a few minutes before that, before you had explained her constitutional rights. 
    "Will you tell us as nearly as you can remember the words that were used in explaining Mrs. Ashdown's rights?" 
    "Yes. 
    We told her we wanted to advise her of her constitutional rights and she was entitled to an attorney that she didn't have to answer any questions unless she wanted to." 
    Question “Did she --" question that she didn't answer could be -- her question could be used against her in the Court if that came to Court. 
    I think that's about all you've told. 
    Was anything said to Mrs. Ashdown about? 
    She was free to leave the courtroom. 
    What was that? 
    Question “What was said to Mrs. Ashdown she was free to leave the courtroom as she cared to?” 
    Answer “My (Inaudible) don't believe about that -- believe (Inaudible) I don't remember about that.” 
    And after the sheriff who spoke on what was said. 
    Well, I believe we talked to her about -- we talked to her about whether or not she'd been out of town and place the last month. 
    So she did say that they had gone to (Inaudible). 
    I think the 10th or 11th, she told us a little about the trip.
