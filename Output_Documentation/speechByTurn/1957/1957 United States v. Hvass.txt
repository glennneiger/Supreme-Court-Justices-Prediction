United States v. Hvass

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    United States of America versus Charles Hvass. 
    Mr. Spritzer.
speaker="ralph_s_spritzer" startTime="15.656" stopTime="258.029">
    Mr. Ralph S. Spritzer 
    Mr. Chief Justice, Your Honors. 
    This is a direct appeal pursuant to the Criminal Appeals Act from a judgment of the Northern -- of the District Court for the Northern District Court of Iowa which dismissed an indictment for perjury. 
    This Court has postponed the question of its jurisdiction to this hearing on the merits. 
    Before getting to that threshold jurisdictional issue, it is of course necessary to state the essential facts and particularly the basis of the District Court's decision. 
    Mr. Hvass, the appellee in this case is an attorney, a member of the Minnesota Bar. 
    He is not a member of the Iowa Bar or of the Federal District Court Bar in Iowa. 
    He wished to participate in two unrelated personal injury actions, both of them pending in the Northern District of Iowa as attorney for the respective plaintiffs on those cases. 
    Like most District Courts, Iowa has local rules relating to the admission of attorneys who are not members of the local bar. 
    The applicable rule in this case is called Local Rule 3 and it is set forth at pages 2 and 3 of the Government's brief. 
    The first paragraph of that rule, the Court will note, contains provisions which are fairly common. 
    For example, the Out-of-State Attorney must associate with himself a resident attorney for purposes of receiving process and the like. 
    And it has a provision that the Court may call for a showing of satisfactory moral character. 
    The second paragraph which is more particularly involved here, relates to a special category of cases to personal injury cases in which the Out-of-State Attorney whishes to represent an Iowa claimant who has suffered injury in Iowa. 
    Now, as to this category of actions, the Court has imposed by its rule more detailed, fuller requirements. 
    That second paragraph provides that the Court may require the Out-of-State Attorney to show and I quote here from the rule, that the connection of the said attorney with the case was not occasioned or brought about in violation of the standards of conduct specified in Rule 8 here. 
    Now Rule 8 to interpolate adopts for the District Court in Iowa the provisions of the Canons of Professional Ethics of the American Bar Association. 
    So the apparent purpose of this second paragraph of the rule in a nutshell is to enable the Court to deal effectively and promptly at the very outset of a litigation with any possible instance of ambulance chasing by an attorney seeking, believed to participate in a case in that court.

    The -- the rule is not restricted, Your Honor to either category. 
    This brings me to the last sentence of the rule which is particularly important here. 
    The Court and I'm reading from the Rule at page 3, “As a part of said showing may require the plaintiff and the said attorney to appear and be examined under oath." 
    Pursuant to this rule, Mr. Hvass sought leave of the Court to participate in the two personal injury cases to which I previously adverted. 
    The Court then acting on its own motion set his application down for a hearing. 
    It also directed the United States Attorney as an officer of the Court to make an inquiry and to present to the Court any relevant facts bearing on the application. 
    Hearings were thereafter duly held. 
    Mr. Hvass at that hearing or those hearings testified under oath.

    Mr. Ralph S. Spritzer 
    The opinion suggests that it was and I think there is no issue that in fact that was the case. 
    The Court does not have before it as part of the record here, the full transcript of the hearing because as I shall elaborate this case comes up on a motion to dismiss the indictment.

    Mr. Ralph S. Spritzer 
    This second paragraph of the Rule went into effect only a short time before this application was filed and hence there had been at that point no regular practice. 
    I can say to the Court that at the same time that Mr. Hvass' application for leave to participate was heard. 
    There was a hearing involving another attorney who sought leave to participate in another case.

    The District Court holding is not that this is an invalid rule.

    I -- I think that that is the only question here because I think that is the only question that was decided by the District Court and I think it's the only question under the Criminal Appeals Act accordingly which this Court would have jurisdiction to decide. 
    I had adverted to the hearings to the fact that Mr. Hvass testified. 
    There was also a testimony by various other witnesses. 
    And at the conclusion of the hearings, Judge Graven who is the presiding judge of the Northern District of Iowa, denied Mr. Hvass' application for leave to participate in the two cases. 
    Some months thereafter a grand jury returned an indictment for perjury which charged that various statements made by Mr. Hvass in his sworn testimony, statements which denied solicitation, maintenance and champerty were false. 
    The day after the indictment was returned, Judge Graven removed himself from all further proceedings in the perjury case presumably because he had formed or at least might be thought to have informed an opinion as to Mr. Hvass' credibility by virtue of having presided at this qualification hearings. 
    And he designated Judge Mickelson, a visiting judge from South Dakota to handle all further proceedings in the case.

    I think that's correct. 
    Our record does not give the order itself but merely a docket entry. 
    Now, the basis of the dismissal is summed up in this case by a single sentence of the district judge's opinion. 
    He himself undertook to state in a sentence what he was holding. 
    At Record 10, he stated and I quote, “I simply hold," -- I'm reading toward the bottom of that page, next to the last paragraph. 
    “I simply hold that Rule 3 under which the defendant took his oath is not such a law of the United States as was intended by Congress to support an indictment for perjury." 
    Now, we say to begin with that such a decision plainly rests upon an interpretation whether that interpretation be right or wrong of the statute upon which the indictment is found.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter

    Mr. Ralph S. Spritzer 
    That itself, Your Honor, yes. 
    He confines himself solely to the proposition that this kind of a rule wasn't encompassed by the federal perjury statute.

    Mr. Ralph S. Spritzer 
    Yes, sir.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="947.655" stopTime="964.557">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    What -- what you said last is that there is a limitation upon this Court's power to review -- the scope of this Court's power to review an influence to which the question was he couldn't and order a case relying in his problems in a way is this Court's jurisdiction.
speaker="ralph_s_spritzer" startTime="964.557" stopTime="1211.422">
    Mr. Ralph S. Spritzer 
    Yes, I think in the -- in the Borden case in 308 United States. 
    This Court indicated that it would have jurisdiction under the Criminal Appeals Act only of the issue of construction of the statute upon which the indictment was founded and that is in fact, there had been another basis of decision by the District Court. 
    The case would have had to go to the Court of Appeals rather than directly here. 
    Now on the merits, the question of course is whether Judge Mickelson's interpretation of the perjury statute is a permissible one. 
    We say that there is no sound reason even if one were writing on a clean slate here and one is not, for holding the perjury statute to be restricted to proceedings which are conducted pursuant to a legislative act as this Court had occasion to note in the Ludenia Howard case on the last term. 
    The case not involving perjury to be sure but the Federal Black Bass Act, A rule or regulation may constitute a law within the meaning of a statute. 
    There, a regulation of the Florida Game Commission was deemed to be a law of the State of Florida for purposes of applying a federal statute. 
    And so far as the federal perjury statute itself is concerned, this Court decided as long ago as Caha against United States, a case that's decided in 1894. 
    That one may commit perjury when the oath is administered pursuant to a valid administrative regulation and that was the case this, as the Court will recall, which arose under one of the Homestead Act. 
    The Homestead Act had given a broad authority to the land department as it was then called to adopt procedures to settle disputed claims as to land and the land department had proceeded to adopt a scheme of regulations, rules of practice for disposing of context questions as to who among various claimants had made the valid homestead entry. 
    And Mr. Caha was a claimant in such a case heard before a local land officer. 
    The land officer got his powers only pursuant to an administrative regulation. 
    He was indicted for having given false testimony during the course of that proceeding before the local land officer and he challenged the indictment on the ground that the act of Congress did not provide for the administration of an oath. 
    And this Court unanimously sustained the indictment. 
    It held the regulation was valid as within the broad delegation of the statute and it held further that since the local land officer, acting under a valid regulation, constituted a competent tribunal, the perjury statute heretofore supply. 
    Of course the -- the test under the perjury statute which is set forth at page 2 of our brief, the test for present purposes is whether a law of the United States authorized an oath to be administered. 
    Now we take it that there can be no serious question that a rule of Court within the rule making authority of the District Court stands on a footing which is not inferior to an administrative regulation.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1211.422" stopTime="1241.476">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Would you -- would you say you indicate whether you think -- putting your side for the moment, purpose of this argument, the validity of this rule that there is any difference between a rule of admission to a District Court and the oath required under it and the rule of admission to this Court and an oath required under it.
speaker="ralph_s_spritzer" startTime="1241.476" stopTime="1309.734">
    Mr. Ralph S. Spritzer 
    I would think there would be no significant difference. 
    I think that so long as the rule is one which falls within the realm of the Court's business but then the Court may administer an oath. 
    Certainly judges and clerks of Court have power to administer oath than to take acknowledgements. 
    That power we think extends to all cases to which the judicial power extends. 
    In this case, in addition to the general power of a court to administer an oath, the rule itself explicitly provided for that procedure. 
    In short, we believe that the broad language of the perjury statute does not admit of any exception for proceedings which are conducted pursuant to rule of court or pursuant to administrative rule.

    Yes, sir.

    Do you consider this proceeding to have been a case within the meaning of the perjury statute, a case?
speaker="ralph_s_spritzer" startTime="1326.052" stopTime="1401.955">
    Mr. Ralph S. Spritzer 
    Yes, I -- I do, Your Honor. 
    I don't think here, we're talking about case or controversy in the -- in any constitutional sense. 
    Certainly, we have a wide variety of decisions in which perjury indictments had been sustained arising out of all kinds of administrative matters in the proceedings. 
    Matters like filing of a tax return, a false statement in an application for a pension, a false statement by a selective service registrant, a false statement by a surety on a bail bond before the United States Commissioner. 
    Indeed this Court in Novak against United States had a perjury case which involved false statements in a verified tax return. 
    So I think that the statute covers any type of proceeding so long as the administration of the oath in that proceeding is authorized ultimately by federal law.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="1401.955" stopTime="1404.888">
    Justice John M. Harlan

speaker="ralph_s_spritzer" startTime="1404.888" stopTime="1473.341">
    Mr. Ralph S. Spritzer 
    Or in any matter, yes, Your Honor. 
    And I -- I think one is compelled to that reading by many decades of decision involving as I say a great variety of cases in which the matter came up out of the course of administrative proceedings which did not involve an adjudicatory matter. 
    It might be a mere filing of a report by a business organization with -- with a regulatory commission. 
    Such matters are brought to the perjury statute in play. 
    So I think our question in all of these cases is simply whether a law of the United States authorized and oath to be administered and on that basis, we see no possible exception for this case from the rule of this Court which is I say dates back to the Caha decision.

    This amendment was enacted in August of 1955 not to go in effect until the first day of October 1955 and in answer to Justice Whittaker's question, the defendant did not apply but he was sent an order by the Court stating that if you care to try a case, you shall appear and call his attention to the new requirement which is the only requirement in the United States of America. 
    All other states grant committee in accordance with the prior law that was in existence. 
    This is the new requirement and it was the first time and the first session of courts so they were ordered to appear.

speaker="warren_b_king" startTime="1695.144" stopTime="1838.001">
    Mr. Warren B. King 
    -- and you don't require it. 
    Now, in answering Mr. Justice Black's question, the suites in which were on the calendar where the order issued was at issue -- the attorneys had selected their attorney on Minnesota to try their lawsuit because they have wished to do so and the case was on the calendar. 
    The very last one at least four months before this law was ever enacted or ever thought of. 
    Now it's our position, if it please the Court, that in other than a judicial proceeding to constitute the crime of perjury under 1621 “The law of the United States authorizing oath to be administered must have a valid legislative base.Otherwise, there can be no crime.” 
    Therefore the question is pure and simply of whether or not Rule 3 has a valid legislative base. 
    We contend that it does not because Congress cannot authorize an oath in an admission hearing since the power to admit attorneys to practice in the federal courts is inherently a judicial power and it is not legislative. 
    Therefore our position is at local Rule 3 is not such a law of the United States authorizing an oath so that this violation will constitute a federal crime of perjury and it is interesting to note that on page 14, the Government takes a position which is substantially similar because they say the decisions of this Court are clear that for the purposes of the prosecution of perjury, there must be two elements. 
    It must be founded on legislative base, a statute of the United States for a rule promulgated pursuant to appellant, delegation of rule making authority and because the legislature has no authority to make any regulations in an admission hearing, there can be no valid delegation of rule making power.

    And you can also determine for what cause they ought to be punished or removed.

speaker="warren_b_king" startTime="1965.874" stopTime="2083.473">
    Mr. Warren B. King 
    Congress -- that is correct and if I may modify your statement, it is correct that Congress did not do that. 
    May I state it this way, if Congress had intended to do as Justice Frankfurter indicated then they all -- they would have had to do in 1621 is merely saying this in any proceeding. 
    Authorizing an oath to -- in any proceeding in which an oath maybe administered on and on. 
    But they didn't do that because you see it's in derogation of the common law. 
    In common law and way back to the Roman law, we had a situation whereby in judicial proceedings, automatically the violation of an oath constituted perjury. 
    That was the common law and that was the Roman law. 
    Anything extrajudicial was false lines, so all down to history, any violation of an oath in a judicial hearing proceeding, constituted perjury. 
    It was not necessary then to have a law of the United States authorizing the oath. 
    Common law now supports that. 
    It's not necessary. 
    Now they wish to go out into a second field. 
    They wish to move into another field in restriction of the common law, so they say not all proceedings, not all hearings, the judge doesn't have a roving commission to administer an oath to the party hires to be (Inaudible). 
    They say only in those cases whereby two qualifications exist. 
    One that the proper tribunal officer purchase or administer the oath and two, there must be a law of the United States or must be a clear legislative base in order to constitute this crime. 
    It cannot be constituted unless there's a legislative base and of course there is no legislative base here.

    And a new case In re Schrader which is found in 22 federal -- found in 22 federal cases that we found when we traced down the citation they made 22 federal cases 12. 
    And it's interesting to note that in this particular case when we traced down 1654 in this particular case which was the statute that they tried to extend over and say constituted a law of the United States and tracing back its history. 
    The Court in the Schrader case said is the statute which was one statute 92, the forerunner of 1654 that they relied on. 
    In the Schrader case they said it is clear concession to the Courts. 
    That statute is a clear concession to the Courts of exclusive jurisdiction over the subject of admission of attorneys to practice in the national courts and maybe taken as an acknowledgement by Congress that this is a matter within the judicial power of the United States.

    You're not attacking this on the basis that this is a regulation for any basis of (Inaudible) merits of structure that the statute does.

    Mr. Warren B. King 
    Four days before. 
    And I might answer the other end of your question because it's important. 
    Of course he had of moral duty.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Oh I'm not -- a man may -- the directive moral duty and not violate a statute.
speaker="warren_b_king" startTime="2305.743" stopTime="2389.349">
    Mr. Warren B. King 
    But may I answer the corollary? 
    He has had a moral duty to tell the court the truth and the court has in its inherent judicial power available all of the sanctions to punish it by contempt temporary suspension. 
    Disbarment in a regular procedure where he would be tried by his own, beat his own home court Minnesota and the Bar of Texas where he is admitted. 
    So there was a duty and there were corollary sanctions. 
    Now, may I call the Court's attention too, the Government's briefs spends four or five pages talking about something that we will readily concede. 
    They are talking about the first requirements of the perjury statute, saying that the Court has power under Rule 459 and the Court under Rule 352 and under the Rules of 83. 
    Of course the Court had the power had to administer this oath. 
    Of course it was a proper tribunal but our contention is that the second valid requirement that first before the crime of perjury can be charged against this man whose professional life is at stake, there must be a law of the United States authorizing that oath and here there is no law of the United States authorizing that oath.

    We say they cannot in an admission hearing but the rule that they pass, Mr. Justice Black was not a law of the United States at all. 
    It was a Local Rule of Court in an investigative hearing -- in an administrative hearing which cannot and does not rise to the dignity of a law of the United States because it must have a legislative base. 
    Do you remember the Caha case he cited?
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="2452.973" stopTime="2456.557">

    And therefore you say there never can be a statutory prosecution for perjury no matter how detail the Congress and spell it out although you indicate that you wouldn't be here if the judgment by virtue of the judicial power, lock this fellow in jail for X month, is that correct?
speaker="warren_b_king" startTime="2477.592" stopTime="2582.974">
    Mr. Warren B. King 
    The last answer to your question is correct that we wouldn't be here if the judge and his judicial power could sanction what he wanted to. 
    And we say correctly that the Congress cannot pass a law under the existing 1621 because that's the field it reserved exclusively to the judiciary to determine who and they do not have a legislative base. 
    Now may I go back to the Caha case and let's take the (Inaudible) case, let's take all of them. 
    What has happened? 
    There first was a statute which had an object in mind only a 160 acres in the Homestead case. 
    And those statutes then put there that agency is spreading out to make rules and regulations. 
    But there first was a legislative based the Homestead Act, the Selective Service Act. 
    And do you remember what you said in the (Inaudible) case that the first statute was that a manufacturer shall keep books but a wholesaler didn't and they charged him with perjury and (Inaudible) 
    The basic act for this crime, the original basic act for this crime must be legislative in basis and because the legislature didn't require the wholesaler keep books, you and your regulations can't supply it. 
    Every one of the cases they cite has a legislative base -- it has a legislative base, the Homestead Act just like the (Inaudible) 
    Here, we do not have a legislative base, we have only Local Rule 3 which clearly is not a legislative base. 
    It's a local rule of court in an administrative hearing and he so said that that was. 
    Now I might just add this one sentence that comes to my mind and that is with reference to the validity.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2582.974" stopTime="2594.105">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter

    Mr. Warren B. King 
    Your Honor that's 100% correct. 
    May I offer a little modification? 
    All right, sir. 
    Congress can wipe it up tomorrow because Congress has the constitutional authority to create a Federal District Court but something happens as soon as they create that court. 
    As soon as the child is born, it assumes under itself then a part and parcel of the judicial branch of the federal government and thereafter -- and thereafter, Congress cannot legislate in the field of admissions of attorneys to practice in that Court because such a Court is vested in such authorities invested in the courts only.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Your statutes have qualifications where people become judges?
speaker="warren_b_king" startTime="2740.032" stopTime="2789.749">
    Mr. Warren B. King 
    I'm not familiar with that qualification. 
    I don't think that there is either but I might say this in direct answer to your question. 
    If there was a statute putting forth the minimum requirements, we would then have this situation in nearly all of the jurisdiction of the country wherein the question has arisen that the act of admitting applicants to the bar is regarded as judicial rather than legislative in character, that's 144 ALR. 
    Accordingly, nearly all of the Courts that have considered the matters support the doctrine of the determination of the qualifications of a particular person applying permission to the bar is exclusively a judicial function. 
    So even if they did, and the question happened to come head on the judiciary in my opinion would win. 
    And that is why --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="2789.749" stopTime="2792.979">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    You mean the judiciary were decided favorably judiciarys?
speaker="warren_b_king" startTime="2792.979" stopTime="2973.835">
    Mr. Warren B. King 
    I would assume so, Your Honor and this is not properly so. 
    That's why in a question of validity that you raised a moment ago, Mr. Chief Justice, I believe in putting the test as to whether Local Rule 3 is a law of the United States. 
    You would have a right perhaps to determine as impliedly within that question of whether or not that's ex post facto and as to whether or not its discriminatory because it applies only to a part of the -- of the state lawyers just to plaintiffs and not the defendants because it's not universal at all, because it's highly discriminatory, because the judge may put the man under oath. 
    And he also, if you please, has the right to put the party under oath. 
    He can call a party down and say, "When did you meet you this man." 
    And so on and so forth and he can take the next man who is an out-of-state attorney and say, "I'll waive the oath.” 
    And you admit it. 
    I like you, you're a fine fellow. 
    That's what Rule 3 is. 
    So insofar as you put the test to whether or not it is a law of the United States, you could determine whether it would meet the common test of a law of the United States because Rule 3 is not a law of the United States. 
    And further because the common law in -- other than a judicial proceeding is not a law of the United States. 
    We sincerely believe in trust that you will agree that the judgment of the lower court should be affirmed because nowhere in the Government's brief have they satisfied the second requirement that there is any law of the United States which in any manner authorized the oath that Mr. Hvass took. 
    And in absence of any judicial, in absence of any legislative base and we say there couldn't be any legislative base that this man is not subjective to the charge of perjury. 
    And as we have pointed out, the attorney's relationship with a federal court, stems from the inherent judicial power and consequently any attorney who is guilty of any unethical conduct in an admission hearing. 
    He is although not guilty of perjury he is certainly has subject to all the inherent powers of the Court to punish such misconduct. 
    But that it was never intended that in an extra judicial hearing that it would support the charge of perjury. 
    You remembered in the George case it said an affidavit not authorized or required by a law of the United States will not support the crime of perjury. 
    And we cited the Larson case which --

    Justice Tom C. Clark 
    Which case are you referring to now?
speaker="warren_b_king" startTime="2975.849" stopTime="2981.211">
    Mr. Warren B. King 
    That's the United States versus George that's cited in our brief, Your Honor.
speaker="tom_c_clark" startTime="2981.211" stopTime="2987.981">
    Justice Tom C. Clark 
    Heretofore, you haven't relied on that at all, have you?In the argument you've made.
speaker="warren_b_king" startTime="2987.981" stopTime="2989.137">
    Mr. Warren B. King 
    Well, I --
speaker="tom_c_clark" startTime="2989.137" stopTime="2992.909">
    Justice Tom C. Clark 
    I didn't understand that your previous argument was on that basis.
speaker="warren_b_king" startTime="2992.909" stopTime="3000.745">
    Mr. Warren B. King 
    It was -- it would be part of it. 
    It would be part of this, Your Honor. 
    Well, I think you could be correct in --
speaker="tom_c_clark" startTime="3000.745" stopTime="3007.470">
    Justice Tom C. Clark 
    That's the one which the Court indicated that, that would be very cautious about regulations in making criminal charges rest on them.
speaker="warren_b_king" startTime="3007.470" stopTime="3074.143">
    Mr. Warren B. King 
    You are so correct and we agree. 
    But we have a Larson case which we think is cited and it came from Minnesota which is so similar because there, a man have been found guilty of a crime. 
    And after the main action was over, the judge brought him in and put him under oath and asked him some questions for purposes of determining whether or not he should -- what type of sentence he should have. 
    And the Court there affirmed the law, laid down in the United States versus George by saying that, "That oath was not supported by any statutory provision in the State of Minnesota and therefore would not support the charge of perjury." 
    And because it wouldn't support the charge of perjury because there was no legislative base, the crime had not been committed. 
    It's so very, very similar to the case that we have here and in that case the Larson -- State versus Larson they cited the George case.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="3074.143" stopTime="3082.975">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    How do you distinguish or do you make any distinction between that case and the one that Mr. Spritzer cited?
speaker="warren_b_king" startTime="3082.975" stopTime="3084.117">
    Mr. Warren B. King 
    Yes, I do.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="3084.117" stopTime="3085.417">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    What is the distinction?
speaker="warren_b_king" startTime="3085.417" stopTime="3147.578">
    Mr. Warren B. King 
    The distinction is this, Your Honor. 
    In Mr. Spritzer's case, there was a clear legislative base that was the Homestead Act by Congress flowing from that and within the framework of that original statutory authority, the land office was created and the land office was delegated rules, power to make rules to carry out. 
    The effect of the land office at the Homestead Act to see that nobody got more than 160 acres. 
    So they had a right, a perfect right to make a regulation and require an oath because it was bottomed upon legislative authority, a clear legislative base. 
    The oath carried out the purpose so nobody could get more than 160 acres and they had a perfect right to do it. 
    In this case, the legislature didn't say anything about putting a man under oath after the trial was all over. 
    In our case, Congress is never given any authority at all to administer the oath to the defendant. 
    Not any authority whatsoever that they did would be a nullity. 
    The cases are so different because here --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="3147.578" stopTime="3159.272">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    You return back to your distinction then to the ground that the courts have the exclusive power to decide all the qualifications of lawyers, anything Congress does is nullity.
speaker="warren_b_king" startTime="3159.272" stopTime="3299.709">
    Mr. Warren B. King 
    100% Your Honor and therefore there is no legislative base to say it in so many words in the case that the Government cited there was a legislative base and here there is no legislative base. 
    We're here left the way we are found. 
    We're found with a man who is practicing law in that federal court because the Court said that he could. 
    And if there is to be any punishment for misconduct, if he was guilty, the Court has ample power to punish him. 
    He shall not be charged with the crime and forfeit. 
    His entire professional life but it can go back to the Bar Association not in a foreign court before a foreign judge and a foreign jury but go back to the Bar Association where they know the man. 
    They understand what the charge was. 
    If the charge is solicitation, they understand what it means in the State. 
    They understand how it's been defined by that state and not by the State of Iowa. 
    And then he is presented with a bill of particulars. 
    He hasn't called down by an order three days before, three days after a new rule is put into effect and said, "Tell us all about your prior life, your prior professional life, years before you ever had these cases and we will determine for ourselves whether or not that is competent, whether or not that is proper." 
    That is far different in being presented and the burden of proof is different but you must remember that the Court satisfied the law, the Court said, "Thou shalt not try these cases." 
    And he didn't but they didn't' stopped there. 
    The rule was to determine his fitness to try one particular, two particular cases. 
    They said, "We don't think you're fit." 
    And after they said that they didn't stop they wanted to go one step further and put -- charge him with a federal crime which was not authored -- the oath was not authorized by a law of the United States to deprive him of his professional livelihood in all of the other states where he is admitted to practice law. 
    That's quite a serious charge. 
    The rule had been satisfied. 
    The rule says, "Permission to try a particular case." 
    They said, "You don't fill our qualifications. 
    We won't let you try it." 
    But they didn't stop there. 
    Months afterwards they put in an indictment.
