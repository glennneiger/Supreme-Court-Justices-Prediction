    Mr. Walter E. Barton 
    Before -- Mr. Justice, may it please the Court. 
    Before attempting to argue the -- to answer the argument of the counsel on the other side, I'd like to call the attention of the Court to our contention that the questions argued by petitioner are not properly before this Court. 
    The only question in the Tax Court was whether the petitioner or the respondent rather, was a transferee of the assets of the estate of Milton J. Stern deceased. 
    Now, that appears on page 4 of the record which is in the deficiency letter sent to Mrs. Stern, the respondent. 
    And then, in the pleadings, in the petition, the answer and the reply the reference is made 25 times I believe it is to the liability of the respondent as transferee of the estate of the decedent. 
    And that is what the Tax Court decided. 
    If Your Honors will turn to page 16 of the record, it is argued and decided that the petitioner is liable as transferee of the estate of Milton J. Stern, deceased. 
    Now, the argument has been addressed to the proposition of whether she is a transferee of the decedent. 
    Of course, if these proceeds had been paid to the estate and turned over by the executor to Mrs. Stern, we've never would have gone into the Tax Court because necessarily, she would have been a transferee there of assets of the estate. 
    Another question which does not -- was not contended for in the Tax Court and wasn't raised there was the question with respect to the cash surrender values of the policies. 
    The only question down below was whether or not she was liable for the proceeds of the insurance. 
    So on those two issues, we contend that those questions are not properly before the Court. 
    I don't want to take too much time on that. 
    I think that is --

speaker="walter_e_barton" startTime="386.563" stopTime="805.243">
    Mr. Walter E. Barton 
    Page 4 in the first paragraph, constituting your liability as transferee of assets to the estate of Milton J. Stern. 
    Now, most -- assuming the questions are probably before the Court, the Government's argument principally is predicated on the theory that there's the same kind of a transfer here as would be involved in the case of a estate tax. 
    If Your Honors care to turn to page 10 of our brief, we have set out there the sections of the estate tax law, which in our opinion clearly indicate that proceeds of insurance were not the property of the decedent. 
    For instance, 811 provides that the gross estates shall include all the value of all property at the time of the decedent's death. 
    Now, in 811 (a), to the extent of the interest therein of the decedent at the time of his death. 
    Now, that would be stocks or real estate or something he might own that would go to his heirs or to his executor. 
    Now, when you get down to the next sections about life insurance, it doesn't say anything about the interest of the decedent in the life insurance. 
    It says to the extent of the amount receivable by all other beneficiaries as insurance showing that Congress in enacting the legislation never considered that the decedent had an -- a property interest in the proceeds of life insurance. 
    If that -- if the Congress have so considered, it wouldn't have been necessary to have incorporated these two sections about proceeds going to this executor or proceeds going to any other beneficiary. 
    Now, Chief Justice Vinson, when he was on the Court of Appeals in the John Hancock Life Insurance case, wrote an opinion in which he pointed out the distinction I have quoted on page 11 of my brief. 
    A paragraph of his opinion in which he shows that the statute has two lines he says. 
    One is the interest of the decedent with respect to property which he makes the transfer. 
    The other is insurance which goes to the beneficiary and he states that the statute proceeds to impose a lien on the estate property to the extent of the decedent's interest at the time of transfer or to the extent of the beneficiary's interest under the insurance contract. 
    So it isn't necessary and this -- in the -- it's Chase National Bank case didn't hold that there was a transfer of life insurance proceeds from the decedent to the beneficiary. 
    In that case, the Court said, it was the termination of the power to control of the insured over the policy at the time of his death which rendered the proceeds includable in his gross estate. 
    Not because he owns the proceeds and by imperative reasoning not because he own the cash surrender values but because at his death, the power to change a beneficiary terminated and shifted the economic benefit of that policy into the hands of the beneficiary. 
    And that the Court said in the Chase National Bank case was the basis for the tax. 
    Now, there are other cases where there are properties included in the gross estate which the decedent doesn't own a property in at the time of his death. 
    For instance, transfers in contemplation of death maybe made years before. 
    Revocable transfers and interests in joint tenancies or tenancies by the entireties. 
    They're all segregated in the estate tax law, separate and apart from the one section that refers to property in which the decedent has an interest showing that all kinds of properties may be included in the gross estates including life insurance proceeds with respect to which the decedent didn't own a property interest up to time of his death. 
    Now, then the Eight and the Ninth Circuits in two different cases each which I have cited on page 12 of the brief have held that the fact that there is a transfer rendering property includable in the gross estate at the time of death has nothing to do with the transferee liability and in income tax case. 
    And in fact, in that case, it was a tenancy by the entirety and joint tenancies and they said there wasn't any property interest that went to the survivor which constituted property under Section 311 of the Internal Revenue Code. 
    Now, the Government in its brief in a petition for certiorari admitted that they couldn't get certain property and the joint names of the decedent and its widow that is some bonds and some real estate. 
    Now, those properties were includable in the gross estate just same as insurance. 
    So I don't see how there can be any distinction between properties of that kind and life insurance. 
    As a matter of fact, life insurance is -- policy is a contract where the insured pays a premium in consideration for the payment of proceeds to his beneficiary. 
    As soon as that policy is signed, the insurance company is liable for the full amount if the insured dies the next day which demonstrates, we think that when the insurance company pays the proceeds, the insurance company pays its own money and it doesn't pay anything that belongs to the insured. 
    Now, as Justice Harlan this morning pointed out all five Circuit Courts of Appeals which are passive on this question have held that there's no transfer of proceeds and there's been no Circuit Court of Appeals that's held of the contrary.

    When you say proceeds, you mean death benefit.
speaker="walter_e_barton" startTime="807.777" stopTime="936.811">
    Mr. Walter E. Barton 
    Well, that's the proceeds of insurance within the meaning of the transferee section of the income tax law, Section 311. 
    Now, I like just to make one statement before proceeding a little further, I understood the counsel to say that the record showed that the insured paid the premiums up to the day of his death. 
    The record doesn't show in any respect who paid the premiums or how long. 
    It shows that these policies were taken out in getting about 1910 up to about 1935. 
    And the widow, the respondent here was made beneficiary in 1919, after they married and she's made beneficiary in the last policy in 1935. 
    He died in 1939. 
    There's no change in beneficiary between 1949. 
    There's no -- no change in beneficiary from the time these -- from 1935 up to the day of his death. 
    Now, these tax years are 1944 to 1947. 
    The Court of Appeals below made the statement that there's no evidence of insolvency before death. 
    There's no evidence that he took out these policies or maintained them to defraud, defeat the creditors. 
    And I would say further there's no evidence whatever in the case as to whether the insured paid any premium from these policies during the taxable years 1944 to 1947, or after that -- after the date of his death. 
    And as to all of that, the Government has a burden of proof under Section 1119 (a) because the Government has a burden of proving transferee liability and the burden is not on the taxpayer.

    He gave a deed to his wife of certain real estate and also included in this deed, certain life insurance policies but he kept in the deed a power to revoke it and take it back or a power to appoint it. 
    Now, the question was whether when he made the assignment of all of his assets to the assignee. 
    That included his power of revocation of that assignment to his wife. 
    This Court held it did not.

    The laws of the state require a solvency reserve, which is the excess over the level premium over the -- over the cost mortality and then with the accumulation of interest. 
    Now, the cash surrender value might be equivalent to the reserve or maybe like deduct the cancelation charge, but the fact that there is a reserve doesn't mean that the insured owns that reserve fund. 
    Now, if the insured wants to borrow money from the insurance company, it comes out of the reserve. 
    He's got to pay an -- he got to pay an interest on that. 
    Now, if that were his own money, he wouldn't have paid any interest on it. 
    And the reserve fund under the law and investment of the insurance company, accumulates interests. 
    Who pays an income tax without interest? 
    It isn't the insured causing interest that goes into that reserve fund belongs to the insurance company.

    Well, the fund of course, there's no trust fund in any sense of a reach in which part of it is mine but that's no more -- that's equally true or untrue of a savings bank account and any of the savings bank.

    Yes, well, that is -- that is true perhaps, Your honor, but then the question gets around to the proposition of whether the cash surrender value passes to the beneficiary at the time of the decedent's death.

    Mr. Walter E. Barton 
    Well, if they had made an assessment, then a lien automatically would have attached to all of his property and I would say an insurance policy is a property. 
    Now, first in this case, this tax wasn't assessed until almost six years after he died --

    But require tax which he owed (Voice Overlap) --
speaker="walter_e_barton" startTime="1598.742" stopTime="1751.281">
    Mr. Walter E. Barton 
    It -- yes, it's approved before his death. 
    There isn't any doubt about that. 
    Now then, we -- we have in our brief contended, there is no transfer of the cash surrender value or the proceeds. 
    I don't believe the Government contends very seriously about the proceeds. 
    The question there is the beneficiary, a transferee of property of a taxpayer. 
    Now, they argue that by analogy, you can go to the transferee section under estate tax law. 
    Well, the transferee section in the estate tax and the income tax law both originated in 1926. 
    They read exactly the same way except in income tax, it said that the property of the taxpayer and the other said property of the decedent. 
    Now, in 1918, was the first time that life insurance is brought into the estate tax. 
    And in the same law, they made the beneficiary of the policy personally liable for the tax to the extent of the proceeds produced the estate tax. 
    Now, that was 1918. 
    In 1926, the transferee provision in both sections of the law were put into effect, and it was not until 1942 that Congress amended the estate tax section and brought in a beneficiary of an insurance policy although that beneficiary had been liable all these years from 1918 and of course in 1926 where the transferee section was first enacted They amended the law and made the beneficiary subject to the summary process of assessment, but that amendment did not make the beneficiary viable for the tax. 
    The beneficiary is already liable under the former section and here under 827 (b), the beneficiary is liable. 
    So, we say and as the Court of Appeals in the Rowen case in New York said, the fact that Congress didn't changed the law in the income tax showed that Congress didn't intend to produce the same result that they did in the estate tax when they did amend the law. 
    Now, then if we should be wrong --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="1751.281" stopTime="1766.050">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    That argument -- that argument does depend on whether she is a transferee or not, does it? 
    But you're saying there is that Congress is taking hold of this thing and legislate it but they didn't choose to pose a liability under the (Inaudible)
speaker="walter_e_barton" startTime="1766.050" stopTime="1785.262">
    Mr. Walter E. Barton 
    Well, the liability of the beneficiary of life insurance was already existent in the case of the estate taxes, it had been from 1918. 
    So, all Congress did in 1942 was not to make the beneficiary liable but to bring the beneficiary under that summary procedure.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="1785.262" stopTime="1794.516">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Well then is your case based entirely on whether -- it was (Inaudible) then entirely on whether we agree with you that she's not a transferee?
speaker="walter_e_barton" startTime="1794.516" stopTime="1865.507">
    Mr. Walter E. Barton 
    Well, if you should hold that she is a transferee then we've got to find out what is the transferee liability. 
    And there, we say, you have to look at estate law. 
    Now, the only Court that's held that state law doesn't apply is in the Bess case which is going to be argued right away and I don't want to go into that too much, but that New Jersey law was almost word for word like the Kentucky law and the Third Circuit in the Bess case said that if you look to the state law of New Jersey. 
    The widow beneficiary is not liable for the tax of the decedent but the Court in the Bess case says you don't look to state law, you look to general law, but I don't know where you look for the general law. 
    That's what the Court said up in the Rowen case. 
    The Third Circuit didn't point out any law you looked to but we say that you got to look the state law under the Kentucky law. 
    There's no liability.
