    Mr. William H. Foulk 
    If Your Honors please. 
    At adjournment yesterday, I had said that the appellant's first pleading in the trial court in Florida was a motion to dismiss on the ground of the Florida court like jurisdiction of the subject matter of the suit which was the 1935 trust, and of the trustee and the appointees of the property of that trust who were nonresident parties. 
    The trial court heard that motion and properly found as we thought, though this case is primarily concerned with the valid -- validity and effect of certain powers of appointment rather than a will, recognizing our position right there. 
    He went on to hold that he was inclined to think that the matter sought to be presented by this motion can best be determined at the final hearing. 
    We weren't satisfied with that and we petitioned the Supreme Court of Florida for certiorari on the ground that the trial court had no jurisdiction and that the parties should not be put to the expense of a final hearing if the Court had no jurisdiction. 
    The Supreme Court of Florida heard us but deny our petition. 
    The executrix send and pleaded all of the parties in -- an action in the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware, which, as Your Honors will recall, had the raise in its State and had control over the Wilmington Trust Company as trustee of the 1935 trust. 
    Having -- she brought that suit for two valid reasons. 
    One, because she wanted to expedite the settlement of the State and two, she had been charged in the Florida proceedings with a failure to capture assets and therefore a dereliction in her duty as executrix. 
    Having brought that suit in Delaware, she came back and filed her answer or the appellants joined with her in filing an answer in which she said to the Court, “Now, the Delaware law applies to this trust. 
    It's a trust that has its home in Delaware. 
    And we are filing with this complaint a copy of our complaint or with this answer, a copy our complaint in Delaware and we're again raising in this answer the question of the jurisdiction of your Court.” 
    At the same time, the appellants filed a motion to stay the Florida action pending the determination of the validity of the trust in Delaware. 
    The respondents or the plaintiffs in the lower court, the appellees here immediately filed a -- an application for an injunction against the executrix pursuing the suit in Delaware. 
    It was a rather meaningless gesture because she had merely acted as an inner pleader in the Delaware proceeding and asked the Court to decide who was entitled to her mother's property in this trust, whether or not her stepsisters or half sisters got property under the will or her children got $470 -- $400,000 and the other appointees, $17,000. 
    Surprising it may seem in that application for an injunction, the plaintiff said that the Circuit Court had already decided the question of jurisdiction and that the executrix was guilty of bad faith in going to Delaware and filing this action to do just what they charged then with not doing, and they went on to charge that she was trying to lose the case in Delaware to benefit her children. 
    The Court -- another judge then the trial judge who had heard the motion to dismiss, granted the injunction. 
    Thereafter, both of the parties filed motions for summary decree or summary judgement in the trial court in Palm Beach, and that hope, I neglected to say, we again appeal or petition the, so far as the Supreme Court from certiorari from the denial of the trial court to grant our petition to stay and from its grant of the injunction against the executrix going forward in Delaware. 
    That was denied. 
    Then we -- both parties filed cross motions for summary judgment. 
    And the case was argued before the trial court, and the trial court found that as to jurisdiction, the trust assets and the trustee in Delaware, no personal service has been handed upon the defendants who have failed to answer. 
    Therefore, the trial court dismissed the case as to the Wilmington Trust Company trustee and as to the persons who were appointed to the $417,000 under the power -- powers of appointment. 
    But it went on to say that as to the answering defendants, the executrix and her three children that the Court was going to decide, determined that this trust agreement of 1935 was testamentary in character and not having met the requirements of the statute of wills, it was valid, and therefore all of the property, the $417,000 plus the remaining million dollars that went to the executrix under the power, anyway, passed under the will to the -- the beneficiaries of the will rather than the trust.

    Justice John M. Harlan 
    -- a suit to declare rights under the will, is that it?
speaker="william_h_foulk" startTime="469.247" stopTime="675.639">
    Mr. William H. Foulk 
    This was simply a suit with the avowed purpose of determining what passed under the will of a Florida domiciliary. 
    We claim that the will was crystal clear and needed no determination that the whole crux and the only question in this case is the validity of a Delaware trust. 
    We asked for a rehearing from the trial court on the basis that the trial court had held that it had no jurisdiction over indispensable parties and it could enter a final force -- enforceable decree because the indispensable parties were not there, that motion was denied without argument. 
    We then appealed to the Supreme Court of Florida on two bases.One, that the Court had no jurisdiction because of the absence of the trust res and indispensable parties including the trustees and the appointees, and two, that they were wrong in -- that they had not applied Delaware law and that they were wrong in the law that they did apply which presumably was -- was Florida law. 
    In the meantime, the Delaware case had proceeded and before we got to the argument in the Florida Supreme Court, the Delaware Chancery -- chancellor, ruled that he was not bind down by the decision of the Florida trial court and that the trust was a Delaware trust and under Delaware law it was valid. 
    We filed a petition in the Supreme Court of Florida to remand and dismiss on the basis of the Florida or the Delaware Chancellor's decision and again brought to the Court's attention that Delaware was the only jurisdiction which had the right to declare the validity of this trust and it is spoken in -- it was entitled to full faith and credit and res judicata. 
    That motion was heard at the same time appearing on the appeal. 
    And in its judgment, the Supreme Court of Florida found -- dismissed that petition to remand and determine that it had jurisdiction over all parties because this was in reality the construction or the determination of what passed under a will. 
    And it went on to -- to find that the lower court is right in finding that this was a testamentary disposition and it added to that that it was a mere -- that the trust was a mere agency agreement and therefore, no rights passed under the power of appointment, and that was true under Delaware law. 
    It specifically rejected the application of Delaware law.

    Do you think your situation would have been any different if the construction question had been raised in the accounting proceeding which is not involved?
speaker="william_h_foulk" startTime="712.093" stopTime="801.055">
    Mr. William H. Foulk 
    It might perhaps, if Your Honor please because there, it would perhaps come up under an administrative function of the Florida court and not under the guise of determining what passed under the crystal clear will. 
    So that I -- I think that that distinction might be well taken. 
    Now, we filed a petition for rehearing in the Florida court and we raised every question we could think of that we raised up until then lack of jurisdiction full faith and credit failure to grant due process in applying the applicable or the proper choice of law and that was denied without argument. 
    Then before the time run out for the appeal to this Court, the Supreme Court of Delaware sustained the chancellor in Delaware and found that -- that was not stopped by reason of the Florida court's decision and that the trust was a valid Delaware trust and it had the right to determine the policy of the State of Delaware on the press that existed in its State.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="801.055" stopTime="814.574">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Fully apart from full faith and credit, why wasn't it -- was it not res judicata because the parties had not been before the power of the Court or had not been served is that right?
speaker="william_h_foulk" startTime="814.574" stopTime="843.881">
    Mr. William H. Foulk 
    Some of the parties were not before the Florida court. 
    We of course claim that indispensable parties were not before the Florida court because no proper service had been had on them because of the absence of any property of theirs in the State or because of their personal presence there. 
    Florida attempted to serve them under a statute which gives them the right to determine matters of wills. 
    Now this --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="843.881" stopTime="848.999">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    This so-called interim proceeding to establish the will if --
speaker="william_h_foulk" startTime="848.999" stopTime="877.282">
    Mr. William H. Foulk 
    That's right. 
    And that -- that the will had already been probated and it -- it was -- the estate was practically administered when this started. 
    This suit started 14 moths after the -- the death of Mrs. Donner and our position is always been, that this is a plain out of action to construe or determine the valid -- the validity of a Delaware trust --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="877.282" stopTime="877.532">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Yes.
speaker="william_h_foulk" startTime="877.532" stopTime="887.337">
    Mr. William H. Foulk 
    And the will hasn't anything to do with it and the statute is used just as a -- as an implement to get Florida's jurisdiction over these assets.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="887.337" stopTime="914.344">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    So the case get down to this ultimately, that Florida, in search for power to pass on the validity of the -- to pass on the legal significance of this power of appoint -- of this trust on the theory that she had jurisdiction over the estate of Mrs. Donner. 
    She could determine what was swept within the term of the estate, is that the ultimate question?
speaker="william_h_foulk" startTime="914.344" stopTime="917.543">
    Mr. William H. Foulk 
    That's -- that's their position that --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="917.543" stopTime="918.403">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Is that the ultimate question?
speaker="william_h_foulk" startTime="918.403" stopTime="919.846">
    Mr. William H. Foulk 
    That's right.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="919.846" stopTime="920.008">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Namely, --
speaker="william_h_foulk" startTime="920.008" stopTime="920.268">
    Mr. William H. Foulk 
    Now --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="920.268" stopTime="944.185">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    -- whether -- whether a power of -- whether a trust establishes a lifetime of the -- of the donor has to be determined by the law of the State in which the trust was established or whether, the estate of the testamentary domicile could determine what passes under the will.
speaker="william_h_foulk" startTime="944.185" stopTime="944.756">
    Mr. William H. Foulk 
    That is right.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="944.756" stopTime="945.909">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    That's the issue, was it?
speaker="william_h_foulk" startTime="945.909" stopTime="982.842">
    Mr. William H. Foulk 
    Well, that's one of the issues. 
    Then we didn't -- we say that Florida, assuming that they had jurisdiction, must apply Delaware law because it's a Delaware trust, the assets are in Delaware. 
    And we say that in denial of the choice of Delaware law, it violated due process under the Home Insurance Company versus Dick and Hartford Accident &amp; Indemnity cases versus Delta &amp; Pine Land Company. 
    Then of course, we say --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="982.842" stopTime="986.597">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    This is a little different if I remember that case, that's the insurance case?

    Mr. William H. Foulk 
    That's right.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="987.462" stopTime="989.559">

    That's a very different story.

    Mr. William H. Foulk 
    But --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="989.836" stopTime="1027.728">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    It's what I think it is because here, that aspect of the case and say there are others, turns on the authority of the estate of a deceased person to determine what estate he left in that State that controls the -- the winding up of the testamentary disposition. 
    And they hold here, as I understand from what you're telling me, they held in Florida that this was a testamentary disposition and whether it was or wasn't, Florida, which passes on what the will is and what its scope is and not Delaware which doesn't pass on that. 
    That's the issue, isn't it?
speaker="william_h_foulk" startTime="1027.728" stopTime="1033.141">
    Mr. William H. Foulk 
    Well that's -- that's the way they have it.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    What is the dispute about it? 
    I mean let's find out -- before you can get an answer to a question, one wants to agree on what the questions is.

    Mr. William H. Foulk 
    Well, we --

    -- fly off giving answers without agreeing on the question.
speaker="william_h_foulk" startTime="1042.891" stopTime="1078.472">
    Mr. William H. Foulk 
    Well, we say of course, that there was no need to determine what passed under this will that everything passed under the will that she hadn't disposed of in her lifetime and that under the law of Delaware, which was the side and home of this trust, she had made a valid disposition of this property. 
    So, there wasn't anything left for Florida to -- to determine, but in determining what passed under their will, they had to determine whether or not the trust which has its home in (Inaudible) in Delaware was valid under Delaware law.

speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1403.375" stopTime="1405.930">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Certainly, it is. 
    That's the big interest of this --
speaker="arthur_g_logan" startTime="1405.930" stopTime="1629.617">
    Mr. Arthur G. Logan 
    That's the -- if we want to reach and I think McGee case decided here last December to solve that question. 
    Your Honor asked about whether this case in Florida started in the probate court, made any difference. 
    In our brief, we pointed out that this case was started in a Circuit Court under a statutory authority, giving the Circuit Courts down there. 
    Section 8702 of the Florida statute annotated, deals with declaratory decrease, provide that any person claiming to be interested or who may be in doubt as to his rights under will, may have any question of construction or validity arising under such will determine and obtain a declaration of his rights thereunder. 
    That statutory authority was placed in the Circuit Court not in probate court and also by statute provided that constructive service of process may be passed upon defendants in -- in a case of that sort. 
    Now, if I may, those court of competent jurisdiction, I think Your Honor had -- probably had in mind the Mullane case, it's some kind of a bank where it was I think in a court -- statutory court with the settlements of accounts, but this is a court of competent jurisdiction. 
    It's never been questioned in Florida. 
    Now, if I may go back. 
    Mrs. Donner died leaving many children and many grandchildren and the will and a trust agreement under which she had powers to appoint at her death. 
    She moved to Florida in 1944 and lived there until 1952 when she died. 
    When she died, found that she had exercised a power of appointment under this so-called trust, providing that -- this $400,000 we're talking about. 
    Under that power of appointment, that $400,000 will be taken out of these trust assets and placed in two existing trust for two of her grandchildren who were children of her daughter, Mrs. Hanson, who was named the executrix. 
    So over here, we have -- if the trust of the State is good and if the power is good, the $400,000 go into two trusts, existing trust for two grandchildren. 
    However, if either their trust agreement was invalid or if the power of appointment was not properly exercised, then under the terms of the will, that same $400,000 would go into two different trusts for two other daughters of hers other than Mrs. Hanson, the executrix. 
    Now these two daughters started this action to challenge the validity of the trust and the exercise of the power under it. 
    They named as defendants, these two grandchildren, their mother, and many other people who are really unnecessary to this question because there were other earlier powers and everybody practically whoever been named was put in as defendant. 
    The two children preserved and then their mother came in and had herself appointed as a guardian ad litem. 
    So the executrix within the Florida court, she was guardian ad litem for her children in a family squabble over $400,000. 
    Every single one of these people, who were interested in that money, lived in Florida and had for a long time. 
    This is a Florida fight in a Florida court between two rival groups of beneficiaries for this $400,000, $400,000 would go into this trust or the other trust.

    The trust which she has established with Wilmington Trust Company was one where she reserved the right to revoke it, change it in any way she wanted, withdraw a part with all the corpus to change the trustees, to change advisors, the trustees had to do what the advisors told her and she reserved the right to name who she'd take upon her death.

    Mr. Arthur G. Logan 
    It -- it was held really, that it was created merely an agency, not a true trust and that the power, the exercise of the power under by one witness only did not comply with Florida or Delaware for that testamentary.

    Every transaction is dictated by the advisor of the trust. 
    They never once exercised judgment. 
    They never even reviewed these things. 
    They were given some securities. 
    They were told when to sell, or when to buy and they just sat there, took coupons, took their fee and turned over to her during her lifetime the income. 
    And that's why the Florida court held it wasn't a trust at all. 
    It's an agency agreement. 
    In Delaware, they were holding assets for -- now answering your question, Justice Whittaker, if Florida is right, the title was in Florida because then he was only an agent in Delaware holding the (Inaudible).

    Mr. Arthur G. Logan 
    We'll take Wilmington trust first. 
    The 19 -- from the time Mrs. Donner moved to in Florida 1944 whether we take the Florida court decision that it was an agency or whether we take and say it's a trust agreement, Wilmington Trust acted for her, took coupons, took its fee, remitted the proceeds to her. 
    Took instructions from the adviser she appointed and she changed her advisers from time to time. 
    She at one time asked to the senders part of the corpus which they did. 
    She did return it. 
    She had had to. 
    She could've taken all of them. 
    She had Wilmington Trust Company acting for her from 1944 while she was a Florida resident in 1952 and certainly they have more than minimum contacts in my humble view. 
    There -- this -- in other words, this trust company is acting really either -- it's either her trustee or her agent. 
    She's in Florida all the time. 
    And on -- as they're all doing is clipping coupons, taking instructions from her advisers as to -- well they -- they issued orders to buy and sell and change the securities. 
    The instructor would say, “Buy this, sell that, pay that, take that money” and -- and they followed those instructions, testimony in the (Voice Overlap) --

    Every case may -- really has to be decided probably on its own.

    Fair play, take that. 
    Is it unfair to ask Wilmington Trust Company, I'm treating with that first because Delaware trust company practically stepped into its shoes in $400,000 over as soon as they're involved, is it fair to ask them to go to Florida where their beneficiaries were when their trust was challenged?

    Let's get back -- let's get back to the plaintiff in the Delaware case, Mrs. Hanson, the executrix of the will. 
    After this family fight, it was at issue and going in Florida ready for decision. 
    She ran to Delaware. 
    Nobody lived in Delaware. 
    The two Trust Companies were up there, she named 22 defendants, 29 residents. 
    And she stayed home. 
    The case would have been decided there. 
    A Florida resident not satisfied to this except the judgment of her own state and her own state enjoined her from proceeding with the case. 
    But of course, she did not plan so many people by then the case went on. 
    But was it unfair -- of course it's the winter of 1954 and 1958. 
    I think the weather was better, it was unfair to ask the attorneys for Wilmington Trust Company and Delaware trust company to go down to Florida and let me point out something here which I think some choose this question. 
    They don't even care enough about that to ask to argue their position here. 
    They turned it over to Mr. Steel who's been carrying the ball and he's going to carry here in this Court. 
    And he is representing three of the children of Mrs. Hanson who ran to Delaware and they are Florida residents. 
    So you will hear not from Wilmington Trust. 
    They did file a brief here saying that they were not subject to service in Florida. 
    But is it unfair to ask them to do what they're really doing in this Court. 
    They're not down here to argue this case.

    Assuming the trust company had gone into Florida and the Florida court -- they had appeared and the Florida court had come up with this judgment, that would certainly be binding on these parties even though they applied Florida law because on the full faith and credit you cannot go into the question of whether the merits have been properly decided, you can go into the question of jurisdiction.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Well, if it were Florida -- suppose it was a Florida -- suppose a Delaware statute had spelled out explicitly what the Delaware court had spelled out by decision and the question then arose as it was hypothesized in the colloquy between Justice Black and yourself. 
    Suppose the statute and the Florida court said we pay no attention to the Delaware statute then it could come up to this Court.
speaker="arthur_g_logan" startTime="2585.583" stopTime="2648.665">
    Mr. Arthur G. Logan 
    I think so, it could then. 
    I might say this when the -- when these courts were dealing with this question, it's the question of whether or not all these cumulative reserve powers in this woman, whether they didn't break it down as a trust to make it an agency, Florida says, that was so, it was an agency. 
    Delaware now with its cumulative powers did not transfer it from a trust to an agency. 
    But both courts said, it was a matter of first impression with them. 
    So when you're talking in Florida of what Florida should do even though the Delaware courts later talk about Florida law and of Delaware law, Florida was hoping to find the answer to this question of these cumulative powers in this situation and had the beneficiary before it and as we say had before it the constructive service of the two trustees who were the stakeholders. 
    And Florida decided that the money should go into the trust for the daughters and not into the trust for the grandchildren.

    Mr. Sol A. Rosenblatt 
    Well sir, I would like to start from the time that this lady died. 
    Because when she died on November the 20th, 1952 as a domiciliary of Florida, she left a will which had been made on December 3rd, 1949 and she left executed on that same day, December 3rd, 1949 a so-called power of appointment. 
    And thereafter, another paper of July, 1950, and she says in the original trust that the disposition of that trust shall be upon her death in accordance with her last writing accepted by the trust company. 
    And her last writing doesn't even exercise the power of appointment. 
    So after she died, eight days letter -- later, Mr. Foulk, who is in these affidavits, submitted to the Court, describes a general counsel for the Donner estate. 
    Mr. Foulk wrote a letter and he's telling some beneficiaries on November 28 at page 79 of the Florida record, about this trust with the Wilmington Trust and he says that certain monies are to be paid to this executrix after the payment of the following specific legacies and he's talking about legacies in describing the so-called remainders in the trust. 
    I didn't use the language. 
    And thereafter sir, this executrix and her counsel Mr. Foulk filed an inventory as required by the Florida law and listed these assets of the Wilmington Trust Company trust as part and parcel of this Florida State. 
    More, she, the executrix of Florida domiciliary, Mr. Foulk her lawyer permitted in Florida to represent her, both took fees and commissions on that inventory which included these assets even though they were located in the State of Delaware. 
    These were the facts that came before the Court.Our people who are the appellees here had a right to rely upon that inventory. 
    And when the time was passing, and nothing was happening about disposing of the estate, the appellees brought this suit in the State of Florida and please let's not be confused further, page 12 of the record in Florida shows that the plaintiffs pray one, that the Court construe and determine the question of what portion of the trust property involved herein passes under the residuary clause of the will of the decedent. 
    Why is that? 
    Because in her will, she said that her Florida State should pay all the taxes even on this trust, which he described in Delaware. 
    So when this action was commenced, what happened first? 
    Well, low and behold, Mr. Foulk and the executrix rushed into the court in Florida, went to pay back the money and correct the inventory. 
    Up to that time, they'd never done anything of a kind. 
    The Florida court refused to take back the money. 
    That procedure is stayed to this very moment. 
    Now what did they do next? 
    Everybody including these trust companies had been cited. 
    I said that in her will she gave directions to the Wilmington Trust Company. 
    It's mentioned in the will. 
    I said that under her will, the Delaware trust company which Mr. Foulk is the Director and Head of the Trust Committee by the way, that Delaware trust company is a legatee under this will, and both of those trust companies were notified like all the other parties by constructive service, mailing by the clerk to their last known address under the records of Florida statute. 
    Same as we do in New York or Nebraska or any other State in the United States and when we have before us a question relating to a deed and estate or a will of a domiciliary of our State.

    They say, and I'm reading from the appellant's reply brief, the judgment appealed from rest on an adequate federal basis. 
    They bottomed the appeal on three federal grounds. 
    This is the Florida case which we moved to dismiss, (a) lack of due process under the Fourteenth Amendment. 
    Due process to who, Your Honors? 
    Not to the executrix, not to the guardian ad litem.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    You're suggesting to that -- that usually fell standing $417,000.
speaker="sol_a_rosenblatt" startTime="3918.757" stopTime="4192.750">
    Mr. Sol A. Rosenblatt 
    Well, I never saw that much money. 
    So, I'm very happy if my clients get it. 
    I say that this lady has no right to back into this Court claiming lack of due process against these trust companies. 
    The second ground is the alleged failure of the Florida courts to give full faith and credit to the judgment in the Delaware courts. 
    If Your Honors will take the time which I'm sure you do to read this fantastic decision of the Supreme of Court Delaware, which is cited as authority for their having a right to come here, you will see that the Supreme Court of Delaware has analyzed the decision of the Supreme Court of Florida which preceded it, and has said that the Supreme Court of Florida doesn't even know what the law of Florida is. 
    The Supreme Court of Florida cited the case which has been very much used in their jurisdiction called Henderson against Usher, 167. 
    The Supreme Court of Delaware says, “It doesn't mean at all,” what the Supreme Court of Florida said it meant although the Supreme Court of Florida decided the case. 
    And that's the way they go all the way through the decision. 
    You think that they were sitting as an appellate court over the Supreme Court of Florida. 
    The third thing is the failure to apply the proper state law in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. 
    Well, that's a good ground that I never heard of, because Florida has the right to apply Florida law to a Florida situation. 
    And I don't think even this Court can require that Florida should apply Delaware law to a Florida estate. 
    It resolves itself, in my opinion, to a very narrow issue and you can recall that I take the position, that if this Court in reviewing my motion to dismiss this case were to hold that there couldn't be any constructive service on the Wilmington Trust Company or the Delaware trust company, even though they're mentioned in the will of legatee. 
    If you -- you held that, I say that under Pennoyer against Neff, I am still entitled to the judgment of the Supreme Court of Florida as between all of the Floridians. 
    I say, that that's binding between the people who were before the Court. 
    Of the innocent victim that was on the wrong side in that Vanderbilt versus Vanderbilt case last year, that's got nothing to do with this at all. 
    But Pennoyer against Neff, which does apply, certainly entitles me to say that as between the parties in Florida who were there and in this case, that that is a binding decree of the Supreme Court of Florida. 
    Now, so far, I haven't asked to enforce that decree and the Supreme Court of the United States has said again and again that until there's some real question before it, it won't anticipate. 
    I haven't asked that my judgment of the Supreme Court of Florida be considered as something which I'm asking this Court to execute and impose upon all the other States yet. 
    Yes, in the brief, we said that the dignity of the Florida Supreme Court should be upheld and that its judgement entitled to full faith and credit. 
    But I don't care, as Mr. Logan cares, that there is a decision of the Delaware Supreme Court, my people were never parties to the decision in Delaware, the infants who are beneficiaries, under the so-called power of appointment. 
    Those beneficiaries are represented by a guardian ad litem, their own mother in the State of Florida. 
    They didn't have to be, until she and Mr. Foulk run up to Delaware. 
    She didn't -- they didn't have to have a Delaware guardian ad litem.

    It was for -- on the following basis.

    I say that in view of the provisions of the will itself, referring to the Wilmington Trust Company and in view of the provisions making that Delaware trust company a legatee, that the State of Florida under its statute, which is appended to our brief in a declaratory suit, has the same right to ask that those companies be heard or forever keep their peace as it has any others interested in an estate. 
    The Supreme Court of Florida has cited a case from New Jersey on the problem. 
    It has also cited a case where it itself gave service to the Chase National Bank which was a trustee in New York, similar to the Wilmington Trust Company in Delaware. 
    There is authority within the State of Florida upholding its right in this kind of a declaratory action to cite in those that it considers ought to be before the Court.

    But answering your question, where was the Wilmington Trust Company had notice and the Delaware trust company who was a legatee?

    And I wish Your Honors to please consider very carefully the alleged basis for jurisdiction from the Florida judgment. 
    I think I made it clear and I'm saying it now for the fourth time that I'm not at all interested in the decision from Delaware. 
    It's my duty and my burden here which I hope I've discharged to show that there is no jurisdiction in this Court to hear the appeal from the Supreme Court of Florida. 
    No certiorari has been granted here. 
    They just raised these points for the first time in a petition for rehearing after the Supreme Court of Florida decided its case. 
    These alleged grounds are for the first time brought to the State of Florida on the petition for rehearing after the decision of the Supreme Court of Florida. 
    And I've cited plenty of authority that they can't back in on that basis either. 
    Now, may it please this Court. 
    I think that there is one thing that ought to be made clear. 
    There has been great comment by text writers, newspaper personnel, strangers, those not members of the Bar, who are constantly complaining that this Court that takes itself into considerations of state law so that there is no grounding for the alleged federal questions. 
    I have emphasized my position because timely, we move to dismiss this appeal which had been taken in my opinion without any warrant or without any authority, and on the basis of points raised for the first time in the petition for rehearing the decision of the Supreme Court of Florida. 
    I asked that this Court consider the Florida case per se. 
    I ask that the Court read the Florida judgement as springing from the holdings long established of Florida law. 
    I ask that the Court consider that whether this judgement of the Supreme Court of Florida is sought to be enforced otherwise or elsewhere that the Supreme Court of Florida had the right to make its decision. 
    And that it has like all the other States the right to supervise and oversee the acts, the deeds, the wills, and the estates of its domiciliaries. 
    The Supreme Court of Florida has held that on an inter vivos trust where no present interest have been given, the Supreme Court of Florida says that there is a republication of the so-called trust instrument when an attempt is made to amend it after a person has become a resident of Florida. 
    In 1949, the trust having originated in 1935 and had been amended theretofore twice. 
    In 1949 sir, there was one so-called exercise of the power of appointment. 
    And in July 1950, and I ask you please to see what this last writing contains because it certainly is not an exercise of any power of appointment.

    Mr. Sol A. Rosenblatt 
    But in 1950, there was another one. 
    And the Supreme Court of Florida says, “Just the same as other States that when those amendments were made, that constituted really a republication of the original so-called trust document by its domiciliary.” 
    And they say that in accordance with long held Florida law that when that was republished, for example the last paper writing being in 1950, it had to be executed with the same solemnity as any testamentary instrument.

    Mr. Sol A. Rosenblatt 
    Now has the Florida court the right to say how a testamentary disposition is to be executed? Every State makes certain provisions about them. 
    I don't know what the law would be in New York or some of the other States as to an ambulatory instrument like this, whether you would call it a trust or an agency, I don't care. 
    I have cited in my brief, I think, a very apt decision of the Supreme Court of Mississippi which says, that when an instrument in form of deeds, specifically provides that it shall not take effect until the death of the grantor, it is testamentary in character and void as a deed. 
    And may it please the Court. 
    I think that when the Supreme Court of Mississippi so declared, the Supreme Court of Florida has the right to similarly declare as it did. 
    When it said a deed in order to be effective as such must pass a present interest to the grantee, although grantee's right to enter into possession may be deferred to a future time. 
    And if the deed manifested intention that it shall be operative only upon the grantor's death, it can never take effect at all unless executed with such formality that it maybe given effect as a testamentary disposition. 
    And I say that not even this August court of the Supreme Court of the United States has the right to overthrow the long established law of the State of Florida over its own domiciliary.

    Mr. Edwin D. Steel, Jr. 
    May it please the Court. 
    I appear as guardian ad litem appointed by the Court of Chancery for three minors who have beneficial interest under one of the Delaware trust company which was an appointee, one of the Delaware trust company trusts. 
    The -- because of the time limitations or rather I should say the number of counsel limitations which were imposed, the Wilmington Trust Company and Delaware trust company has also consented that I say what need to be said on their behalf. 
    I have represented neither of those institutions in the litigation. 
    The interest of my clients, of course, is sustaining the Delaware judgment and the validity of the trust. 
    Let me cite preliminarily what I think is not an issue here. 
    This Court is not concerned with the merits of the question of whether the 1935 Trust was an agency agreement or an inter vivos trust that presents no federal question. 
    There is substantial authority which would support the Delaware view on that. 
    Recent action taken by the restatement in May of this year, cited on page 5 of the brief of the Wilmington Trust Company is authority for the validity as a trust of such an agreement. 
    What this Court is concerned with is or are two constitutional questions which were separate in the State. 
    And as it seems to me clearcut analysis the problem requires at all times that a distinction be kept in mind. 
    The first is the full faith and credit question as to whether Delaware should be bound by the Florida judgment because as we contend, Florida was lacking in jurisdiction over indispensable parties and hence the judgment is binding on no one. 
    The second constitutional question is one which would arise if the Court should resolve that first question adversely to my clients. 
    On the hypothesis, as to Mr. Justice Black, put it that everybody was, in fact, before the Florida court. 
    Did Florida choose the right law when it shows Florida law and not Delaware law? 
    And under teachings of this Court, the erroneous choice of law can interrupt -- can deprive a judgment based on the erroneous choice of law of due process. 
    Now there are two separate questions. 
    Let me address myself first if I may to the question of the jurisdiction of the Florida court over the Delaware trust company and the Wilmington Trust Company. 
    That jurisdiction purportedly came about by virtue of a Florida statute which contained 10 subdivisions, 9 of which dealt with in rem actions. 
    The one, under which the Court purported to act presumably and the decision of Florida says nothing about it, is one which authorized the service by publication for the construction of a will, deed, contract or other written instrument and for the judicial declaration or enforcement of legal or equitable rights thereunder. 
    And let me start and approach the problem with what I'm going to call pre-McGee law and then speak of McGee against Insurance Company and what if any impact it may have on the problem. 
    Certainly -- certainly, absent the minimum contact theory, the Court where a will has been probated has no jurisdiction in a plenary action to determine whether out-of-state property, owned by out-of-state people or let me put it this way, whether out-of-state property claimed by out-of-state people, ownership of which is claimed by out-of-state people can be rested and determine -- taken from and repost in the hands of the administrators. 
    This isn't a question and I think the distinction is important as to whether or not out-of-state properties owned by the decedent passes in one way or another under the Florida will. 
    This is a much more basic question than that. 
    This is a question of whether out-of-state property is, in fact, owned by the Florida decedent. 
    And I suggest to Your Honors that this case is no different leaving aside minimum contacts for the moment. 
    This case is no different that it would have been if the administrator had filed a suit against the Delaware resident who held shares of stock owned by the decedent and claim that those shares of stock had been transferred by the decedent during her lifetime, as a result of fraud and deception practiced upon her and had asked that that ownership or rather claim of ownership out-of-state could be adjudicated in Florida. 
    I see that there's no difference this Court in the Bakers, the Eccles case has held that the Court of domicile of a decedent could not determine in a plenary action against the nonresident where intangibles were held that the interest of that nonresident in those intangibles was cut off. 
    Now that has been -- was based on Pennoyer v. Neff and I think Pennoyer v. Neff has never been willed away in those circumstances unless, and I'm going to come to the minimum contact, it was on some minimum contact theory.Let me say preliminary about minimum contact.

    Before you move on to that, am I right in going inference from what you've just said that until the interest of the beneficiaries, potential beneficiaries under the Delaware trust -- under the Delaware trust influence, are declared by Delaware court to the nonexisting interest, that they have potentially, if I may use an old fashioned phrase, have vested interest which couldn't be cut off.

    In default of none -- of none exercise of the reserve power.
speaker="edwin_d_steel_jr" startTime="5384.315" stopTime="6058.884">
    Mr. Edwin D. Steel, Jr. 
    That's correct. 
    Florida doesn't have a minimum contact statute such as California had which provided that if an insurance policy was delivered to a beneficiary in California and premiums were paid from California that that insurance company was amenable to in personam jurisdiction in California. 
    This statute which I read doesn't profess to do that, it doesn't profess to lay down any standards of any kind. 
    And as a matter of fact the Florida court didn't base its theory on any minimum contact theory. 
    And I submit that the Delaware court was entitled to take that Florida decision as it would writ without minimum contacts and measure it against constitutional requirements to see whether it was right or whether it was wrong. 
    It wasn't incumbent on the Delaware court to delve around the theories of all sorts to see whether the Florida court might have relied on those theories but didn't. 
    But passing that, passing that and coming down to the minimum contact business, the Delaware trust company, as appointee of $400,000, it was the trust company of a trust, as to which the decedent had no -- nothing to do. 
    The decedent wasn't the settlor of the trust. 
    The decedent wasn't the income beneficiary of the trust and the trust was irrevocable. 
    So that the content which Florida had with the institution which now holds the assets and which held the assets as a result of the distribution which was made before the Florida suit has began. 
    The only contact which Florida has -- had there is because the beneficiary is under that trust resided in Florida, that's the contact. 
    Now, is a contact which those beneficiaries have with the trustee because of their beneficial interest? 
    Such a contact as to permit a third party to come in and say that because of that isolated, insulated type of contact, a third party can hale into the Florida court and get, if you please, not in rem jurisdiction but as the Florida court said clearly, in personam jurisdiction, in personam jurisdiction. 
    I submit that that's not the kind of a contact. 
    It's not the kind of an evil which this Court was dealing with or considering in the McGee against Insurance Company. 
    Now, what was the contact which -- and I say this. 
    That in the absence of the Delaware trust company regardless of what contacts the Wilmington Trust Company might have had, in the absence of the Delaware trust company which holds those assets and held the assets when the Florida action was began, Florida had no jurisdiction to make an adjudication unless it had jurisdiction over the trust company and those minimum contacts I've described is more than sufficient to give it to him. 
    Now, so far as the Wilmington Trust Company is concerned, the 1935 Trust was created when Mrs. Donner lived in Philadelphia in 1935. 
    Nine years later, she moved to Florida. 
    She exercised of the first two powers when she lived in Pennsylvania. 
    She exercised the third power when she was residing in Florida. 
    She exercised it in Pennsylvania as shown by the Delaware record. 
    And she exercised the fourth power in Montreal, Canada. 
    And that's shown in the Gold affidavit which is not mentioned in our brief but is at page 295 of the Delaware record. 
    Now it's true that Mrs. Donner did reserve a life interest in the right to exercise these powers. 
    But that wasn't a contact which she had when that trust was created. 
    Wilmington Trust Company didn't go into Florida by any voluntary act of its own; it was taken into Florida, so to speak, when the settlor moved into Florida. 
    And I suggest to you again that that type of contact is completely different than the type of contact you have in a case like International Shoe where you have business being solicited by the defendant who would be held. 
    The type of contact you had in McGee against Insurance Company or the type of contact you have where you served a non -- a nonresident motorist to voluntarily come in. 
    Now, my friend may argue that -- that the Wilmington Trust Company could have gone into Court and asked to have been relieved of its responsibilities and that type of non-action resulted in its further contacts in distributing income, and let me say something about that in some sort of a contact. 
    But the fact of the matter is the Delaware record shows that there was no income sent down to Florida to Mrs. Donner. 
    It was all put in the Wilmington Trust Company who worked out and the advisors of the trust in Philadelphia were informed of it. 
    The record also shows that when there were purchases and sales of securities, Mrs. Donner was never advised of it. 
    The information all went to these life long associates or her families in Philadelphia who were advisors of the trust and they were told about it. 
    When proxies were sent for execution, they weren't sent to Mrs. Donner after the banks had signed them for sending into the company. 
    They were sent to -- in Philadelphia, so that those contacts with Florida were of the minimal variety. 
    And I suggest that this matter of -- of minimum contacts, if given the comprehensive scope which my adversaries would give to it, would result in this sort of a thing. 
    Stockholder and corporation, many contacts between a stockholder and a corporation, proxy materials sent, proxies are set in, dividends sent and whatnot. 
    Can it be said that that type of contact gives the State where the stockholder lives, jurisdiction over the corporation in any suit which would be brought against them, they're much more extensive than these contact are in this situation. 
    So much for minimum contacts as we see, we think that the doctrine of the McGee against Insurance Company which of course we filed to was a doctrine which was understandable, which was under a statute which prescribe standards of minimum contact, and did result in the avoidance or will result in avoidance of an evil of which -- which was -- which many of us are cognizant of these polices being written and the burden being put on a -- a beneficiary to chase. 
    Now, let's pass the question of -- of jurisdiction and make the assumption. 
    That on some theory, the Delaware trust company and the Wilmington Trust Company, were brought in to Florida court. 
    I think it can't be sustained for the reasons I have stated. 
    But if that position should be sustained, then I suggest that you have this further question, namely, whether Florida was wrong in applying Florida law to strike down a relationship which was valid under Delaware and whether or not, that error was not so vital and basic as to constitute a denial of due process. 
    Now this Court has spoken on that subject on several occasions and I -- I'm sure it's a little naughty problem because one time Court goes one seemingly on fine distinctions goes one way or another. 
    But the case we rely on is the Hartford against Delta Land Company case, where there was fidelity bond written in the State of Tennessee. 
    That case, Your Honor, is referred to -- on -- it's 292 U.S. 143 and it's referred to on pages 29 and 30 of our brief. 
    There was a case where there was a fidelity bond in -- written in Tennessee. 
    A defalcation occurred, a defalcation occurred in Mississippi. 
    The plaintiff was a Mississippi corporation. 
    The defendant was an out-of-state corporation but both were doing business in Mississippi where the defalcation occurred. 
    The bond contained a provision which limited liability after a period of time. 
    That provision was good in Tennessee where the bond was ready. 
    It was bad under the statutes and public policy of Mississippi. 
    Mississippi therefore said, “Plaintiff can recover on the bond.” 
    The case went to this Court and this Court reversed saying that the contract was a contract which had its intimate relations with the place where it was written and that law and not Mississippi law was controlled. 
    We suggest that -- that this relationship which was created, which I call a trust and my friends call an agency in Delaware was a much more static and less ambulatory or transient type of relationship than you have in the case of a fidelity bond which ensures persons against losses all over the country. 
    And by a fortiori reason, by a fortiori reason, the principle of the Hartford case would apply to this situation and that it was wrong for the Florida court to cease all the Florida law to strike down a relationship which was valid in the State where it was entered into.
