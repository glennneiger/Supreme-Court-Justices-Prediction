    Mr. Haimoff, you may proceed and we understand that there is no one here on the bottom side is that correct?
speaker="louis_haimoff" startTime="25.006" stopTime="145.750">
    Mr. Louis Haimoff 
    That is correct, Your Honor. 
    Mr. Chief Justice, if the Court please. 
    This case is here on certiorari to the Supreme Court of the State of North -- North Carolina. 
    The judgment involved is a judgment of the Supreme Court in North Carolina which denied the petition of the petitioner here, Mrs. Kovacs, to enforce in North Carolina an award of the New York Court which had -- which had awarded to her the custody of her child. 
    The child was then eight years of age, a little girl. 
    The case comes here on the following facts. 
    The parties were married originally in New York where they resided. 
    The marriage occurred in 1945. 
    The child was born in New York in 1946. 
    In 1950, the husband brought an action against the wife for divorce in New York and after a trial, judgment was rendered in favor of the husband against the wife. 
    With respect to custody, the court held that while it would not have ordinarily taken the child from his mother really by reason of the misconduct which had been found in the case, nevertheless, the Court did so for the reason that he found that the mother's financial situation and circumstances with such as not to promote the interest and welfare of the child. 
    There was another problem with respect to custody because the husband was then in the navy and has been throughout this proceeding.

    Mr. Louis Haimoff 
    If he is, Your Honor, in the navy. 
    For that reason, the court ultimately decided to award the custody of the child to the paternal grandfather who was a resident of North Carolina. 
    And accordingly the child, he went to North Carolina and remained there with her grandfather.

speaker="louis_haimoff" startTime="177.168" stopTime="259.060">
    Mr. Louis Haimoff 
    So far, as the record is concerned, yes Your Honor. 
    In 1951 and again in 1952, Mrs. Kovacs made application to the Supreme Court in New York to modify the order which has been made and both of these applications were denied. 
    The court presumably finding that there has been no sufficient change in her circumstances as to warrant any change of custody. 
    In 1954, however, she married Joseph Kovacs who has been named as correspondent in the original divorce action and she went to live with him in Riverdale, New York. 
    Based upon this change in her circumstances, a new application was made, came on to be heard, the Brewers, the grandfather, the father and son appeared by counsel submitted affidavits and upon the basis of the evidence submitted, the court modified its earlier order and awarded custody of the child to Mrs.Kovacs. 
    With this order, the petitioner here attempted to obtain custody of the child. 
    The Brewers however refused voluntarily to surrender the child.

    Mr. Louis Haimoff 
    Well, the proceeding was a motion in the divorce action so that Brewer, Jr., the plaintiff appeared by counsel submitted an affidavit and his father who had actual custody of the child did not appear by counsel but did submitted an affidavit in opposition to the application to modify the custody award.

    Mr. Louis Haimoff 
    Yes, Your Honor. 
    In other way, the motion, the application of Mrs. Kovacs was by motion in the divorce action. 
    In other words, if the question is whether or not the grandfather was added as another party, that is not so.

    Mr. Louis Haimoff

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Did it require the grandfather to do anything?
speaker="louis_haimoff" startTime="322.768" stopTime="356.284">
    Mr. Louis Haimoff 
    It did require the grandfather to surrender custody of the child since the order of the Supreme Court originally had awarded custody of the child to the grandfather. 
    I think possibly, the legal analysis of that situation is that the grandfather is acting pursuant to court order as agent of the father, Brewer, Jr., who was in the navy taking care of the child temporarily pending his service in the navy. 
    If he was -- I think the father ever left the navy, the custody of the child would then be turned over to him. 
    But that never happened.

    The jurisdiction of the State of North Carolina based upon the idea of a notion that the state has acted as parents patriotic, I consider it applies only in a case where there is no parent or were the rights of a parents are being adjudicated. 
    The point of this whole appeal is that what we have involved here is an adjudication of the right of the parents as between the parents to the custody of the child. 
    Now, the net effect of the New York decision was to award the custody of the child to the father. 
    Well the reasons which I have pointed out, the Court considered it appropriate to send the child to the father's father or the child's grandfather in North Carolina.

    And the child is there and has been there. 
    And now because another New York judge several years later thinks that she would make a good -- what shall I say? 
    Tender and desirable mother and such a judge, I take it for granted, is allowed to make that judgment. 
    If a child isn't there and he does not know anything about it at a distance, that determination that's controlling upon North Carolina in theory and law as though these were a controversy about a negotiable instrument.

    Exactly. 
    Now may I -- may I add to that, if Your Honor please that if -- if -- if that statement is not correct although it sounds extreme as it was put --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="956.083" stopTime="958.678">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    I want it to be accurate whether it's extreme or not, there's a difference.

    Mr. Louis Haimoff 
    It is accurate. 
    (Voice Overlap) and it is a necessary result of the adjudication of the decision of this Court in May against Anderson which was to the effect that a proceeding with respect to custody is a proceeding in personam. 
    In other words, if you -- if you are dealing with the rights of individuals with respect to money or with respect to children, and if you hold that personal service on both -- on both parents, it is necessary. 
    In order to give the Court jurisdiction, you have in effect rule that in custody cases, no distinction is to be drawn. 
    And that once you have defined the rights of the parents, once you have held that we are concerned in custody matters with the rights of the parents then it follows that you are dealing with the personal rights of individuals, the mother and the father and that the presence of the child or the physical whereabouts of the child is irrelevant. 
    Now, the fact that the child is not present in Court and the fact that the judge has no opportunity, let us say, to confer with the child, ought not to make a difference unless you are going to establish a different rule for an infant or for a grown child.

    Mr. Louis Haimoff 
    Well, I would like -- perhaps I want at this point, Mr. Justice Frankfurter, to refer to -- to the decision of this Court in the Halvey case where the statement was made that the -- where the statement was made after Florida decree or to be binding in New York and that the New York court ought not to change the Florida decree simply because the New York court disagreed with the Florida decision. 
    Perhaps I could read the language because it's exactly the point I have in mind.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1275.435" stopTime="1286.911">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    As I understand -- as I recall that, I think I wrote something there too and the whole point of that case was that you're dealing -- when you're dealing with custody, you're dealing with something very different from a negotiable instance.
speaker="louis_haimoff" startTime="1286.911" stopTime="1316.763">
    Mr. Louis Haimoff 
    That is true in a sense Your Honor. 
    The language I have in mind is this. 
    The child's welfare must be the controlling consideration. 
    Whenever a Court which can actually lay hold of a child is appealed to on behalf of the child, there's no question about that. 
    Short of that, a valid custodial decree by Florida could not be set aside simply because a New York court, on independent consideration, has its own view of what custody would be appropriate.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1316.763" stopTime="1317.901">

    Mr. Louis Haimoff 
    We don't agree with that, if Your Honor please. 
    And the -- and the New York court which originally made the order, awarding custody to the grandfather has now also reconsidered its decision and it's in line with the normal --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1359.762" stopTime="1362.657">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Was the child before the New York court?
speaker="louis_haimoff" startTime="1362.657" stopTime="1425.252">
    Mr. Louis Haimoff 
    Well, I'd like to address myself to that, if I may Your Honor as to whether or not the child was before the New York court. 
    In other words, it seems to me we ought not to -- well not to confuse but link together at the same time the question as to the legal right of the Court to make decision and the further question as to whether we agree with it or whether it acted on -- on insufficient evidence. 
    In other words, the question it seems to me that is now being raised is how can a court make a decision with respect to custody unless the child is in court? 
    Well now, it very often happens that such orders are made and the child is not in court. 
    The child maybe away in school. 
    This is a matter for the judge to -- to determine but we are not concerned with that question. 
    That's dealing with the sufficiency of the evidence of the New York court that might be a matter that could be presented on appeal. 
    Mr. Brewer, Jr. could have taken an appeal in New York and urge it. 
    How could this New York court have changed the decision that was formerly made? 
    The child wasn't even here. 
    This is a matter that's addressed, it seems to me, to the correctness of the decision --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1425.252" stopTime="1426.021">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    May I -- may I --
speaker="louis_haimoff" startTime="1426.021" stopTime="1427.127">
    Mr. Louis Haimoff 
    -- not to the jurisdiction of a court to make it.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1427.127" stopTime="1494.996">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    May I quote it to you why it is relevant to my mind? 
    It isn't merely a question of the evidence on which the judge acted but what legal rule, what imperative requirement we should make to determination by distant tribunal abstractly considering the question without having available the kind of evidence in a normal instance, determine such a judgment. 
    Now, the cases to which I -- you refer, I read a lot of them. 
    They deal with the difficulty of the problem whether a child of eight years or nine years or six years or 12 years can give evidence on what basis the court can act. 
    The cases are full of that kind of thought. 
    But we're not considering a legal question which you're tendering quite right now that abstractly considered because the New York District Court, having no evidence before except the quality of the mother now that she's remarried to change the condition in which the child has been in the last four years as a constitutional doctrine. 
    That's what you're tendering, right? 
    Aren't you? 
    Isn't that true?
speaker="louis_haimoff" startTime="1494.996" stopTime="1496.473">
    Mr. Louis Haimoff 
    I don't -- I don't agree with that. 
    With all due --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1496.473" stopTime="1498.409">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    But isn't it a constitutional doctrine you're tendering?
speaker="louis_haimoff" startTime="1498.409" stopTime="1524.466">
    Mr. Louis Haimoff 
    I am tendering a constitutional doctrine but not that one which it seems to me still addressed to the question of the correctness of the decision of the New York court. 
    I'm not dealing with that. 
    I'm dealing with the question of the jurisdiction of the Court to make that decision and it seems to me that does not depend and I see no authority for it anywhere on the fact that the child happens to be physically within the state. 
    Are we dealing now with physical presence, residence or domicile?
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1524.466" stopTime="1552.916">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    I'm suggesting that in order to determine a constitutional question, we are not to determine it in abstract (Inaudible). 
    A legal question that the child is like a negotiable instance like a bill of exchange and since the bill of exchange determines in New York and binds other state, ergo, a determination regarding the child binds all the other state. 
    I'm challenging the basis on which we are asked to pronounce such a constitutional doctrine.
speaker="louis_haimoff" startTime="1552.916" stopTime="1562.081">
    Mr. Louis Haimoff 
    The only -- the answer that I would like to make to that is this, that we are dealing in custody cases with the rights of the parents.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1562.081" stopTime="1564.295">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Is that (Inaudible)
speaker="louis_haimoff" startTime="1564.295" stopTime="1573.044">
    Mr. Louis Haimoff 
    This I believe to be the necessary implication of May against Anderson and I believe that to be crucial to the decision of this question.
speaker="tom_c_clark" startTime="1573.044" stopTime="1575.410">
    Justice Tom C. Clark 
    Whether that would be the best interest of the child?
speaker="louis_haimoff" startTime="1575.410" stopTime="1602.900">
    Mr. Louis Haimoff 
    The fact that a resolution of the conflicting interests of the parents to the custody of the child depends or turns upon the welfare of the children. 
    It does not alter the fact that what is basically being passed upon or adjudicated is the right of either parents to the custody, care, management and companionship of the child.
speaker="tom_c_clark" startTime="1602.900" stopTime="1607.607">
    Justice Tom C. Clark 
    Wasn't that a constitutional right? 
    They don't own them, do they?
speaker="louis_haimoff" startTime="1607.607" stopTime="1624.833">
    Mr. Louis Haimoff 
    They don't own them, that is true but they are legal rights and all legal rights, all legal -- I mean in other words, there is nothing in the United States constitution in the Full Faith and Credit Clause which says that all judgments except judgments in custody matters must be respected by other states. 
    It says --
speaker="tom_c_clark" startTime="1624.833" stopTime="1631.318">
    Justice Tom C. Clark 
    Are there any state that make a judgment for the custody of a child forever binding?
speaker="louis_haimoff" startTime="1631.318" stopTime="1715.594">
    Mr. Louis Haimoff 
    No state does but there is an established -- but the fact -- but the proposition which is that a Court may modify its earlier decision assumes the jurisdiction of the court to have made its earlier decision and acts upon the basis of evidence of -- of facts which have occurred since the rendition of the early adjustment. 
    There is no question that the New York court as in the Halvey case which presented that situation. 
    The New York Court there on the basis of fact which have not been presented, require the Court modify the acquired decision and this Court sustained the action of the Florida -- of the New York court on the very theory that what Florida could do, New York could do. 
    So we -- that question is not presented here because that question assumes the jurisdiction of the Court to make the original -- and also assume since the courts talk in terms of facts not previously presented and in terms of changed circumstances also assume that in the absence of those things, in the absence of changed circumstances, in the absence of evidence which had not been presented to the prior courts that -- that award would be binding and ought to be respected because otherwise, judicial proceedings with respect to custody matters are excluded or excised from the Full Faith and Credit Clause as if there has been a specific exception of that type of judgment. 
    Now --
speaker="tom_c_clark" startTime="1715.594" stopTime="1720.887">
    Justice Tom C. Clark 
    Do you think there is no jurisdiction in the state where a child is determined? 
    There is jurisdiction.
speaker="louis_haimoff" startTime="1720.887" stopTime="1868.223">
    Mr. Louis Haimoff 
    There are two types of jurisdiction in a state where the child is physically located. 
    There is the jurisdiction which has been referred to which was applied in the Halvey case based upon as I said the evidence not submitted or upon other facts. 
    There is also another type of jurisdiction which is entirely independent of the jurisdiction and we have thus far have been talking about which has to do with a divorce proceeding and the incidental power of the Court which is passing upon a divorce to make awards with respect to alimony and custody. 
    There is another jurisdiction which was set forth in the Finley case in the New York Court of Appeals and was actually the origin of the North Carolina Rule about the Reece. 
    In that case, the Court held that the parties could not bring into the New York court a dispute which had to do with their respective claims to the custody of the children without at the same time bringing -- unless there were a divorce action. 
    In other words, there was no independent proceeding to define the rights of the parties with respect to the child. 
    The Court did say however that the Court -- that the State of New York has a jurisdiction as parent's patriot to take care of the child if the welfare of the child requires it. 
    But the Court pointed out that there was nothing in that case to show that this was a kind of an emergency situation which required the Court to intervene for the benefit of the child. 
    Now, that is the jurisdiction and that would apply whether there are no parents. 
    It applies to orphans, to abandoned children, it has nothing to do in my opinion where the situation where you are dealing with a divorce suit, where the Court and the divorce action made an award with respect to custody and where that Court subsequently modifies it upon the appearance of the parties. 
    It will be entirely different of course that the parties had not appeared. 
    Based upon the appearance of the parties and then another court supposing the following day on the same facts says, “Well, we don't agree with you New York Supreme Court judge. 
    We have our own view as to what custody would be appropriate.” 
    I don't think that -- I mean either -- either I say the Full Faith and Credit Clause applies the custody proceedings or it does not. 
    If it does apply, then this judgment has to be reversed.
