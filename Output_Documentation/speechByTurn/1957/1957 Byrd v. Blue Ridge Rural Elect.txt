    Mr. Wesley M. Walker 
    Mr. Chief Justice and Members of this Honorable Court. 
    The rights and remedies here involved were created and controlled by virtue of a South Carolina statute. 
    In our brief, we referred to the case of Caughman versus Columbia Y.M.C.A.on page 23 in which case it is stated, "It was stated in Marchbanks versus Duke Power Company, et al., that Workmen's Compensation Acts or in derogation of or departures from the common law and are not a mandatory cumulative or supplemental thereto, nor declaratory thereof but wholly, substitutional in character." 
    These rights and remedies pursuant to Workmen's Compensation Acts are unknown to common law. 
    Certainly, the constitutionality of Workmen's Compensation Acts in the various States have been tested time and again. 
    I believe this Court held in the Mountain Timber Company versus State of Washington with respect to the Washington Compensation Act, that it's between employee and employer the Act abolishes all right of recovery in ordinary cases and therefore, leaves nothing to be tried by jury. 
    Now, the issue of the affirmative defense of the respondent in the present case was before the Court from the outset. 
    As a matter of fact, this affirmative defense was confronted with issue by motion four times during the trial of this case.

speaker="wesley_m_walker" startTime="149.939" stopTime="323.306">
    Mr. Wesley M. Walker 
    Thank you. 
    I will get into that. 
    There's one matter I wish to touch on first. 
    It will revert around to it, Mr. Justice Brennan. 
    Now, there were four motions made in the trial of this case. 
    The first motion was by the petitioner at the outset to conceal the compensation issue from the jury because it was a question of law. 
    The second motion was made by the respondent. 
    I made the motion at the close of the petitioner, the plaintiff's testimony by way of involuntary dismissal, contending that the plaintiff's own testimony showed that the work being done was a part of the trade and business of the defendant, and therefore the Workmen's Compensation defense was a bar to the plaintiff's action. 
    Third, at the close of the respondent's testimony, the plaintiff moved to dismiss the defense. 
    And at that time, the Court inquired of the plaintiff if he had any testimony throughout there and reply. 
    Then following that, and before exercising his ruling on the motion, the trial judge stated that, “Now, the defendant here is going to make a motion, another motion in connection with his defense at the close of all the testimonies. 
    Do you have any evidence to put in by way of replying?” 
    The plaintiff said, “We make our motion now.” 
    Then following that, the district judge said that he would grant the motion. 
    But in so doing, and in those pages of the record between 48 and 52, the trial judge said, “I'm going to allow the defendant to make his motion for a directed verdict and I'm going to allow him to include this affirmative defense as a ground of that motion.” 
    My point quickly is this, may it please this Court, that the issue was paramount throughout the trial from the outset to the end. 
    There was no motion made by the plaintiff to strike his admission with respect to this defense. 
    There was no motion made by this plaintiff to strike the testimony that had been presented throughout the trial with regard to this defense. 
    Certainly, the district judge, the trial judge when he said, “I'm going to keep the matter open.”

    Mr. Wesley M. Walker 
    I do not think, Mr. Justice Whittaker, that he admitted the detail in that respect. 
    But there was that testimony and no testimony offered to rebut.

    That's --

    Justice Charles E. Whittaker 
    You wonder, I do, if that would have been the record.

speaker="wesley_m_walker" startTime="442.758" stopTime="567.561">
    Mr. Wesley M. Walker 
    Mr. Justice Whittaker, I feel certain that the evidence would have remained the same. 
    It could not have been contradicted. 
    Those facts are there. 
    They could not be contradicted, but he had the opportunity. 
    The plaintiff had the occasion. 
    He was advised, he was notified, he was warned. 
    He elected to make his motion at the time that he did and the Court specifically held the matter open. 
    And then, at the conclusion, the Court had undertook. 
    The Court listened to the arguments. 
    This matter on the motion for directed verdict was fully argued. 
    I argued it to the best of my capacity and then at the conclusion of it, the judge ruled upon the motion. 
    But the judge expressly allowed our rights to be reserved. 
    He granted us an exception with respect to the plaintiff's motion to dismiss the affirmative defense. 
    And when this matter goes to the Court of Appeals, the court below, I wish to point out here that go back to the trial and with regard to the trial judge allowing this matter to be kept open, allowing this affirmative defense to be a part of the motion for a directed verdict, the plaintiff did not take exception. 
    The plaintiff made no objection. 
    He sets out. 
    If he had any objection to what the trial judge was doing at the time of making his ruling, it was incumbent upon him in the trial court to exercise his objection at that time and to say so. 
    Now, to go one step further, may it please the Court, the petitioner here has never complained of the trial judge allowing us, the respondent, to keep and to tell that part of our motion in our motion for a directed verdict. 
    The plaintiff --

    That is the petitioner's complaint here in this Honorable Court. 
    And we submit most respectfully, the petitioner here has not been deprived of any right of jury trial. 
    This question of the Compensation Act, this question of the South Carolina Act, the South Carolina law, it was strictly a matter of jurisdiction, it was a matter of law for the Court to decide and that had been determined in this case from the outset on the plaintiff -- his own motion.

    Yes, sir.
speaker="charles_e_whittaker" startTime="620.293" stopTime="644.900">
    Justice Charles E. Whittaker 
    -- did you open that? 
    Under your law, your compensation which creates this right of liability without cause, was that question of determining whether it applied to the exclusion of a common law (Inaudible) a procedural or a substantive matter of South Carolina law?
speaker="wesley_m_walker" startTime="644.900" stopTime="804.475">
    Mr. Wesley M. Walker 
    We say, sir, that it is a matter of substantive law of South Carolina. 
    It is a jurisdictional issue. 
    The -- the matter of jurisdiction is not a matter that can be tried by men of the jury, men not trained in the law. 
    It is a matter that must be decided by the Court. 
    It is an issue of law.In that respect, I wish to refer to our brief again where we cited the Guaranty Trust case. 
    And we think that here, it applies. 
    Here is Erie versus Tompkins as applied to our case and if I may to read the quote from our brief with respect to Erie versus Tompkins and then to apply here. 
    This Court said Erie versus Tompkins was not an endeavor to formulate scientific legal terminology. 
    It expressed a policy that touches vitally the proper distribution of judicial power between state and federal courts. 
    In essence, the intent of that decision was to insure that in all cases where a federal court is exercising jurisdiction solely because of the diversity of citizenship of the parties and certainly here, may it please the Court, the jurisdiction of the District Court, the federal court was exercised solely because of the diversity of citizenship of the parties and the jurisdictional amount involved. 
    And going on, the Court -- this Court said the outcome of the litigation in the federal court should be substantially the same, so far as legal rules determine the outcome of a litigation as it would be if tried in a state court. 
    The nub of the policy that underlies Erie versus Tompkins is that for the same transaction, the accident of a suit by a non-resident litigant in a federal court instead of a state court, a block away should not lead to a substantially different result. 
    And concluding plainly enough, a statute that would completely bar recovery in a suit if brought in a state court bears only state-created right. 
    We say it bears upon the substantive law of the State as created by our statute. 
    It bears on a state-created right vitally and not merely formally or negligibly as to consequences that so intimately affect recovery or non-recovery a federal court in a diversity case should follow state law. 
    Thank you for your courtesy.

    If the claim is brought before the Industrial Commission, then the Industrial Commission will, of course, make the first determination as to jurisdiction. 
    But under our South Carolina Compensation Act, that is the one factual matter that is reviewable by the Court and by the Supreme Court of our State. 
    And Adams versus Davison-Paxon and the line of other cases cited in our brief have held time and again that it is a matter of law for the Court to decide, it is the matter of jurisdiction, sir.

   Argument of Henry Hammer

    Mr. Hammer.
speaker="henry_hammer" startTime="884.300" stopTime="956.778">
    Mr. Henry Hammer 
    May it please the Court. 
    At the outset with reference to the testimony of the respondent's managing agent, (Inaudible), we submit that if that testimony can be treated as some evidence that the respondent's direct employees at some time perform the activity of building substations, it is clear from the record that at the time the petitioner lost both his arms and for a long time prior to thereto, the respondent was not engaged in this activity if indeed if ever was engaged in such activities. 
    And in this connection, with reference to a question asked of me yesterday by Mr. Justice Frankfurter as to whether the nature of the work at the time of injury controls, I would like to ask this Court to consider the case of Gordon versus Hollywood-Beaufort Package Corporation, 213 S.C.438 --

    Or in 49 S.E.2d 718 in which this Court -- in which the South Carolina Supreme Court held that the type of activity performed at the time of the petitioner's injuries by the owner controls in determining whether the work comes within the Act or if excluded from the Act.

    Justice Charles E. Whittaker 
    (Inaudible)
speaker="henry_hammer" startTime="1001.240" stopTime="1218.722">
    Mr. Henry Hammer 
    The type of work that is being performed by the employer, the employer's activities. 
    In that case, if Your Honors please, it appeared that a claim was brought against the defendant, Hollywood-Beaufort Package Corporation, for workmen's compensation benefits. 
    And it also appeared that sometime prior to the petitioner's injuries, the employer was engaged in manufacturing rotary veneer which was used in its principal business of also manufacturing shipping containers. 
    And under the South Carolina statute where an employer is engaged in the business of manufacturing shipping containers principally, he is exempt from the application of the Act. 
    Sometime previous to the petitioner's injuries, this employer gave up its operations of manufacturing shipping containers but retained that part of the operation of producing rotary veneer which was placed or used for the manufacture of shipping containers. 
    The petitioner or the claimant sustained an injury at that time at some time subsequent thereto and the employer sought to deny liability of its responsibility for payment of workmen's compensation benefits under the Act on the ground that it was engaged in the business of manufacturing shipping containers principally and therefore, under the provisions of the Act, it was exempt. 
    And the Court very empathically held in that case that the only question presented therefore is whether or not, and I quote, “At the time of the injury and death of John Gordon, the appellant, was subject to and bound by the provisions of the South Carolina Workmen's Compensation Act.” 
    And the Court held that since it had no facilities to engage in the manufacturing of shipping containers, which it previously had and had given up those facilities, the Court held that the employer was bound by the provisions of the South Carolina Workmen's Compensations Act. 
    Of course, the situation in that case is converse from the situation in this case because in this case, we submit, that if the respondent, Blue Ridge, had any time been engaged in such business of manufacturing substations, the evidence is totally clear in this case that it had not performed such activity for a long time prior to petitioner's interest.

    Mr. Henry Hammer 
    Well, under those circumstances I stated, in response to Your Honor's question yesterday, it must appear that the whole of the work of the independent contractor being performed for the respondent here was part or the whole of the respondent's business. 
    The mere fact is that a small activity performed by the independent contractor would be the same type of activity performed by the respondent, Blue Ridge, would not make the work of the independent contractor the trade, business, or occupation of the owner because we many times have those situations where a classic example is where, as I stated yesterday, the driving of a nail into the wall may be performed by a large building contractor and that same work might be performed by a -- outfit like Sears Roebuck and Company where they have maintenance men who drive a nail in the wall to keep the wall in repair. 
    But that would not mean that the work of the independent contractor, the trade, business or occupation of the owner. 
    I submit that the Fourth Circuit in the previous case of Sears Roebuck versus Wallace cited in the brief clearly enunciated the controlling principles but did not apply them in this particular case.

    Well, I perhaps used an incorrect word but nevertheless, our position was the same as the position of any defendant who moves for an involuntary dismissal as against a person having the burden of proof.

    You said not at this stage of the game. 
    You were -- and I do not regard it as proper administration of justice for lawyers to sit back and wait to see which way to pass (Inaudible) and then decide what position they'll take.

speaker="henry_hammer" startTime="1910.597" stopTime="1990.867">
    Mr. Henry Hammer 
    Mr. Justice Frankfurter, if I may call your attention to the transcript at page 48, he asked me, "In the event of," -- and I read from the transcript of the Court, “In the event I overruled your motion, do you contemplate putting up any testimony in reply? 
    You have that right of course on this point, I mean.” 
    My answer was this, “We haven't discussed it that we are making that motion. 
    I frankly don't know at this point of any reply that is necessary. 
    I don't know of any evidence in this case.” 
    Now, as -- I was about to say that would be necessary and, of course, I was interrupted and then there was a colloquy between the Court and Mr. Walker. 
    And then, I stated to the Court, "We are moving at this time in the nature of an," -- it says voluntary dismissal, I believe that's now in printing, involuntary dismissal. 
    And the Court says, “You move to dismiss the defense?" 
    "Yes, sir, at this stage of this game.” 
    Then he asked, "Mr. Walker, what do you say?” 
    And there was a colloquy between the Court. 
    And after that, the Court very properly so overruled rather dismissed the affirmative defense.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="1990.867" stopTime="2034.687">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    But all of that -- all of that was in the context of an issue of a theory in the South Carolina statute which the Court of Appeals since held to be wrong because as I understand the Court of Appeals' opinion from the fact that this organization, Blue Ridge, was engaged in distributing power, as a matter of law, the Court of Appeals said power stations, lines were part of the business. 
    And it was wholly immaterial whether the company itself had ever engaged in the physical construction work itself. 
    Now, you say that's wrong --
speaker="henry_hammer" startTime="2034.687" stopTime="2034.797">
    Mr. Henry Hammer 
    The Court went that far.

speaker="henry_hammer" startTime="2040.906" stopTime="2047.301">
    Mr. Henry Hammer 
    Well, I interpreted the decision of the Court of Appeals that's holding it on several grounds and this --

    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Well --
speaker="henry_hammer" startTime="2047.840" stopTime="2057.914">
    Mr. Henry Hammer 
    And I -- I am taking up each of the ground, but I -- I didn't want to be precluded as to any particular ground. 
    You -- Your Honor stated it correctly. 
    That was an additional --
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="2057.914" stopTime="2073.429">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    If my ground -- if my reading of the Court of Appeals' decision is correct, and that it's manifest, that the Court of Appeals went haywire on South Carolina law, all of this discussion is to whether you were thrown, shutoff or not is immaterial, you agree with it --
speaker="henry_hammer" startTime="2073.429" stopTime="2074.333">
    Mr. Henry Hammer 
    That's correct. 
    I agree --
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="2074.333" stopTime="2075.132">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    -- that you'd agree with it.
speaker="henry_hammer" startTime="2075.132" stopTime="2219.362">
    Mr. Henry Hammer 
    Yes, sir. 
    Now, if Your Honors please, in our argument, the respondent contended that since the statute under which it was organized empowered it to perform the work that the independent contractor, Bouligny, was performing, this was proof in itself that the respondent was engaged in the construction of substations. 
    And at page 60 of the transcript, the Court in reversing apparently placed some reliance upon this contention by stating, and I quote, “There can be no doubt that all of the work is covered by the Bouligny contractor.” 
    It was of a class which Blue Ridge was empowered by its charter to perform. 
    We submit, if the Court please, that this contention is in direct conflict with the South Carolina law. 
    And we call the Court's attention to the case of Vermillion versus Woman's College of Due West reported in 104 South Carolina, in which the South Carolina Supreme Court held that the mere fact that a corporation organizes or obtains a charter under a statute providing for the incorporation of eleemosynary corporation is not, of itself, sufficient proof that such corporation is, and now, eleemosynary corporation in the absence of evidence as to its actual operations. 
    That's the holding of the South Carolina Supreme Court as to whether proof that one -- that one has the power as distinguished from the exercise of that power, sir, is engaged in a particular business. 
    And we submit that if respondent's reasoning and the Court's reasoning below has followed Section 72-111 of the Act would take on a meaning far different than the plain wording of the statutes. 
    It would extend the liability of owners to work which corporate owners have the power to perform and individual owners have the right to perform.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2219.362" stopTime="2249.125">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    That's all -- all your cases, so far as I reckon, indicate that the so-called little construction must be given to the statutes for the sake of benefitting (Inaudible) and not making growth construction like your container case. 
    There's nothing to do with this case. 
    That was a question of whether you look through the corporate, failed to see that the holding company was the real thing.
speaker="henry_hammer" startTime="2249.125" stopTime="2250.780">
    Mr. Henry Hammer 
    That was -- that was one of the questions involved.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2250.780" stopTime="2258.361">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    I know that that was proved because of that question because there's no doubt about it. 
    Subsidiary company was engaged in that business.
speaker="henry_hammer" startTime="2258.361" stopTime="2262.002">
    Mr. Henry Hammer 
    It was a -- an operation between apparent and subsidiary --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2262.002" stopTime="2275.266">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    (Voice Overlap) 
    but the Court says you -- it's sufficient that the immediate employer was a subsidiary and a legal entity and you do not look through that, and disregard that as ultimate holding company. 
    That's a different question.
speaker="henry_hammer" startTime="2275.266" stopTime="2275.484">
    Mr. Henry Hammer 
    And this --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2275.484" stopTime="2299.183">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    And even in that case, they said what they've said again and again in South Carolina that you construe the statutory, sweep in statutory employer rather than to keep them out. 
    Now, you're arguing in the interest of a workman to conspire the Workmen's Compensation Act of South Carolina because in this particular case, the interest is in direct to the confinement.
speaker="henry_hammer" startTime="2299.183" stopTime="2322.778">
    Mr. Henry Hammer 
    But, Mr. Justice Frankfurter, the South Carolina Supreme Court said also that even though you were supposed to liberally construe the statute, the Court, and I refer to the case of McDowell versus Stilley Plywood Company, said the courts are -- and I quote, “are without authority to enlarge the meaning of the terms used by the legislature.”

    Mr. Henry Hammer 
    If we follow that construction, Mr. Justice Frankfurter, then the phrase “trade, business or occupation” will have no meaning. 
    Owners would be liable for the injury sustained by employees of independent contractors under all circumstances save the exceptional one where the contract with the independent contract by a corporate owner is ultra vires or the contract by an individual with the independent contract is prohibited by law.

    Mr. Henry Hammer 
    But we must look at this thing in context, not out of context. 
    We must look at the interpretation to be given to a statute in the light of the purpose for which it was enacted and what was the purpose for the enactment of the statute. 
    It was for the purpose of protecting employees of independent contractors who are not otherwise protected by law and to prevent employers from debating responsibility under the Act by doing to -- through independent contractors work which is not performed, which work rather which is ordinarily performed by direct employees. 
    None of --
