    Mr. Atkins, before you get to your argument, I would like to ask you this question, whether your question that we took on certiorari was ever raised in the court below in any of the courts below?

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    In your petition for certiorari, there was no mentioned, of course, about it not being raised. 
    There was nothing said in the response but in petition or in the respondent's brief, the very first item in its argument is to the effect that this Court is without jurisdiction because the petitioners did not raise a substantial federal question on the jury issue in the state courts nor have they allege a substantial federal question in this Court. 
    Now, did you raise that question in the courts below?

    Mr. Hobart F. Atkins 
    That's true -- that's true, Your Honor. 
    But, there comes the appellants and each of them and show and represent to this Court that they were petitioned to the Supreme Court of the United States with a writ of certiorari to this Court to review the judgment of this Court and that on July the 20th, 1956 wherein the verdict of the jury and sentences are from one to three years and two cases to run consecutively against that. 
    The said review being based upon the federal question that they are denied due process of law and that their rights does violated on the Constitution and particularly the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution and that they were denied an opportunity to consult counsel, required unwillingly to be witnesses against themselves in violation of the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. 
    And because they were members of labor unions, organizations, they were denied the right and privilege of having other citizens who were qualified as jurors but who belonged to labor organizations from participating as jurors in the administration of justice. 
    A discrimination against all union members, inconsistent with and in violation of Amendment Fourteenth of the Constitution, they being denied the equal protection of the laws by reason of the exclusion of our members of labor union. 
    The said petition for writ of certiorari will be immediately filed but due to the fact the Supreme Court of the United State is now or soon will be in vacation said petition were probably not be considered until the Court convince at the October term 1956. 
    That probable conviction in the trial court and while the cost is spending in the trial court the appellants were allowed to pay bail in the sum of $1000. 
    And that they and each of them, at all times, had perform the condition of bail and that they and each of them are citizens and resident of Knox County, Tennessee and have families that they are each employed outside of the state but with at all times be available for the performance of the condition of the bail and will immediately upon notification return to the state or permitted to go back to the State of Ohio where they are in fraud.

    Mr. James M. Glasgow 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    I think that I can clarify this rather briefly as to what situation here is in regard to the record. 
    On page -- under the Tennessee procedure, it was necessary at the conclusion of the trial for the petitioners to file a motion for a new trial, setting forward the various grounds of error in the trial court. 
    After that, it was necessary for them to perfect their appeal by filing assignments of error and a brief in the Supreme Court of Tennessee. 
    Now, both of those instruments or documents are in this record. 
    On page 13 is the motion for a new trial --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1026.208" stopTime="1026.798">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    13 of what?
speaker="james_m_glasgow" startTime="1026.798" stopTime="1030.388">

   Rebuttal of James M. Glasgow
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1030.388" stopTime="1031.733">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Yes.
speaker="james_m_glasgow" startTime="1031.733" stopTime="1244.228">
    Mr. James M. Glasgow 
    Now, in the motion for a new trial, the only thing that I can find under Roman numeral one, subsections (a), (b), and (c) with reference to the jury question is in reference to the state constitution, Article 1, Section 6 of the Constitution. 
    Now, otherwise, this motion for a new trial is completely devoid of any substantial federal question except in regard to the confessions which are not before this Court, because on the writ for certiorari, we were limited to the jury question. 
    Now, on page 30 of the printed record, in the assignments of error, brief and argued. 
    I beg your pardon, page 29 and then continuing over on page 30, 31, 32, and 33. 
    There is nothing in regard to a substantial federal question. 
    No reference is made to the Constitution of the United States and the whole argument is pitched upon the constitution of Tennessee. 
    Now further in the same record on page 55, in the opinion of the Supreme Court of Tennessee, it is said in the fourth paragraph, the defendant have -- defendants have filed several assignments of error but they have argued only two propositions as a ground for reversal. 
    The one was the confession. 
    The other was the jury of proposition. 
    The jury proposition is resolved in the later part of the opinion by reference to four Tennessee cases. 
    Each of those Tennessee cases you will find, deal only with a construction of the constitution of Tennessee, and therefore, it is necessary to look behind the opinion to see actually what the grounds were upon which the state court reached its decision. 
    And we submit, may it please the Court, that it's improper not only under the decisions of this Court for them to raise this question here for the first time but also that it's unfair to the state courts that it'd be treated in that way. 
    Now, I would like to say this in regard to my position in the case. 
    I did not argue this case before the Supreme Court of Tennessee that was done by the then acting advocate general of the state whose name appears upon brief in reply to the petition for certiorari. 
    I took this record just as you have it and worked on this case from that point. 
    And from what I have found, I cannot find anything which partakes or even smacks of the federal question.

    Mr. Hobart F. Atkins 
    If Your Honors please, the assignments of error in our appellate court are the same as the motion for a new trial. 
    Now, under C on the first assignment of error of our jury or about the jurors, I said this -- now this is prior to the statement in the third article where I spelled out the Fourth and Fifth Amendment. 
    Because the only means on speaking at the under C provided and limited to each side, is that a preempt charge which is intended and does permit the exclusion of those suspected advice or prejudice. 
    These rights of challenge were assured at common law as procedural instruments for the purpose of maintaining the traditional rights of the fair and impartial jury. 
    There is no doctrine of exclusion other than that setout in the Constitution and statute. 
    Now, the Constitution -- there is, as I say, our constitution of 1890 and the constitution, the national constitution are comparable. 
    But the constitution doesn't say the constitution of the State of Tennessee.

    Mr. Hobart F. Atkins 
    You Honor that would be a useless statement to -- to go ahead say the constitution and then say of the Federal Constitution and the State Constitution. 
    We considered these two questions in the light of the Constitution of the United States and of the State. 
    And frankly, I think our appellate court agree that it was true that this action did violate the constitutional rights and for the first time, the Court applied to these constitutional rights the harmless error of statute. 
    And of course the first time we had in the -- that we could object to it was when I filed this petition that I was intending to appeal to this Court to review the action of our state appellate court. 
    That is the first emanation that we have, that it would be considered a harmless error to violate the constitutional rights of these defendants and that is the substance of what occurred. 
    We thought that we had reserved every right in the in paneling of the jury that we exhausted the rights of these defendants to preempt toward a challenge. 
    We objected to each juror being excluded and there were 27 excluded. 
    And we presented the matter to the trial judge after our objections were overruled in the trial. 
    And in the -- in the brief that we filed, we ask that these constitutional rights be enforced. 
    We presented it as forcefully as we could. 
    There has not been a holding by this Honorable Court that we could find on this identical proposition. 
    But we did find cases where this Court had said that those states have rights and they have responsibilities and that this Fourteenth Amendment and be invoked to require a State to treat all citizens equally. 
    And we have, we think in our brief, establish that this is the only case that our Supreme Court has ever applied to a constitutional right, this harmless error statute.

    Mr. Hobart F. Atkins 
    Now then our appellate court or the argument in our appellate court was, that while this is wrong, it's an error and we won't do it anymore. 
    Now then you -- you've come to this proposition, do we administer law to those two defendants, those two individuals as a personal proposition or are they here equal with all others at the bar of justice. 
    If they are equal, they should have an equal opportunity in the selection of a jury, if they are not, then they're not entitled to it. 
    Now basically that is the situation with reference to this application of this harmless error statute. 
    There are three cases that our Supreme Court has decided where the matter of print challenges or allowing too many challenges to the state or in law, the one Levine's case that is cited that was argued to the Supreme Court. 
    And in this opinion you notice that they undertook to differentiate and say that that was a colored man. 
    There -- there were two other cases that we have cited and in both of those cases, one juror, one challenge by the state, worthy of a qualified juror more than what's allowed was held to be irreversible error.So this is the only case which the -- on this error, a statute has been applied.

    Mr. James M. Glasgow 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    Going back to the jurisdictional question for one observation only, I should like to say that it seems to me that if these petitioners wanted to protect their rights by raising federal questions in the state courts they might well have done so by filing a petition to rehear which under the rules of the Court maybe filed within 15 days after the opinion is announced in any decision. 
    And it seems to me that otherwise we're on the same grounds when we say that a substantial federal question has not been raised that certainly we don't want to weigh that by going forward with these other questions. 
    But I do want to address the Court very briefly if I may on those subjects. 
    Senator Atkins is always very persuasive and he raises the very interesting proposition of discrimination as between the various cases that have been decided by the Supreme Court of Tennessee. 
    He says that -- first of all in the (Inaudible) case, our Court held that it was reversible error for a trial court to do what was done in this case. 
    Now, our Court distinguished that proposition by saying that that error was coupled with other errors which required a reversal in the case and although they said it was error to do what was done in this instance that it would not be sufficient when standing alone to require a reversal. 
    Now, I submit that that's purely a question of the state law that has been resolved by the state courts and certainly it's not a thing that this Court would look into. 
    Now, there are two propositions on which we say that this Court should dismiss the writ in this case. 
    The first is that the state court opinion rest upon an adequate and independent non-federal ground, and that is that these petitioners, under the Tennessee constitution received a fair and impartial trial by a fair and impartial jury. 
    And our court has said over and over again that that satisfies the constitutional requirement in our State. 
    Now, I take it that under the adjudicated cases, come into this Court or coming from this Court, that there could be no question whatever about the construction which the Supreme Court of Tennessee places upon its own constitution.

    Mr. James M. Glasgow 
    I -- It will review all the facts.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    In a case like this?
speaker="james_m_glasgow" startTime="2177.657" stopTime="2381.504">
    Mr. James M. Glasgow 
    Yes, sir, and the rule is or the rule of evidence is this or in regard to the weight of the evidence that the weight of the evidence must preponderate against the verdict and in favor of the innocence of the accused before the court will reverse upon the facts. 
    But now the factual situation was resolved aside and apart from these legal questions which were raised which were in regard to the confession and in regard to the jury question. 
    And we take it that from the standpoint of the factual situation that there is no serious dispute as to the facts because counsel, as I understand it, representing the petitioners, conceives that the facts were cited by the Supreme Court of Tennessee are accurate in its opinion. 
    Now, the other proposition, it seems to me, that might be raised in the case is whether or not the action of the Supreme Court of Tennessee by saying that the error that occurred in the trial court was cured by its harmless error of the statute, violates the Fourteenth Amendment. 
    Now, it has been argued that it violates the Fifth Amendment, the Sixth Amendment and others. 
    And certainly this Court has held repeatedly that under that Sixth Amendment, all that is raised there or protected there are federal rights and not state rights. 
    And it is also saying that in regard to the Fifth Amendment that the Fourteenth used the same protection that is supported under the Fifth. 
    Therefore, I take it that the only possible question which could be raised would be in regard to the Fourteenth Amendment. 
    Now, this Court has had before it the problem of construing statutes in regard to various classes of people from jury service in the states. 
    It's had before it the question of whether or not there can be a structure and a regular jury system coexisting in the same state where an unequal number of challenges are involved. 
    It is has had the Blue Ribbon jury case before it from the State of New York, and then all of those cases this Court has concluded that so long that as a fair and impartial trial is afforded and accused by a fair and impartial jury that that is all that is necessary. 
    That substantially is what the Supreme Court of Tennessee held was required under the Constitution of Tennessee. 
    Therefore, we submit that under those cases that which are mostly akin and by analogy are very similar to the proposition which we have here that they -- that control the question at bar. 
    We respectfully submit, may it please the Court, that the case -- that writ should be dismissed and thank you very much.

    May it please your -- gentlemen, the matter of rights was fully discoursed in the trial before the Supreme Court of our State.

    That is the basis, I think, without fear of contradiction, the basis on which they say in the opinion reported as I have previously indicated that it was an error that the court erred in this matter of excluding these 27 jurors because they were members of labor union, but that -- the harmless error statute would prevent a reversal. 
    I think that is the factual picture. 
    There was no question in the Supreme Court opinion as I understood it but what it was an erroneous rule and it was error to have excluded these men for no other reason. 
    They were competent jurors before they are tendered, their bias, prejudice kinship, or ten or twelve reasons. 
    Those were disposed of before the jury -- juror is tendered for jury service.
