Ciucci v. Illinois
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="0.000" stopTime="33.846">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Number 157, Vincent Ciucci, Petitioner, versus People of the State of Illinois. 
    We'll wait just a moment until the counsel gets in. 
    Mr. Leighton, you may proceed now.
speaker="george_n_leighton" startTime="33.846" stopTime="185.031">
    Mr. George N. Leighton 
    May it please the Court. 
    This case is before this Court on grant of certiorari to review judgment of the Supreme Court of Illinois in which the conviction of the defendant in the Criminal Court of Cook County was affirmed and a death sentence imposed. 
    The federal question which is presented here is whether under the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States, a state can construe the alleged criminal acts of a defendant so as to indict him under four separate indictments, try him four times introducing in evidence against him the same proof showing that he committed four offenses which the state contends are distinct crimes. 
    Now, if I may be allowed a moment to state the facts of which this question arises, if Your Honors please. 
    Vincent Ciucci was indicted in the Criminal Court of Cook County charged with the murder of his wife and three children and the incident giving rise to the indictments occurred in the early morning hours of December 5, 1953 when his home was discovered on fire. 
    The firemen found his wife and his three children dead in the little home they occupied as part of a store that was owned and operated by the Ciucci family. 
    Ciucci first was indicted separately for the murder of his wife and he was tried in a separate trial and he was found guilty and sentenced to a term of 20 years in the Illinois State Penitentiary. 
    The State of Illinois does not contradict the facts that at that first trial there was introduced in evidence all of the facts showing the killing of four persons. 
    The jury considered all these evidence and returned a verdict of guilty and sentenced Ciucci to 20 years imprisonment in the Illinois State Penitentiary. 
    As soon as that happened the prosecutor for Cook County announced in the newspapers that this was a miscarriage of justice and that he, the prosecutor, was going to see to it that some jury was found that would impose what he thought was an adequate penalty for this crime which he thought enormous.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="185.031" stopTime="189.203">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Are those statements in the newspapers controverted by the State anyway?
speaker="george_n_leighton" startTime="189.203" stopTime="351.103">
    Mr. George N. Leighton 
    They are not, Your Honor. 
    Now, they proceeded to try him the second time and it is not contradicted that at the second trial, they introduced the same proof that they had submitted to the jury in the first case. 
    And the jury again, considered the evidence from all that appears adequately and properly and returned a verdict of guilty and sentenced him this time for the murder of his oldest daughter Angeline to a term of 45 years in the Illinois State Penitentiary. 
    Contemporaneous with that, the prosecutor announced in the newspapers that this also was a miscarriage of justice and that he said, he thought that some jury ought to see what he thought in the matter that only death was a proper penalty for Ciucci. 
    Now, it happens that in the first trial, they discovered there was some inconsistency in the proof. 
    There was some question where these three persons had met their deaths by inhalation of carbon monoxide or whether they had come to their deaths by shooting. 
    So that, the State's attorney while the three remaining of the four indictments obtained in 1953 remained pending, went before the grand jury and obtained three others. 
    So, as we point out in this brief at one time, Ciucci had been under six separate indictments charging him with three separate crimes. 
    In April of 1954 on motion of the prosecution, three of the remaining indictments obtained in 1953 with nolle prosequi on motion of the State and there remained the three indictments obtained in 1954. 
    After the second trial in which Ciucci was found guilty and sentenced to 45 years in the Illinois State Penitentiary, again, the prosecutor announced this was not satisfactory. 
    And he proceeded then to try him a third time under the indictment charging him with the murder of his son, Vincent, Jr. 
    This time when the trial had gone on in a few days a mishap occurred and a mistrial was declared on motion of the defendant. 
    And then the fourth trial was begun. 
    And I think that it is clear from this record, and certainly all of us who have had experience in the trial of criminal cases known, that by the simple process of rearranging the evidence they finally -- as we argue here, found an arrangement of the evidence, the same proof, the same evidence, but a rearrangement of it by this experience of three trials. 
    They found an arrangement which convinced the jury that this crime was of the enormity deserving the extreme penalty.

    In Illinois, according to Illinois law, could there have been a trial for the death of all the victims?

    Mr. George N. Leighton 
    There could be, Your Honor.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="358.520" stopTime="363.209">

    Mr. George N. Leighton 
    They could, Your Honor. 
    It is not unusual for an indictment to be returned in which there will be one indictment several counts. 
    It all arose out of the same transaction. 
    They could have been --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="372.643" stopTime="378.969">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Well, that's normally so. 
    I wondered if -- I'm asking whether they saw there's a capital offence.

    Mr. George N. Leighton 
    Speaking from personal experience, I have never seen one, but if Your Honor -- but it could be it'll need a little more practice. 
    In fact that's the point we make this case, that's what should have been done in the case like this.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="392.229" stopTime="406.237">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Well is there -- there must be -- if there's no statutory disposition of the question. 
    There's no statute in Illinois which gives an answer to my question. 
    In case you give an answer to that question.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    If there is no enactment of the state legislature, which gives me an answer to that question, would I find an answer in some of the decisions of the Supreme Court of Illinois?
speaker="george_n_leighton" startTime="418.390" stopTime="422.282">
    Mr. George N. Leighton 
    I don't think Your Honor will find an answer to the decision of the Supreme Court of Illinois.

speaker="george_n_leighton" startTime="425.726" stopTime="444.655">
    Mr. George N. Leighton 
    Well, that might be the most accurate answer possible under circumstances. 
    However, I would say this to Your Honor that in Illinois, under the Illinois criminal law of practice it is common for the prosecutor to charge in one indictment, under separate count, all of the crimes which are related and which make a part of the same criminal transaction.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="444.655" stopTime="450.107">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    I can see a difference in that rule with reference to charges of murder.
speaker="george_n_leighton" startTime="450.107" stopTime="458.121">
    Mr. George N. Leighton 
    Yes, Your Honor, there could be a difference. 
    And Your Honor, there was a difference here and that is -- and that I would like to say, is why this case is before this Court.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="458.121" stopTime="511.047">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Because it -- it -- it may make a difference from the out -- and I don't say it is. 
    I haven't -- there's nothing on that. 
    But I should think we have one question. 
    If a state says "In fairness to the Defendant, we do not allow him to be charged with the murder of more than one human being, and that he can't be put on trial for the murder of two people before that may have," -- I should think it might easily have "a prejudicial influence upon the jury as against the State who does allow such a trial, chooses not to try the defendant that way but chooses to try him in possession if he commits more than one murder." I'd like to submit the Court on that.
speaker="george_n_leighton" startTime="511.047" stopTime="573.154">
    Mr. George N. Leighton 
    I think we'd all agree with that, Your Honor except that it sounds a bit inversed if the State were reasoning in that way, to say that they wouldn't impose upon him a trial in which there is alleged in the indictment, several murders but then at the proof of the case on a construction of a rule of evidence of Illinois as they did in this case relying on People versus Murphy the doctrine of res gestae which is the knob of the contention of the State, that under the doctrine of res gestae, though -- and this is where the State's position in my judgment is a -- inconsistent and indefensible. 
    They say on one hand these are separate and distinct crimes. 
    But then they said, "And the record is clear and the position of the State of Illinois hasn't changed one with from the beginning to the day." 
    Then they say that while it is a distinct crime we have the right to introduce before a jury the evidence that you committed this great enormous crime consisting of four murders.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    You understand -- did I understand on the first trial there was a disagreement of the jury?

    Yes.

    Mr. George N. Leighton 
    There is nothing to prevent that if they have separate indictments on the Illinois criminal law of practice.

speaker="george_n_leighton" startTime="652.334" stopTime="697.704">
    Mr. George N. Leighton 
    That's the point, Your Honor. 
    But if at the trial in which the case resulted either in an acquittal or a conviction in which the same evidence was introduced. 
    You see Your Honor, the -- the constitutional question arises here, in my judgment, it wouldn't be as pointed if the State had taken a consistent position that these were distinct crimes and that he should have been tried separately for these distinct crimes then punish for the distinct crimes. 
    But they didn't do that. 
    They insist that they were distinct crimes, that they were entitled to the right to show in the jury each time that he committed not only the crime of murdering his wife for which he was tried the first time, not for the crime of murdering his daughter for which he was tried the second time, not the crime for murdering his son which he was tried the third time, but that he committed this heinous crime of wiping out his family. 
    In fact --
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="697.704" stopTime="710.965">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Are you saying Mr. Leighton that in each of those several trials, part of the State's proof was that, in fact, there were four killings not just the one where indictment of which he was on trial?
speaker="george_n_leighton" startTime="710.965" stopTime="711.861">
    Mr. George N. Leighton 
    Yes, Mr. Justice Brennan.

    Mr. George N. Leighton 
    Each -- each time. 
    In fact, the way the question which is before this Court was raised was by a motion which a -- one of the trial attorneys filed raising the question, and it was alleged in allegation which is not successful to understanding, and we cited on page 8 to the brief. 
    And he alleged that the facts and the evidence upon which the instant indictment, number 54839 is based are the same, that a trial in this instant case will be a retrial of the above and foregoing two-named indictment namely 841 and 532415 which had been previously called.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="750.697" stopTime="759.145">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Well, let me get this clear. 
    Is that to say then, there was actually no difference except as you suggested earlier, perhaps, in the arrangement of the proofs?
speaker="george_n_leighton" startTime="759.145" stopTime="759.814">
    Mr. George N. Leighton 
    The only difference --
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="759.814" stopTime="765.071">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    In the proofs, except that there was a different name on the particular indictment under trial at that time?
speaker="george_n_leighton" startTime="765.071" stopTime="765.670">
    Mr. George N. Leighton 
    That's right, Your Honor.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="765.670" stopTime="766.636">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    That is a different name received?
speaker="george_n_leighton" startTime="766.636" stopTime="813.762">
    Mr. George N. Leighton 
    The only difference -- the only difference. 
    And you see, if I may press the point further. 
    By the time they got to this case, incidentally, they had gone through the matter so often that they had finally had, at the trial of this case, one of the most experienced prosecutors in Cook County. 
    And the newspaper references showed that Mr. Sam (Inaudible) who had been in the State Attorney's office some -- almost 30 years. 
    If I'm wrong one -- I may stand corrected. 
    But Sam (Inaudible) was known as one of the most experienced prosecutors in Cook County. 
    He'd been through several administrations of the Cook County -- of the State Attorney's office. 
    So that -- it was by the rearrangement of proof and incidentally, if Your Honor please, in the Supreme Court of Illinois we raised that point, that it was this rearrangement of the --
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="813.762" stopTime="817.313">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Before you get to that. 
    Can you say shortly what the rearrangement was?
speaker="george_n_leighton" startTime="817.313" stopTime="883.069">
    Mr. George N. Leighton 
    Well, they started off this time with putting on Carol Amora, the young girl, whom he had seduced and who had a child for him. 
    They had tried in the various cases to put Carol Amora in the middle of the trial or at the end of the trial. 
    And in this trial, they started off with Carol Amora. 
    And in the opinion of the Supreme Court, the opinion which is published in the record of this case, we pointed out that in allowing Carol Amora to testify first about her illicit relationship with this defendant for bearing a child, they even went to the point of bringing out that he had swindled her out of $300 to buy a Cadillac. 
    They started off with that frame of mind on the jury that he was not a murderer but as the state's attorney said before the Supreme Court, a stinger, a rocker, that's how they started the fourth and final trial. 
    In that tone, this was not a man who had the innocence of heart to wipe out his family but a man also, who would seduce a young girl of 18. 
    That's how they started the fourth trial, by this rearrangement of proof.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="883.069" stopTime="897.685">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Let me ask you this question, that's bearing on -- your to enlighten my mind on singular against collective offenses. 
    Suppose he had attempted to murder -- the part that they should meet --
speaker="george_n_leighton" startTime="897.685" stopTime="898.711">
    Mr. George N. Leighton 
    Yes, sir.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="898.711" stopTime="926.251">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Supposed he'd attempted to murder his family, wife and three children, and he had failed in his purpose but they were all injured so that there's manslaughter or some other -- a high degree of that whatever it should be called in Illinois, under the Illinois Penal Code, as I understood you, certainly as to those cases there could be trial of all four before the attack on all four, is that right?
speaker="george_n_leighton" startTime="926.251" stopTime="926.918">
    Mr. George N. Leighton 
    Yes, Your Honor.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="926.918" stopTime="943.898">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Now, would you mind expressing your view whether there could be punishment, accumulated punishment for each of the victims could pose the maximum was 10 years for the particular offense that the Court give a sentence of 40 years?
speaker="george_n_leighton" startTime="943.898" stopTime="957.364">
    Mr. George N. Leighton 
    That's not -- that's not what they do in Illinois. 
    Now, if he were tried in the fashion, Your Honor's suggestion, Your Honor's hypothetical case, he would give -- be given one sentence in a manner informed as charged in the indictment and he would be sentenced for the crime charged in the indictment.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="957.364" stopTime="973.522">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Now, what makes you say that? 
    Is there some decision of Illinois which says, if a person by one comprehensive deed, brings injury, violence, mens rea injury to for four people we cannot be given more than the maximum of one person.
speaker="george_n_leighton" startTime="973.522" stopTime="976.742">
    Mr. George N. Leighton 
    No, Your Honor. 
    There is no statute in Illinois so provided. 
    However --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="976.742" stopTime="980.375">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Do you have any decision that should be right on that problem?
speaker="george_n_leighton" startTime="980.375" stopTime="1013.153">
    Mr. George N. Leighton 
    Yes, there are decisions on that for which I cannot give, Your Honor, one right at this moment. 
    However, I would say this. 
    The custom in practice in -- under Illinois criminal law in such a case as, Your Honor puts, is to impose if there are separate findings of guilty as to each count. 
    If there are, is to impose sentences on those findings to run as a rule concurrent with. 
    Now, that -- that's the usual custom. 
    It is rare indeed --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1013.153" stopTime="1025.693">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    No doubt a court -- no doubt a court, I suppose can do that. 
    What I want to know is what the requirements of Illinois law are, limiting that power or allowing a trial judge to make accumulate -- give accumulated sentence?
speaker="george_n_leighton" startTime="1025.693" stopTime="1026.380">
    Mr. George N. Leighton 
    The requirement --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1026.380" stopTime="1028.263">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    -- even if he puts forth --
speaker="george_n_leighton" startTime="1028.263" stopTime="1029.083">
    Mr. George N. Leighton 
    Yes.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1029.083" stopTime="1036.816">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Put before (Inaudible) et cetera, attempted -- take attempted murder. 
    What is the punishment of Illinois for attempted murder?
speaker="george_n_leighton" startTime="1036.816" stopTime="1043.271">
    Mr. George N. Leighton 
    Well, under the law of attempt, the punishment is the same as the crime for which the -- the attempt was made.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1043.271" stopTime="1044.608">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    So that is death for attempted murder?

    Mr. George N. Leighton 
    Yes. 
    Well --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1046.501" stopTime="1048.178">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    That sounds shocking to me.
speaker="george_n_leighton" startTime="1048.178" stopTime="1051.689">
    Mr. George N. Leighton 
    It will be a felony under Illinois, punishable under the code.

    Without any limit?
speaker="george_n_leighton" startTime="1052.805" stopTime="1071.585">
    Mr. George N. Leighton 
    Without any limit. 
    Now, to answer Your Honor's question, though, so as I may not mislead, Your Honor. 
    In the case you put, now that I have understood Your Honor's point, there is nothing to delimit the Court's power in imposing separate penalties for each count. 
    If there --

    Filing them on.

    Mr. George N. Leighton 
    Yes. 
    If there is a separate finding. 
    But there is this much to be said in Illinois practice. 
    There is a discretion given to the Court to compel an election. 
    You see, Your Honor the question you put brings up the question which is raised here. 
    If this procedure were followed in the Ciucci case, then Ciucci would have had the opportunity to have moved to compel the State to have elected on which count they were proceeding, and then the question could have been raised, he would have had his hearing right there and then as to that. 
    All the procedural safeguards against the multiplicity of prosecutions would have been afforded him if such a -- a proceeding had been instituted by the state --

    But there are lots of -- there are lots of things in the administration of criminal justice that a humane and wise system would enforce by a state law the absolute which doesn't make a violation of the Due Process Clause. 
    All the things you've indicated that are maybe your prosecution-elect or looking in the direction not multiplying. 
    But we're here concerned as well, whatever maybe Illinois law, in her own good or bad wisdom, it -- it transgresses the Fourteenth Amendment. 
    That's the question, isn't it?

    Mr. George N. Leighton 
    Yes. 
    But, Your Honor, in this case we also have the question which we raised here. 
    That this is not the exercise of the sovereign power of Illinois to correct what is considered to be a criminal act. 
    This is an arbitrary use of state power because it would be just as if any state officer should decide to arbitrarily or discriminatorily impose a state act against a citizen of the United States without going through the details, Your Honors have held consistently, that an arbitrary discriminate use of state power against the citizens of the United States so as deprive him of his life liberty is a denial of due process. 
    This case puts out the fact that Ciucci was treated in a manner solely to obtain the extreme penalty and that he was tried several times and because the prosecutor had in his mind that the only way to punish this man is to put him to death.

    Mr. George N. Leighton 
    That's right, Your Honor. 
    They're all tried by jury. 
    Now within the time allotted to me, I would like to go to what strikes me as a persuasive point in these cases. 
    Authorities on the subject, students of this subject have asked the question, "Why is it that in civil proceeding we don't allow a party who has a cause of action against another party arising out of the same transaction to chop up his cause of action and try it at his own whim and go on before one jury and rearranging his proof at his own discretion and his own arraignment?" 
    We don't do that. 
    In fact it is almost consistent throughout the country that in civil cases we require the individual with a -- with a cause of action to bring his case at that time, otherwise, he shall be barred under the doctrine of res judicata. 
    Now, the question I raise in this case, why should the State of Illinois have greater rights than individual members of its sovereign body? 
    What is it about the criminal law administration that will allow a -- a digression from what is uniformly considered? 
    Just a simple fairness, that if you have a case against the man bring it all at one time so you may have his one day in Court and defend himself.

    Mr. William C. Wines 
    Your Honors, despite the great importance of this case, not only to petitioner but in the field of constitutional law and criminal jurisprudence, it can be argued briefly and simply, and I know that I won't be understood as deprecating the importance of the case if I do argue it briefly and simply. 
    The facts that give emergence to the questions presented in this case can be briefly summarized. 
    The Petitioner had been engaged in an illicit love affair with a young woman by the name of Carol Amora. 
    She had conceived a child by him. 
    He had been refused to divorce by his wife who would yield him only separate maintenance. 
    On the night in question, in the building in which he live with his wife and three children, was found in flames. 
    He was found crouched in a doorway.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="1504.595" stopTime="1505.371">
    Unknown Speaker 
    I can't hear you.
speaker="william_c_wines" startTime="1505.371" stopTime="1696.575">
    Mr. William C. Wines 
    I'm sorry. 
    He was found -- the building in which they live was found in flames. 
    He was found crouched in the doorway. 
    The day before the fire, he had borrowed a 22-caliber rifle from a friend saying that he wanted to use it in hunting. 
    His wife and three children were found dead. 
    Apparently, overcome by carbon monoxide asphyxiated, but each of them had a hole shot through his or her head, wife, two daughters and son were killed. 
    The State of Illinois first indicted petitioner for the murder of his wife. 
    The trial on that case ultimate in a verdict, the jury fixes the penalty in Illinois in a murder case. 
    We don't have degrees of murder of 20 years. 
    He was subsequently tried before another jury for the murder of his daughter and was given 20 -- that was given 45 years. 
    A third case resulted in a mistrial, and in the fourth case a prosecution for the murder of his son, the jury fixed the penalty at death. 
    Petitioner contended, and contends here that he was denied due process of law and that he was subjected to three separate prosecutions, there was one mistrial, four trials but three separate prosecutions, and presumably would have faced a possible fourth prosecution for the death of these four people. 
    He also contends that it was error to admit in evidence as to each, the scene for which he was tried, respectively, evidence of the deaths of the other members of his family although, all of them perished on the same occasion. 
    It is the position of the State of Illinois that in accordance with inveterate practice throughout the English-speaking world at least, where a defendant kills or robs or rapes or otherwise injures, or damnifies four a separate persons and is convicted. 
    I want to emphasize "convicted" for one of such damnifications, that conviction does not bar prosecution for other injuries to other people even though the transactions are contemporaneous. 
    I will call the Court's attention to the fact --
speaker="william_o_douglas" startTime="1696.575" stopTime="1700.627">
    Justice William O. Douglas 
    -- your conclusion I gather would be different if he's acquitted.

    Mr. William C. Wines 
    I don't think -- it is a different case, Your Honor. 
    We would be prepared to argue as was argued in the Hoag case --
speaker="william_o_douglas" startTime="1708.140" stopTime="1708.559">

    I was wondering why --
speaker="william_c_wines" startTime="1708.559" stopTime="1722.139">
    Mr. William C. Wines 
    That even -- even an acquittal would not bar the further prosecution. 
    That's an argument I would make but I'm not compelled to make it in this case because it is my position, that even if an acquittal would bar a further prosecution.
speaker="william_o_douglas" startTime="1722.139" stopTime="1724.752">
    Justice William O. Douglas 
    You're not drawing a difference here now?

    What?

    You're not trying to draw a difference?
speaker="william_c_wines" startTime="1727.015" stopTime="1794.306">
    Mr. William C. Wines 
    Yes, I am Your Honor. 
    I am making -- I'm -- I'm saying that at least where there is a conviction for one of the four deaths, robberies, larcenies, assaults, rapes, slanders or the like, at least in that case, the Fourteenth Amendment does not bar a second prosecution even if it would bar it in the event of an acquittal. 
    However, even in the case of an acquittal I would be prepared to argue that there was no denial of due process under the Fourteenth Amendment by successive trials as long as there were separate injuries. 
    I realized that Your Honors have before you the case of Hoag against New Jersey which is not, as far as I'm aware, been yet decided by this Court. 
    But in the Hoag case there was an acquittal of the first robbery and that poses a very different question.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1794.306" stopTime="1865.475">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Mr. Wines, may I put this to you, if you consider it sometime before you sit down that, argumentatively, let me see if I can state on. 
    There it denies, considering the fact the Hoag case is still before us and the case of -- of an acquittal, there is the argument of -- of the hazard to the jury trial etcetera, etcetera. 
    But if there is a conviction and the State tries again, a conviction in which the sentence was short of the ultimate sentence and then is there an escape from the consideration. 
    I'm not saying it's controlling of what he does, but as a matter of fact if there was an escape from the consideration that by retrying, having had guilt established but a lower sentence in the alternate sentence, the State is really complaining or not satisfied that does what it does however, you choose to put it because it isn't satisfied with the heaviness of the sentence. 
    Isn't that what -- is there an inference unentitiled necessarily to draw.

    Mr. William C. Wines 
    I wouldn't say necessarily, but it certainly --

speaker="william_c_wines" startTime="2129.041" stopTime="2188.037">
    Mr. William C. Wines 
    Yes, Your Honor. 
    My position on that is -- is this. 
    We say, I really think, that due process permits successive trials for successive deaths, assaults, slanders, or similar offenses against individuals, even though the transactions are virtually simultaneous and there is an acquittal in the first or the first two or three of them. 
    That's the Hoag case. 
    But if I'm wrong about that, I say that at least where there is a conviction, the State has a right to take into account the fact that more than one person has been damaged and to inflict successive punishments and penalties for that injury.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="2188.037" stopTime="2196.180">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    But that distinction you draw is not based as I understand here on different treatment in connection with those --

    -- in the past.
speaker="william_c_wines" startTime="2197.623" stopTime="2324.237">
    Mr. William C. Wines 
    That's right, Your Honor. 
    There aren't too many decisions of this Court directly on the point but I will call Your Honors attention to the case of Flemister against the United States cited and discussed in our briefs in 207 United States, a unanimous opinion by Mr. Justice Holmes. 
    That case arose in the Philippine Islands. 
    The accused had struck a policeman and simultaneously assaulted another public official. 
    He was tried for the first of these offenses, punished, tried for the second, pleaded in effect double jeopardy and Mr. Justice Holmes is writing for a unanimous Court sustained both convictions and held that there was no infraction of the Due Process Clause. 
    A similar result was reached in the Hotema case, that's a little different. 
    There the defendant was indicted for killing three persons on the same day. 
    In two trials, he was found to have been insane, in the third trial he was found to be sane, and this Court rejected as "wholly without merit" the plea of "once in jeopardy." 
    Your Honors have in mind other cases that have been cited in the recent arguments in this case, Your Honors have in mind the mail bag cases where a man who slits several mail bags even though at the same time has been held punishable for each of those offenses, and Your Honors have mind the cases in which it has been held that both the State and federal government may prosecute for the same -- or virtually the same Act. 
    I --

    What case in connection with the mail bag case is?

    Mr. William C. Wines 
    Yes, that's one.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2351.487" stopTime="2354.735">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    I'm talking about the mail -- the mail and narcotic. 
    You had none of the successive?
speaker="william_c_wines" startTime="2354.735" stopTime="2531.201">
    Mr. William C. Wines 
    Yes. 
    Now, we say this, very earnestly, Your Honors, that while due process is a steadily evolving concept, there are guides of history and it has been as we all know the Welna Universal Consensus throughout the English-speaking world that a man who kills more than one person is subject to several punishments. 
    States don't deny due process of law when even though there may be some tincture or parodistic nature of vengeance in the sentence, they punish several offenses. 
    I have in mind the case that we're all familiar with which did not reach this Court at least certiorari wasn't granted where a man blew up an airplane and killed 40 passengers. 
    Now, we say that there is nothing so shocking to the universal sense of justice about prosecuting that man for a more than one of those deaths as wouldn't deny due process of law. 
    It might be that there's much to be said -- I want to be entirely fair in arguing with the Court – for a system of jurisprudence in which there would be only one investigation of guilt and only one punishment for what is in effect one transaction. 
    But we say, that a State doesn't deny due process of law when it applies to the maximum, if men will multiply crimes, the state will multiply prosecutions and punishments. 
    One other contention need detain us for only a moment. 
    It is contended here that due process was denied because on each of these trials, the state was permitted to show all four of the killings while on the very simplest principles of evidence they were all part of the res gestae, they were all part of a single scheme, they were all part of a single transaction. 
    Now, petitioner says, 'Well, if you're going to treat it that way for the purpose of rules of evidence then it's all part of one transaction for the purpose of punishment," we say that, "It was not in accord with the historic contours of the Due Process Clause." 
    And we think, that whatever Your Honors might wish to make the law, due process is not denied by multiple prosecutions for multiple crimes.

    I'm -- I think Mr. Leighton made a slight mistake as to Illinois law. 
    He said that the punishment for an attempt is the same as a punishment for the commission of a crime. 
    He's mistaken about that if he meant to say it. 
    Have these people not died, to my understanding of the Illinois law, and I'm quite sure I'm correct about it, that the defendant would have been subject to a prosecution for assault with intent to commit murder and the maximum penalty would have been 14 years which is a minimum penalty for murder.

    The record shows that each one of these bodies were taken out of this home by a different fireman, and I argued in the Supreme Court of Illinois, that since that was the case, this was not a case which the death of one had to be shown to prove the death of another because the bodies were taken out of the room separately. 
    They even went to the point of showing how much embalming fluid they put into the seven-year-old child.

    Mr. George N. Leighton 
    No -- no, Your Honor. 
    I think -- I think I should make it very clear, Your Honor, that these statements of the prosecutor were not made during trial.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="3177.664" stopTime="3179.319">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    I understand. 
    They were made outside.
speaker="george_n_leighton" startTime="3179.319" stopTime="3184.227">
    Mr. George N. Leighton 
    They were made outside. 
    They were made soon after the defendant was tried and convicted the first time.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="3184.227" stopTime="3184.776">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Yes.
speaker="george_n_leighton" startTime="3184.776" stopTime="3200.482">
    Mr. George N. Leighton 
    Then there -- then there was a big lapse of time, then he was tried the second time, then after he was convicted the second time and sentenced to 45 years.Then the state was again -- then there was a big lapse of time. 
    You see this is not the case of a statement that the prosecutor made during trial or just --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="3200.482" stopTime="3217.576">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    I understand that. 
    But you're complaining of those you hear, urged those statements, if I understand it, as an evidence of the state of mind as a conduct of the prosecutor in securing the conviction that he did secure which is the only thing before us.
speaker="george_n_leighton" startTime="3217.576" stopTime="3218.075">
    Mr. George N. Leighton 
    That's right, Your Honor.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="3218.075" stopTime="3219.133">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    This death sentence.
speaker="george_n_leighton" startTime="3219.133" stopTime="3219.951">
    Mr. George N. Leighton 
    That's right.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="3219.951" stopTime="3239.123">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    And what I'm asking is, how can I take if you give me the basis for allowable consideration of those successive statements by the prosecutor that he's going to persist in this until an understanding from his point of view, until an effective jury brings in the death sentence?
speaker="george_n_leighton" startTime="3239.123" stopTime="3246.137">
    Mr. George N. Leighton 
    I think, Your Honor, it's just a matter of taking into account the entire total aura of this case. 
    Now --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="3246.137" stopTime="3263.506">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Well, well -- but aura implies something. 
    Now, where -- where can I - -and what can I -- on what basis can I find this aura which gives me any kind of indication that those were the considerations that underlay the fourth conviction?
speaker="george_n_leighton" startTime="3263.506" stopTime="3265.592">
    Mr. George N. Leighton 
    From the facts of the prosecution, Your Honor.

    All the (Voice Overlap) --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="3291.273" stopTime="3315.307">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    You are asking me to take into account as an element in the -- what does or doesn't amount to due process, that the prosecutor was bent on getting a death sentence. 
    And I'm asking you, on what take can I take notice of those statements, handle statements?
speaker="george_n_leighton" startTime="3315.307" stopTime="3320.095">
    Mr. George N. Leighton 
    There's -- there's no rule of Court to which I can point to, as you all know, nor is there --

    Mr. George N. Leighton 
    No, Your Honor we did not. 
    We did not. 
    That precise question, don't put that way before the Supreme Court of Illinois. 
    We had raised the federal question before the Supreme Court of Illinois, and I might add to inform the Court that I did not represent this man at the trial. 
    I undertook to represent him after his conviction.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="3339.922" stopTime="3345.100">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    And at the -- was your position -- what was your position before the Supreme Court of Illinois?
speaker="george_n_leighton" startTime="3345.100" stopTime="3347.563">
    Mr. George N. Leighton 
    That the multiplicity of the -- of the --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="3347.563" stopTime="3348.441">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    As such --
speaker="george_n_leighton" startTime="3348.441" stopTime="3348.561">
    Mr. George N. Leighton 
    As such.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="3348.561" stopTime="3358.606">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    The fact that he was finally, he was sentenced to death in a trial when there had been three preceding trials of convictions for other victims, is that right?
speaker="george_n_leighton" startTime="3358.606" stopTime="3374.462">
    Mr. George N. Leighton 
    That's right, Your Honor. 
    Now, if Your Honor observed in -- on page 9 of the brief, on petition for rehearing before the Supreme Court of Illinois. 
    Again, we made a claim, what was the federal constitution question being urged. 
    Now, I will --

    Page 9?
speaker="george_n_leighton" startTime="3375.508" stopTime="3395.950">
    Mr. George N. Leighton 
    On page 9 of petitioner's brief. 
    See, the Supreme Court of Illinois cited People versus Allen as the sole authority for denying the constitutional question. 
    And I have not had the time, but I think it's quite plain to Your Honor, that People versus Allen is not authority for the proposition which the Supreme Court of Illinois cited it.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="3395.950" stopTime="3418.673">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Rather end up with the wrong concerning which the Defendant complained and before that, you do not consider determinative, the constitutional question that defendant's case does not fall into the established rules of double jeopardy. 
    The gravamen of the wrong concerning which the defendant complained was the multiple forms of prosecution against it, elected by the state.
speaker="george_n_leighton" startTime="3418.673" stopTime="3419.340">
    Mr. George N. Leighton 
    That's right, Your Honor.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    And -- and so far as you candidly stated, there's nothing in the record that enables me to go outside, that statement of the issue?

    Yes, sir.

    This is not the full typewritten record of the trial I suppose.

    Mr. George N. Leighton 
    Not the earlier trial.

    No, Your Honor.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="3443.819" stopTime="3452.181">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    That shows either that the Court who presided it made any comment as to what he thought about the jury's verdict or did the prosecutor made any comment about it?
speaker="george_n_leighton" startTime="3452.181" stopTime="3462.057">
    Mr. George N. Leighton 
    No. 
    Your Honor, it is very clear that at this present trial, the prosecutor made no comment about the prior conviction. 
    There's nothing to indicate --
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="3462.057" stopTime="3466.626">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    I'm talking about the earlier convictions, the records of the earlier convictions.
speaker="george_n_leighton" startTime="3466.626" stopTime="3468.091">
    Mr. George N. Leighton 
    No, there was nothing said about those.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="3468.091" stopTime="3468.720">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Nothing?
speaker="george_n_leighton" startTime="3468.720" stopTime="3472.289">
    Mr. George N. Leighton 
    No. 
    Under Illinois practice, that would have been a reversible error. 
    The Supreme of Illinois would have reversed.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="3472.289" stopTime="3478.286">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    No, I -- you don't understand me. 
    If you went to the records of the two earlier trials now --

    Mr. George N. Leighton 
    Yes.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="3478.985" stopTime="3486.366">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Would you find in those typewritten records any -- anything that bore upon the questions that Mr. Justice Frankfurter has been asking you?
speaker="george_n_leighton" startTime="3486.366" stopTime="3546.136">
    Mr. George N. Leighton 
    No, Your Honor. 
    I'm sure there isn't anything like that. 
    I'm sure there isn't. 
    I might say in frankness to the Court, that this appendage to this petition was my idea in -- in bringing before this Court the detail as to the -- the forces behind this prosecution. 
    I think Mr. Justice Harlan asked Mr. Wines and Mr. Wines said he doesn't remember any such case in which any man had been treated in this fashion. 
    Now, Mr. Wines could remember there was a case in Illinois which a man set a fire to several buildings and killed eleven people. 
    He was indicted eleven times, he went into trial once, on the second trial when he came up, he pled double jeopardy and the plea was sustained. 
    The States Attorney of Cook County filed a petition for writ of error and the Supreme Court of Illinois dismissed the writ of error saying that while the plea may not have been signed, there was no writ of error to review, sustaining of a plea of double jeopardy under Illinois practice by the prosecution.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Can I trouble you to state, how soon after the crime, the prosecution got under -- how soon was the first trial after this affair?
speaker="george_n_leighton" startTime="3558.309" stopTime="3567.317">
    Mr. George N. Leighton 
    Your Honor, he was tried in 1953. 
    The fire -- the first trial was in 1953. 
    He was -- the fire --

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    When was the -- when was the occurrence?
speaker="george_n_leighton" startTime="3570.072" stopTime="3573.144">
    Mr. George N. Leighton 
    The occurrence December 5, 1953.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="3573.144" stopTime="3574.200">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    And he was tried the first time?
speaker="george_n_leighton" startTime="3574.200" stopTime="3579.028">
    Mr. George N. Leighton 
    He was -- he was tried during the latter part of December 1953.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="3579.028" stopTime="3580.755">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    That is within a few weeks and this --
speaker="george_n_leighton" startTime="3580.755" stopTime="3581.929">
    Mr. George N. Leighton 
    Well, a short time. 
    It was short then --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="3581.929" stopTime="3585.866">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Did that -- did that bring normal speed of prosecutions in Cook County?
speaker="george_n_leighton" startTime="3585.866" stopTime="3589.436">
    Mr. George N. Leighton 
    No, Your Honor. 
    No -- no, it's not. 
    Not for murder cases.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="3589.436" stopTime="3593.795">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    And there was, as Mr. Wines indicated a great deal of publicity about this at that time.
speaker="george_n_leighton" startTime="3593.795" stopTime="3594.514">
    Mr. George N. Leighton 
    Oh, yes. 
    There was --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="3594.514" stopTime="3597.087">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    And none of this was brought to the attention of the Court?
speaker="george_n_leighton" startTime="3597.087" stopTime="3611.812">
    Mr. George N. Leighton 
    No, it was not. 
    It was not brought to the attention of the Court. 
    Now, if Your Honor will allow me just to say this final word. 
    You see these statements that we make point of here were not made in connection with the intended first prosecution.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="3611.812" stopTime="3612.521">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    I understand that.
speaker="george_n_leighton" startTime="3612.521" stopTime="3614.026">
    Mr. George N. Leighton 
    Yes. 
    Thank you very much.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="3614.026" stopTime="3622.322">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    But two different things. 
    There was -- there was -- if I -- suppose I'm accurate, there were sensational accounts of the affair naturally enough.
speaker="george_n_leighton" startTime="3622.322" stopTime="3623.729">
    Mr. George N. Leighton 
    Oh, yes -- yes.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="3623.729" stopTime="3625.895">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    There was a quick trial after the event.
speaker="george_n_leighton" startTime="3625.895" stopTime="3626.582">
    Mr. George N. Leighton 
    Yes.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="3626.582" stopTime="3638.945">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    There were successive trials in what you're raising or what you put in the appendix is a totally different thing. 
    It evolves by the prosecutor that he's going to keep at it until the jury has a good chance to bring him a death sentence.
speaker="george_n_leighton" startTime="3638.945" stopTime="3661.539">
    Mr. George N. Leighton 
    That's right. 
    Now, in the final word, in Mr. Wines' comment about the English-speaking world, I don't think Mr. Wines' research would reveal one single case in which a defendant had been tried in a series of prosecutions and in which the same evidence was introduced against him in this manner, and that is why we raised the federal question. 
    Thank you, Your Honor.
