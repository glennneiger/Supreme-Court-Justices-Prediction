Northern Pacific Railway Company v. United States
speaker="ml_countryman_jr" startTime="0.000" stopTime="109.621">
    Mr. M.L. Countryman Jr. 
    -- what I was saying at adjournment yesterday afternoon, Northern Pacific land grant amounted to approximately 39 and a half million acres. 
    All of this acreage has at all times been for sale and as fast as the sentence could be induced to the company and as purchasers could be found, the land had been sold. 
    So that at the time the complaint was filed in May, 1949, the company had sold all but approximately 2,700,000 acres. 
    In the sales of these lands, the traffic clauses were ever used where the lands were agriculture in character or were grazing lands. 
    But in the case of lands which were valuable solely for their natural resources such as timber, minerals, coal and iron and the like. 
    Traffic clauses were used from the beginning of the character that I have explained. 
    Because those natural resources had a special value to the Northern Pacific and not to obtainable market price and that Northern Pacific have a transportation agency. 
    It had railroad to transport these commodities to market to resume the transportation business.

    May I ask you Mr. Countryman? 
    What is the relationship between the Northern Pacific Railway Company and the Northwestern Improvement Company?
speaker="ml_countryman_jr" startTime="118.919" stopTime="146.207">
    Mr. M.L. Countryman Jr. 
    The Northwestern Improvement is wholly on subsidiary. 
    Originally incorporated under the laws of New Jersey and later transferred to Delaware, it's organized as a New Jersey corporation in 1897 to takeover lands that were subject to Missouri division mortgage of the old company in order to keep them up to (Inaudible).

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Are all the lands of the Northern Pacific Railway Company of this character in -- in the ownership of the Improvement Company?
speaker="ml_countryman_jr" startTime="155.812" stopTime="162.270">
    Mr. M.L. Countryman Jr. 
    No, Your Honor, relatively small proportion of the lands are in ownership of the Improvement Company.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="162.270" stopTime="165.282">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Why -- why is the differentiation?
speaker="ml_countryman_jr" startTime="165.282" stopTime="329.177">
    Mr. M.L. Countryman Jr. 
    The Improvement Company took over only these lands that were subject to the Missouri division mortgage. 
    Those were in -- principally in North Dakota and they're practically old and sold to agricultural lands. 
    Very little remained in Northwestern Improvement Company ownership although I think the Improvement Company did have some timberlands in Montana. 
    And as I've stated to yesterday, the Improvement Company has at all times has been treated as the department of the railroad. 
    The land department of the railroad is the land department of the Improvement Company. 
    And this -- well it doesn't appear in the record, we are now in the process of dissolving the Improvement Company. 
    Of the lands that had been sold, only 2,144,000 acres were timberlands subject to traffic clauses and all but about 218,000 acres of that 2,144,000 were sold prior to 1910, 900,000 acres were sold to warehouses in 1900 and the traffic clauses in that contract expired in 1915. 
    The Railway Company as I say had an interest in land -- in the natural resources and when the lands containing coal or iron which I might say were included in the grant were sold. 
    Generally, the minerals were accepted and reserved to the company. 
    If other minerals were suspected to be present, a reservation of minerals is also made so that in 1949, the Railway Company had about -- had mineral rates in about six and a half million acres of land. 
    In all leases of it are mineral rights or timberlands or cutting timber or for removal of natural resources. 
    They have included the traffic clause providing that the lessee with ship products over our line upon which were equal to those of any competitors and when the destination to be reached by our land.

    Mr. M.L. Countryman Jr. 
    No, Your Honor. 
    They are very general among railroads. 
    They have been used for 75 years I would say. 
    There are quite a number of cases of the books, where the reasonableness or the validity of traffic clauses of this character had been before the Court. 
    Only a few have involved to questions of violation of the antitrust laws. 
    They have been uniformly upheld to deal with as against to numerous different charges of objection that has been made to. 
    I say uniformly in the Revenue case in this Court about 253 U.S., two types of the traffic clauses were involved. 
    One where the (Inaudible) have leased a shipper's railroad from the shipper serving the shipper's coal mine. 
    And the lease contained the provision that the shipper would ship three fourths of his coal over the leased line and the line of (Inaudible). 
    The Court said that the claim of violation of the Sherman Act was too insubstantial to be considered. 
    Other traffic clauses involved in that case were found to be a part of the scheme for the monopolization of the coal of the school fields in Pennsylvania and its transportation to markets, and were condemned as being a part of that scheme of monopolization.

    Is it common to have in these clauses the provision to ship over the railroad only if it can be considered (Inaudible)?

    Mr. M.L. Countryman Jr. 
    Yes.

    Unknown Speaker 
    That's common in all of them?
speaker="ml_countryman_jr" startTime="471.867" stopTime="535.872">
    Mr. M.L. Countryman Jr. 
    Yes that's in everyone. 
    I should say the words “and service” is not included in grazing leases, it's included in our timber contract or timber cutting contract. 
    But the administration has at all time recognized that we couldn't expect the shipping business unless we can provide them good service as to our competitor. 
    And I say that the word “rates being equal” implies service equality because unless the services are the same, you can't compare the rates. 
    For example, frequently, there may be transit privilege that connects with the rate over one line that isn't available by another to stop privilege that to has appearing on measure of the rate even though the rate itself may be the same number since per hundred pounds.

    I think not necessarily, but I think probably he will get in trouble with Section 3 of the Clayton Act. 
    Now Section 3 of the Clayton Act is different from Section 1 of Sherman Act and that all that needs to be shown is a potential lessening of competition or a potential tendency to monopoly, whereas, the restraints of the Sherman Act are unlawful only if they're unreasonable and they are unreasonable only if they have actual harmful effects on competition to the detriment result.

    Mr. M.L. Countryman Jr. 
    Well, we think there's no effect, no substantial effect on competition from this traffic clause. 
    Because in the first place, our rates have to be published and filed therein, open to all shippers the same -- on the same commodity between the same points for everybody and subject to change only on 30 days notice. 
    We are in competition in courts for the commodities of all other shippers from the same shipping point, and the -- it is observed to suppose that either our competitors or our self would disregard the business of other shippers because we have clauses that gave us priority on the particular -- of the business with particular shipper.

    And I say that if there is a distinction, the case should go back to trial on the merit. 
    Now, I say, we have no intention of making a distinction.

   Argument of Daniel M. Friedman

    Mr. Friedman.

    Mr. Daniel M. Friedman 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    The contract restrictions which are involved in this case are ones which basically give the Northern Pacific Railway Company a claim, the right to get the business of the shippers to whom it has sold or leased various categories of its land, as long as the Northern Pacific's rates and in some instances, the service are equal. 
    Mr. Countryman has suggested that it's a practical matter this case must be treated as though rates and service were written into all of these contracts. 
    The fact is that they're not written into all of these contracts. 
    The contracts vary in their form but the contracts which cover the majority of the acreage involved in this case are limited to rates and do not authorize a shipper to ship via some competing carrier merely because the service is better either in his opinion or in the Northern Pacific's opinion.

    The -- in any event, if a shipper for whatever reason as a matter of whimsy as Your Honor suggested, wishes to patronize a competing carrier, we think, he has the right to do that. 
    Now, I'd like to mention one other thing in describing these restraints. 
    In some instances, they go beyond merely requiring the lessee or the grantee to ship the products produced on a particular land. 
    In some instances, they're acquiring to ship products produced not only on the lands received from Northern Pacific but on adjacent lands in the same area which he then or thereafter own. 
    And indeed in some of the leases, leases for the coal lands, there's a provision requiring him to ship incoming freight destined to those areas by the Northern Pacific.

    In this case, you have land which is sold or leased and there's no possible argument that these restrictive clauses are needed to permit the more efficient use or the better use of the remaining land which Northern Pacific has.

    Mr. Daniel M. Friedman

    The theory which you have suggested is the theory of the tying cases enunciated in the Times-Picayune case and I will come to that in a moment and believe what -- show why I believe we have established that. 
    But we think this particular situation has a further vice, this is a situation in which you have contracts which on their face show no demonstrable business purpose, no legitimate business aim and the effect of them is to preclude competing sellers of transportation from any access to a very substantial market. 
    In other words, it narrows the outlet as this Court have said of competing sellers and at the same time denies to the use of the transportation their freedom to patronize competing carriers and that we think that where you have that kind of a situation whether it's on a wide scale and whether it's a substantial restraint of interstate commerce, the principles which this Court has applied in such cases and associated press and fashion originated skill, compel the conclusion that these agreements are invalid on their face.

    Will that be better under Sherman law, the case I put you?

    There was no showing in that case as to what percentage of the market for the tying product, that is, the salt leasing machine International Salt had. 
    Despite this, the District Court granted summary judgment, and this Court upheld the grant of summary judgment. 
    Now, in their appeal to this Court, International Salt challenged the ruling of the trial court because they said they're entitled to show that there were competing machines. 
    That in fact competitors were not excluded, and furthermore, they said they're entitled to show what percentage of the market, the salt machines they had. 
    And this Court deemed those considerations irrelevant and then subsequently in the Standard Oil case, this Court in discussing the International Salt case pointed out that those factors were present in that case and they were deemed irrelevant.

    Mr. Daniel M. Friedman 
    Well, I think Mr. Justice that even though in International Salt, the company had abuse its patents by seeking to go beyond its patent monopoly. 
    That factor, I don't believe was crucial on the question of whether International Salt had the recusant dominance to be able to effectively enforce upon its lessees the obligation to purchase the tied product. 
    And what we're saying to this Court is that the kind of leverage which a patent holder is able to exert in a situation where there may be very many other articles, very similar which will do the same thing is comparable to the kind of leverage which the owner of land is able to exert as we think it's shown here by the fact that these people were able to impose these contracts upon their lessees and grantee.

    The stipulation is a substantial portion that there's -- I say there's no particular breakdown as to the precise dollar volumes from each individual shipper or from particular --

    And that shows that would have been very expensive and I gather you'd say --

    Mr. Daniel M. Friedman 
    In fact stipulated --

    -- selected lessees from shipments under each various stations along the line?
speaker="daniel_m_friedman" startTime="3384.611" stopTime="3391.076">
    Mr. Daniel M. Friedman 
    There wasn't -- basically, I would say a recognition -- a concession of substantial shipments were involved.

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    That stipulation (Inaudible) would mean, I just understand that the counsel for the railroad (Inaudible) in fact that there was substantial amount of volume (Inaudible). 
    I do not understand what -- what issues of the fact they had the court to decide or did they -- what was that issue of fact?
speaker="daniel_m_friedman" startTime="3413.567" stopTime="3426.112">
    Mr. Daniel M. Friedman 
    The issue of fact, they wanted the Court to determine primarily was whether in fact Northern Pacific had a dominant position in all the particular types of lands involved. 
    In other words they --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="3426.112" stopTime="3428.076">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    You took the position that was given to you?
speaker="daniel_m_friedman" startTime="3428.076" stopTime="3428.655">
    Mr. Daniel M. Friedman 
    That's correct.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="3428.655" stopTime="3429.481">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    So did the Court?
speaker="daniel_m_friedman" startTime="3429.481" stopTime="3471.068">
    Mr. Daniel M. Friedman 
    That's correct. 
    They -- they wanted the Court to say whether in grazing lands in Montana which Northern Pacific leased whether in fact Northern Pacific had a dominant position in the sense of having 60% or 70% and whether it only had 5% or 10%, we took the position that that was immaterial. 
    We said that the impact of these clauses was such and the fact that they have this position as the owners of the land and were able to exert leverage sufficient to get the shippers or the grantees to enter into these contracts that that was enough to violate the Sherman Act.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="3471.068" stopTime="3482.518">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    The fact that they were able to exert leverage is essential if contracts are made or discover a substantial part of interstate commerce, suppose they're made voluntarily between the parties.
speaker="daniel_m_friedman" startTime="3482.518" stopTime="3483.165">
    Mr. Daniel M. Friedman 
    Well this was --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="3483.165" stopTime="3486.397">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    What difference does it make so far as the violation of the antitrust act --
speaker="daniel_m_friedman" startTime="3486.397" stopTime="3522.239">
    Mr. Daniel M. Friedman 
    As we rate the International Salt case, we don't think it does make any difference but if the -- under the Times-Picayune case where it speaks in terms of exerting monopolistic leverage, we believe we -- as an alternative theory meet that test because they were able to exert that leverage in this case through the possession of their land. 
    But we think there's a broader position and the situation involved here which is that they have tied up a substantial volume of commerce and with respect to that volume of commerce, they have excluded a --

    Suppose the a three steel company manufactured 35% of the steel of the country that would combine voluntarily either one being authorized to exert some kind of a power. 
    They just decided they want to combine or fix grievance agreement between (Inaudible) would that not violate the Sherman Act?
speaker="daniel_m_friedman" startTime="3545.402" stopTime="3554.895">
    Mr. Daniel M. Friedman 
    Clearly Mr. Justice, it would violate the Sherman Act because there was a substantial -- it was a restraint on a substantial volume of commerce.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Mr. Friedman, counsel often tell us the things of interest by way of background. 
    Well, the judges also have that curiosity at times and I have the curiosity of -- curiosity to ask you whether this record shows what blew -- what can this litigation is being in 1949 when this is a long standing arrangement on the part of the Northern Pacific.
speaker="daniel_m_friedman" startTime="3583.574" stopTime="3584.021">
    Mr. Daniel M. Friedman 
    Now, the record --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="3584.021" stopTime="3585.129">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Anything in the record on that?
speaker="daniel_m_friedman" startTime="3585.129" stopTime="3585.446">
    Mr. Daniel M. Friedman 
    There's nothing --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="3585.446" stopTime="3588.231">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Is there something that's on 50 to 60 years?
speaker="daniel_m_friedman" startTime="3588.231" stopTime="3607.239">
    Mr. Daniel M. Friedman 
    No. 
    There's nothing in the record on that Mr. Justice, and I frankly don't know what was the emphasis to this litigation except that I supposed that it's conceivable that with a limited step of the antitrust division, we never got around to doing it until this time.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="3607.239" stopTime="3615.470">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    But the record doesn't show that something from new -- of course effort or anything like that is made by the railroad.
speaker="daniel_m_friedman" startTime="3615.470" stopTime="3659.386">
    Mr. Daniel M. Friedman 
    No, it does not Mr. Justice. 
    And in conclusion, I just like to point out once again that these agreements have no demonstrable business purpose. 
    They're solely anticompetitive. 
    They're designed solely to give Northern Pacific a priority on this business and we believe that affecting as they do a substantial volume of commerce and narrowing the outlets to which competing sellers may sell and from which purchase of transportation they buy, they're invalid and that it is not necessary in holding them invalid to establish if Northern Pacific in fact had any dominance of all the lands in the area. 
    Thank you.
