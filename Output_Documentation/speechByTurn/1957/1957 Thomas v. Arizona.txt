Thomas v. Arizona

    Mr. W. Edward Morgan 
    -- I think an answer to the question of Mr. Justice Frankfurter yesterday regarding the attitude of the counsel -- the publicity regarding the arrest of the defendant in this case.I think it might be pertinent to remark that counsel at the time, felt it was so flamboyant and tending to bring the defendants into hate in this community that a motion for change of venue was -- was brought by counsel at the time the trial was denied. 
    The -- I think it should be pointed out also in addition to the confessions that the arrest took place on March 17th and the last confession obtained from the defendant was on April 1st, which was in the -- while the defendant was still in the Cochise County jail at Bisbee, and that this confession was also ruled by the trial judge as being inadmissible -- as being involuntary by reason of the original incidents of his arrest and this was a considerable time. 
    In a connection with the --

    Mr. W. Edward Morgan 
    Yes.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="129.567" stopTime="153.148">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    If later confessions were excluded by the trial court because of the continuing, disturbing, undermining influence of the incident at the time of his arrest, how did he differentiate admitting to the judge orally, which was earlier in time than the confessions which he excluded?
speaker="w_edward_morgan" startTime="153.148" stopTime="204.954">
    Mr. W. Edward Morgan 
    His distinction set forth in his -- we ask the trial judge that a direct question, we ask him why he did this. 
    He said I -- if counsel wants to know the answer, the answer is that I feel that he was in the -- he was in the courtroom and he was in the presence of the -- of the man who had saved him, that is the Sheriff Jack Howard who had saved him from this -- from the posse. 
    There is, I think, maybe a more fundamental reason and that is that the trial judge did not have the testimony of the state highway patrolman Harry Selchow at the time he made his ruling on the -- at the time of the ancillary hearing. 
    The -- that testimony of the state --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="204.954" stopTime="207.126">

    Yes, it was.

    We had released the witness Harry Selchow to give testimony in a murder case in Tucson in the federal court upon three hours notice to return. 
    And in the proceedings aside from the jury, we came to a point very rapidly, very unexpectedly, the judge ruled on the confessions and we didn't have an opportunity to bring back Sergeant Selchow nor did we know what his testimony was going to be.

    Mr. Morgan, this -- this matter, it seems to me -- to me, at least, so crucial that I'd like to ask, if I may, one or two questions so that when the Attorney General put the State's case, you will be able to deal with it. 
    You will deal with it. 
    Let's see if I understand this. 
    There was an oral disclosure by Thomas in this -- in this informal courthouse.

    Mr. W. Edward Morgan 
    Yes, sir.

    Yes.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="503.573" stopTime="514.758">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    And that admission was first in chambers before the judge and the preliminary I think, and then the matter was right before the jury and left for the jury.

    Yes, sir.

    Both of which were excluded by the trial judge on the ground, as I understand it, that the -- that the subverting, the coercing effect of his experience at the time of arrest continued and operated to make what his -- that make his confession involuntary, is that right?

    Answer, he knelt down beside Mr. Thomas and he talked to him and asked him why he had killed the woman. 
    He said, “No I didn't, the other boy did.” 
    Mr. Howard said, “We have your blood from the store, we have your shoes and we have tracked you from the store, then what happened, if anything.” 
    Answer, “Then Mr. Howard said, you are under arrest and Mr. Thomas stood up and I put the handcuffs on him.” 
    Question, “And then what happened, if anything? 
    Somewhere from behind me a rope was thrown over Mr. Thomas' neck and he was pulled back into me and we stumbled a little bit and I had to hold of the rope and then -- then Mr. Howard came around me and I said, “Jack this is no way to handle this.”

    As a witness, he was called -- he was put on the information as a state's witness.

    May it please the Court. 
    At the outset, I would like to say on behalf on the State of Arizona that the State is just as interested as is this Court in seeing that its criminal processes and procedures aren't designed in such a way as to deny due process nor administered is such as a way as to deny due process to any person no matter who that person maybe. 
    Now, this case depends to a great extent, upon facts and facts alone. 
    It is here on habeas corpus. 
    We have shown in our brief why we believe that petitioner wasn't entitled to a hearing before the District Court. 
    We will not go into that on this argument.

    Mr. Wesley E. Polley 
    There was a petition filed in the State of Arizona. 
    It was invited to file opposition to that petition. 
    There was no testimony taken. 
    It was simply -- we might say battle of affidavits.

    The transcript --

    They filed the transcript.
speaker="wesley_e_polley" startTime="1098.121" stopTime="1245.168">
    Mr. Wesley E. Polley 
    The -- the State filed a response and attached to that response was an affidavit of the County Attorney. 
    The admission against interest which was taken by the County Attorney, all of the transcripts of the testimony and of the lower court that is the Superior Court, all -- all of the briefs in the Supreme Court of Arizona on both sides. 
    Now, under the rulings of this Court, I believe that the Court will examine the evidence in this light. 
    It will not review disputed questions of fact and substitute its own decision thereon for that of the state jury and the state courts. 
    (2) This Court will review the undisputed questions of -- the undisputed facts and will apply its own independent legal judgment to those facts and the law as which defines due process. 
    Now, on that basis I will attempt to state the undisputed facts to the Court and just a fair as way as I can possibly do. 
    I will leave out nothing which might be unfavorable to the State and I will leave out nothing which would be favorable to the State. 
    I will state nothing that is not supported by the record. 
    First, the petitioner, Arthur Thomas, is a Negro, 27 years old, male, a very -- a quite large man, over six feet tall. 
    He is of normal intelligence. 
    His education progressed into high school. 
    He served in the United States Navy, but it doesn't appear how many years although we know that he was there in 1942, when he was in the brig and he was there in 1946 when he was in the brig. 
    He had been in jail as a juvenile. 
    He had been in prison twice on felonies.

    Convicted you mean?
speaker="wesley_e_polley" startTime="1246.290" stopTime="1351.846">
    Mr. Wesley E. Polley 
    Convicted and actually served time. 
    One -- or the last time, I believe, was for a felony in the State of Texas. 
    He received a five-year sentence and serve 14 months of it. 
    Now, when he was arrested, there is no doubt that a rope was thrown around his neck by two irresponsible people who were no part of the official Sheriff's posse. 
    The State of Arizona, I will confess, is not proud of that fact. 
    However, we do not believe that that fact should be exaggerated and over-emphasized and magnetized to where the entire picture is clearly thrown out of focus. 
    The undisputed evidence is that the Sheriff, himself, did take the rope off in each instance. 
    Now, it is the claim of the petitioner that the confession which was actually introduced in evidence was the product of the fear created by the throwing of this rope. 
    We would point out to the Court that the time this rope was thrown, at the time that the controverted facts state, the Sheriff said, “If you don't tell the truth I will let them use this.” 
    That it wasn't -- it didn't create such a furious to cause him to confess because he didn't confess. 
    He said that he didn't do it, but he knew he did and he pointed out a 17 year old Negro boy as the person who had actually committed the crime.

    Did they leave the stand or did -- did the Sheriff thereafter, take the stand and say that, “I did not, I did not say to this man, "Will you tell the truth or I will let them go ahead and do this?”

    Is that the practice in Arizona to raise -- to -- when you offer a confession, before you offer confessions to produce proof to show a prima facie case of voluntariness?

    Mr. Wesley E. Polley 
    Under the law of Arizona, if the Court please, it is left to the discretion of the court. 
    He can hear that preliminary evidence in the absence of the jury or he can go ahead and require that the foundation be laid in the presence of the jury. 
    In this case, the court, in an abundance of caution, required the State to lay its foundation in the absence of the jury, first.

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    You, of course, claim that the jury and the court were right in the first place that you say whether so or not, that there shouldn't be a new trial of that issue in the District Court, although it was asked.
speaker="wesley_e_polley" startTime="2659.082" stopTime="2758.038">
    Mr. Wesley E. Polley 
    I believe that under the rule of Brown versus Allen there was sufficient in the record to be reviewed by the federal court for that court to make up its independent determination as to whether or not the due process have been violated and apparently that was the -- the Judge McCulloch's holding and also the -- the holding of the Ninth Circuit Court. 
    Now, if the Court would permit me, I would like to run through the subsequent events which I believe are very, very immaterial. 
    As I say, after Thomas, the petitioner was apprehended and he said that this other Negro boy, Cooper, had actually committed the murder, then, the party went to another field which was two or three miles from the first field where Cooper was apprehended. 
    Now, I believe that's a fair statement of the evidence that he -- that Cooper was out in this field about some witnesses say a half a mile from the road where the Sheriff's car was left, (Inaudible) the Sheriff went over there unarmed. 
    He got Cooper and the same cop rancher was accompanying the Sheriff. 
    He threw a rope around Cooper, around his waste and he was laid back to his car.The rope was taken off of Cooper by the Sheriff. 
    Then, while the two of them were standing together, the same cop rancher.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2758.038" stopTime="2764.487">

speaker="wesley_e_polley" startTime="2764.487" stopTime="2795.581">
    Mr. Wesley E. Polley 
    No. 
    It -- it was taken off -- I believe the testimony was that he was laid about 50 feet towards the car and then the rope was taken off. 
    And while Cooper and Thomas were standing there being questioned, a rope was thrown around the two of them, there is a conflict as to whether or not, they were jerked off their feet or not. 
    Some witnesses say that they were. 
    Some witnesses say that they weren't.

    There were two cop rancher involved, if the Court please. 
    There are only two men on horses. 
    Now, at that time that the evidence is uncontradicted, that the Sheriff got mad at the cop rancher which certainly took considerable time in doing and admonished that there would be no more of this. 
    And from that time on, there wasn't.

    I understood you to say that this was not a part of -- that these cop ranchers were not a part of the Sheriff's posse. 
    How does it happen -- how does it happen that they were there at the time they arrested the second man three miles away if they weren't in the official party? 
    You said only this man and the Sheriff went there to the place where the second boy was apprehended.

    The circumstances the next day is that -- that he got up. 
    The Sheriff -- the night before, if the Court please, his upright questioning, he was taken to the hospital where his hand was dressed and where he made no complaints whatsoever, about any roping incident or about any damage to his neck. 
    He was taken to jail and his clothes were taken from him because we wanted to use them as evidence. 
    His -- he -- overalls were replaced with ordinary jail coveralls. 
    His shoes could not be placed for the simple reason that the Sheriff had no shoes large enough to fit this man. 
    The next morning, he was taken to the Justice of the Peace, Judge Frazier, the magistrate for arraignment. 
    The record shows that he was barefooted. 
    Now, he was barefooted for the simple reason that they still couldn't find the pair of shoes, big enough to fit the man. 
    When the Sheriff, it must be conceded, took him from the jail down to the lower justice court which by the way isn't any converted store. 
    It's an office building, the Justice Court building which has been made for 20 or 30 years. 
    The Sheriff took him there in an automobile by himself and believe it or not that the evidence shows that the Sheriff had a gun but he -- it was in the seat between him and the petitioner. 
    When he got to the Justice Court, the petitioner was taken into the Justice Court. 
    There were two men in the Justice Court who were transacting business with the Justice. 
    He was doing some notary work or something like that which took five or 10 minutes. 
    When the work was finished, the next order of business was the arraignment of Arthur Thomas. 
    The Justice Court or the judge asked him if that was his name and he said, “Yes.” 
    The Justice then read the complaint to him, told him that he had a right to -- to employ an attorney and that he could either wave his preliminary hearing or if he didn't want to wave the preliminary hearing, one would be held. 
    And it was then out of the clearest sky with no prompting from anyone that the petitioner said, “I don't need a lawyer. 
    I'm guilty. 
    I killed a woman.”

    My time is growing short. 
    That after the two men were put in the automobile, they were taken to Willcox at a distance of about 15 miles to the nearest Justice of the Peace, for -- the Justice was out driving a school bus, so the party then went to the mortuary for the purpose of taking a picture of the deceased. 
    The photographer was riding with the Sheriff that I don't think it's a fair inference from the testimony that -- that the petitioner was taken there to view the remains. 
    It was simply with the Sheriff and this photographer.He certainly was enforced to -- to view the remains. 
    The party was then taken to Bisbee. 
    They got there approximately 6:30 in the afternoon after the local Justice office had closed. 
    They were brought to my house for this simple reason that I was in the stretcher and it was more convenient to interview them there than it was for me to be loaded into an ambulance and taken to the courthouse. 
    I questioned each of the Negroes. 
    They were in my house approximately two and a half to three hours. 
    I questioned them each for about an hour.

    Then, the -- the other hour in the three was taken up in getting a court reporter down there. 
    The petitioner gave me his statement was an accusation against the other boy and which we have attached to our brief as an appendix. 
    At that time, before I started taking this statement or in -- in the first portion of the statement, I advised him is this. 
    “Now, you know that I'm the County Attorney of this county here and all of these gentlemen around here are either Deputy Sheriffs or Deputy County Attorneys. 
    I want to ask you about this occurrence and Kansas Settlement. 
    I am not going to make you any promises if you do talk to me and I'm not going to make you any threats, if you don't talk to me. 
    Whatever I ask you, I want you to tell me freely and I want you to tell me the truth.”

    Mr. Wesley E. Polley 
    In the federal court and it was considered by Judge McCulloch in the federal court. 
    Now, again on page 30 of the appendix to our brief, I stated this to him. 
    Question, “Well, I'm going to let you go now for a little while. 
    Now, everything that you have told me has been the truth hasn't it?” 
    Answer, “Yes, sir.” 
    Question, “And you swear to God that it is the truth?” 
    Question, “And everything you told me, you have voluntarily told me haven't you?” 
    Answer, “Yes.” 
    Question, “And you understand like I told you when we started that I'm not making you any promises if you do talk to me. 
    I'm not making you any promises if you don't talk and I'm not making you any threats if you don't talk, you understand that?” 
    Question, “And you understand that when you started, you didn't have to talk to me unless you wanted to -- to, do you understand that?” 
    Now, after that was taken, he was taken back to the jail. 
    The next day, if the Court please, which -- no, the day after that on the 20th, that I again questioned him in the courthouse, in -- in my office in the presence of a different set of officers altogether, Sheriff Howard or none of the officers involved in his arrest were there. 
    Present was Percy Bowden, the Chief of Police of Douglas and a -- I mean who was also a Deputy United States Marshall. 
    At that time that Arthur Thomas was shown the transcript of the statement that he had made me at my home and he read it and initialled it. 
    I then proceeded to question him again in the presence of these officers. 
    Going into the matter much more in detail as to how the crime was committed, he gave me that willingly as the -- the evidence shows. 
    Not only willingly that he talked to me, but he assisted me in explaining how the thing had happened by marking a big diagram with crayons, different colored crayons as we went along. 
    That was testified too, without contradiction. 
    Then, 11 days after that, on April 1st after this statement had been typed up, it was given to the Deputy United States Marshall who went up into the jail and interviewed Thomas in the fingerprint room of the Sheriff's office, not in any cell or anywhere else. 
    He told Thomas why he was there that he wanted him to read each and every page of this statement if it was the truth to initial it. 
    If it wasn't the truth and not to initial it, that Thomas went ahead and took approximately an hour, read each page, initialled it as he went along and then signed the last page. 
    Now, on the question of whether or not that Thomas was in fear of the Sheriff himself, I would like to read the Court's -- this part of the transcript.

speaker="wesley_e_polley" startTime="3875.836" stopTime="3951.415">
    Mr. Wesley E. Polley 
    “I have read your authorities on voluntary and involuntary confessions and I have studied the citations carefully. 
    And I have studied the exhibits in relation to those and the court recognizes the fact that the friends and neighbors of the deceased might well have been highly unjustifiably incensed on finding her slain body. 
    Many others might well have felt the same way. 
    However, neither good morals nor the Constitutions of the United States and of the State of Arizona will tolerate an individual or a group taking the law into their own hands. 
    There are countries where confessions are extorted by devious and improper methods that run countered to our American way of life or of our Constitution. 
    Our ancestors gave us the Bill of Rights and the law of due process and to scuttle this time honored in sacred laws will be to invite anarchy and dictatorship. 
    The Court will not, in any way, honor any confession cured by an underthreat of attempted lynching. 
    Under such circumstances, a confession is not voluntary and its credibility is doubtful, then therefore barred by our Constitution and the Court therefore feels and he -- he ruled."

speaker="wesley_e_polley" startTime="3963.874" stopTime="4044.951">
    Mr. Wesley E. Polley 
    I have been studying the matter. 
    Counsel brought this matter to a head before the Court intended saying any more about it, but since counsel has, I am going to sustain counsel's objection to the introduction of State's Exhibits 51 and 53 because they are confessions and they are obtained having been procured by threat of lynch and the Court does not propose to be a party in any ways to any attempt of lynching, and I will deny the motion for mistrial. 
    That takes away the confession that you say that Percy Bowden secured and it takes away Number 51. 
    I believe 53 was the one that was under the influence of Percy Bowden. 
    Now, the Percy Bowden incident, Mr. Morgan was asking for a mistrial upon the grounds that Percy Bowden had taken this last confession to Thomas in jail and had him initial it after counsel was appointed. 
    That was the matter that was before the Court. 
    Now, the -- the important thing about what I just read, if the Court please, where this -- Judge Jennings mentions threat of attempted lynching. 
    At that time, there wasn't one word in the record about any attempted lynching. 
    Apparently, that Judge Jennings have been reading the newspapers also.

    Mr. Wesley E. Polley 
    Not under the circumstances of this, if the Court please. 
    Now, my time is almost up. 
    Could I pass to one more subject as to whether or not these -- or that Thomas was actually injured or the defendant put on a newspaper reporter who was a very belligerent witness insofar as the State is concerned. 
    He went to the prison on either the 18th -- I'm not -- or to the jail, on either the 18th or the 19th of March to take a picture of the petitioner and to look for any marks or bruises which might be on his body. 
    He took a picture of him and that was introduced in evidence. 
    On cross-examination, he was asked. 
    Question, “And the picture you published in connection with the story?” 
    Answer, “Yes, sir.” 
    Question, “And the footnote to the picture stated this, did it not?" 
    "The six-foot negro agreed with Howard's statement that he had saved the farmworker's life.” 
    Answer, “That is exactly what I just finished saying.” 
    So, there is no doubt that on the 18th that the petitioner did concede that if Howard had any part in his roping at all, it was as his benefactor and nothing else. 
    Now, insofar as the marks are concerned, this is what -- this appears on page 1943 of the Superior Court transcript. 
    Question, “And when -- where were those marks?” 
    Answer, “He had one mark on the -- a very small minor abrasion on the left side of his neck and he had a larger abrasion about a quarter of an inch long on the right side of his neck.” 
    Now, those were the extent of the injuries. 
    Now, Mr. Pidgeon would like to say a few words to the Court upon the evidence in the record other than this confession. 
    I would simply call the Court's attention to the fact that under the ruling of this Court, itself, in the Lisenba case, in the Lyons case, in the Gallegos case and in the Stroble case that physical abuse, itself, even though admitted, isn't sufficient to make a confession involuntary.Unless that it is going further and shown that the physical abuse did create some inducement or some fear which actually produced the confession. 
    In this case, we submit that it had nothing whatsoever to do with it. 
    We deplore that it happened. 
    We do not believe that it is sufficient to upset the conviction of the state court.

    Well, may I --

    Justice Harold Burton 
    May I ask you one question? 
    How do you reconcile the fact that at the -- confessions before the magistrate that he was not (Inaudible) by -- by fear and yet in a subsequent confession, it is held to be (Inaudible)
speaker="wesley_e_polley" startTime="4324.903" stopTime="4379.207">
    Mr. Wesley E. Polley 
    I do not believe that Judge Jennings ruled on that particular thing. 
    I think Judge Jennings in an outburst of -- of indignation as to the -- brought on by the fact that this roping had actually happened, said in short, “I am not going to permit the State to use this confession after that happened.” 
    I don't think that there was any question in his mind as to whether there was fear or whether there wasn't fear. 
    We have no opportunity to argue the time sequence of these various confessions and I'm certain that Judge Jennings never realized it. 
    That is, I reiterate, we haven't finished our foundation. 
    We had never offered a single one of these confessions at the time that he ruled out the ones that he did.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="4379.207" stopTime="4398.330">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well, then -- then you accepted a finding of the Court that -- that the -- the confession against the defendant is admissible. 
    You -- you say that that's all right, but you contest the finding of the trial court that the others are not?
speaker="wesley_e_polley" startTime="4398.330" stopTime="4402.706">

    I do, Your Honor, and under the authority of the Stroble case.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Now, let me ask -- let me ask you this. 
    If there was or if we should conclude that there is a finding by the Court in the record that those subsequent confessions were involuntary by reason of the so-called lynching effort that was made at the time he was arrested. 
    If we conceive that there was a finding of that kind by the -- by the Court, do you believe that we can sustain the admitting of a confession that was given between the time of the so-called lynching episode and the time of the confessions that were excluded?
speaker="wesley_e_polley" startTime="4453.743" stopTime="4455.724">
    Mr. Wesley E. Polley 
    I sincerely believe so, Your Honor.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="4455.724" stopTime="4463.611">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    And -- and would you mind elaborating on that. 
    Tell us what your reasoning is on that score.
speaker="wesley_e_polley" startTime="4463.611" stopTime="4511.442">
    Mr. Wesley E. Polley 
    Well, the simple reason that it may have been Judge Jennings' idea that after the confession was made to Judge Frazier in the sanctity of this Court where there was no mob present, no anything, or it couldn't reasonably be -- be believed that any harm was going to come to the defendant. 
    That that confession was admissible while a later confession given to me in my home in the presence of these officers and a later confession given to me in my office in the presence of officers, although different ones, that there was a sufficient change of circumstances as of -- of this Court has well emphasized in the Lyons case.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="4511.442" stopTime="4518.296">

    None whatsoever.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="4519.160" stopTime="4526.745">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Then -- then why do you say that the judge probably based it upon that when there was no evidence to that effect?
speaker="wesley_e_polley" startTime="4526.745" stopTime="4529.722">
    Mr. Wesley E. Polley 
    I think that the judge ruled prematurely.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Do you think there that we should say that -- that the judge acted prematurely and without -- without consideration for the facts, words against you, but on the other hand that he acted properly when he acted for you?
speaker="wesley_e_polley" startTime="4560.356" stopTime="4587.044">
    Mr. Wesley E. Polley 
    I must be consistent. 
    I believe that each of the confessions was admissible and all that I ask is that the Court examined the facts under the light of the decisions on the Haley case and the Malinski case, considered the undisputed facts and then way those undisputed facts against the law of due process. 
    I think that I'm confident if that is done that this conviction will be upheld.

    How about the Leyra case?

    I do not believe that the Leyra case has anything to do with this case upon the merits that there is -- is -- a mere reading of that case is revolting.

speaker="wesley_e_polley" startTime="4605.518" stopTime="4673.913">
    Mr. Wesley E. Polley 
    Is revolting. 
    That is the facts in that case is to what was done with the defendant in that case by going back to the -- the various reports in -- in the state courts and the -- the report in this -- from this Court that that man, there was every advantage taken on the man. 
    It was done in that case where he was questioned for hour after hour after hour without proper care where he was -- they knew that he was sick. 
    That is the officer's did. 
    So, he asked for a doctor and they brought in a doctor who he thought was a doctor, but he wasn't a doctor. 
    He was a state agent and by the use of the confidential relationship between this doctor and the patient, where the -- the doctor, he didn't exactly threatened him, but he offered all the inducements in the world that he wasn't -- he stated to him, “You're not more than guilty. 
    That it'll be better if you would go ahead and tell us what happened. 
    Now, why don't you tell us what happened, and so forth." 
    That -- that --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="4673.913" stopTime="4690.336">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Yes. 
    My point was on the merits of the case of the extent of the -- of the coercion used, put on the question of subsequent -- subsequent confessions that one was -- if one was bad, those that followed it were bad.
speaker="wesley_e_polley" startTime="4690.336" stopTime="4766.262">
    Mr. Wesley E. Polley 
    In the -- the distinction, if the Court please, is that in the Leyra case, all of the confessions were secured within a period of five hours. 
    There was certainly no change of circumstances. 
    I -- I believe that the effect of promises of leniency are much more far reaching and continue much longer than -- than threats of violence. 
    If -- if Thomas in this case, had any idea that he was going to suffer physical punishment if he didn't confess from what happened out there at the time of his arrest, I think that they were dispelled when I advised him of his rights and when he still didn't confess when he was put back in the -- the custody of the Sheriff and he still didn't suffer any abuse when even the next morning, he went to the Justice Court that no abuse was offered to him that -- I simply can't see why, if there was any fear that it wasn't broken at the time that I talked to him.

    It -- it is right after Selchow testified. 
    See, after -- after the highway patrolman testified that Mr. Morgan made a motion for a mistrial at that time when this matter was thoroughly argued to the Court.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Your time has expired, Mr. Polley, but I see Mr. Pidgeon has been sitting there anxious to -- to say something in this -- in this matter. 
    You mentioned that he did. 
    Could you in two or three minutes make your point Mr. -- Mr. Pidgeon? 
    We'll be glad to hear from you if you -- you would.
speaker="john_g_pidgeon" startTime="5006.670" stopTime="5124.967">
    Mr. John G. Pidgeon 
    Well, if it please the Court, I want to make two points. 
    One is when we talk about habeas corpus itself. 
    And in this particular case, we believe that the District Court Judge, the United States federal judge, was correct in denying this application for habeas corpus on the grounds that the remedies had not been exhausted. 
    Now, if I understand correctly, Rule 22 (1) of this Court provides that you have 90 days from the final hearing in the State Supreme Court within which to file certiorari appear. 
    In this particular case, the appeal was decided in Arizona on October 18, 1954. 
    A rehearing was denied on November 16th, 1954. 
    It is the State's contention that the 90 days commenced to run when that rehearing was denied. 
    However, it wasn't until October 24th, 1955, about 11 months later that certiorari was applied for for the first time in this Court. 
    In the meantime, it is true there had been an application for a new trial in the trial court on the grounds of newly discovered evidence that no point that was brought up in the trial was brought up in that particular application for a new trial on the ground of newly discovered evidence. 
    But it wasn't until after that matter had been applied for in the Superior Court and decided by the Supreme Court of Arizona and a rehearing denied that certiorari was for the first time applied for here.

    In order to use them, you must make a timely application for certiorari to this Court.

    But, Mr. Pidgeon, if -- if Mr. Morgan had filed a petition for certiorari in this Court after the disposition of the main trial in your Supreme Court and there has been pending a motion for a new trial under Arizona law, I should think you would've said to this Court, "Those -- this is a premature petition for certiorari because non-concept, the motion for a new trial is that you might be granted in this Arizona court?”

    Mr. John G. Pidgeon 
    Yes, if this Court says from a matter of the uncontradicted evidence that's involuntary, that is true. 
    But if, as in the Stein case, where it is questionable, and I certainly think that that is, at least, the case here that it is questionable whether this was involuntary or not, that if there is sufficient evidence otherwise, then the decision should stand if it's submitted in -- in the right way. 
    Now, as far as I'm concerned in this particular case, the confession which was admitted to the jury was voluntary and there's no question of that. 
    Now, Mr. Polley has argued that, but in the event that it is questionable, then I believe that the rule of the Stein case applies that it was submitted to the jury under a proper instruction and that there is sufficient evidence with which to convict and therefore, they're not entitled to their habeas corpus. 
    But rather than take up the Court's time, those facts do appear in the brief, the other facts.
