Payne v. Arkansas
speaker="wiley_a_branton" startTime="0.000" stopTime="164.384">
    Mr. Wiley A. Branton 
    -- The Supreme Court of the State of Arkansas, the defendant Frank Andrew Payne is or rather was at the time of the alleged commission of the crime a 19-year-old Negro youth, was tried for a charge of murder in the first degree in the Circuit Court of Jefferson County, Arkansas. 
    He was convicted of that crime in Jefferson County, took an appeal to the Supreme Court of Arkansas where the conviction was affirmed and this Court has granted certiorari to the petitioner to hear or to determine two points raised in the petition. 
    One, whether or not members of the Negro race were systematically excluded or their number limited in the selection of the jury panel and of the jury commission. 
    And two whether the petitioner's alleged confession was introduced into evidence after the same had been illegally and unlawfully secured from him. 
    I should like to argue those two points in the order of that certiorari was granted, namely beginning with the filing of our motion to quash the then panel on the grounds of racial discrimination. 
    In order to fully appreciate the motion which was filed in the lower court, it should be pointed out that the petitioner in this case is a Negro, that he was charged with the slaying of an elderly white man and that he was tried before an all white jury in Jefferson County, Arkansas. 
    The population of Jefferson County according to the 1950 census is 76,075 of which 37,835 or approximately 50% of the total population is composed of colored people. 
    The jury panel is selected from qualified electors within the county pursuant to Arkansas law. 
    And at the time of the trial on the lower court there were 19,452 qualified voters in Jefferson County, of which 5774 or 30% were Negroes. 
    The petitioner in proper time prior to the hearing of the case on the merits filed a motion seeking to quash the jury panel on the grounds, one, that for more than 50 years in Jefferson County, Arkansas no Negro had ever been appointed to the three-man jury commission which is charged with responsibility of selecting persons to serve on the jury panel in Jefferson County. 
    And two, that of the persons selected for jury service, that the jury commission was acting in a manner so as to have and inapportioned limiting of the number of Negroes called for jury service in Jefferson County.

    What is the term of office of the jury commission?
speaker="wiley_a_branton" startTime="166.688" stopTime="179.408">
    Mr. Wiley A. Branton 
    The term of office of the jury commission amounts to approximately six months. 
    There are two terms of court each year and the court appoints a three-man jury commission a few days prior to the beginning of each term of court. 
    The term --

    Mr. Wiley A. Branton 
    It is the practice to change them and I'm rather definite that it is required by law that they be changed. 
    I think there is a two year span between the time that they can serve. 
    So that you do get a different, an entirely different jury commission at each term of court. 
    The terms of court in Jefferson County begin in March and in October, of course each commission serves until the next term the court begins.

speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="252.769" stopTime="256.937">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Well in this instance, were any of the jury commissioners public officials?
speaker="wiley_a_branton" startTime="256.937" stopTime="347.286">
    Mr. Wiley A. Branton 
    No, sir, none of the jury commissioners were public officials, no. 
    They were proper persons to serve on the jury commission. 
    We only charge the racial discrimination of the selection. 
    This three-man jury commission was appointed by the court a few days prior to each term of court, and there has never been a Negro serving as a jury commissioner in the history of anybody who we were able to get to testify who had any knowledge on it at all. 
    There has been a long line of cases from this Court and from other courts that there shall be no discrimination on account of race in the selection of petit juries which try the cases, nor of grand juries which return the indictment. 
    And as early as Strauder versus West Virginia this Court said that the constitution of juries is a very essential part of the protection such of mode of trial is intended to secure. 
    We have no case law at all to support our argument, other than to say a fortiori that we contend that such reasoning should also apply to the three-man jury commission which selects the people to serve on the jury panel in the first place, and that the appointment of this three-man jury commission at each term of court is such an integral part of the selection of jurors, that if there has been racial discrimination in the selection of persons to serve on this commission in the first place that that is just as unconstitutional as discrimination by race for serving on either a petit or grand jury.

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Well do the jury commissioners for a given term pick the jury panels?

    Mr. Wiley A. Branton 
    Only for that one term of court.

    And how do they do that within a few days before a term?
speaker="wiley_a_branton" startTime="360.749" stopTime="377.387">
    Mr. Wiley A. Branton 
    They are given the poll tax record from the county and purportedly they go through this entire record of persons, of qualified electors and select at random or in any manner that they so desire a sufficient number of persons to serve on the jury panel.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="377.387" stopTime="378.943">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    How large is the panel usually?
speaker="wiley_a_branton" startTime="378.943" stopTime="392.359">
    Mr. Wiley A. Branton 
    The panels normally in that particular county consist of about 36 persons for the regular panel, then there is a 25-man special list which normally is not opened unless the 36-man panel has been exhausted.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="392.359" stopTime="397.229">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    And does that panel, a grand jury as well as the petit jury is picked from that panel?
speaker="wiley_a_branton" startTime="397.229" stopTime="460.864">
    Mr. Wiley A. Branton 
    No. 
    They select really three panels. 
    The jury commission selects a grand jury panel, they select a civil petit jury and then they select a criminal petit jury. 
    And all of the facts now which I talk about with reference to the racial discrimination in the selection of the jury panel, I have specific reference to the criminal jury only and I do not have with me nor do I raise in this argument discrimination as to the grand jury or as to the civil jury. 
    Now, insofar as the grand jury is concerned, in Arkansas it's something that is just more or less a tradition, because to my own personal knowledge, as long as I have been practicing I do not recall a single instance that a grand jury has returned an indictment in the State of Arkansas. 
    It is normally done by the filing of an information by the prosecuting attorney. 
    We raised that as a question on certiorari but we were not granted the right to review on that question. 
    As a matter of practice it is done by the filing of the information of the -- by the prosecuting attorney.

    Do you have peremptory challenges?

    Yes, Your Honor, we have --

    How many --
speaker="wiley_a_branton" startTime="463.871" stopTime="464.656">
    Mr. Wiley A. Branton 
    -- peremptory challenges.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="464.656" stopTime="465.605">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    How many in a criminal case?(Voice Overlap) --
speaker="wiley_a_branton" startTime="465.605" stopTime="628.645">
    Mr. Wiley A. Branton 
    In -- in a capital case the state has 10 peremptory challenges and the defendant has 12 peremptory challenges. 
    Now, the second reason for the filing of our motion to quash the panel, aside from the fact that no Negroes have ever been appointed to the jury commission, the fact that we contend that there has been an arbitrary and an inapportioned limiting of the number of Negroes serving on the petit jury. 
    Now, prior to 1947 no Negro had ever served on a jury in Jefferson County for more than 50 years. 
    And in the March 1947 term of Jefferson Circuit Court, in a case then pending, the defense attorney filed a motion to quash the then panel on the grounds that there had been systematic exclusion of Negroes from jury service in that county. 
    That motion was granted and the jury commission was directed to select a new panel and on that panel there were some 13 or more Negroes appointed on the panel. 
    But beginning with the next term of court which was the October term of 1947, down to and including the October term of 1955, on page 25 of the petitioner's brief we set forth there the total number of persons selected on the panel and off to the right we have the total number of Negroes who have been placed on that panel. 
    If you will note there, the number of Negroes who have been called for jury service not for one term of court, but for 17 consecutive terms of court from October of 1947 down to October of 1955, you have only had a total of 29 Negroes called for jury service out a total of 669 jurors which constitutes only four and three-tenths percent of the number of persons called for jury service. 
    If you will note there it seems to follow a rather definite pattern of limiting the number of Negroes on the panel to just to two or three Negroes per panel. 
    And of course that means that in, not only in a capital case but even in a misdemeanor, unless there happens to be a Negro on that panel who satisfies the prosecuting attorneys, then it means that the state has more peremptory challenges authorized by law, so that they can exclude all of the Negroes on the panel so that in practical effect no Negro can actually serve on a jury unless it meets with the approval of the prosecuting attorney in that case.

    I'm tying to see if I cite in my brief the exact requirement. 
    On the top of page three. 
    They shall select from the electors of the county 16 persons of good character, of approved integrity, sound judgment and reasonable information to serve the next time that the court has grand jurors. 
    And I do know that that is the same requirement for persons serving as petit jurors. 
    Those are the only requirements under the Arkansas law. 
    That is cited under Arkansas -- on page 3 of the petitioner's brief and Arkansas Statute Section 39-206. 
    Those are the only requirements for serving on the jury in the State of Arkansas.

    Mr. Wiley A. Branton 
    Only by saying that because of this inapportioned limiting and having such few Negroes on the panel, we see here that as a practical matter, the total number of Negroes ever appearing on the panel is less than the peremptory challenges allowed to the State even in a misdemeanor case, to say nothing of a capital case. 
    And that therefore, the State could if it wanted to, use their peremptory challenges to exclude the few Negroes who were actually on the panel.

    No, Your Honor, we do not contend that there should be any certain number of Negroes on the panel. 
    In fact, we don't insist there should be a single Negro on the panel. 
    We don't ask for any systematic inclusion and certainly I think we all agree that systematic exclusion is wrong. 
    Well, we say that a defendant is entitled to a jury from which there has been no racial consideration or discrimination shown, it might be an all Negro panel, it might be all white panel, but we say that the pattern that has been followed is one to inapportionately limit the number of Negroes who are placed on that panel and that it is therefore discriminatory.

speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="865.511" stopTime="894.446">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Could I ask you a question about your table on page 25, is that the total number of Negro column on the righthand side, does that show all the people who were called or merely those who were on the top? 
    I mean, in other words, would it be -- does this exclude the possibility that there were others who were called and for some reason or other, were not put on the panel because they asked to be excused, that they weren't found qualified or something?
speaker="wiley_a_branton" startTime="894.446" stopTime="971.298">
    Mr. Wiley A. Branton 
    This includes all of the people who were on the payroll record and in trying to show the number of persons called, at that time the only information which we could find was that if they were -- if their names never appeared on the payroll record at sometime or another, that there would be no record of the number -- of the persons who were actually called for jury service. 
    Now in our brief we cite the law which requires that these persons must come into court, in answer to the service of the summons by the Sheriff after having been selected by the jury commissions. 
    And that if they are then excused from jury service, they are still entitled to $5 per day, even though they maybe excused when they come there and show some good cause why they should not serve on their -- on that panel. 
    And that therefore the payroll record is probably an accurate record of the number of persons called for jury service, both white and colored. 
    Now, there was some discussion with the trial court when that was offered in which the court made some statement that persons had been excused by the court without ever coming to the court that therefore their names would not appear. 
    There was no proof offered on it, and there is nothing to suggest that Negroes were excused in any greater percentage or proportion than white persons were excused.

    I don't know when the list expires, but the information that we cite here was obtained from the clerk of the court and the record, the payroll record went back to October of 1947.

    Mr. Wiley A. Branton 
    First why in order to explain why I happened to testify because it's a little bit unusual for a defense lawyer to testify. 
    I had intended to prove this information by the testimony of a Deputy Sheriff who has been in the Sheriff's office for a good many years and who is the person charged with the responsibility for serving these summons. 
    The trial court felt that it would delay the trial, to put him on and to have him go down this long list and suggested and in fact invited me to take the stand and to testify since I claimed to have already made the search. 
    It is nothing unusual in a rural community like Pine Bluff or Jefferson County.

    Pine Bluff is a pretty good sized town.

    Mr. Wiley A. Branton 
    Pine Bluff is a pretty good sized town Your Honor, it's about 40,000 persons. 
    But generally the jury commission uses the same people over and over for jury service at each term of court, allowing only an elapse of the time requirement, that is required by statute in which they cannot serve. 
    And as a matter of practice you would not find -- I mean, of the 669 people, for example listed on page 25, while I do not have the actual record on it, I would say that there are not more than 150 different people, they have used the same people over and over. 
    And for most of this time, the jury commission would insert a C behind the name of every colored person placed on the panel. 
    Now, they just stopped that practice just a few years ago, and if you go back from 1947 down for about 1952, wherever there is a Negro on the panel there will be a small C in parenthesis at the end of the name and so they make the designation by race.

    They were also repeated. 
    In fact on page 26 of our brief we say that only 23 different Negroes have ever been called for jury service. 
    And of course, you've only had 29 calls so there were some repeats there. 
    And most of these Negroes who have been called for jury service are placed on the panel, are persons above the age of 65 and while persons 65 years old and older may serve on the jury panel, they can claim an exemption and are not required to serve if they so elect.

    I'm told they can't fight specifically, take it outside the record in the usual sense of that phrase. 
    What I want to ask you is this, whether you and Attorney General would agree on whether or not in practice of -- practice that happens to be common, it was found that Negroes on the whole if they are summoned are more likely that they asked to be excused than white folks?

    Mr. Wiley A. Branton 
    I could not agree. 
    I rather -- I am rather of the opinion and it has been my experience that the few Negroes who have been called for jury service are so proud of the fact of having been called, that the percentage of persons asking to be excused is less than that of white persons.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1513.201" stopTime="1529.480">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    That maybe, if one gets going on this, that maybe because they are selected because they would (Inaudible) that may well be.
speaker="wiley_a_branton" startTime="1529.480" stopTime="1727.602">
    Mr. Wiley A. Branton 
    It is also interesting to note that in the selection of this jury panel, the jury commission is given the poll tax list and they select their names entirely from the poll tax list. 
    And under Arkansas law it is required that the race of the taxpayer be shown on that list so that therefore the very two which is being used by the jury commission has a racial designation and they therefore know in advance whether or not they are in fact selecting a white person or a colored person. 
    The three jury commissioners testified and the sum total of their testimony we think brings this case squarely in line with Cassell versus Texas. 
    We cite -- repeat some of that testimony on page 28 of our brief. 
    For example, in the footnotes there, in asking Mr. Truelock one of the commissioners a question, he said I felt that in the selection of a jury I could not take anybody that I didn't know, he might be a better qualified man that I would, but I still wouldn't know it. 
    I was limited to the number of people whom I was trying to select. 
    And in answer to a further questions as to whether or not he was personally familiar with very many Negroes in the county who might be qualified as jurors, his answer was, "I don't think I am sir." 
    And then down at the bottom, Mr. William stated that he had raise in mind when he selected the one or two Negroes whose names appeared on the panel. 
    We say that to select persons from a poll tax list that has a racial designation is pretty much the same situation that you had in Avery versus Georgia where they put the names of the white jurors on the white slips and the names of the Negro jurors on yellow slips. 
    Now we can't see where that situation is any different from where you go out and select the names in the first place from an official poll tax record that designates the taxpayer by race. 
    And we say that the whole of the petitioner's evidence in this case was uncontradicted and that his motion to quash the jury panel should therefore have been granted. 
    We'd like to move on to the confession which we contend was unlawfully obtained from the defendant. 
    There is some testimony which is in conflict as there always is in these cases, and therefore we do not intend to even mention the testimony which is in conflict. 
    The Court under the usual procedure which we follow in Arkansas first heard the testimony relating to the confession in Chambers. 
    And then overruled our motion to quash the confession on the grounds that it has been unlawfully obtained and we went then into the jury room and went over pretty much the same testimony before the jury.

    Mr. Wiley A. Branton 
    There were one or two cases, the first case that it was raised in was in Washington versus State of Arkansas which was immediately following the Wilkerson case where the petition was granted. 
    And the Court said in that particular case, that because of the fact that in the proceeding term of Court, the motion was granted and Negroes were put on the jury for the first time, that the petitioners could not come in and say that simply because of the fact that you only have so many in the next term of court that that showed a systematic inclusion or an arbitrary limiting of the numbers of Negro. 
    In other words, there had not been a sufficient pattern established. 
    And this is the only case to my knowledge to reach the State of Arkansas on this systematic inclusion where you've had a pattern over the years, of course the Supreme Court of Arkansas affirmed the lower court. 
    As to the confession the defendant took the stand on his own behalf and testified that he was 19 years old, that he was arrested while was at work about 10 or 11 o'clock on a Wednesday morning. 
    That he missed his regular noon meal because he has been arrested. 
    And that he was in the Chief of Police's office that afternoon when supper was being served and consequently other than getting his breakfast on Wednesday morning, he received no food on Wednesday. 
    That on Thursday morning he was awakened around 6 o'clock in the City Jail in Pine Bluff, required to remove his clothing and his shoes and socks, that he was then taken to Little Rock without any breakfast, and that he was taken to State Police Headquarters in Little Rock where he was given a lie detector test, and that he was given a sandwich around 1 p.m. on Thursday, and that that was the first food in the more than 26 hours that he -- since he had been arrested.

    The defendant was arrested on a Thursday morning without a warrant. 
    He was held in jail all day on Thursday through the noon hour without any food. 
    He was not given any supper on Thursday night or rather on Wednesday night the day of his arrest. 
    He was awakened at 6 o'clock on a Thursday morning and taken at least barefooted and with no socks to Little Rock without breakfast. 
    He was given a lie detector test up in Little Rock and questioned all day in Little Rock. 
    He was never arraigned, not even up until the day of his trial, the first time that any -- any question came up about arraignment was on the day of the trial. 
    Of course, at the day of the trial there was no point in worrying about arraignment at that time. 
    Arkansas law requires first of all that a person not be arrested without a warrant, unless there is probably reason for believing that the person being arrested has committed a felony. 
    Well even if they had probable reason for thinking that he had committed a felony, the law still requires that the person so arrested be taken forthwith before the nearest magistrate and properly informed of the charges placed against him and advised of his right to counsel. 
    This defendant was never arraigned and that is uncontradicted and is admitted to by the parties.

   Argument of Thorp Thomas

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Thomas.
speaker="thorp_thomas" startTime="2667.465" stopTime="2774.109">
    Mr. Thorp Thomas 
    May it please the Court. 
    The question in this case regarding the systematic exclusion is as I see it, did the petitioner here meet the burden of proof imposed on him by the rule announced in Patton against Mississippi, by showing a conscious and a purposeful and arbitrary discrimination of race in the selection of a petit jury. 
    Since they were members of the Negro race on the panel at which this petitioner was tried, then the burden of proof is on the petitioner to prove a conscious discrimination by the limiting of the number of Negroes on the panel. 
    Now this, the State of Arkansas contends that he has failed to do, taking the record and staying well within its bounds, on record 11 and 12, it's pertinent testimony of the jury commissioner Truelock, said the question, “Do you know very many Negroes who would be qualified for jury service?” 
    He answers, “I think so.” 
    Question “Do you think of any while you served on this panel?” 
    Answer “Well, there were quite a few that I certainly would have selected, but they had already served the past year or had some other reason why they could not.” 
    Also on --

    Mr. Thorp Thomas 
    He said they, and later on in his testimony he does explain that.

    I got to go to a dentist or I am sick or my wife is going to have a baby," and the judge is simply not going to make you come down.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Now, I can understand all that. 
    That was the four point of my question to your Brother.

    Mr. Thorp Thomas 
    Well, the -- the record is silent as to that. 
    But I will -- there is some testimony here between Mr. Branton and the trial judge regarding that particular point. 
    And it appears at 25 and 26 of the record. 
    About three-fourths of the way down on page 25. 
    The Court made this statement. 
    “You are testifying from the payroll that indicates that that is the number who have actually served on the jury. 
    Do you know that the jury commission has selected many other colored people who at their request the Court has excused and who did not serve?” 
    Mr. Branton answers, he said, “Are you asking me that?” 
    The court said, “I am asking you if you know that.” 
    Mr. Branton says, “All I know is that from time to time Negroes have been excused from jury service.” 
    And then the Court says if their names don't show on this list because they were excused, they don't draw or pay and Mr. Branton says that may be true.

    Mr. Thorp Thomas 
    It's -- it's certainly a fact that needed clarifying. 
    Now to give you an example of what I'm --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3037.280" stopTime="3043.453">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    I'm asking proof that there were any number -- any number of them, who were thus excused, is it?

    (Voice Overlap)
speaker="thorp_thomas" startTime="3046.040" stopTime="3156.431">
    Mr. Thorp Thomas 
    -- and that's Your Honors, precisely the point I'm making, that under the holding in the Patton against Mississippi, the burden since there were Negroes on this particular panel, the burden was not on the State to show how many Negroes it served or had not served. 
    The burden was on the petitioner and he did not meet that burden because he doesn't show how many were actually selected, he just merely shows how many actually served and was paid. 
    Now, to indicate my point a little further, you will notice that on page 25 of the petitioner's brief, on the October 1947 term. 
    It says the total number of jurors is 31 and the total number of Negroes two. 
    Well in this Washington against the State in the 213, Arkansas at 218, it involves a trial during this particular term, this October of 1947 term. 
    And here is what the Arkansas Court said speaking on the facts that the proof in this record shows that the three Negroes who were a member of the regular panel, petit jurors called in this case and then they list them (Inaudible), and they were numbered 7, 10 and 12. 
    Now then, if Mr. Branton's payroll record is correct, then he is minus one on that very proof alone. 
    In other words, we have a Supreme Court record of the March 1947, October term rather of 1947 in Jefferson County that shows that there were three Negroes. 
    Mr. Branton's record here merely shows two.

    Well, the delay of time, I don't think that Mr. Branton would deliberately fabricate his testimony, and I doubt that the judge did there either. 
    If I had been there I would probably agree to it, although what I'm saying here now, the burden was not on the State to prove how many were summoned, the burden was on the petitioner to show a conscious and deliberate discrimination and he has failed to do it. 
    For example, and I think to show --

    Did you -- did you mean if Arkansas had shown there had been only one colored man in 15 years, the burden would be on the -- shall remain on the county?

    There are some breaking points. 
    Now, I noticed in the cases like Hill against Texas, in Patton against Mississippi, there it had been a great lapse of time in all of those cases where there had been no Negro to serve on the juries, now here in this case on the payroll evidence alone it indicates that they were including Negroes.

    May I ask you one question about the -- those who were excused, I noticed because that figure is probably the same (Inaudible) 
    As I understand it, what you say is that the jury (Inaudible) maybe a week, they can't do this two weeks before that time, frequently some of them will call up the judge or the clerk, get excused before they come to court.

    Mr. Thorp Thomas 
    Now, I believe Mr. Justice Brennan asked this question too about an Arkansas statute in regard to how the jurors are paid, and that is that Arkansas statutes 39, 301.1 and it reads thusly, “Person whose names appear on any legal and authorized grand jury or petit jury list of the respective counties of Arkansas, shall receive in addition to other fees allowed down blow other than under authority of another Act, A, when such person or a person failed for any reason to attend court, none.

    And the commissioner answered, "Well, I don't know that we made anything special of that.

    Mr. Thorp Thomas 
    No, Your Honor, I do not. 
    Now, to get back to the minds of these jury commissioners, where to me the whole answer to this problem lies is to the -- it was the burden on the petitioner to show this conscious discrimination. 
    Now, here is what one of the commissioner, this was Truelock. 
    “So, do you recall whether or not the names of other 12? 
    Do you recall whether or not the names of any other Negroes were mentioned to the panel?” 
    Answer “Any others, yes, sir, other than the ones that were selected, the answer is yes, sir.” 
    Question “How did you arrive at the selection of those that were selected? 
    Did you decide you wanted so many on there?” 
    Meaning so many Negroes on there, presumably to -- as the way the question was loaded, presumably to comply with the law or just barely comply, and his answer was, “No, we just go down the list and here is the man. 
    We discussed to him what he would do or would not do, will it be possible to serve or was he too old. 
    What was his work and just those things, in fact it is a very difficult operation to get a jury and we were coming to get anybody we thought could serve.” 
    Now that is completely barren of any inference that they wanted to get anything other than a representative jury. 
    And his --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="3637.603" stopTime="3707.303">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    May I -- may I ask you this question. 
    What inference do you think is allowed if any inference is allowed from the fact that in a county in which the population between colored and -- white and colored is about half and half, as it is in this county and the process by which jurors get on panels runs over a course of years from 30 to 60, as to white and never more than six, only one as I noticed it, runs from zero to normally two, what inference is allowable that there is not operating an individualized judgment each year for some predisposition in the selection of people which already makes a classification that they want more whites than of colored?

    Mr. Thorp Thomas 
    Yes. 
    There are always -- a list is always available and then of course if something like this is coming up then they can't summon. 
    But I think possibly that this case stands pretty much in the same situation, that United States against Brant in the Northern District of Ohio which was a 1955 case, 139 F. Supp. where we are making the same claim as they are making here that Negroes as a class were excluded from jury service. 
    However, in the Brant case the record was clear that throughout the years covered by the evidence colored persons were represented on the jury list and actually served as jurors in the cases and that's the same thing that we have here. 
    The Court said to sustain this claim. 
    Defendant's relied in part on the fact that no member of the indicting grand jury was a Negro that their contention that this evidence -- that this is evidence of discrimination is void of merit, because it's well settled and an accused person is not entitled to have a jury composed and in part of persons who are members of the his own race nor is anyone entitled to that. 
    And then they cite the Martin against Texas in 200 US and Akins against Texas in 325 U.S. 
    Now to -- I think that the Akins case is probably the complete answer to this one. 
    And the language of this Court in that case is that petitioner's sole objection to the grand jury is that the commissioners deliberately and intentionally and purposefully limited number of the Negro race that should be selected on same said -- grand jury panel to one member. 
    Now, that's what he is saying here that that we are systematic -- we have systematic inclusion rather than systematic exclusion. 
    And this Court said fairness in selection has never been held to require proportional representation of races upon the jury citing Virginia against Rives and Thomas against Texas.

    Probably wouldn't. 
    I'd like to briefly discuss the petitioner's confessions. 
    I believe Mr. Justice Frankfurter said to -- set out the grounds that -- believed that it was coerced. 
    Well, the petitioner's grounds, he alleges one that he was mentally retarded, that he was arrested without a warrant, that he was interrogated constantly, that he was deprived food, threatened by mobs and that he was held incommunicado and that the Chief of Police had threatened to arrest all the members of his family if he didn't confess. 
    Now, if all these things were true then I would not hesitate to tell this Court they should reverse it because in my mind it would coercion. 
    But the only thing that I know to do in explaining these things is go to the record and see what the testimony is. 
    And Mr. Branton -- I believe all of the facts as he gave them was based on the testimony of the petitioner and since he was on trial for his life he might be excused some latitude in his testimony. 
    Now, to go to the --

    And he said, “I said there could possibly be that many and there possibly would be.”

    And the petitioner gets in the phrase to get -- to get into me, he concludes that act referring not only what Chief Norman Young said there, but also what the officer down at Dumas said.

    Well, has that been disputed by you here? 
    He would try to keep them out, has that been -- has that been disputed by you?

    Justice William O. Douglas 
    In your brief on page 11 counsel of your brief a few lines from the bottom of the page. 
    You state it as apparently what Chief Young meant was there would be other people there to witness the confession. 
    Now, where is that?
speaker="thorp_thomas" startTime="5940.664" stopTime="5956.891">
    Mr. Thorp Thomas 
    That is what I get out from page 69 because when you come on down and read in context without taking it out of context. 
    If you take it out of context, it looks -- you don't know. 
    But, if you go on down close to the bottom of -- that's the --
speaker="william_o_douglas" startTime="5956.891" stopTime="5967.250">
    Justice William O. Douglas 
    But the thing that's wrong with that is that when somebody did knock on the door to want to come in, he wouldn't let anybody in, even though he was the Sheriff to witness the confession.
speaker="thorp_thomas" startTime="5967.250" stopTime="5983.092">
    Mr. Thorp Thomas 
    That's true, he -- he had -- he -- in his testimony, the Sheriff said, I had promised Frank, the petitioner, that he could make this confession to me in private and he kept his promise and he wouldn't let anyone else in, he testified until he got Frank's permission.
speaker="william_o_douglas" startTime="5983.092" stopTime="5989.471">
    Justice William O. Douglas 
    So that -- that all adds up against what you say in the bottom of page 11 as to the reason that he -- he would.
speaker="thorp_thomas" startTime="5989.471" stopTime="6041.794">
    Mr. Thorp Thomas 
    I don't think so if you read it in context. 
    On 69, right after he says, “I said it was possible.” 
    “Did you go downstairs to your office?” 
    “Yes.” 
    “Was his confession interrupted?” 
    Says, “It was by a knock on the door,” and he went to the door, he said the then Sheriff and a State Trooper were at the door. 
    “Did you permit them to come in?” 
    "I did not.” 
    “Did you tell them anything about the defendant?” 
    He said, “I told them that he was making an oral confession.” 
    And said then, “Did he complete his confession roughly, then what you do?” 
    “I asked him if he would mind the Sheriff and Sergeant Halsell to come in.” 
    “How much later was that?” 
    He says, “Not more than five minutes.” 
    Question “Then, did the other people come in?” 
    Connect it back up here, there would be 30 or 40 there, reading it directly in context.

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    So what you have here, I wish you'd state whether or not you think that shows the confession was coerced or not.
speaker="thorp_thomas" startTime="6050.715" stopTime="6051.368">
    Mr. Thorp Thomas 
    I do not.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="6051.368" stopTime="6080.584">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Well, let me ask a question. 
    You have undisputed testimony to this effect, no witnesses deny it. 
    Chief Norman Young said 30 or 40 people were outside waiting to get in to me, and he asked me if I wanted to make a confession, he would try to keep them out. 
    And nobody has denied that. 
    In your judgment, if that is true, was this a free and voluntary confession?
speaker="thorp_thomas" startTime="6080.584" stopTime="6081.956">
    Mr. Thorp Thomas 
    I think it was.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="6081.956" stopTime="6082.389">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Even with that statement?
speaker="thorp_thomas" startTime="6082.389" stopTime="6083.591">
    Mr. Thorp Thomas 
    For -- for this reason.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="6083.591" stopTime="6085.685">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Even with that statement made?
speaker="thorp_thomas" startTime="6085.685" stopTime="6102.505">
    Mr. Thorp Thomas 
    I don't think possibly the statement as you put it was not denied as such, but during Chief Young's testimony, he explained it in a different way, I mean answered the questions in a different way where you could possibly draw any inference you want to, you --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="6102.505" stopTime="6115.059">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    He made no statement on (Inaudible) about whether this man -- whether 30 or 40 people there, the statement was true, that he had told this young fellow that there were 30 to 40 people out there waiting to get him.
speaker="thorp_thomas" startTime="6115.059" stopTime="6139.050">
    Mr. Thorp Thomas 
    But the reason that I think that it wasn't coerced is his subsequent demeanor after that. 
    That is shown by the testimony of the court reporter and the other witnesses to the effect that, well, a few minutes later, here he is testifying, and he was watching the court reporter to takes the notes in shorthand, and he is very careful not to talk too fast, so she'll get everything down that he is saying.

    (Inaudible)
speaker="thorp_thomas" startTime="6139.271" stopTime="6147.354">
    Mr. Thorp Thomas 
    And he shows no outward signs of fear, and that would lead me to believe that there is just no substance to --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="6147.354" stopTime="6147.687">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    But you do have --
speaker="thorp_thomas" startTime="6147.687" stopTime="6148.730">

    -- the argument of a coerced confession.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="6148.730" stopTime="6162.754">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    But you do have to defend it, do you not, on the basis that this undisputed testimony in the record. 
    The Chief of Police told him five minutes before the confession, you got to go ahead and talk to the 30 or 40 out there waiting to get you.
speaker="thorp_thomas" startTime="6162.754" stopTime="6164.856">
    Mr. Thorp Thomas 
    Well, it depends on whose testimony you're going to believe, the Chief of Police --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="6164.856" stopTime="6167.233">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Well, who denies it?

    Mr. Thorp Thomas 
    They didn't deny it as such.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Thomas before you sit down, what have you got to say about the proof, the lack of proof? 
    Now as I understood Mr. Branton, as I understand the briefs, this man was arrested at about 10 o'clock Wednesday morning. 
    He was given no food on Wednesday, he was given the sandwich, I think, your witnesses say two sandwiches on -- at noon on Thursday, and then nothing more to eat until after he -- after he confessed on Friday afternoon. 
    Now, what do you have to say about that?

    Mr. Thorp Thomas 
    There is no testimony in the record on behalf of the State that shows whether he was fed or not.

    -- when -- that was after he had completed the lie detector test, and was turned back over to the police officer. 
    They fed him and returned him to Pine Bluff, where he was placed in jail for the remainder of the night, which would indicate to me that he was there at the time that the food was served. 
    Certainly he was there the next morning, because he wasn't taken out of that cell until he wanted to confess at approximately 1 o'clock on Friday.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Yes. 
    Well now do you not -- do you not think that a 19-year-old man, whatever you want to call him or a boy, whichever it is, who was thrown into jail and held for 26 hours, without any food, and then is given one or two sandwiches. 
    And then this questions off and on for another 26 hours or so before he's given any more food. 
    And half of the time without even any shoes on, dragged around the country.

    Yes, but as I read the record, your own witnesses said that his shoes were taken from him about 6:30 in the morning and then they took him to Little Rock and they gave him some shoes about 4:30 in the afternoon.

    Mr. Thorp Thomas 
    Well, he said he had two sandwiches and the coke and a candy bar and some peanuts and testified that Sergeant Halsell, although he had had breakfast, now this was in Dumas that morning in jail, Sergeant Halsell, he told him he was still hungry and he stopped outside of Dumas and bought him ham and eggs and milk.

    Well then, that's the reason why I -- I asked you whether there isn't more than just the one point, you say the only issue in the case, as you see it is what the Sherriff is supposed to have told him just beforehand. 
    But you don't attach any significance to the fact that this young was kept in jail and questioned and night and day at various times, I don't say continuously, and that he was given no food, except one or two sandwiches over a period of more than two day.

   Rebuttal of Wiley A. Branton
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="6882.179" stopTime="6887.664">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Branton, you may -- you may finish if you wish (Inaudible) want to come back tomorrow.
speaker="wiley_a_branton" startTime="6887.664" stopTime="7035.332">
    Mr. Wiley A. Branton 
    May it please the Court. 
    I noticed that there has been considerable questioning back and forth as to what the Chief of Police meant about whether or not there were 30 or 40 people downstairs just prior to the confession. 
    I wish to point out to the Court that on bottom of page 113 on cross-examination of the Chief of Police by myself, I specifically asked him this question, “State whether or not anything was said to the defendant to the effect that there would be 30 or 40 people there in a few minutes that wanted to get him? 
    His answer was, “I told him that would be possible, that would be that many. 
    It was possible there could be that many.” 
    I think that clears up what the Chief of Police meant because certainly the question was, “Did you tell him that there'd be that many people there to get him.” 
    Now the State contends what he meant was, there'd be 30 or 40 people there to witness the confession. 
    And certainly to use the language to get him, it can't mean but one thing namely just what it implied that there would be possible mob violence. 
    The defendant specifically repudiates his confession on page 94. 
    It does not appear in the transcript of record printed here as to the defense on the merits for the simple reason that the only part of the record here is that part designated by the petitioner. 
    Naturally, the petitioner was only going to designate that part that this Court would consider on certiorari, we didn't feel that we should make our state's case, they failed to cross designate, it's not here. 
    The defendant took the witness stand on his own behalf admitted to the slaying, but states that he was working there, that he and his employer got into a very heated argument that the employer slapped him and that he reached down, passed an iron bar, and that he jumped over this counter, that they fought over, he got it away from him and beat him with an iron bar and when he realized what he had done that his first thought was to get away and the man was there checking up and he took some money. 
    Now it should be remembered that this defendant was not charged with a crime of murder in the first degree while in the perpetration of a felony, because the State would have had -- would have had an easier case in the Arkansas law, no premeditation being required. 
    Now, they're trying to imply here that he was charged with robbing the man. 
    But he wasn't even charged with that. 
    It's true that he had 400 some odd dollars but he was never charged with a slaying while the perpetration of a felony. 
    And that is significant.

    Justice Charles E. Whittaker 
    Did that testimony (Inaudible) $400 from the deceased?

speaker="charles_e_whittaker" startTime="7063.877" stopTime="7074.103">
    Justice Charles E. Whittaker 
    Well, did you object to the inference that the $400 of the deceased money was found in the home of the deceased --
speaker="wiley_a_branton" startTime="7074.103" stopTime="7074.393">
    Mr. Wiley A. Branton 
    We objected --
speaker="charles_e_whittaker" startTime="7074.393" stopTime="7075.489">
    Justice Charles E. Whittaker 
    -- of the petitioner.
speaker="wiley_a_branton" startTime="7075.489" stopTime="7350.430">
    Mr. Wiley A. Branton 
    We objected to the testimony of Sergent Halsell who first testified, yes, sir we did. 
    But if -- if you have reference to the objection of the possible commission of other crimes insofar as that angle is concerned we did not raise that as a legal question. 
    As to that payroll record, the payroll record is -- the payroll record accurately reflects the actual number of persons who served on the jury in Jefferson County. 
    And therefore in answer to a question as to the number of Negroes who served the preceding year, one commissioner said that he couldn't use all of those who had been used a year before. 
    The record shows that only two or perhaps four had been used a year before. 
    Anybody who had been excused would not be on the payroll record and therefore could be used on the next panel. 
    The testimony as to that payroll record is uncontradicted. 
    The State says if we don't know how to add and that the total number there is 640, we still get 669. 
    We attempted to put the sheriff on the stand, the record, the permanent record is kept not in the Sheriff's office, but in the office of the circuit clerk the same person who said he had no such record. 
    And the Court didn't even want us to burden the trial because after all we had been in court for half a day and if you take longer than two days in Arkansas to electrocute a Negro, why then, you have an unusually long trial. 
    So we wound up in two days. 
    And the Court didn't want this trial delayed and suggested that I get on the stand and testify. 
    Now we submit that after having been invited to make this testimony and certainly we have the burden, then the burden of rebutting that presumption which we had raised was on the State and they offered no testimony whatsoever to rebut the evidence which we had offered. 
    As to whether or not there were more Negroes excused from jury service as compared with white, the record is silent. 
    As I say, we'd have go outside the record but certainly the percentage of Negroes who served would be even more disparaging if we used the accurate record rather than the payroll record. 
    And even if that was not true there is nothing here that the State says that people get excused for two things, having made this, and this, that and the other. 
    And I don't think that this Court can take any judicial knowledge of the fact or be presumptuous enough to say that Negroes have any more (Inaudible) than white people, that therefore a greater percentage of Negroes would asked to be excused than would white. 
    And as to the inference that might be raised by such a situation as you have in Jefferson County with such a small number of people, being -- Negroes being called for jury service over a long period of time. 
    This Court said, in another decision coming out of Texas that it should tax the credulity of the Court, to say that mere chance resulted in such few Negroes being called for jury service in a county, where you have such a high percentage of Negroes making up the population and a high percentage of qualified voters. 
    Another question was directed to the Attorney General as to whether or not in Jefferson County you would find an unusually high percentage of illiterate colored people in that county. 
    Now I've lived in that county all in my life. 
    Insofar as Negroes are concerned, Jefferson County is the leading cultural and educational county of the State of Arkansas for Negroes. 
    It is the home of the Arkansas State College for Negroes. 
    It is the home of (Inaudible) Institute for Negroes. 
    For many, many years the Negro High School has been accredited by the North Central Association. 
    And I dare say that percentage wise there is a greater percentage of literate Negroes in Jefferson County than any other county in the State of Arkansas, and that the literacy qualifications of Negroes is probably equal to or superior percentage wise than the literacy test of white people in that county because there is not a single white college within that county. 
    And certainly anytime that you have a county where you've had a college down through the years, there generally is a higher literacy portion in that particular county than you have in a county where you do not have a college.
