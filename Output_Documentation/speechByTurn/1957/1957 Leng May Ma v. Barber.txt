    Mr. Joseph S. Hertogs 
    Mr. Chief Justice, Associate Justices of the Supreme Court, may it please the Court. 
    We are here today, seeking reversal of a judgment entered in the District Court and affirmed in the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. 
    The petitioner in the instant case was born in China in about 1938. 
    Some time prior to the Communist invasion, she and other members of the family moved to Hong Kong and took up residence in Hong Kong. 
    In 1951, when she was 12 and a half years of age, her father submitted in her behalf an application for documentation with the American Consulate General at Hong Kong. 
    American Consulate General issued documentation in the case and the girl proceeded to the port of entry of San Francisco, California. 
    Subsequent to the time of her arrival in 1951, the Immigration and Naturalization Service determined that she had failed to reasonably establish her claimed relationship to her citizen father and therefore, her claim to United States nationality. 
    As a result, they ordered her excluded and deported from the United States as an alien, not in possession of a proper immigration visa authorizing her admission for permanent residence.

    Unknown Speaker 
    How old she was?
speaker="joseph_s_hertogs" startTime="112.202" stopTime="283.730">
    Mr. Joseph S. Hertogs 
    She was 12 and a half years of age at the time of her arrival. 
    During the interim, prosecution had taken place. 
    The Government in the prosecution contended that the parents and one other member of the family had committed perjury in a primary and preliminary statements made to officials of the Immigration and Naturalization Service. 
    Those members of the family were indicted and they were acquitted.However, during the interim, they saw fit to parole her into the United States. 
    As a result, the proceedings in the instant case were not concluded for a considerable period of time. 
    The ultimate decision of the Board of Immigration Appeals was not arrived at until 1953. 
    In the early part of 1954, the petitioner received a notice to surrender for deportation to Communist China. 
    And merely after following such notification, there was filed in her behalf with the District Director of the Immigration and Naturalization Service who is the respondent in the instant proceeding, an application for a stay or deportation on the grounds of physical persecution. 
    Such application was filed, presumed to regulations and in effect. 
    It was contended in that petition that this -- this petitioner would suffer physical persecution, probable death and at least would be required to adhere to predispose to which she did not believe. 
    The Immigration Service refused to accept such application, stating that she was not a person eligible for that relief, that merely following notification of that decision, a petition for a writ of habeas corpus was filed in the United States District Court of San Francisco. 
    The Court, in its decision, reached a conclusion that the pleadings did not state facts sufficient to warrant the issue -- issuance of a writ of habeas corpus. 
    The Circuit Court of the Ninth Circuit affirmed it. 
    And I might state that at no time was the petitioner ever given a hearing. 
    That no time was an order to show cause ever issued by the District Court. 
    No hearing was ever held. 
    Therefore, the only thing which we have before this Court are the pleadings on a petition for writ of habeas corpus. 
    The similar question was presented to other -- two other Circuits. 
    The Second Circuit held similar to the Ninth Circuit that persons excluded from admission to the United States were not persons within the United States, within the statutory language of Section 243 (h) of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952.

speaker="joseph_s_hertogs" startTime="613.345" stopTime="709.192">
    Mr. Joseph S. Hertogs 
    I was going to come to that, Your Honor. 
    There's a difference of positions between counsel in the following case and myself without -- with that regard. 
    I think that there are four points in this case. 
    One is the human rights, whether any humanitarian consideration will be given to deportation of any alien to a communist dominated country where they -- they are likely to suffer physical persecution. 
    The other three points are all one of statutory construction of the provisions of the Act. 
    There are three questions involved in the statutory construction problem. 
    The first is what is the meaning of deportation? 
    Secondly, what is the meaning of the phrase, “any alien” as used in Section 243 (h), the Section under which the application was filed. 
    The third question is what is the meaning of, “within the United States,” as used in the same section of law? 
    I only passed over lightly the first one because I think we can reach a decision -- the Court can reach a decision on the statutory construction angle. 
    However, I believe that as Mr. Justice Frankfurter stated, “If a person were detained and they were to be deported to a Communist country and all of the evidence and it could be clearly established that they would suffer physical persecution and probable death.” 
    I don't think the Courts were -- are without power to interfere to the administrative discretion.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="709.192" stopTime="721.519">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    What you are saying I think is that in a proper case, you --you would have this Court to recognize the constitutional right of exile?

    Mr. Joseph S. Hertogs 
    That is correct, Your Honor.

    What country would this -- would this petitioner be returned?
speaker="joseph_s_hertogs" startTime="729.625" stopTime="751.275">
    Mr. Joseph S. Hertogs 
    She would -- there's no question about where she was to be returned. 
    It was admitted and it's submitted in the pleadings that she was to be returned to Communist China. 
    She was to be taken by boat to Hong Kong. 
    She had a transit -- they had obtained a transit visa through Hong Kong. 
    She was to be placed on the train, taken up to the border and physically put over the border in the Communist China.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="751.275" stopTime="755.146">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well, wouldn't the Hong Kong -- doesn't the Hong Kong authorities have a say about that?
speaker="joseph_s_hertogs" startTime="755.146" stopTime="845.317">
    Mr. Joseph S. Hertogs 
    They have issued a transit visa and a transit visa only. 
    I am going to come to that particular question afterwards because I think it is one involved in the statutory construction, because this petitioner came from Hong Kong. 
    It is true that she is a native and citizen of China, but she came to the United States from Hong Kong and the excluding provisions, the law relating to exclusion says that they shall be immediately deported back to the place from whence they came. 
    That is not what they -- is occurring in this particular case. 
    It is a contention of the Government that she is deportable from the United States as an excluded and deportable alien. 
    Now, the Section relating to that particular Section, which was in effect at the time that she arrived was Section 18 of the Act of 1917. 
    That Act itself said they shall be immediately deported to the place from whence they came. 
    Now, the Court of Appeals in the Ng Weng Cheong case that was at the Court of Appeals in the District of Columbia held that where there was no immediate deportation, that the person have to be deported under Section 20 of the same Act. 
    That is the Act of 1917. 
    Now, the act of that Act provided that they could not only be deported from the place from whence they came, but to the place of the nationality, to a country in close proximity thereto or to any other country of a choice if that country would accept him.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="845.317" stopTime="866.387">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Just be noted that I may have no doubt about it.

    Mr. Joseph S. Hertogs 
    Yes. 
    I -- that's only on the Immigration Service decision because that same Section provides that the carrier shall take the individual back to the same port and that the carrier shall be liable for the expenses.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="930.023" stopTime="933.014">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    And the carrier here was a fellow -- the carrier from Hong Kong.
speaker="joseph_s_hertogs" startTime="933.014" stopTime="1106.410">
    Mr. Joseph S. Hertogs 
    That is correct, Your Honor. 
    Now, one of the things which is causing confusion in the instant case is the fact that we had two sections of law and the fact that the time of arrival of this applicant in 1951, at the time of the conclusion of the final decision of the administrative agency, the Immigration and Nationality Act in 1952 had been passed. 
    There are two similar sections contained in the new Act, Section 237 and Section 243. 
    However, in Section 243, that is the one relating to certain types of classes of aliens and it is the contention of counsel for the respondent. 
    At Section 237, the one relating to exclusion and deportation of aliens is the one which is applicable in the instant case. 
    Now, Section 237 states in itself. 
    It refers to a person who has been excluded under this Act. 
    By this Act, they're referring to the Act of 1952. 
    This girl was not excluded under the 1952 Act. 
    She was excluded under the provisions of the Act of the -- of 1917. 
    We also have and giving consideration to that argument, the savings clause which this Court has previously construed as being very broad and it preserves any rights, status, conditions or anything in the process at the time of enactment of the new legislation. 
    Now, Section 243 states that a person shall be deported whether pursuant to this Act or any other Act or treaty. 
    Now, since Section 237 refers to only deportation under this Act, that is the 1952 Act, she is not deportable from United States under that Section. 
    She is deportable under Section 243 (h), the Section that provides for the deportation of persons under the 1952 Act or any other Act or treaty. 
    It is very important because we are seeking here relief under Section 243 (h), yet, the Immigration Service and the courts below contend that she is not an alien eligible for that relief. 
    They are holding that even though she maybe deportable from the United States under Section 243 (a), she is not entitled to relief under a subsection of the same section of law.

    In this particular case, the decision below rest upon interpretation of the phrase within the United States as it is contained in Section 243 (h) of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952. 
    The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit stated that this alien is not a person within the United States as contemplated in a congressional legislation.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    I don't -- I'm not sure I follow you.

    Mr. Joseph S. Hertogs 
    That is -- I might be here for statutory construction, Your Honor, of the Section. 
    However, a person who is going to return to a country such as Hong Kong certainly could not contend that they would be subject to physical persecution and file an application for the relief as provided by that section of law.

    Mr. Joseph S. Hertogs 
    The Government was paying for it in this particular case. 
    Now, getting to the phrase within the United States, I would like to cover that before my time expires. 
    A lot of the argument will be covered by counsel representing the following case. 
    However, I would like to comment contrary to the decision of the Court of Appeals, I feel that within the United States applies in the instant case. 
    Now, relating to Section 262 of the same Act. 
    It states that any alien in the United States must comply with the Alien Registration Provisions and it uses the word “in”. 
    In Section 265 of the same Act, it provides that any alien within the United States must file an Alien Address Report Card in the month of January of each year. 
    Now, the Immigration and Naturalization Service admit that a person paroled in the United States is a person required to comply with the Alien Registration Provision and is a person required to file an Alien Address Report Card in the month of January of each year. 
    In addition, when Congress passed this enactment in 300 -- Section 360, it provided that a person, any alien in the United States who've made a claim of United States citizenship could file a declaratory judgment suit in the United States District Court where they claimed permanent residence, except an alien excluded from United States. 
    Now, they said, “Any alien within the United States, except an excluded alien.” 
    Now, it would not be necessary to put the phraseology except and exclude alien into that piece of legislation, unless an excluded alien was an individual who was within the United States.

   Argument of Leonard B. Sand
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1700.322" stopTime="1703.528">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Sand.
speaker="leonard_b_sand" startTime="1703.528" stopTime="1794.751">
    Mr. Leonard B. Sand 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    I would like to state at the outset that the issue which is now before this Court, which wholly want a statutory construction is whether the Attorney General has any power to act under a certain provision of the Immigration and Nationalization Act of 1952, which speaks of withholding deportation of any alien within the United States. 
    The question is whether he has any power to act under that particular Section of the statute. 
    There is presented in this case no question as to the validity of the orders excluding these aliens from the United States. 
    Some reference is made to the fact that there was no hearing in this case and I want to make clear that the counsel for petitioner there refers to the fact that there was no hearing held on the application under 243 (h), because the Attorney General took the view that he had no power to act under that statute. 
    There was of course a hearing on the earlier question of excludability of this alien and there is no question as to the validity of the orders which have excluded the alien in this case and in the succeeding case.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1794.751" stopTime="1824.869">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    You -- are you saying that there is outstanding an in -- an uncontested legally valid order of deportation, that the Attorney General out of the goodness of his heart can't say, “Oh well, this is a hard case.I'll give relief,” but he has no power to do that, but the Congress in 243 has given him power under certain circumstances that you find conditionally and that as a matter of law. 
    He has ruled that this case doesn't come within those conditions.
speaker="leonard_b_sand" startTime="1824.869" stopTime="1918.479">
    Mr. Leonard B. Sand 
    Yes, I'm saying -- I'm saying almost that. 
    I'm saying that the Attorney General has said, that with respect to an alien who has been excluded from the United States albeit released on parole, there is no power to act under this particular Section of the statute. 
    Now, the Court will recall that on the motion of the Solicitor General, this case was held in advance, because the Solicitor General was of the view that there was power elsewhere in the statute, under which the Attorney General might grant parole, might continue parole, might continue the physical presence of the alien in this country. 
    And that in considering whether to exercise the discretion given in that other Section of the statute, which is 212 (d) (5) and which appears at page 3 of the Government's brief, a relevant consideration would be whether the alien would be subject to physical persecution. 
    In other words, the question now before this Court, is not whether Congress has anywhere given the Attorney General power to act with respect to a claim of physical persecution by an excluded alien, but whether he has given -- whether Congress has given the Attorney General power to so act under Section 243 (h).
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1918.479" stopTime="1925.365">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Well, that -- I haven't -- you haven't made clear to me at least why -- why he couldn't act under Section 212 (d)?
speaker="leonard_b_sand" startTime="1925.365" stopTime="2021.232">
    Mr. Leonard B. Sand 
    He could and in fact what has -- what has occurred is that while the case was pending in this Court, applications were made for relief by petitioner in this case and respondents in the succeeding case for relief under to 212 (d) (5). 
    Those applications have been denied by the Attorney General, acting through his delegate in the Immigration Service on the grounds among others that the petitioner failed to establish to the satisfaction of the service that she'd be subject to physical persecution in the country to which she was being sent. 
    Now, the action under 212 (d) (5) is not now before this Court and I make reference to it, simply to emphasize again that the question is not whether there is any power in the Attorney General to act with respect to such a claim on the part of an excluded alien. 
    The question is whether that power is contained in 212 (d) (5). 
    We agree that it is, whether it is also contained in 243 (h). 
    The Attorney General has taken the view that it does not -- that the explicit phrase “deportation of any alien within the United States,” indicates that that provision has reference only to aliens who in legal contemplation, as well as in fact all within the United States.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2021.232" stopTime="2033.542">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Is that the only difference between 212 -- 212 (d) and -- and 243, namely that 212 isn't restricted by whatever within the United States may mean, whereas 243 is?
speaker="leonard_b_sand" startTime="2033.542" stopTime="2070.025">
    Mr. Leonard B. Sand 
    That -- that is the basis for the -- for the distinction with respect to this relief, because 212 (d) (5) talks of parole into the United States and talks of applicants for admission to the United States. 
    So clearly, the relief within in that Section maybe accorded to -- to one who is at the gates, whereas 243 (h) which talks of any alien within the United States has reference. 
    The Government submits to aliens who are legally within the United States who were subject to deportation rather than exclusion.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2070.025" stopTime="2094.081">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Did I understand you to say that the application with 212 (d) was rejected, because as a matter of -- on a finding of fact by the Attorney General, by the immigration federal, by the authorized officials, it was with the suggestion that she would be returned to a physically dangerous country which found (Inaudible) is that right?

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Well, not the same -- if that -- if that would be an allowable finding of fact, why are we not discussing an abstract case here, in fact that would equally buy him from exercising power under 243 (h)?

    The Attorney General has been given under two sections with the important difference that you indicate, restricted within the other issue, this compassionate power, this power of -- of relief in human situations. 
    And I have no doubt that that's ought to be exercised with the appropriate anxiety with which such a power should be exercised, such a power of mercy. 
    And it troubles me to say that it was found unavailable under 212, because she hasn't made out this danger, but maybe, she can make it out under 243.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Sand, is it the position of the Government that -- if this Court should decide the case in favor of petitioner that that would adversely affect the Immigration Service?

    Mr. Leonard B. Sand 
    Is it -- yes. 
    Well, Mr. Chief Justice, that -- that -- I think that what petitioner in this case is basically attacking is the concept of parole. 
    I think that -- that the -- the only Court which is held at 243 (h) is applicable here, which is the District of -- the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, held that the alien was within the United States by virtue of the parole. 
    Now, as -- as counsel for petitioner stated in response to a question by Mr. Justice Frankfurter, the concept of parole is -- is a longstanding one, which long antedates this statute and that it has been held by this Court in such cases, this Kaplan against Tod in 1925. 
    That parole did not bring the alien within the United States in -- in contemplation of law, so that -- so that what this case comes down to is whether the fact that the alien has been granted parole, will change her immigration status, so as to bring her within a different area of operation of the immigration statutes. 
    And that is a concept which we submit is hostile to the basic notion of parole and which will in the long run, not only operate to the judgment of the service, but -- but to the detriment of the alien as well.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2472.894" stopTime="2502.382">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Well, that -- that is the point. 
    The Immigration Service isn't -- we're not here concerned, at least I'm not whether something will help or harm some notions of the Immigration Service. 
    In the first place, there are specific immigration statutes which it is our duty to apply and enforce whether we like them or not. 
    In the second place, there's a long tradition of construction of words -- terms of art in the immigration laws. 
    And the third place, the one you've just indicated --

    Yes.

    -- that leads to a very serious thing to make a ruling and to be asked to make a ruling, the upshot of which will be, people won't be led out of the detention place, the places of detention, because it will then be suggested they're within the United States, so that a particular case that may appeal to our emotion maybe of a greatest disservice to aliens coming into this country.
speaker="leonard_b_sand" startTime="2524.060" stopTime="2546.566">
    Mr. Leonard B. Sand 
    Well, I think, I think that the -- that the whole thrust of the argument which is advanced on behalf of the aliens in this case is that -- is hostile, as I've stated, to this -- to the concept of parole, because it would seek to attach to parole the consequences of changing the immigration status.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2546.566" stopTime="2548.830">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Well, they won't parole them a year after.
speaker="leonard_b_sand" startTime="2548.830" stopTime="2630.866">
    Mr. Leonard B. Sand 
    It -- certainly, it would have to be a factor in determining whether or not to parole an alien, what consequences that would have on the status of the alien and -- and the whole -- we -- we're dealing here with the legal fiction, the legal fiction being that an excluded alien paroled in the United States is not in the eyes of the law within the United States. 
    Now, I don't think legal fiction is a term of disparagement. 
    It indicates, this is a concept which was invoked to serve a purpose and in determining whether or not, one looks to the physical fact that the alien is physically in the country, or to the legal fact. 
    One has to refer back to this purpose for which this legal fiction was created. 
    And it's perfectly clear from the history of the immigration statutes and from the cases decided by this Court such, as Kaplan against Tod that the purpose was to permit the alien to enjoy the greater liberty and freedom which parole offers without altering the immigration status. 
    And that is the concept which Congress explicitly recognized in the Immigration Act of 1952.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2630.866" stopTime="2649.870">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    You call that a legal fiction. 
    This -- this Court had at the beginning long before the parole problem (Inaudible) and it has very serious consequences in the kind of rights to be accorded to a fellow who is waiting to be -- waiting at (Inaudible) to have the authority to decide whether she'd be let in or not --
speaker="leonard_b_sand" startTime="2649.870" stopTime="2650.048">
    Mr. Leonard B. Sand 
    Well --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2650.048" stopTime="2659.462">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    -- the -- the whole line of cases from Ju Toy. 
    The difference between incoming and resident aliens, the whole structure of the immigration law is based on that.
speaker="leonard_b_sand" startTime="2659.462" stopTime="2767.069">
    Mr. Leonard B. Sand 
    Well, that's -- that's correct, Mr. Justice Frankfurter. 
    The Nishimura Ekiu against United States in 1892 held that an alien in the detention center was not legally within the United States. 
    And then -- then, as Mr. Justice Holmes said in Kaplan against Tod, the prison bounds were expanded. 
    The alien was permitted to -- to enjoy parole, but legally, she was regarded as still being on the vessel which brought her to the -- to the United States. 
    And this was a concept, which was to the benefit of the alien. 
    This is the concept, which permitted the alien not to be forced to remain physically on the vessel, not to be forced to be -- to remain in the detention center. 
    Since November 1954, it has been the policy of the Attorney General, through the Immigration Service to grant parole as to all aliens, except those thought likely to abscond and -- and security risks. 
    And as the Court -- the Court may judicially note, the large detention centers have been closed. 
    This is a policy which we think is a -- a beneficial one, a humanitarian one. 
    And we shrink from any construction of the immigration laws, the consequence of which is going to be to require a -- a change in the immigration status of the alien by virtue of parole, because the whole concept of parole is that the status quo of the alien remains unchanged.

    Well Mr. Sand, suppose that this young woman, instead of coming into the country by parole had sneaked across the border and had been in this country for the same length of time and the Attorney General wanted to send her back, the country she came from, say it was the same country, would he have jurisdiction under 243 (h) there to -- to consider her case?

speaker="leonard_b_sand" startTime="2808.712" stopTime="2890.853">
    Mr. Leonard B. Sand 
    Well, because it's basic to the Government's argument that there has always been in the immigration laws of this country, a distinction between the excluded alien and the alien who is in the eyes of the law in the United States. 
    This is a distinction which -- which is reflected as I say in -- in the earliest -- in the earliest cases and in every case in which that distinction has been made and there are several that can be said, “Oh, if --- if the alien had not been stopped at the port, but had sneaked to cross the border,” then it would be different. 
    Yes, it would be different because then -- then, there was never available to the -- to the Government the -- the power to -- to keep the alien at the border. 
    What's involved here is the question whether where the Government has the power physically as well as legally to exclude the alien from the country, but for the benefit of the alien permits her to come in on parole. 
    She is then to be regarded as legally within the United States.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2890.853" stopTime="2895.063">

    Mr. Leonard B. Sand 
    She would be -- you're right, Mr. Chief Justice. 
    She would be within the United States though -- the fact that she was in the United States would be -- would be legally cognizable.

    A concept which as I have said --

    In other words, you based your -- your argument on the fiction as to whether this -- this young woman is actually within the United States now or not?
speaker="leonard_b_sand" startTime="2934.048" stopTime="2989.749">
    Mr. Leonard B. Sand 
    I base my argument, Mr. Chief Justice, on the fact that reading the Immigration Act of 1952, the Government finds in it over and over again instances that Congress has adhered in this statute as it has in old prior statutes, to the fact that there is a difference between an excluded alien, who is subject to exclusion and -- and an alien who is within the United States and in subject to deportation. 
    And that this particular statute, 243 (h), deals only with aliens who are subject to deportation. 
    One finds that in the Immigration Act of 1952, that there are separate provisions, separate chapters which deal with exclusion and those which deal with deportation.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2989.749" stopTime="3053.412">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Yes, but referring back to your -- to your fiction, don't you believe that the -- that the fiction as to whether one who sneaks into the country is -- is in the country and one who is here under parole is not within the country, becomes a distinction without a difference when the Government permits the person to come into the country and permits the person to remain here for a period of time for the purpose of -- of -- for any purpose, whether it's for the purpose of -- well, for any purpose. 
    And she remains here for -- for a period of years, so far as the fiction of whether she is in the United States or not. 
    And whether that fiction should keep should keep her out of the -- out of the country, put her out of the country regardless of what persecution she might meet when she goes home, disappears.

speaker="leonard_b_sand" startTime="3103.313" stopTime="3246.583">
    Mr. Leonard B. Sand 
    I think it's in a humanitarian term. 
    I think it is -- it is the only device, the only method by which it is possible for the United States which must of course maintain control over who will and who will not come to this country. 
    It is the only device by which the United States can permit a -- a screening of these aliens, a determination of which aliens are admissible and which will be excluded. 
    The only way that that can be done without requiring the aliens physically to be kept aboard the ship or -- or in -- in the detention center, and in -- in further answering your question, Mr. Chief Justice, whenever you have to determine, the Government submits, whether you will adhere to the concept that an excluded alien, though paroled is not within the United States. 
    You have to go back to this basic concept that this is the device which permits the alien to enjoy this greater liberty while her immigration status is being determined. 
    And -- and I think that that if you say, “Well -- well, she's here.” 
    Then, you -- then you're compelling in essence, those who are entrusted with the administration of the immigration laws to say, “Well, then, we can't let her be here. 
    We must keep her on the boat. 
    We must keep her in the detention center.” 
    It's anomalous. 
    It's a paradox that in this case, the argument which is hostile to the concept of parole, but be -- hostile to that concept because it reasons from the mere fact of parole. 
    There is a change in the immigration status that that argument is advanced here on behalf of the alien.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3246.583" stopTime="3270.979">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well, how can you say that there's such a great danger of the change of status when all she ask for is to have the same kind of consideration under Section 243 (h) that you say the Attorney General is entitled to give her under the other Sections? 
    Now, what grave consequence is this?
speaker="leonard_b_sand" startTime="3270.979" stopTime="3376.335">
    Mr. Leonard B. Sand 
    Well, the -- the consequence is, Mr. Justice Warren, this is not a question of whether the Attorney General saw fit or did not see fit to act under 243 (h). 
    This is a question of whether the Congress of the United States which -- which throughout the Act, recognize the difference between exclusion and -- and deportation, whether the Congress of the United States has given the Attorney General any power to act under this statute. 
    And the legislative history of this statute is very illuminating, because prior to 1952, in this particular statute, there were not the words within the United States. 
    And in the 1952 Immigration Act, Congress specifically inserted in this provision the phrase within the United States. 
    Now, obviously, Congress doesn't legislate extraterritorially. 
    There is no provision. 
    There is no occasion or purpose for Congress to -- to provide the deportation of -- of an alien from one foreign country to another. 
    And so, the phrase within the United States following the phrase deportation of any alien is completely meaningless. 
    It's -- it's a redundant phrase which had no purpose when it was inserted, unless, it has reference, unless, it has reference to this concept that an alien who has been excluded is not legally within the United States.

    I don't -- I'm saying it's a greater doubt, if the -- if that question is served, then I -- I don't think I want to reach your problem, the statutory problem, because then, under a different provision of the statute, she can't be sent to China.

    What -- there is a complaint -- the complaint in this case alleged that the alien was being sent back to China. 
    The Government did not controvert that allegation.

    Yes.
speaker="joseph_s_hertogs" startTime="4015.518" stopTime="4054.808">
    Mr. Joseph S. Hertogs 
    There is one comment I would like to make in the argument by counsel for the respondent. 
    He refers to exclusion and deportation as if they were two separate and distinct things. 
    They are not. 
    Exclusion and deportation is a phraseology used in the Immigration and Nationality Act and has been used for many years. 
    It refers to a type of deportation. 
    The other type which is referred to is expulsion and deportation. 
    However, whether it is exclusion or whether it is expulsion, they both result in deportation, which is the physical removal of a person from the United States.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="4054.808" stopTime="4063.416">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    But that is -- you're leaving out of account or vast constitutional difference between procedures, between exclusion and deportation.
speaker="joseph_s_hertogs" startTime="4063.416" stopTime="4064.483">
    Mr. Joseph S. Hertogs 
    There is a difference. 
    One --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="4064.483" stopTime="4067.484">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Well, then, why do you say that they're -- they're the same thing?
speaker="joseph_s_hertogs" startTime="4067.484" stopTime="4072.492">
    Mr. Joseph S. Hertogs 
    As far as -- he said one is deportation and one is exclusion. 
    I hold that they both are deportation.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="4072.492" stopTime="4086.170">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Well, I know but they're sent out, but the -- the protective -- the protection, the legal protection in the case of an incoming alien and one who is here and thought to be sent out are vastly different.
speaker="joseph_s_hertogs" startTime="4086.170" stopTime="4087.048">
    Mr. Joseph S. Hertogs 
    That is correct, Your Honor.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="4087.048" stopTime="4088.886">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Well, then, don't say they're the same.
speaker="joseph_s_hertogs" startTime="4088.886" stopTime="4110.429">
    Mr. Joseph S. Hertogs 
    Now, under -- under one of the answering -- one of the questions of Mr. Chief Justice with regard to whether or not a person who had sneaked in the United States would be eligible to fall in this Section. 
    The answer would have to be answered affirmative even though he had been in the United States for only one day. 
    It would not necessarily have to be in the United States for the period of time which this girl was here in -- on parole.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="4110.429" stopTime="4138.511">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    But we can't construe these statutes according to the particular appeal of a particular case or how close a particular case on one side of the line comes to another side of the line. 
    I've just indicated to you with your agreement that the difference between not letting a fellow come in although he -- in Ellis Island or a detention center in San Francisco where not and a fellow who's in and is to be deported is profound in the law.
speaker="joseph_s_hertogs" startTime="4138.511" stopTime="4138.755">
    Mr. Joseph S. Hertogs 
    But it's --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="4138.755" stopTime="4141.667">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    So, although you are saying they're the same and yet, very different.

    Mr. Joseph S. Hertogs 
    Yes, Your Honor.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="4141.908" stopTime="4149.216">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    And the fact that a person comes in and he's here, doesn't mean that the fellow who isn't here, in the eyes of the law is here.

    -- if you wish to -- to conclude.
speaker="joseph_s_hertogs" startTime="4154.654" stopTime="4211.943">
    Mr. Joseph S. Hertogs 
    Thank you, Your Honor. 
    The one point which I want to refer to once again is the fact that construing the Immigration and Nationality Act of -- as a whole, the 1952 Section. 
    The word “in” and “within” is used constantly throughout the legislation. 
    And in every case, it refers to the fact of physical presence in the United States and a person on parole is construed as being a person who must comply with other provisions of the same piece of legislation. 
    The only other comment I would like to make is this. 
    The Immigration Service in ordering this alien deported to Communist China must have been directing deportation under Section 243 (a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952. 
    If such be the case, then certainly she is entitled to the benefits of a subsection of the same Section of law. 
    I thank you, Your Honor.

    Well, I think the first answer in the first problem, whether there is a distinction between 212 (d) (5) and 243 (h), I would answer that in the affirmative. 
    There is, with regard to the application which was submitted for relief under 212 (d) (5) when this case was taken off the counter to the suggestion of the Solicitor General. 
    There was just a written application submitted to the District Director in accordance with his regulations for relief under that provision. 
    No evidence was submitted. 
    No hearing was conducted. 
    Recently, the Immigration Service has determined that in a case filed under Section 243 that the person is entitled to a hearing before a special inquiry officer, at which time they are orally examined and an opportunity to support it for the introduction of evidence and we have a right of appeal to the regional commissioner. 
    And in those cases, of course, we rely upon many other things which are referred to in the petitioner's opening brief, concerning the Korean situation, the fact the Congress saw fit to enact legislation for displaced persons, for refugees and prior decisions of the Immigration Service that people similarly situated would suffer physical persecution.
