United States v. F. &amp; M. Schaefer Brewing Company
speaker="leonard_b_sand" startTime="0.000" stopTime="229.584">
    Mr. Leonard B. Sand 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    This case arises on the writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, which Court dismissed the Government's appeal as untimely filed. 
    The facts are not in dispute. 
    This was a suit for refund of taxes and the taxpayer moved in the District Court for summary judgment. 
    And on April 14th, 1955, the district judge granted an opinion which quoted and relied upon the opinion of another district judge in another case. 
    And that opinion concluded with the language which appears on page 4 of the record. 
    I am in agreement with Judge Leibell's analysis and accordingly, the plaintiff's motion is granted. 
    On that same day, the clerk of the Court made an entry in the civil docket which appears at the top of page 2 of the record."April 14th, Rayfiel, J. Decision rendered on motion for summary judgment. 
    Motion granted. 
    See opinion on file." 
    On May 24, 1955, the district judge signed a paper submitted not by the Government but by the taxpayer which was -- had a judgment and which appears on pages 4 and 5 of the record. 
    That document after -- reciting that the Court's opinion having been duly filed herein, it has ordered adjudged and decreed that the plaintiff, Schaefer Brewing Company recover of the defendant certain sums spelled out in that document. 
    The document was stamped, judgment rendered, dated May 24, 1955. 
    And on that date, the clerk made the docket entry which appears on page 2 of the record. 
    May 24, Rayfiel J. Judgment filed and docketed against defendant in various sums of money that spelled out. 
    The Government filed its notice of appeal on July 21, 1955 which was 98 days from the original grant of the motion from the decision and 58 days from the filing of the judgment, the form of judgment signed on May 24th. 
    The taxpayer moved in the Court of Appeals to dismiss the Government's appeal as not timely brought. 
    That is not brought within 60 days from the entry of the judgment as required by Rule 73. 
    Thus, looking at pages 4 and 5 of the record, the first issue in this case is whether the opinion of the District Court granting the motion was in and of itself the judgment of the Court, the final disposition by the district judge of that case. 
    Or whether the document headed in a stamped judgment dated May 24th, 1955 submitted by the taxpayer and signed by the district judge constitutes the judgment in the case. 
    And the second issue, looking at page 2 of the record is whether the April 14th entry decision rendered on motion for summary judgment constitutes an entry of judgment, a docket entry of judgment which contains the nature and substance of the judgment as required by the rules to begin the running of the period within which an appeal must be taken. 
    Or whether the May 24th entry is the applicable judgment entry.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Mr. Sand, may I ask at the outset, in order to appreciate the reach of this -- does the -- in the problem of this kind, appreciate the general problem, but does the specific setting in which the problem arises in the Second Circuit raised the question for all the other circuits or other variations in the different circuits regarding the practice of what they do about, what they say when they file opinions and make docket entries thereon and then later there's a later entry. 
    What is (Inaudible)? 
    What is the situation?
speaker="leonard_b_sand" startTime="276.884" stopTime="297.170">
    Mr. Leonard B. Sand 
    Well, the crucial question that the Second Circuit has -- has held and the other circuits would agree, is the intent of the -- of the district judge. 
    And to some extent in evaluating, in categorizing the words used by the district judge resort has had to local practice.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="297.170" stopTime="308.708">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Well, this -- this question may not -- this -- you -- one cannot say that this raises that question of statutory construction which will hereafter govern every circuit.
speaker="leonard_b_sand" startTime="308.708" stopTime="396.986">
    Mr. Leonard B. Sand 
    I -- I think not. 
    I think that one says -- let me make that clear. 
    I think that there is now an explicit conflict between the Second Circuit and the First Circuit. 
    And -- and that the decision below is also inconsistent with decisions reached in the Fourth and the Ninth Circuit. 
    I think that these circuits disagree as to the interpretation of Rule 58. 
    Subsequent to the decision in the Schaefer case, the First Circuit in United States against Higginson reached a result which it recognized was inconsistent with the Second Circuit's result. 
    The First Circuit said that where the district judge later signs a formal order that becomes relevant in determining whether he intended the first memorandum decision to be his final disposition in the case. 
    And referring to the Schaefer opinion said that that was influenced by a local rule. 
    Subsequent thereto, the Second Circuit decided the Matteson case which is reprinted in the appendix to the Government's petition for certiorari. 
    And in that opinion, Judge Clark said, "No, the local rule merely corroborates Rule 58 and this -- our decision is based on -- on Rule 58."
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="396.986" stopTime="427.824">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    I suppose that. 
    I only let you -- see what you have to say but if the thing turns on intent -- intent, maybe what the district judge manage to do, what he sought to be accomplished, then one either has to say that you look for nothing but the word and they must mean the same thing in whatever circuit they arise or if its other things -- other understanding except words, then that's (Inaudible), you must have local differences.
speaker="leonard_b_sand" startTime="427.824" stopTime="456.056">
    Mr. Leonard B. Sand 
    Well, you -- you look to the words and -- and you look also the words used by the district judge and you look also to the rules of -- of civil procedure which of course a uniform throughout the country to see whether those words satisfy the requirements set forth in the rules. 
    But I want to emphasize that there is a clear conflict between the circuits which is in no sense dependent on any local rule of court.

    Mr. Leonard B. Sand 
    It's -- exactly so.

speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="523.335" stopTime="553.446">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Well, it may get -- one gets lost in words in this problem. 
    I rely on words for the -- for the proposition obvious enough that while no local rule can change the terms of the legislation or that the statute of Congress or the rules adopted not changed by Congress. 
    Statutory standard cannot be changed by local practice but local practice may determine whether the standard is satisfying.

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Mr. Sands, may I -- do I correctly infer from what you have said about the determination of several circuits that none of them has suggested that without regard to the attempt of the district judge, there was no judgment until a formal paper captioned judgment is entered.

speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="580.725" stopTime="594.231">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Well, what I mean -- what I mean is, has it been suggested by anyone that you don't have a judgment until there's a formal judgment entered, in other words, that you can't spell a judgment merely out of a docket entry.
speaker="leonard_b_sand" startTime="594.231" stopTime="631.918">
    Mr. Leonard B. Sand 
    I think, no. 
    I think that -- that it's clear under the rules of as -- as they now exist that if the decision of the district judge satisfied the requisites of a judgment and by that -- and we take those requisites to be that it contained judgment language that language which will clearly indicate to the lay personnel of the clerk or clerk's office that it is to be the judgment. 
    And if it goes on to state the -- the amount of the recovery, the -- if it tells what a judgment must tell, who is to pay what to whom and the money --
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="631.918" stopTime="647.391">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    In other words -- but here, it had said at the end of the opinion, the district judge have said, "I adjudge and decree that there shall be recovered by the plaintiff from the United States X dollars." 
    That would have satisfied it?
speaker="leonard_b_sand" startTime="647.391" stopTime="668.452">
    Mr. Leonard B. Sand 
    That -- if that had been the case and had the clerk made a -- an entry in the docket which satisfied a Rule 79 indicating the nature and substance of the judgment then -- then the time to appeal would begin to run from the time of that entry. 
    I think that's correct. 
    I think that --
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="668.452" stopTime="672.413">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    And the Government doesn't take a different view of the rule?
speaker="leonard_b_sand" startTime="672.413" stopTime="704.764">
    Mr. Leonard B. Sand 
    The Government does not take the view that -- that the document which is the opinion of the Court cannot also serve as the judgment of the Court if it contains the essential elements of the judgment, which is as I say, if it contains language which directs the use of language of the rule directs the clerk that the plaintiff has to recover the money and if it spells out the -- the essential elements of a judgment, who is to pay what to whom.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="704.764" stopTime="709.219">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Isn't that the Bedford case, for -- even for all the purposes of our jurisdiction.

    Mr. Leonard B. Sand 
    I -- I think that's correct.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    So that tomorrow, if this Court sustained -- if we sustain the Government's claim in this case to theirs, our judgment comes down, the Court of Appeals of the Second Circuit can effectuate its present rule by -- by providing for its own rules that that what was done on April 14th to be final and nothing more shall be entered, couldn't it?

    If in fact it contains the elements which -- which we regard as essential to a judgment a direction for the clerk and an indication of who is to pay what to whom.

    Now, Mr. Sand, let me see if I follow you. 
    Are you saying the clerk has the discretion as to whether he will treat the Court's announcement as a judgment or won't? 
    Isn't this the situation, the appeal of course in real time runs from the date of the entry of the judgment? 
    This is an action for the recovery of money, isn't it? 
    Rule 58 says that when the Court directs that a party recover only money or cost or that all right be denied, the clerk shall enter judgment forthwith upon receipt of the direction. 
    Now, the clerk has no authority to enter the judgment until he has a direction to do so from the Court.

    Well -- that -- that it contained -- it lacked the direction. 
    It merely has the -- the general language motion is granted and also it did not say who was to pay what to whom. 
    It was impossible looking at the four corners of the opinion of the district judge in this case to determine the exact amount which was the plaintiff was to recover of the defendant. 
    And -- and for that reason, we think that the opinion did not satisfy the requisites of a judgment. 
    And -- and we also think that the entry of the clerk which did not even indicate which party had prevailed below on April 14th was not an entry of the -- which indicated the nature and substance of a judgment which the rules require.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Is there anything in the rules that prevents a particular circuit in the interest of expediting appeals in arresting that great evil in American litigation dilatory to provide that it should all be done on the final day, in one act. 
    The judge should hand on an opinion, that he writes an opinion as he should in all but exceptional cases. 
    And then in there translates that opinion into a final document for purposes of going upstairs.
speaker="leonard_b_sand" startTime="1273.847" stopTime="1335.898">
    Mr. Leonard B. Sand 
    I know nothing in the rules that would prevent a particular circuit from saying when a district judge determines a motion, he shall also enter judgment -- indicate the judgment in that case by directing the clerk to -- by directing that the party recover and spelling out the exact amount. 
    But the difficulty that arises there, Mr. Justice Frankfurter, is that in -- in some cases, particularly in tax cases, the -- let me -- if I may present a hypothetical. 
    Suppose the issue is whether a particular transaction resulted in income in 1941 and 1952 or was -- or was a gift or not a sale. 
    The District Court may in an opinion indicate how the various transactions are to be treated. 
    But the computation which must follow thereafter becomes an extended process.

    Mr. Leonard B. Sand 
    Well, I think that's right. 
    But if -- if the opinion does not leave unanswered only matters which can be ministerially handled and is accorded a judgment -- the status of judgment which -- which Schaefer indicates would be the case, then the time to appeal might begin to run or even expire before the parties knew who was to pay what to whom. 
    And -- and as Mr. Justice Whitaker indicated, the opinion of the district judge below did not indicate one of the crucial elements in determining what the consequences of this judgment would be. 
    He did not indicate the date on which the taxpayer paid his taxes. 
    And under the applicable statute, interest runs from that date of payment. 
    So, if that have been possible for the clerks in this case from the -- within the four points as of the opinion itself to have determine the amount -- the amount of the judgment. 
    They would have to go beyond that to the pleadings and to the answer and submit that the -- the function of a judgment is -- is -- is to be a document which culminates the litigation and which presents in that one collection of words, the -- the consequences of the litigation.

    But, if the intention has anything to do with this, the intention of the District Judge does not the fact that he later, after pronouncing orally the judgment or the writing of his opinion later enters a formal entry of judgment have some bearing upon the fact that he didn't intend his first pronouncement to be the judgment.

    I -- I think it has -- it's crucial. 
    And the First Circuit agrees and the Fourth and the Ninth Circuit agrees. 
    And -- and the decision of this Court in United States against Hark is to the same effect. 
    One shouldn't presume that the District Judge in later signing the formal order performed a useless act or an act intended improperly to extend the time -- the time for appeal.

    Mr. Thomas C. Burke 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    The question as to the timeliness of the appeal in this case depends on when judgment was rendered and when judgment was entered. 
    Although that question may depend to some extent on local rules and practice as they affect judicial intent, our first point of departure is Rule 58 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. 
    Plaintiff's contention of respondent here, is that in this case, Rule 58 disposes of the question completely without ever having to resort to local rules to ascertain the judicial intent. 
    This was a case for the recovery of money only. 
    The sentence of Rule 58 which Mr. Justice Whittaker read a few moments ago expressly provides that where only money is recovered where there is a direction for the recovery only of money, judgment is to be entered forthwith.

    -- in all inclusive rule can be stated on that, Mr. Justice Whittaker. 
    For this reason, there are -- there are two types of cases, I think.

    We say parenthetically that it was clear here because the amount was stated in the opinion and the opinion was clear that it represented the respondent's adjudication. 
    The second type of case would be where the direction is not so clear. 
    It may or may not constitute a direction. 
    In those cases, the judicial intent can be clarified by -- resort to local rules in practice. 
    When we do that on each case, assuming that the direction was not clear on its face, we find a local rule which states that the memorandum of a termination of a motion shall constitute the order. 
    The order is a direction and therefore under the local rule which have now been construed by -- by the number of decisions of the Second Circuit and are no longer open to doubt as to their own rule.

    I think the answer to your question, Mr. Justice Brennan, it should be that the clerk's job is not to decide or to interpret but simply to record. 
    If the opinion did constitute a judgment, then the clerk's act in duly recording it was an act of entry of judgment.

    I was just turning to Mr. Justice Black's question and I can only state in my opinion as a lawyer and not from any factual material in the record that execution could have been obtained.

    The clerk may or may not check some record of judgments. 
    Assuming that the clerk first of all might have refused to issue an execution, if in fact, there was a judgment here, there was certainly a procedure whereby the clerk could have been directed to issue execution.

    Oh, I think it's a proper notation of an entry of judgment. 
    There is a difference between what is the judgment of the Court and what constitutes an entry of judgment. 
    The clerk's docket entry was the entry of the judgment. 
    The opinion of the Court was the judgment itself. 
    I would like to conclude with the statement that there may well be cases where it's desirable to have a formalized judgment. 
    But, the decision as to what those cases are should rest with the Court and it's easy enough for the Court to state in its opinion that counsel should submit a form of judgment for the Court to consider. 
    In this complicated cases involving computations, it may well be that that's the preferable procedure. 
    But it's for the judge to decide that and not for the attorneys and if in fact, the judge does show final adjudication, then he has rendered judgment.

   Rebuttal of Leonard B. Sand

    Mr. Sand.

    Mr. Leonard B. Sand 
    Mr. Chief Justice. 
    With respect to Mr. Justice Black's question as to whether writ of execution could be -- could be obtained. 
    I -- I agree with Mr. Burke that further proceedings would have been necessary before execution could have been obtained and it could not have been obtained merely on this opinion. 
    And I suggest that further proceedings that would have been necessary would have been mandamus to compel the district judge to sign a document which contains the elements that are found in the formal judgment.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="3325.262" stopTime="3391.284">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    That answer -- that answer is based on the assumption that a specific figure in the judges' opinions are not to be deemed incorporated in the judgment, i.e. the entry of April 14th that that's really at the heart of this business, to what extent you can incorporate in an informal statement to formalize terms and statement of the judges' opinion. 
    If -- if -- I don't know whether -- I emphasized it maybe, if in this case, there isn’t any doubt as to the mathematical computation which followed the amount for which recovery could be had and the judge says, "Yes, you can recover what you asked for, $6000, whatever it is." 
    It's just like a bill in equity for specific performance in which you asked for the delivery of a (Inaudible) and the judge says "Yes." 
    That's the -- the bill for specific performance is granted and the (Inaudible) should be delivered. 
    Now, I -- you can't incorporate that in the formalized statement of a -- of a clerk's entry. 
    I don't understand.

    I would ask you one more question. 
    I don't know if it has anything to do with it but I'm wondering if there are any particular statute which controlled Government agents in the payments of judgment against the Government.
speaker="leonard_b_sand" startTime="3418.535" stopTime="3458.073">
    Mr. Leonard B. Sand 
    We cite in the -- in our reply brief to page 5, the Treasury regulations which applied at the time -- the District Court rendered its decision in Schaefer and the construction of those by the Internal Revenue service and they would not have made payment unless they were submitted to them a document which contained the exact amount of the recovery. 
    And so, the taxpayer was qualified in this case to have secured the additional document high insider or not because without such a document, it could never had been paid.
