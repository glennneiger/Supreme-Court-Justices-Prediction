    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Did they deal with both the statute and the constitutional provision? 
    They did both, yes they did. 
    Now these petitioners are not the only persons or churches in California who felt themselves unable to sign the oath, there are two cases pending before Your Honors, in the form of an appeal in which this Court has not acted upon the appeal, they are on behalf of the First Methodist Church of San Leandro and the First Unitarian Church of Berkeley. 
    First Methodist Church of San Leandro as appears from the record in this Court, in that case deemed that Methodist discipline prevented it. 
    If it were to comply with Methodist discipline from complying with this requirement, the first -- these two churches with leave of this Court have filed briefs amici, as has the Philadelphia yearly meeting of the Religious Society of Friends in Southern California. 
    The Orange Grove yearly meeting took the position that this requirement violated its conscience and its commitment to Christ and therefore that it was unable to comply with this requirement. 
    Now in a word, the nub of the argument which I shall present is something like this, that the requirements, particularly again the statutory requirements, open due process because unreasonable and arbitrary and more particularly those, I'm still stating the summary of my argument, that on the one hand there is no support for the legislation or the constitutional amendment in any real need or any real danger existing in California warranting this or similar legislation on the one hand. 
    And on the other, the requirements are so broad and sweeping, affecting thousands, hundreds of thousands more than a million persons in California, are so broad and sweeping on the one hand and so deep and offensive and intrusion into privacy and into the privacy of the spirit and the mind of man, so that a balancing of any real concern for national security of California on the one hand and off the sweeping inroads on the other by this legislation would require this Court, assuming this Court were to adopt and follow the narrowest kind of jurisdiction which it could take, assuming this Court to exercise its jurisdiction most reluctantly in view of the fact that was involved here as state legislation, as distinguished from federal legislation in giving the states the widest reasonable scope for authority in dealing with so difficult a problem as national security, assuming all these -- that this legislation opens federal due process.

    We are raising questions of equal protection in our briefs. 
    I have been taking about the thrust of my oral argument. 
    Your Honors need not reach the problem of equal protection if you are -- if you agree favorably to the petitioners on the narrower of issue of due process, so let me proceed to address myself to that problem. 
    I say to Your Honors first quickly and then I hope to demonstrate it, that there is no substantive base, there is no support in any real evil, or to borrow a phrase from one of the justices of this Court, there is no solid threat to any security in California warranting this legislation.

    Well the narrow point is that I'm arguing a due process point essentially as distinguished from the broader points of equal protection or even the broader point of religious liberty that I shall mention it, or even the broader point of freedom of speech. 
    I thought that due process is a comparatively narrow approach before this Court.

speaker="a_l_wirin" startTime="306.057" stopTime="463.267">
    Mr. A. L. Wirin 
    I intend to -- I hope that my argument before it is concluded will impress Your Honor as a narrow nonetheless, so I shall proceed. 
    I suggest to Your Honor that there is no showing in this record and that no claim can be made by the respondent of any solid threat to the security of the nation or to security of California, which would support this kind of legislation. 
    The first question to ask is, what is the purpose of the legislation and here I shall advert to the arguments for the constitutional amendment and we shall see to it at these are filed within 24 or more hours from now in sufficient quantities for the justices of the Court, in urging the support of a proposal which became the constitutional amendment, it was urged, there is no valid reason why such exemptions should be allowed communists and the like. 
    So far as the voters of California was concerned, this -- the constitutional amendment was designed to deal with the problem of communists and the like. 
    This contention or this position is supported by the majority of the court below which in the record at page 52 explained this legislation and these provisions and said this was California's, and I quote "Endeavor to protect itself from subversive infiltration." 
    Now of course I suppose when a court or a person these days talks about subversive infiltration he's talking about the infiltration of communists. 
    Now I say to Your Honors that there are no facts, supporting the assumption that communists have infiltrated into the institutions of California that are entitled to tax exemption, and that this is not only not posit on fact but is pure fancy. 
    In the argument to the voters Your Honors, no claim was made that there were any communists who had infiltrated into the various institutions that under California law are entitled to exemption as for example charitable organizations, churches or cemetery.

    Mr. A. L. Wirin 
    Veterans are also entitled to exemptions and I should -- I'm glad Your Honor asked that. 
    There is no claim so far as the argument is concerned that any of the agencies or persons that are entitled in the California law have been subject to infiltration for communist, as far as any of them are concerned.

    Justice Charles E. Whittaker 
    (Inaudible)
speaker="a_l_wirin" startTime="488.114" stopTime="780.091">
    Mr. A. L. Wirin 
    The list is brought, there are many other persons entitled to exemption one of them is veterans and other are veterans of growing crops, householders are entitled to exemption, income tax payers are entitled to some exemption. 
    Now -- but what I am saying is that there is no claim in the argument that any of the persons or organizations, no matter how many they maybe that are entitled to tax exemptions had been victimized or subjected to infiltration by communists. 
    On the contrary, no such claim was made in the legislature which adopted this legislation. 
    No single judge in any of the proceedings in the California courts suggested that there was any basis for any such claim. 
    On the contrary, the dissenters of the Court affirmatively stated and I refer to the record at page 60, there is no evidence that plaintiff church or any of the organizations seeking tax exemption, this is the second new paragraph, and the second sentence in the second new paragraph on page 60, there is no evidence that plaintiff church or any of the organizations seeking tax exemptions are infiltrated by communists or other disloyal persons or that they are in any danger of such infiltration, the evidence is all to the contrary. 
    This solemn statement by three of the seven justices was not disputed again say by the majority of the Court, on the contrary in the record at 56, the majority of the Court implicitly accepts this statement and appraisal after it -- page 56 after the majority of the court recognizes the integrity and the morality of the principles of the petitioners. 
    It goes on to say, I'm reading from the first new paragraph, the sentence in the middle of the page, it is inconceivable that any organization actuated by the doctrine of pronouncements there declared, namely by the Unitarians would knowingly harbor within itself any person or group of persons who would engage in the subversive activities referred to. 
    As a matter of fact Your Honors, nowhere throughout the proceedings in the courts below and not even in the brief filed by the respondent in this case, has there been any suggestion that this legislation is needed, because of any claim that communists had infiltrated institutions that are ordinarily entitled to tax exemptions as the basis for support of this legislation. 
    Indeed the California legislature made no findings at any time of any danger to the institutions from communists and this is in marked contradistinction as we point out in our brief, that when California legislature was dealing with the problem of subversives in education, public education and in government, it affirmatively made elaborate findings with respect to such infiltration and such dangers, similar to the findings made by the legislature of New York in the case which was before this Court in Adler. 
    This case does not have findings by the legislature comparable to the findings or comments made by committees of the Congress with respect to the old declaration which was involved in the Douds case. 
    And the reason no findings were made and no suggestions that this danger exists in California is because there is no basis in fact for such a claim, because this claim is pure fancy. 
    Now I have talked thus far solely with respect to the first half of the requirement which every tax payer must avow about. 
    There are two halves, and they are in the conjunctive and no one may receive a tax exemption in California, unless he otherwise is entitled to it, unless he or the organization involved avows in the conjunctive or avows negatively in the disjunctive that the person or organization advocates -- it doesn't advocate the destruction of government by violence and so forth, nor advocates the support of a foreign government against the United States in the event of hostilities.

    Not very relevant in --
speaker="a_l_wirin" startTime="862.277" stopTime="1021.162">
    Mr. A. L. Wirin 
    Well I think it is and I'll try to give Your Honor some figures in a moment. 
    I however want to say a word now with respect to the second half of the requirement, the one pertaining to support hostilities and so on. 
    Now in the first page Your Honors will note that in this provision there is nothing about the State of California. 
    This deals with the problem of foreign relations and what maybe advocated in California as a condition of getting tax exemption in peace time in the event of hostility, but passing that, here is a provision, new in the statute books, throughout the current cold war, which we hope is not as cold as it was some years ago, no other state in the union saw the need of adopting any such provision. 
    Now here again there are no findings by the California legislature, there is no suggestion by any judge in California, there is no claim by our opponents that this legislation has support in the actual advocacy by churches, by anyone in California anywhere during the last decade or more or ever in the history of California since we became a state in the union, there is no suggestion, the natural fact any person in California has actually advocated the doctrine which is set forth in this legislation. 
    I have called it a peacetime sedition statute, that's what it is. 
    The Congress of the United States has seen no need of adopting legislation comparable to this so long as we are at peace. 
    Despite the numerous and thorough going investigations conducted by congressional committees and federal executive agencies, no one has suggested that anywhere in United States is there any danger from persons or organizations with the churches or otherwise preaching this doctrine which is the subject matter of the second half. 
    Now I'm making that argument merely to demonstrate to the Court again that certainly with respect to this completely novel provision, Californians were seeing things which no one else in the nation saw.

    Mr. A. L. Wirin 
    Well, I am spending time about the newness of the statute, in order to make the argument that there is no real warrant for it and in order to make the point which I shall do so now, that while this Court has had before it, requirements involving avowals or belief or of advocacy, that's for instance is the Douds case. 
    This Court supported the requirement of the Douds case because this Court found that here were present excesses from direct active conduct based upon findings or statements by the Congress that communists had infiltrated trade unions and were constituting an immediate and serious menace to the security of the nation. 
    And I'm making the argument Your Honor because I think prominent inference can be drawn by this Court, that whether new or old, this legislation has no reasons which are exigent or obviously compelling to warrant its constitutional support.

    I was referring to this country Your Honor, and in this country, to my knowledge certainly in recent years, no such oath was required. 
    Now it is true and we refer to it in our brief particularly in an appendix in our brief that this type of oath was not unknown in Great Britain. 
    And that the classic test oath although essentially dealing with other problems and dealing essentially with religious problems rather than with political ones, Your Honor's will find in the second appendix to our brief, Appendix B a reference to some of the classic oaths in Great Britain, particularly the Jacobean oath, which had provisions with respect to the use or advocacy -- the use of violence, which had provisions pertaining to support all the foreign power and -- by the (Inaudible) was concerned referring to the Pope. 
    Your Honor will find those references particularly on page 8 and page 9, page 6 and 8 and 9 of the appendix to our brief.

    Mr. A. L. Wirin 
    Yes. 
    Now if there is substance to my argument that in California there is no support, no solid support for this legislation, I move on to the second half of my argument that the method which the legislature of California resorted to in dealing with any problem, assuming a problem really existed, is so sweeping in its effect as to become unconstitutional under narrow due process requirement. 
    Let us look for a moment though I had said that major thrust of my argument will be with respect to the legislation. 
    Let us look for a moment at the constitutional amendment itself. 
    So far as that amendment is concerned in practice in California, it applies to every -- to virtually every adult person in California because every adult person in California, they indicated in their answer to Mr. Justice Brendan is entitled to some kind of an exemption whether by way of the income tax or householder. 
    And therefore so far as the constitutional amendment is concerned, it applies to -- well the population of California is something like 14 million, if we talk only about the adult population, it applies perhaps to some 10 million. 
    So far as the faith of the requirement is concerned, it is the most sweeping, that any I know of, but when we turn to the legislation, which requires oaths the number of course becomes considerably less. 
    We've indicated that the figures with respect to those who are subjected to this oath requirement in California include certainly over a million persons in California, for there are as we indicated in our brief, over a million veterans in California, who actually have secured exemption who have submitted to this oath. 
    And the figures further indicate there are a 11000 churches in California, there are more than 11000 churches in California, but 11000 churches have subscribed to this oath, I shall make some explanation about that perhaps later. 
    So you have it here a requirement, which so far as the constitutional amendment is concerned blankets the entire state and so far as the legislation is concerned involves a very substantial, a very large number.

    Well, I'm answering in this way. 
    I understand that the sweep of a regulation particularly one that involves opinion, that involves advocacy, that involves conscience, I want to say a word in a moment or two, that one of the considerations that this Court has in mind in balancing the need of national security on the one hand and whether the legislation is reasonable is whether it were narrowly drawn to meet a particular evil. 
    For instance in the Douds case, Your Honors talked about a hand full of persons who were affected, Your Honors used the phrase, "only a few are affected by this," and therefore it seems to me that where a regulation is sweeping in its coverage and doesn't affect a handful or a few, but involves more than a million persons, it is one of the considerations Your Honors will want to know about.

    Now let me address myself for a --
speaker="william_o_douglas" startTime="1730.360" stopTime="1734.820">
    Justice William O. Douglas 
    You mean that the churches as a matter of constitutional right can get tax exemption?
speaker="a_l_wirin" startTime="1734.820" stopTime="1760.113">
    Mr. A. L. Wirin 
    No I don't. 
    I don't think that's involved here. 
    I just claim that once tax exemption is granted, the persons who receive it must be treated fairly without imposing any unconstitutional limitations or conditions. 
    And that the requirement here is such an unconstitutional condition or limitation because it involves in avow with respect to the non-advocacy by the church and that leads me to deal with the narrow question --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1760.113" stopTime="1771.025">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    (Inaudible)
speaker="a_l_wirin" startTime="1771.025" stopTime="2098.274">
    Mr. A. L. Wirin 
    Let me spend a few more minutes taking about the particular constitutional problem and the particular position of the petitioners whom I represent. 
    Now they take the position that as churches, they have had the right from time immemorial and they still have that right, free from coercion, or restraint, or prohibition, or inhibition of any kind, no matter how direct or indirect, no matter how manifest or subtle from the state so far as the preaching of their doctrines are concerned. 
    And that these doctrines include particularly the right of churches to preach to their followers and to the world, the commands of God and the demands of morality. 
    And that requiring churches as a condition of securing this ancient and traditional and accredited tax exemption recognized by every state in the union, recognized and existing in California for over a century, that churches must be free not to preach whatever doctrine they may want, certainly not to engage in any conduct they may want without accountability to seizure but free from accountability to the State of California and to seizure prior to any advocacy as to what their principles and their religious doctrines are. 
    The churches are unwilling and unable particularly in the light of the history of test oaths to which I have made some reference, prior to advocacy to declare in advance as a condition of getting tax exemption as to what doctrines the churches will not advocate. 
    For of course once they do that, they can readily subject themselves to accountability to the state for the doctrines that they do advocate. 
    Now I don't want to engage now in a long discussion about the metaphor used by this Court of separation of church and state, but certainly throughout our history, this Court has acknowledged that there are many situations when the state may not demand of a person or of an institution to avow prior to advocacy pertaining to the belief or the advocacy of the person or institution. 
    And so here we think that the requirement, particularly the oath requirement now, violates constitutional limitation because the effect of such a requirement is to make full freedom of expression on matters sacred and important to the community, a little bit the less likely if churches have to attest to their non advocacy as a condition of securing a tax exemption. 
    Let me make this suggestion to the Court as I sit down and reserve a few moments for reply. 
    On page 6 of our reply brief in the appendix, we have set forth a statement by the Northern California-Nevada Council of Churches with respect to this requirement, as we have on pages just previous to that by the American Baptist Association, the Methodist Discipline, the position of the American Unitarian Association, the position for instance on page 3 of some 600 Protestant ministers who are in the Southern California Council of Protestant Churches, which appears for instance at the footnote 5 on page 3. 
    And finally let me call Your Honors' attention because I think it demonstrates the point that I'm urging, to the language of the Northern California-Nevada Council of Churches representing all of the Protestant Churches in Northern California and Nevada, I won't read it but it is before Your Honors, in which that group states its vigorous castigation and opposition to communism, to Marxian communism, but nonetheless protests the loyalty oath requirement and yet calls attention to the fact that most of our churches have signed this oath because of the desperate need the churches have for the funds which are involved in a tax exemption. 
    Now I say to Your Honors --

    This is on page 6 of the reply brief which is a vanilla colored little brief, on page 6 of the appendix and I say to Your Honors that it is impossible to appraise either in a grocer's scale or through a Geiger counter, the pulse upon the freedom of expression of opinion in California generally and particularly in the pulpits of California where opinion and doctrine must be free, when there is a requirement which compels churches despite opposition to attest to the doctrines which they do not advocate as a condition of securing tax exemption.

    And the point of my argument is that to require a statement particularly by churches of non advocacy is abusing --
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="2217.451" stopTime="2231.047">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Supposing this oath as you call it had been that the church does not advocate any conduct which should be a violation of the Smith Act, would that be all right or would that be bad?

    Mr. A. L. Wirin 
    I think Your Honor, if there were a constitutional amendment which provided that and barred churches from securing exemption if they advocated such conduct, it probably would be good, but on the other hand I would say if it requires a declaration under oath on the part of churches, in view of the doctrine of separation of church and state, in view of the insistence by churches not to be subject to the commands of seizure prior to advocacy, I think that would be bad.

   Argument of Gordon Boller
speaker="gordon_boller" startTime="2573.550" stopTime="2859.270">
    Mr. Gordon Boller 
    If Your Honors please, may I run back over a little of the introductory legislative and constitutional procedure which my opponent has covered. 
    In California, constitutional amendment may be accomplished in one of two ways. 
    The constitution maybe amended only by popular vote, state wide vote of the people. 
    The measure to accomplish such amendment may initiate with the legislature or it may initiate by petition, initiative petition signed by the people. 
    The measure so prepared whether by the legislature or by initiative petition, is by the Secretary of State submitted to the people. 
    The measure is entitled, a title given to it and which is then put on the ballot which the people vote on by the legislative counsel, a legal advisory body set up with that as one of its duties. 
    Upon that submission the vote is taken and the amendment becomes effective according to that vote as of the date of the election. 
    Now here in California there's a provision which has been in the constitution since 1900, which was then adopted as a constitutional amendment Article 13, Section one-and-a-half, this is the so-called church exemption provision. 
    It's not a general provision for exemption of church property. 
    It is not a provision at all exempting church property as such. 
    It's an exemption of property by reason of its use, an exemption of property used solely and exclusively for religious worship. 
    It is not an absolute and unconditional exemption. 
    It is conditioned on such use. 
    It is further conditioned on the property not being rented and rent received for the use by the owner. 
    Now this constitutional amendment of property used for religious worship continued in that form with minor extensions until 1952, the exemption of property as used for religious worship was extended to cover property which was intended for such use that is property which was in the course of construction. 
    It was extended to include as well as the building and the land whereon situate equipment of the church. 
    It was extended as well to include parking areas and parking lots, but that exemption of church property, not under that category but exemption of property used solely and exclusively for religious worship continued until 1952 when one of the measures called in question here was adopted by popular vote. 
    The people in 1952 by statewide election adopted the constitutional provision that notwithstanding any other provision of this constitution, no person or organization which advocates the overthrow of the government of the United States by force or violence or other unlawful means, or who advocates the support of the foreign government against the United States in the event of hostilities shall receive exemption from any tax imposed by this state or any county, city or county, district and so forth. 
    The legislature shall enact such laws as maybe necessary to enforce the provisions of this section.

    Mr. Gordon Boller 
    It would not make a bit of difference, so far as the validity. 
    I can give you those figures Your Honor, you're asking them yes, the yes vote was 2,902,695. 
    The no vote was 1,359,970. 
    At the next session of the legislature, the legislature utilized the authority given to it and adopted as a provision of the Revenue and Taxation Code Section 32, any statement written or other document in which is claimed any exemption other than the householders' exemption from any property tax imposed by this State County and so forth shall contain a declaration that the person or organization making the statement, return, or other document does not advocate the overthrow of the government of the United States or of the State of California by force or violence or other unlawful means nor advocate the support of a foreign government against the United States in the event of hostilities. 
    If any such statement returned or other document does not contain such declaration, the person or organization making such statement return or other document shall not receive any exemption from the tax to which the statement return or other document pertains.

    Mr. Gordon Boller 
    That's right and the question is for Your Honors whether this is a valid classification, and we submit that it is. 
    Now, I've just said that exemption from taxation constitutes unequal treatment, a benefit and a favor to some and what is the justification for that unequal treatment? 
    Exemptions are granted by the public, commonly granted found throughout the country. 
    Tax exemptions are justified on the ground of some compensating benefit to the public body which is granting it, which compensates for the loss of the revenue which would otherwise be received. 
    The exemptions, for example the exemption to religious organizations, and that's what we're concerned with here, is justified on the ground that the teachings and influences of religion make better citizens, and that the churches and it's activities renders a benefit to the state and to the general public, whereby the state gets back in the benefit from personal conduct and private and public morality what it looses in money. 
    People perform public services that they otherwise would not perform, and refrain from public misconduct, that they otherwise would not refrain from. 
    The benefit is expected to be found in the church's influence and work, and the result thereof in maintaining and raising the standards of civic and private virtue and the ideals and conduct in public and in private life. 
    If however the influence of the exemption recipient is inamicable to such results, and if it fails to forward such purpose, the justification for the exemption is gone and the exemption should be and may validly be withheld or withdrawn.

    Mr. Gordon Boller 
    And (Inaudible) Your Honors' questions to me, we have here a condition which was imposed by the legislature in implementing a statute for the purpose of qualifying the right. 
    We already have the condition recognized and utilized that claim must be made. 
    This is another condition which must be met. 
    The provision long recognized has been that the claim for exemption if not made was waived. 
    Statute has provided that any party entitled to exemption, must make his claim therefore or if he failed to make it, that the exemption is waived. 
    That is a condition which was validly imposed. 
    As to the veteran there is the requirement as well that he make the exemption. 
    That is the ordinary type of an implementing statute. 
    Now the state has recognized, the State of California has recognized and declared valid implementing statues of this sort. 
    The statute I've spoken of it requiring the veteran to claim his constitutional exemption under penalty of forfeiture for one of the claim, when the -- that was the case of Chesney against Byram. 
    The veteran failed to claim the exemption, he came to court and said the Constitution gave me exemption, the legislature came along and said I must claim the exemption or I forfeited, and the Court said that's all right, that's an implementing statute. 
    The Constitution provides that public property shall not be taken or damaged for public use without compensation first provided. 
    Along came the legislature and said in such a situation, claim on account of such taking or injury must be made within a year or the right is gone. 
    That was an implementing statute. 
    It was not contrary to the provision of grant by the Constitution and it was upheld, (Inaudible) and so forth against the City of Los Angeles. 
    The constitutional provision assured the right. 
    The legislative provision declared that unless certain procedure was followed, the right could not be asserted. 
    Constitution assures the electoral franchise.

    A foreign government is not something else. 
    It isn't the individuals, the stressed individuals who constitute its populous for one thing. 
    I may run over it somewhat by elimination. 
    It does not constitute the individuals. 
    It represents the agency. 
    It represents the government as its states. 
    It is with respect to government action. 
    It is not with respect to individual need, individual merit it maybe. 
    It is not with regard to disassociated individual conduct.

    Mr. Gordon Boller 
    The basis for this exemption, the basis for these two provisions of constitution and of statute, is not apprehension of overthrow of government, it is not peril to the government, it is not a matter of clear and present danger to the persistence and continuance of government. 
    It is instead danger of defeat of the purpose for which the exemption is granted. 
    The exemption is accorded as I suggested earlier as an aid to the general atmosphere in which a constitutional government exists, for its benefit in raising the standards of conduct and morality in private and public life, and the danger is of defeating that purpose which is sought to be accomplished by the granting of the exemption, its not a danger of overthrow of the government.

    It speaks of the benefiting communists and others of that sort, but the purpose of legislation as I was starting to say is indicated in the opinion of the Court, if I'm reading in the record at page 51. 
    It first indicates reading at the bottom of the page, it first indicates a very insignificant purpose to be accomplished, the interest of the state in protecting its revenue raising program from subversive exploitation has already been considered. 
    Then it goes on, there are additional interests with which the state is concerned and which it is attempting to promote by granting exemptions from taxation. 
    Included is the interest of the state in maintaining the loyalty of its people and thus safeguarding against its violent overthrow by internal or external forces. 
    This legitimate objective is sought to be accomplished by placing any favored economic position and thus to promote their wellbeing and sphere of the influence, those particular persons and groups of individuals who are capable of formulating policies relating to good morals and respect for the law. 
    It has been said that when church properties are exempted from taxation, it must be because apart from religious considerations, churches as regarded as institutions established to inculcate principles of sound morality leading citizens to a more ready obedience to the laws. 
    The same maybe said about as enjoying tax exemptions.

    Mr. A. L. Wirin 
    First about some other people and with respect to that what are involved here with respect to the two churches, a congregation of the churches, they're churches that have no dogma, and no creed and there is no one in the church, not the minister, not the officer, not the secretary or anyone who may speak for either for the church or for any of the members or for all of the members with respect to the advocacy either of the church or of any one of them.

    Mr. A. L. Wirin 
    Yes, if Your Honors will look at a very excellent brief prepared in this case not by the petitioners but by the American Civil Liberties Union (Inaudible), you will find on page 24 a very helpful discussion of this matter with respect to matter that you may take judicial notice. 
    On page 24 of the Civil Liberties Union brief and may I hasten to remind Your Honor that in the (Inaudible) case Mr. Justice Frankfurter you said the -- that the court was greatly helped by the able brief of the American Civil Liberties Union, you may find that to be true here in this case.

    Mr. A. L. Wirin 
    Yes, page 24.4 of the brief of the American Civil Liberties Union, Mr. Gunawal who prepared it with your counsel at your desk. 
    Now finally with respect to the problem of severability both the constitutional amendment and the statutory requirement which we are challenging refer to the two kinds of advocacies which have been the subject of discussion and colloquy. 
    The statutory requirement is even more clear for it says that notwithstanding any other provision and so forth -- excuse me, it provides that one must attest or avow with respect to non-advocacy of these two, of these doctrines. 
    Now if Your Honors were to find the doctrines with respect to support, peace time support in the event of hostilities of a) to a foreign government as against the United States to be vague.

    Mr. A. L. Wirin 
    Your Honor it's not a clairvoyant but you say exactly what I was going to say and that is that you still have the problem of unlawful means which is in the first half of the requirement and which we think is equally vague and equally vulnerable certainly so far as requiring someone -- persons of good conscious and there's no question of (Inaudible)

    Mr. A. L. Wirin 
    Well, I think not but we would hope that Your Honors would not -- I'm going to (Inaudible) maybe that's too strong, we would hope Your Honors would not try to rewrite California legislation, we would assume that it would be fair to (Inaudible) this legislation, and if California wants to adopt other legislation, thereafter of course it is free to do so.
