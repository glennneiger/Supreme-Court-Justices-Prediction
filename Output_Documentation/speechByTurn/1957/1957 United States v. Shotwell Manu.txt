    This -- if the case were remanded to the Court of Appeals and assuming the question would be open, Mr. Christensen and I would be briefing and arguing the very question that is now here whether the case should be sent back to the District Court.

    On the basis of what you have, you've got a substantial taint on the record in the criminal case. 
    You have allegations that the Court of Appeals was led to decide the case as it did because accredited testimony which a grand jury now says was part of a prearranged scheme to defraud the United States. 
    Now, you didn't have that issue before Judge Nordbye to begin with. 
    He was considering the -- the disclosure simply as whether it was sufficient or whether it's timely. 
    The Government at that time didn't argue or present evidence to Judge Nordbye.

speaker="philip_elman" startTime="576.828" stopTime="665.553">
    Mr. Philip Elman 
    Well, we are relying on the broad provision incorporated in Section 2106 of the Judicial Code which I think is just a codification of the settled inherent power of this Court to remand the cause and direct the entry of such appropriate judgment, decree or order or require such further proceedings to be had as maybe just under the circumstances. 
    Now, certainly this Court, there's a suggestion that there's nothing before Your Honors for review, but certainly, the petition for certiorari brought the case here for review and that -- that petition wasn't denied, it was granted but limited to the issues which are now being argued. 
    Your Honors have a case before you that this Court has jurisdiction to this case. 
    And the question is what disposition of the case would be just under the circumstances. 
    Now, I -- I think it would -- the parts of the case would be exactly the same as if it were comparable in Mesarosh where certiorari had been granted. 
    If -- if these matters had come before Your Honors after a grant of certiorari, we would be as Mr. Justice Harlan indicated in the same position, we would still not be asking this Court to review the cases -- case on the basis of this kind of a record.

    What it would get down to (Voice Overlap) --
speaker="philip_elman" startTime="675.789" stopTime="736.242">
    Mr. Philip Elman 
    I'm saying -- I'm saying that when the petition for certiorari was presented to the Court along with the motion to remand, the Court had before it, the choice of really three alternatives. 
    The Court could have granted our petition in which case the case would have been reviewed on the basis of the present record. 
    It could have granted the motion to remand or set the case down for argument on that motion and then -- and we were so disposed, grant the motion and send it back to the District Court. 
    Or the third alternative that the Court would have, the alternative which -- for which -- which will be urged my Mr. Christensen speaking for all of the respondents except Mr. Huebner. 
    That third alternative would be to deny both and leave the Court of Appeals decision where it founded despite the attacks -- well, that's not the right term, despite the -- the allegations which have been made that the foundation of that decision was infected with perjury.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="736.242" stopTime="738.476">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    There are two other alternative, if I may suggest.
speaker="philip_elman" startTime="738.476" stopTime="739.264">
    Mr. Philip Elman 
    Well --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="739.264" stopTime="794.830">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    The one that Justice Harlan suggested in which you erase the difficulty and I think a real difficulty mainly, that if this Court dismisses this case as -- as though nothing was before it and I think a technical argument could be made on that fact in view of the way in which we dealt with the petition for which I do not wish to disclaim responsibilities as far as I have in the end as one person. 
    But if what Justice Harlan suggested, it sent -- its dismissal is made here or the case is sent back where dismissal is made here and it is explicitly stated that it should not be the so-called law of the case that is without prejudice for the Court of Appeals to be allowed with this motion on the merits. 
    That's another alternative.
speaker="philip_elman" startTime="794.830" stopTime="795.723">
    Mr. Philip Elman 
    Yes, sir. 
    That --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="795.723" stopTime="822.962">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Another alternative is if we have granted, we could have granted the motion there, the Government's petition of certiorari. 
    We could have granted what the Government there asked us on the merits, namely, to review the Court of Appeals held that petition and the interest of judicial decency sent this particular aspect of the case to the District Court for determination. 
    That would have been another alternative.
speaker="philip_elman" startTime="822.962" stopTime="873.933">
    Mr. Philip Elman 
    I think all of those alternatives are open to the Court as a matter of power, if I may answer you question, Mr. Chief Justice. 
    I believe there's no question as the Court's power. 
    The question is -- which will best serve the interest of justice and we think that the faster this case gets back to the District Court which -- which heard evidence in the trial lasting so -- so many weeks and had a hearing on this very motion to suppress and saw the witnesses and saw the case unfold. 
    That Court and that Court alone is in the position to determine what disposition should -- should now be made of these matters. 
    Now, I -- I think if the case went back to the Court of Appeals, that Court would have nothing that Your Honors don't have. 
    And -- and we are not coming to you with facts, we're coming to you frankly with -- with allegations but they're serious allegations and they go to the very heart of the judicial process.

    May I ask you this. 
    Suppose it -- just to find out exactly what is here. 
    Suppose these were not -- you didn't have this particular situation. 
    The Court of Appeals had held that he should be acquitted -- held that he should be acquitted because his testimony showed he was honest. 
    He was satisfied. 
    He didn't have enough conviction. 
    And the Government would have come in and say, “Well, before that's done, before you pass on, we pass on, before you pass on the point that the record show, we have a great deal of evidence to show that he was perjurer and a liar and we therefore want the case remanded to the District Court before it passes on the -- this record to make him with this conviction, to determine whether or not this new evidence we have that he's a perjurer and a liar is correct. 
    Could you do that?

    That's a judgment which is before the -- this Court for review. 
    In that situation, it would seem to me that if representations are made for this Court, which are substantial enough to justify Your Honors in concluding that a fraud was perpetrated on the Court of Appeals, I should think, Your Honors will want to do something about it. 
    I should think you would have the power at least to remand it to the Court of Appeals.

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    I think I'll express myself there fully on that in a civil case and a patent case where we held and I wrote the opinion that there was an inherent power of the Court to set aside judgments obtained by fraud on the Court. 
    The reason I'm asking you this is because according to the facts, I don't know -- I don't know why it's confronted. 
    I don't know -- I don't say that it happens a lot. 
    What -- this being a criminal case, I suppose, the Court was right that there wasn't enough evidence to convict the Court of Appeals. 
    It comes up to us and the Government said “Well, we have additional evidence and it's not in the record which shows this defendant was a perjurer.” 
    And without regard whether the record now entitled him to reverse it, we want the case remanded to have the District Court decide this new evidence as to his perjury. 
    Would that be similar to this or what would be the distinction?
speaker="philip_elman" startTime="1085.578" stopTime="1094.406">
    Mr. Philip Elman 
    Well, I think -- I think what may be troublesome in the hypothetical case you put is this.

    Mr. Philip Elman 
    But -- but that's -- that's what troubles -- what seems to me to be the source of difficulty. 
    If you got an acquittal and the jury acquits a man on the basis of perjured testimony and of course that's the end of the matter. 
    The Government can come up later. 
    Now, there's a big difference between a jury acquitting the defendant and the Court of Appeals on the review of a conviction entering a judgment whether it's a judgment directing a new trial or a judgment directing the case be dismissed or what. 
    That judgment presumably would be subject to review by this Court when this Court's review attaches, the Court has full power to make a just disposition of it without impairing any constitutional right of double jeopardy or anything of the sort. 
    Now, if -- if the Government in that hypothetical case or just to say “Well, we've got new evidence and nothing more --

    This is -- this is a pure -- a question purely for the judge sitting without the jury. 
    Judge Nordbye can hear evidence in this case tomorrow if you were so in kind, the parties were ready without reconvening -- convening a new jury without having a new trial. 
    The purpose of the remand here would be comparable to the purpose in the -- in the Remmer case. 
    There was a -- there was a doubt generated by the record as to whether justice had really been done. 
    And then this Court in the exercise of its supervisory powers was sending the case -- would be sending the case back to the lower court to find out what the facts were and do what the facts and what the law and what justice required.

    Well, there's no double jeopardy there with reference to the Government.

    Now, maybe there's something else can but that's what I'm trying to focus your attention on. 
    Let's suppose that we looked over this record, we reach the conclusion that it just wasn't enough to convict him. 
    And the -- the Government said, “Well, even though there wasn't enough to convict him, I don't want you to order the case dismissed because we have more evidence here.”

    Then you said, “But we have evidence that there was fraud committed by these people on the Court.”

    And from our point of view, the case being here, this -- this Court in the exercise of it -- of its powers could -- could make the disposition that we suggest, but I -- I don't think that anyone has urged that would violate. 
    Double jeopardy would be subjecting a man to a second trial twice for the same offense anymore than the Court of Appeals disposition in this case sending it back to the District Court for a second trial by the constitutional rights of double jeopardy.

    Mr. Philip Elman 
    Well, I don't -- I can't concede that in this particular case any appellate court would -- would direct dismissal of the -- of the indictments. 
    The only issue here is whether certain evidence should be suppressed for use at the trial. 
    There was no question at all that the evidence presented at the trial would sufficiently support the conviction --

    No, I -- I would not argue that without this evidence, the conviction would be sufficient because I -- I just don't know how much evidence would remain. 
    But I do concede that if the Court of Appeals is right in its premise that this motion to suppress should have been granted then the proper disposition was a new trial and not a dismissal of the indictment.

    We had checked the records.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Christensen.
speaker="george_b_christensen" startTime="1530.954" stopTime="1700.973">
    Mr. George B. Christensen 
    May it please the Court. 
    I don't want to waste very much of my valuable time on preliminary matters but I would like to pick up what Mr. Elman left off. 
    Number one, when this disclosure was made, every single item of gross income was disclosed. 
    You will find in you records these photostatic reproductions that show every single item of alleged gross income that has ever been called into question. 
    Number two, with respect to the so-called destroyed records, a thing that was greatly amplified by Judge Nordbye, it was not records, it was one record and as best it is described, it was a little foolscap piece of paper that had on it some notations covering a portion of the time in which over-ceiling payments were received and over-ceiling payouts were made. 
    Precisely, what its contents were, no one knows except those who made it and they did not explain it in any great detail. 
    It could not in any event have been material. 
    Now, that's enough for that. 
    And remember always that this disclosure was made in the year 1948 when the Treasury maintain and said in so many words not by oral testimony alone but by the published regulations of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue that we will allow no credit or your so-called over-ceiling payouts for raw material. 
    And I don't care what the perjury lawyers now say about how agents had to investigate how this money was spent. 
    The published regulations prohibited every agent of the Treasury from 1948 until after this indictment in 1942 from allowing a taxpayer one dime of credit for anything spent on the black-market no matter if he came in with gold engraved receipts to show who he paid it to and what he paid it for. 
    And the Court of Appeals was imminently correct and it used the only term that could possibly use when it said that the Treasury disavowed this disclosure simply because it was trying to get these taxpayers to turn informer on the recipients of their payments who of course might have proved to be tax violators.

    No, it is not. 
    I say these are preliminary matters but they came up and they apparently had been troubling some members of the Court and I wish to lay them at rest. 
    Now, as to the disclosure policy which is not precisely an issue as the argument has developed, I think Mr. Elman has embroidered that considerably by his reference to the statement saying he had to have good faith, he had to make a full disclosure and do this, but I'm not going to rely upon memory. 
    But here is what the Secretary of the Treasury said about it. 
    The simple statement -- this was his announcement, the simple statement “I have filed false tax returns and one who make the Government whole, constitute a complete disclosure.” 
    Now, later on, you've got to go in and get the tax straightened out. 
    The Treasury always has the right to make its own investigation. 
    Once you took them off, there was something wrong. 
    Measured by that test, the simple statement “I have filed false tax returns and want to make the Government whole would constitute of complete disclosure”. 
    There can be no doubt when these people went in and said they have filed false tax returns and offered and had been offering from that date of this to pay their taxes. 
    There can't be any doubt they made a good disclosure.

    Well, except -- except to Mr. Christensen. 
    Actually, this is what happened. 
    The conviction was based upon evidence which the Government was allowed to offer, after the defendant sought to prevent the Government from using it because it was supposed to have been within the disclosure policy. 
    Is that it?

    In fact all the Government saying here is we relied on certain witnesses, Busby and Sauber to establish that we should not be stopped. 
    It now develops that the defendants here secure the reversal of their conviction because Sauber and Busby in conspiracy with Cain and others, gave a story which was not in fact true and we want to show that that's the case.

    I think I have unjustly convicted this citizen.” 
    And do what you did in Mesarosh regardless of how you do it whether it'd be done directly here or whether it'd be sent back to the trial court. 
    It's very a laudable thing and is -- in keeping with the spirit of our law. 
    It's quite another thing to allow a prosecutor to come in and say, “Now, I figured out some things and they say we didn't appreciate all our evidence and I want to have another goal with this -- at this fellow.”

    Mr. George B. Christensen 
    If that be the fact, now, let's get down to a matter of policy. 
    If that be the fact, if you assume on that, the Government is not without remedy, the Court is not without remedy, you don't start out the old case all over again. 
    Clark versus the United States says that perjury does not lose the quality of contempt simply because it is perjury and you can indict these people for perjury and while we are talking about this tainted record. 
    The fact is that that grand jury that you've heard so much about sat in Chicago from some date in April 1946 until two days after this Court entered its order on February 25 and then out came this great big voluminous indictment. 
    Now, the coincidence of those dates is rather remarkable. 
    This indictment was prepared somebody sitting down at a typewriter and writing it out between the time word was flashed to Chicago that the Supreme Court had as we say in effect denied certiorari and the 27th when it was released to the newspapers and sent out to these people. 
    And that indictment does not charge these people with perjury. 
    What Mr. Elman read to you were allegations of overt acts in this so-called conspiracy count. 
    There is no direct charge of perjury against anyone of these people with respect to a single item of evidence relative to this disclosure. 
    The perjury counts that are in that indictment, be they good or bad, relates solely to evidence that was given on the trial as to the merits and in effect what they are. 
    They had the Government's chief witness was a man by the name of Lubben who has developed quite a reputation for perjury. 
    You've heard about him in one of your earlier arguments. 
    I believe Justice Brennan you insisted that the man ought to get disbarred up in your state because he's been mixed up with this fellow.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="2768.744" stopTime="2770.527">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    He was disbarred.
speaker="george_b_christensen" startTime="2770.527" stopTime="2833.460">
    Mr. George B. Christensen 
    And you got -- he's suspended I think. 
    You voted for disbarment and the Court suspended him for five years or something. 
    But in any event, the perjury in here is every time Lubben said one thing on the merits and our people who theretofore were citizens of unblemished reputations and the other, this new indictment says our people were guilty of perjury. 
    Now, that's neither here nor there but that indictment was showed on the back of the story while this part was meditating what to do with the certiorari applications. 
    And then it came out and when you read the indictment although they use the words perjury and bribery and all this in it. 
    They are in the means of allegations or they are in the overt act allegations. 
    There is nobody indicted for perjury here. 
    Sauber is not indicted for giving perjured testimony on this suppression hearing. 
    Busby isn't indicted. 
    Cain isn't indicted. 
    None of the witnesses who testified on this suppression hearing are indicted for perjury.

    Suppose as Judge Nordbye's decision in favor of the Government and an appeal by you from his decision, seeking to reverse it.

    Once that judgment be it of conviction or acquittal that that record is closed and ended and neither the trial court nor a court of review may open up that record and splice something new onto it to bolster up or support the result already achieved.

    Mr. George B. Christensen 
    But here, the defendants were -- were convicted and appealed. 
    Now, I don't think it makes any difference in the criminal case which way it goes. 
    The trial is a unit. 
    The mere fact that this was a pretrial suppression hearing, it seems to us, makes no difference. 
    It is an integral part of the trial. 
    The prosecutor proceeds at his peril and must put in his case. 
    When it is in, it is complete and you don't let him go back either of the trial court or a Court of Appeal and add something on there and say, “No, this proves I was right all along.”
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="3033.667" stopTime="3057.635">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    But you must have some legal grounds, double jeopardy I can understand. 
    But overwriting the interest of a partisan unless it offends double jeopardy is the protection of the Court against being use for corrupt purposes which has nothing to do with the interest of the party, unless the vindication of the integrity of the Court makes some inroad on a constitutional principle.
speaker="george_b_christensen" startTime="3057.635" stopTime="3125.462">
    Mr. George B. Christensen 
    Well, I think -- I think that the constitutional principle, the due process of law that has been recognized for centuries that a criminal trial can't be broken up and that it must be tried at one time is of equal importance to the purity of the courts. 
    Now, the Court need not go on to them. 
    The perjury has been committed. 
    If perjury has been committed here and the Court had been defiled, this grand jury could have indicted Sauber and Busby and these people. 
    There isn't any problem here about justice going on to then if that had happened or conceivably, it hasn't occurred currently to these gentlemen, but I would see no problem or whatsoever if this was true of the trial court proceeding upon the grounds of contempt. 
    But once you depart from the principle, you try that criminal case and there it is. 
    The Government has only such appeal as it's provided by statute. 
    It has no right to a new trial to put on new evidence or they just discovered perjury or not. 
    If there was perjury, indict for perjury and convict them if you can.

    No, the defendants by statute and by common law are given many rights from criminal cases and rightly so that the sovereign never has. 
    The rule provides that a defendant may have a new trial. 
    This -- this supports criminal rules and the laws of all the states. 
    Now, the Government's right of appeal in criminal case is circumscribed by statute and circumscribed of course quite rigorously.

    Well, I know the United States versus Sanges for the whole of my professional life and all that says is that although there wasn't a determination on the merits, the Government is not allowed on appeal (Inaudible) unless the -- unless the statute gives an appeal. 
    That's all that it says. 
    That (Inaudible) indictment which goes against the Government, you can't appeal although it doesn't touch double jeopardy as a matter of construction just as this Court have said as matter of construction, will construe criminal statutes leniently. 
    But where is the principle that when there is alleged and we must assume this is capable of proof that the judicial process had been sort that -- that this Court is powerless to deal with it.

    What you are saying, as I understand it and I want to see if I (Inaudible), you say that the when the Government was on a criminal case, it must put on all its evidence that it covers.

    You say that rule apply where the evidence off -- the evidence offered which goes to the jury in considering which goes before the Court in connection with the motions such as the motion to suppress because of unreasonable searches and seizures and so forth. 
    And it's the duty of the Government to present its evidence and even if there is a conviction that the Government is bound by that record with reference to that name if it hasn't put on all its evidence.
speaker="george_b_christensen" startTime="3440.819" stopTime="3441.359">

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    And that under -- the -- the jeopardy you say has ended when that record is examined by the appellate court on the record that you said. 
    Now, I'm -- I'm not saying your point is good or bad. 
    It seems to me that issue --

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    And that you are saying that since the Government should not be permitted after a conviction has -- after an acquittal has been -- conviction has been obtained. 
    And the defendant desires to have that conviction examined in the appellate court on the record, the Government should not be permit -- permitted to add to that record evidence which it did not see fit or could because it didn't have anything else. 
    That it did not offer in the original trial. 
    And therefore, to permit that, would violate the rule of -- of double jeopardy in the -- the jury, the man was entitled to have the jury that tried him first to act on that with the absence of some emergency like a hung jury or cyclone or storm or something that knocks the Court down. 
    And that your -- your claim that the rule with reference to the Government's duty to offer evidence is just as binding on to double jeopardy and when it examines a motion before the Court as though it was offered to the jury itself.

    Mr. George B. Christensen 
    Well I -- when I was asking a question -- answer a question Mr. Justice Harlan. 
    I think I was talking across purposes in using the language of jurisdiction. 
    I -- we rest upon that the basic concept that you just put to us now if --

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Have you had any cases -- have you had any cases? 
    Have you looked up to see if there are any cases? 
    I assume that there wouldn't be -- I don't know. 
    But I don't doubt as there'd be much dispute that the Government -- of the Government's view is to put on all its evidence in a case of the defendant's right to have that evidence, that record to his conviction, adjudged by the evidence standing before the jury. 
    It seems to me that your dispute comes in connection with the motion by the Government here to remand in order to get everything in connection with the subsidiary motion made in the case.
speaker="george_b_christensen" startTime="3596.313" stopTime="3628.384">
    Mr. George B. Christensen 
    Your Honor let me answer that this way. 
    Our research may have been insufficient but we looked and searched and I am sure that the Mr. Solicitor General did and no one has come up with a case. 
    There's a point on these facts and I think -- I think it is solid grain in the whole system of criminal jurisprudence, precisely what you're talking about no one has ever carried this kind of a point into a court the last resort where it's been reported.

    Now, there maybe something at some state courts somewhere that we have missed.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="3632.468" stopTime="3654.969">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    It seems to me that the issue that which you have say or you have raised is consistent with Mr. Justice Frankfurter's question with which I'm agreeable, in which he said, “You can't defy the Court of jurisdiction and protect itself from fraud in the absence of some constitutional barrier to setting aside a judgment.”
speaker="george_b_christensen" startTime="3654.969" stopTime="3705.518">
    Mr. George B. Christensen 
    Well, I would answer that the same way I did that the right of a court to protect itself from a verdict or a judgment obtained by fraud of course must be protected. 
    But the right to criminal process in accordance with our established processes, as a due process of law and not in violation of the double jeopardy provision is equally sacred and where the two come in conflict. 
    If they do here, you still don't have much of a real problem in the administration of justice because the Court can be protected at any time and very adequately by an indictment for perjury and indictment for obstruction of justice in the precise question --

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Do you carry the proposition which you have just been discussing with Mr. Justice Black so far as to say that on this new trial, if we should sustain your position on this motion that the Government would be stopped from using this new evidence in the new trial against these defendants before a new jury?
speaker="george_b_christensen" startTime="3754.074" stopTime="3801.233">
    Mr. George B. Christensen 
    I don't think I can answer your question precisely as you put it for this reason. 
    Well, I will tell you why. 
    The mandate of the Court of Appeals is, I will not quote it precisely, but in substance it says, “The case is remanded with directions to grant the motion to suppress and retry the case.” 
    Now, insofar as any of this new evidence goes to the question of suppression, I take it that that mandate would prevent use of that evidence for that purpose. 
    If they have other evidence bearing on collateral features --
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="3801.233" stopTime="3809.258">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Well, supposed Mr. Huebner for example would have testified now, now that he's gone over to the Government's side. 
    He didn't testify on the motion to suppress?
speaker="george_b_christensen" startTime="3809.258" stopTime="3812.475">
    Mr. George B. Christensen 
    No, he did not.

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    You suppose the Government is to be denied under the proposition that you've been supporting? 
    Do you (Voice Overlap) --
speaker="george_b_christensen" startTime="3819.606" stopTime="3850.624">
    Mr. George B. Christensen 
    Well, I suppose that under the literal language of that mandate that even if Huebner was permitted to testify, any district judge would have to say I don't care what he testifies. 
    The Court of Appeals has told me to grant the motion to suppress and I've got to grant it. 
    Well, that is the literal -- because of that strong warning of that mandate. 
    I don't see how a District Court could do anything else other than that. 
    Thank you.
