    Mr. Davis.

    Mr. John F. Davis 
    Mr. Chief Justice, the Court please. 
    In the original wire-tapping cases, Olmstead and Nardone, this Court was dealing with wire-tapping in the sense of an actual interference with the electrical circuit, either by means of attaching wires to that circuit or by means of induction. 
    The question, here, is whether the same rules apply when an extension telephone is used. 
    Here, the petitioner made a call from New York City to a certain station in Pueblo, Colorado. 
    The call was completed just as was intended. 
    It was received in Pueblo on the regularly installed instruments at the station which was called. 
    And it was at that station that at the request of one of the parties to the conversation, the two police officers listened to the conversation. 
    I think one thing is clear in this field of interception and that is, that the contents of a telephone message do not acquire a confidential status merely because the message is transmitted over the telephone. 
    Either party to the conversation, for example, may disclose the contents of that conversation to a third party. 
    And the holding of the Goldman case was that a third party could eavesdrop at the commencement of the conversation and as long as he didn't interfere with the actual means of transmission, he could disclose what he heard. 
    It seems to me that it makes no sense to draw a distinction between the situation where, Mr. Sparks, in Colorado, can hold the telephone a few inches away from his ear so that someone can overhear what has been said and where he requests the officers to step into the next room and listen in on the regularly installed telephone instrument. 
    But that is the question -- that is really the question which is before this Court. 
    We urge that Congress was intending to protect the integrity of this particular means of communication. 
    There is little or no legislative history relative to 605 which aids us in determining, specifically, what Congress intended. 
    But we do know that they legislated with the Olmstead case in the background. 
    We know that there had been before they legislated the extensive use of wire-tapping in the sense of surreptitious attaching of wiretaps in connection with the enforcement of the Prohibition Act. 
    The Congress had outlawed the use of funds for enforcing prohibition. 
    So it's in this climate that Congress passed this Act which forbids the interception and divulgence of telephone messages. 
    And the specific question is, of course, is this an interception. 
    This Court has never passed on it. 
    The nearest the Court has come to passing on this particular question is the Goldman case which it -- its reasoning be applied here. 
    We think it shows that there was no interception here. 
    The lower -- the – the Courts of Appeals have had it before them on several occasions and they are split. 
    The Second Circuit, and not quite so clearly, but probably the Court of Appeals of the District Court of Columbia Circuit, have both held that this is an interception when a person listens on an extension phone with the consent of one of the parties. 
    The Sixth and the Seventh Circuit and some of the -- and some of the District Courts have held to the contrary and their view --

speaker="john_f_davis" startTime="321.592" stopTime="389.045">
    Mr. John F. Davis 
    They say that an interception is -- is in effect the eavesdropping on the -- on the conversation and that this is eavesdropping on the conversation. 
    The Sixth Circuit, I think the reasoning and the plan of this case is -- is pretty clear which holds against the interception and they say that it is not an interception because the message begins at the place it was intended to begin perhaps and continues uninterruptedly to the place where it was supposed to be received and there someone listens and they say, "this is not an interception." 
    The -- the communication is completed as intended. 
    Our rational which -- rationale which we propose for the Court is that an interception was intended by Congress to be an interference with this method of communication and that there – there is in this case, no interference with the method of communication but rather the use of it as it was intended to be used.

    Mr. John F. Davis 
    Well, on -- on the theory which I have proposed, if it were done on a regularly installed extension phone or on a party line, there would be no interference with the means of communication and this would, again, not be an interception. 
    I think we have a stronger case here where there is consent by one of the parties.

    Well, suppose Mr. Davis, we use one of these devices that Mr. Hudson described for us that you may lay alongside as I understand with the telephone line without any attachment and in that way get the message that's going over the line.

    As to what Congress was trying to do. 
    The -- the situation of someone listening in on an -- an extension phone is so common today that the results of holding this to be an interception so that the divulgence would make for their own legality, would have far reaching effects, probably, much further than -- than Congress could have intended at the time they passed the statute. 
    It's usual -- it's customary for businessmen, for government officials, not with any ulterior motive but merely in order to have two minds on a -- or maybe a stenographic transcript have a -- a record made of what has been said, to have a secretary listen on an extension telephone. 
    And it isn't considered or -- or frequently at any rate it isn't ever mentioned.

    If, A talks to B and someone overhears them lying under the couch or something like that surreptitiously, that is not protected in the ordinary case.

    It might well -- I think that they would say that listening in -- if the listener in -- gave a -- a beep, it was certainly not wire-tapping because they authorized it with respect to a machine and so they would authorize it with respect to individuals if their presence were as disclosed. 
    Whether you can draw any conclusion if their presence is not disclosed, I'm not sure. 
    I -- I've cited that material and -- and its interesting reading but I feel that the Communications Commission just stayed away entirely from any -- from any judgment as to whether or not wire-tapping was involved when at one end of the -- of the line, some -- some monitoring of some kind was done.

    Now, there is dormant in this case and I think I will leave it to a discussion in the next case since there was a limited grant of certiorari in here but there is dormant in this case the problem of the interception if there was -- were an interception being performed by -- by state officers without any participation by federal officers. 
    And in the event that it should be held that an interception was involved, then the judgment of the court below should still not be reversed if this question -- on this question of the state officers against federal officers, the Court accepts our view that the evidence may be received in evidence when only interception by state officers is involved.

    Mr. Thomas K. Hudson 
    -- if the Court please. 
    You know it's my conception that telephone conversations do have a confidential status as between the two individuals talking. 
    We assume that A is talking to B, period. 
    And A is not talking to B, C, D and E and if he is talking to C, D and E in addition to B, he's entitled to be advised. 
    That doesn't make any particular difference what vehicle is used to connect the ears up. 
    Now, we can use a play on words and we can have extension to wiretaps or what have you. 
    They're all the same net result. 
    Congress never passed an act that should be made a nullity by a play on words. 
    They never passed an act that was supposed to become a nullity on one-billionth of a second. 
    We have a principle involved here that the privacy of communication and we're entitled to have protected. 
    If I cannot call anyone in these good United States and talk to them with freedom, then the complete foundation of communication is broken down.

    Well, Mr. Hudson, I have sat in offices almost as far as I am from you and couldn't avoid hearing the telephone conversation, not only one on this end of it but -- but the -- the instrument was so attuned that you just couldn't help hearing it in -- in much of the room.

    As I have said, the word interception is an unfortunate thing. 
    There might have been better words to be used but there has never been a case decided in these good United States that interpret interception following a dictionary and we've got a rule of law that is very, very long that says words should be given their normal meaning.

    That was detectaphone hanging on the wall and is -- is entirely different. 
    The Tenth Circuit judge wrote that and I forget who it was, it might have been Hogsman.
