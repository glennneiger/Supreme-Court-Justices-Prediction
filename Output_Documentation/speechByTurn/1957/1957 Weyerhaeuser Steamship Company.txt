    William Symmers appearing for the petitioner, the Weyerhaeuser Steamship Company. 
    This case arises out of a third-party action by a longshoreman who recovered damages from the petitioner, Weyerhaeuser Steamship Company, for personal injuries which the longshoreman sustained while working on Weyerhaeuser Ship in Boston Harbor. 
    That issue here is the right of the shipowner to indemnity from contracting stevedore which employed the injured longshoreman which supervised him in the course of his work. 
    The logbook for the day in which this longshoreman was injured is so succinct in the statement of facts. 
    Before I go into my narrative of facts, it might be helpful to the Court if I simply read the sailor's language of how it happened.

    Secondly, was the shipowner's claim in a third-party proceeding against the stevedore. 
    The judge let -- he said that he would charge the jury on both of those cases. 
    He submitted the case of Connolly, the longshoreman against the shipowner first and entered instruction. 
    He said, "If you decide against the shipowner in this case I will then instruct you later in the case of the shipowner for indemnity against the long -- stevedoring company."

    We say two things. 
    Our point here is that actually the trial court heard and not following a ruling of this Court in the line of stevedoring case and in directing the -- in the second -- in the (Inaudible) case, they showed a directed verdict for the shipowner against the stevedore. 
    And at the very least, they should have submitted the case to the jury for the jury to determine whether or not the stevedore's breach of contract with the shipowner was the approximate cause or the cause of the agent stevedore -- any longshoreman is injured. 
    I think it's -- it gets rather complicating to have these four cases or four parties involved.

    Mr. William Garth Symmers 
    Yes, sir, Your Honor. 
    The jury -- there were two counts in Connolly's claim. 
    One was negligence, a failure to provide a safe place to work. 
    And secondly, unseaworthiness causing his injury. 
    The jury found for the shipowner on the seaworthiness count. 
    In other words, they found the ship and our impertinent that we're a bit seaworthy, but they said, "You left this man work under unsafe conditions and therefore you're liable." 
    Didn't say primarily or secondarily or anything like that. 
    That was submitted.

    Mr. William Garth Symmers 
    -- to provide a safe place to work even if that place has been created unsafe by one of his independent contractors. 
    And the -- that question is then, where -- this liability has been imposed upon us with no fault other than a (Inaudible) for committing an unsafe condition. 
    We are not therefore entitled to go up against the independent contractor under his contract for contractual indemnity to recover the damages that he has caused (Inaudible) to suffer.

    Mr. William Garth Symmers 
    That would be the absolute liability (Inaudible).

    Do you contend (Inaudible)?
speaker="william_garth_symmers" startTime="466.307" stopTime="625.464">
    Mr. William Garth Symmers 
    Under the law as presently stated by this Court in Ryan, yes, Your Honor. 
    The -- the contract itself provides this. 
    It's in the record at page 65 that the stevedore agrees to faithfully furnish such stevedoring services as maybe required upon such of Weyerhaeuser vessels as are assigned to the contractor. 
    And the stevedore further agrees to provide all necessary stevedoring labor, also foreman and such other stevedoring supervision as are needed for the proper and efficient conduct of their work. 
    Now, this man had been working on in the Weyerhaeuser ship. 
    There are no -- the stevedores in port, all the 11 deck men were shore -- on shore leave, 30 some odd longshoreman taking over the ship discharging under a -- a specialized long work under their own foreman. 
    They had control of their particular portion of the ship for four days. 
    They were using a -- a winch shelter to keep the rain off the winch driver's head and winds and so forth. 
    There had been a record by this very stevedoring company. 
    They had never bothered to look at it or check it to see whether this flimsy structure which was built from dunnage and loose pieces of wood they found and about, was safe or unsafe to the vibration of the ship during the cargo operation with the wind and everything else for the last four days. 
    And suddenly a piece of wood falls off of the roof of this shelter, seven feet high shelter and lands down the lower hold on top of Mr. Connolly's head. 
    The jury thought that was a worth -- and it was worth $50,000 which we paid. 
    We say that primary duty there is to indemnify us is rather the stevedoring contractor which created this petition which would -- we hired to do this work. 
    They built their shelter. 
    They provided their own supervisory personnel and that they breached their contractual obligation to do their work properly. 
    And that we therefore, what we should've done is we moved for a directed verdict in our favor. 
    And at the very least that the case should have been submitted to the jury as to whether the -- any conduct on the part of Nacirema amounted to a breach of contract on their part so as to entitle us to indemnity.

    Mr. William Garth Symmers 
    Well, I think that the jury covered that and I tried to cover it in our brief. 
    The jury would be entitled on -- if we -- if the Ryan case is still the law, that was -- decided here in 1955, the jury would -- might have a case as to -- as to whether this particular certain type of this case were caused by a breach of contract on the part of Weyerhaeuser to that effect. 
    Now, if Ryan is not the law then the Second Circuit has a different theory of the law which they've been following for many years in the New York Court of Appeals and other courts too, which I thought had been put to sleep by Ryan. 
    And that is a theory of active primary negligence as against the passive negligence and the party who is guilty of the -- what the Court used to call so active or primary negligence to entitle the indemnity or rather must indemnify the negligence to the owner of the premises who's only negligence was passive and that he submitted the conditions to exist.

    Mr. William Garth Symmers 
    And the -- the Court of Appeals below, two of the judges, Judge Terry Waterman writing his opinion joined by Judge Medina were of the view that while the facts of our case are strikingly similar to the Ryan case, nevertheless it's distinguishable. 
    Well, it is distinguishable as all cases are distinguishable and that the trouble is that the -- in fact, it's so close that one is a little bit blinded about the principles of law, I think, it applied. 
    Now, Judge Lombard said, "Not only does Ryan apply but it's a -- it applies despite the distinction made by the majority of the Court of Appeals." 
    In -- in the Ryan case, the stevedore loaded some paper down in George Town, South Carolina negligently and then the same stevedore discharged the ship in New York and one of the employees was hurt as a result of that stevedoring negligence. 
    The shipowner was held responsible there for a failure to give the -- the person non-delegable duty, the failure to -- to give the longshoreman a safe place to work which is a non-delegable duty even though that unsafe condition has been created by the longshoreman's employer. 
    And this Court held that the longshoreman had breached the -- its contract, implied contractual obligation to do the work properly and implied and read into the contract in obligations indemnified.

    Mr. William Garth Symmers 
    Well, Ryan -- in Ryan, the unsafe condition was created in George Town, South Carolina and the action occurred in New York. 
    In our case, this winch shelter was built by the stevedoring contractor in New York and the accident occurred in Boston. 
    And for that reason, the cases become being so similar become confused when they shouldn't be. 
    The Court of Appeals, the majority of the Court of Appeals said, "Well, it's a George Town case when the stevedore negligently loaded the -- loaded the paper." 
    It was foreseeable that somebody was going to get hurt when they started discharging in New York. 
    And they read into the -- into the contract, the duty to indemnify for foreseeable injuries.The --
speaker="charles_e_whittaker" startTime="871.974" stopTime="923.777">
    Justice Charles E. Whittaker 
    But didn't the Court here find that there was an attempt (Inaudible) on the part of the steamship company, between the time of the construction of this shelter over the hatch in New York Harbor and the time the ship arrives in Boston Harbor with the shelter still on it. 
    The allegation of negligence being that the custom was and in the duty of the steamship company to remove that shelter before they left New York and they failed to do so and the predicate, that the jury's finding for the plaintiff in -- in Boston was that the shelter was still present. 
    And therefore, the steamship company was negligible (Inaudible).
speaker="william_garth_symmers" startTime="923.777" stopTime="978.205">
    Mr. William Garth Symmers 
    Well, it wasn't put to the jury solely on that -- on that issue. 
    I think the Court of Appeals had that point in mind that there -- there is evidence. 
    The evidence is uncontradicted in the record that it was customary when the stevedore has finished work in one port when the ship go to -- went on to its next port of discharge or the deck crew of the ship to tear down these shelters. 
    But the evidence is also appearing, it's overlooked in the Court of Appeals' opinion, majority opinion that the reason for carrying down those shelters has -- and not any duty to the stevedore company at all. 
    It is so that they will have room to maneuver on deck to secure the booms of the ship and so these pieces of wood won't be flying around and injure some member of the crew during the course of the voyage. 
    Those are all the reasons described by witnesses for the plaintiff which is uncontradicted in the record. 
    Those were the sole reasons for removing shelters at sea.

    Justice Charles E. Whittaker 
    Wasn't there evidence however that there was (Inaudible) this was -- the shelter is still there where it became (Inaudible).
speaker="william_garth_symmers" startTime="987.359" stopTime="1076.231">
    Mr. William Garth Symmers 
    No evidence whatsoever in that, Your Honor. 
    The Court -- there was a conflict of evidence throughout. 
    I tried to avoid that to make the facts more simple but there was a conflict of evidence at the trial, conflict of testimony, a short conflict. 
    All of the ships' officers swore up and down that these shelters had been removed and that the shelter that actually caused this man's damage is important had been constructed by the Nacirema employees in Boston rather than by Nacirema employees in New York. 
    But the longshoreman in Boston also swore that it was there when they -- when the ship arrived in Boston. 
    Therefore, by -- although they were prepared with knives -- rather with hammers and nails and tarpaulin and all the rest of equipment they needed to build shelters in Boston, they saw them already there and so, they used them. 
    And they used them for four days without inspecting in any way. 
    Now, I think the fact is they -- they took over an instrumentality, that was created by the same company, same contractors, adopted -- readopted rather, used it, never inspected it. 
    There's nothing in the record that said we were negligent. 
    Well, we -- yes, I suppose our basis of negligence is that we let it stay there or let these men use it and that would have been true whether it was built in Boston or built in New York.

    That is the only act of negligence that occurred in -- in this case. 
    There was no other act of negligence to the -- either to the stevedore employee or to -- to anyone else on the part of the shipowner in this case. 
    There was no duty on the part of the shipowner to tear this structure down at any time. 
    It was customarily done at sea solely because it's part of the squaring up of the ship and has to do with the ship and its own sailors and not any duty towards the stevedore. 
    And with -- in making a short run from New York to Boston if it left those structures there, that beyond -- that was in violation of no duty to anyone other the seaman if a seaman might have gotten hurt in the process of cleaning it up during the course of the voyage. 
    But the jury found that this structure, as it arrived in Boston was the very same structure that had been created by the third-party defendant stevedore at New York. 
    And that our liability was in permitting these men passive action of committing the (Inaudible). 
    Stevedore created it. 
    Stevedore was in charge of the men. 
    They were the specialist at discharging the ship and in supervising the work. 
    They expressly contracted to do this work properly, with the proper supervision and equipment. 
    The -- the piece of equipment which caused this man's injury was no part of the ship.

    Mr. Leavenworth Colby 
    The United States appears amicus curiae in this case because of its great importance to the Government as one of the principle operators of the merchant marine and additionally, as responsible for the subvention of the merchant marine. 
    Any increase in cost of the operating of ships falls upon the Government to a greater or less extent. 
    And accordingly, we are interested not only as the largest customer of contracting stevedores, but also as those who are responsible for supporting and subventioning other customers of contracting stevedores. 
    Now, this if the Court please, in the second phase which is the phase which is before this Court today is a suit by the customer, the ship who hired a professional stevedoring contractor to stevedore its vessel in a skillful and proper fashion. 
    In other words, it is a claim of the client against the expert of the customer against the contractor. 
    The basis of the claim is that by reason of a breach of the contact by the contracting stevedore to do the work in a proper fashion, one of the contracting stevedores own employees was injured. 
    That employee recovered a judgment against the ship on account we maintain of ultimately the negligence of the contracting stevedore. 
    And the ship having paid for that brings this suit to obtain reimbursement of the money it was required to pay out as a result of the contracting stevedore's breach of contract. 
    And accordingly we say, the concepts of primary and secondary fault have nothing to do with it. 
    The question here is purely one of the law of contracts. 
    The ship had a contract to have the work done properly. 
    The contractor breached that contract. 
    Now, I would like to look for a moment at the facts. 
    Now, Mr. Connolly, the injured longshoreman who got hit on the head with the board has been paid off some $50,000 odd and this suit is by the ship who paid him pursuant to the judgment to be reimbursed that amount because it had to pay it as a result of the breach of contract of its professional contracting stevedore. 
    Now, the facts are quite simple. 
    The ship got into New York Harbor on the 25th day of January. 
    At that time, there was a deck load on and they had to begin first to take the deck load of lumber off and then to go into the holds. 
    And when I assumed they got the deck load off, at that point, the winch man erected in New York shelters to keep the weather off of him, the snow and the rain. 
    Those shelters which were erected by the winch man, employees of the contracting stevedore for their own convenience were flimsy-like structures. 
    They're made out of dunnage, hard boards that are left around loose and they put over them tarpaulins in order to keep off the weather. 
    Now, they erected them some time subsequent to the 25th day of January. 
    The vessel was done discharging at New York on the 30th day of January. 
    So on the 30th day of January, she put to sea, at that time ordinarily, the longshoreman would have been expected to take away the stevedore's tarpaulins from this flimsy hatch shelter that they had here. 
    But whether they did or not, when the vessel arrived at Boston, the following day, that's one day later, the shelter, the hatch shelter was still in place. 
    It was visible whether there were one or two tarpaulins over it. 
    It's doubtful under the testimony in the record whether it could be certain and that's of course important because it was light loose dunnage placed on the top of the second tarpaulin which was blown off by the wind and precipitated into the hold hitting Mr. Connolly, the injured man, on the head. 
    Now -- so, we have a situation that the professional contractor built this flimsy structure for his own purpose. 
    It's a hindrance to the ship and when the ship gets ready to go to sea, it should take it off. 
    As Mr. Symmers has explained, it owes that duty to its seamen. 
    When they got into Boston, the ship's personnel say that the shelter was gone. 
    The stevedore contractor's personnel say the shelter was still there. 
    They say that they ordinarily in accordance with the custom of the trade, the agreement of parties go aboard with hammer and nails and they erect such a structure but they didn't have to do it this time because there was one up there. 
    Now, once more, I want to remind the Court. 
    The ship employs the professional expert stevedore to do the job properly. 
    Now, if there was some kind of conjuries of boards amounting to a hatch shelter that for one day had been in the possession of the vessel while it was at sea and had been blown about. 
    Proper stevedoring practice and indeed ordinary common sense would indicate that that should have been inspected by the professionals who were going aboard to stevedore the vessel and who would have to erect their own flimsy structure if they hadn't found the remains of an old one there. 
    The record however shows that they didn't do a thing. 
    They did not inspect the hatch shelter that was there. 
    They paid no attention to it and they went on stevedoring using this hatch shelter which the company had built at New York and which had been in the possession of the ship just one day at sea. 
    And after five days of using the structure during which again the record is clear, they failed absolutely to make the customary inspections. 
    Indeed, I think common sense dictates that a structure of this sort should be inspected two or three times a day. 
    The winch drivers themselves who testified for the plaintiff said that matters might be dislodged from it by wind or by the vibration of the winches in operating and that it was most important that it be secured. 
    Now, because they say that the ship had permitted the structure to remain aboard while it put to sea and came in, they are excuse from the professional duty of inspecting that structure when -- before they started to use it and through the whole of five days. 
    Now, if the Court please, it seems to me it makes a great deal of difference in this case as to whether the accident happens a few hours after the longshoreman come along or as in this case five days. 
    We believe that when a ship hires a contracting stevedore, it's entitled to have the hatch shelters or any other parts inspected immediately before they begin to use them. 
    But we don't have to worry with that here. 
    They had five days during which there should have been 15 inspections in all probability and none were made until after.
speaker="charles_e_whittaker" startTime="1922.123" stopTime="1927.103">
    Justice Charles E. Whittaker 
    You wouldn't say that if the shelters were a part of -- or had been built by the ship.
speaker="leavenworth_colby" startTime="1927.103" stopTime="2140.673">
    Mr. Leavenworth Colby 
    If they were an integral part of the ship, the situation might very well be different. 
    But of course not only are we precluded by such a judgment as a matter of common sense but the finding of the jury was in respect of the instructions on unseaworthiness that the hatch shelter was not impertinent to the ship.So, we have no such trouble. 
    However, I would point out to Your Honor that even it had been a part of the ship such as a hatch beam with the defective locking device or anything of that sort, it is well settled under the decisions that the professional contracting stevedore, the expert which his hired by the ship. 
    Now remember, the ship's personnel go ashore leaving only a couple of men around to take care of the ship. 
    They don't do anything about the stevedoring. 
    The professional stevedore is supposed to inspect and if things are not in order, he's supposed to stop work. 
    And if it's a job that the ship should do to put them in proper order then the work stops and the time is running against the ship until the ship gets around to fix it. 
    Now, that's exactly what wasn't done here. 
    In other words, this is the old familiar pattern that the contractor took the money and didn't do the job right. 
    Now, I'd like to say a word about this question, about intervening acts of negligence. 
    The Second Circuit by a very distinguished judge, Judge Waterman, thought that the failure of the ship to remove the hatch shelter was an intervening act of negligence insolating, I take it, the liability of the contractor for having built a flimsy hatch structure but by the same token, the failure of the contractor to perform its proper professional duty to inspect the shelter before working. 
    And during the course of the work for five days was an intervening act of negligence which should in turn insolate the situation there. 
    But actually, this conception of intervening acts of negligence is not appropriate to a case which involves contract rights. 
    In other words, the question we have here is when the ship allowed the flimsy structure to remain aboard when it put to sea and came in to Boston. 
    Did it breach its contract to the contracting stevedore? 
    Was there an agreement by the ship that it would for the benefit of the contracting stevedore remove the hatch shelter?Of course, the answer is, how could it be? 
    To the extent that it was left there, it put the contracting stevedore in the position that there were the remains of a hatch structure, of a hatch shelter which it could refurbish and renew and put in shape with less trouble. 
    There's certainly between the ship and a professional contractor skilled in the art could be no doubt that there was no representation by the ship that this flimsy structure hadn't been withstanding the high seas and winds in the passage from New York to Boston.
speaker="charles_e_whittaker" startTime="2140.673" stopTime="2159.531">
    Justice Charles E. Whittaker 
    In your review then legalistically, there is no difference between these facts and what would have been the situation if the ship had stayed in New York Harbor and only a night had intervened?
speaker="leavenworth_colby" startTime="2159.531" stopTime="2471.948">
    Mr. Leavenworth Colby 
    That is right, sir. 
    That's why we don't think it makes any difference whether there was one or two contracts, whether the same stevedore operated at New York or Boston or any of these things. 
    The question is, the stevedores at Boston were hired to do a proper job. 
    When they got aboard, there -- there was the remains of a flimsy hatch shelter there. 
    It was their duty to refurbish that, to inspect it because it was there for their purpose. 
    We make conjecture that the reason it was left there is very likely because it was -- was the same stevedore in both places and it saved the people doing work in the second port. 
    Idle speculation but it's the most logical explanation. 
    Now, in other words, had it been some similar flimsy structure there and a new stevedore had come up. 
    The new stevedore would owe the ship the same duty of professional skill in here to look after it. 
    And as I've said to Your Honor, even if it had been a part of the ship as long as it was susceptible of discovery by inspection, there could be no doubt about the professional contractor's duty to his customer to see that it was done. 
    Now, in the brief of the contractor, a great deal is made to the fact that it was difficult to detect that there was trouble and insufficiency in the construction of the shelter. 
    Now, that's errant nonsense because we find that after Mr. Connolly was hit on the head by a board, and the boards by the way were one inch by eight, about three and a half to five feet long, so it's little light dunnage. 
    After that, one of the winch drivers simply skipped up on top the winch and being up that high, he could see up over the top of the shelter which was seven foot high and he was able to say to his partner that, "Now, this is an improper way to put a hatch shelter together." 
    The second tarpaulin isn't secured at all. 
    They just laid it across and put two or three boards on top of it. 
    Now, that they could have found by similarly getting up on the hatch and taking on the winch and taking a look, the day the vessel came in to port. 
    It is to my mind the most abominable and shocking violation of a professional duty on the part of a contractor to its customer that has come before the courts. 
    Most of these cases involve something quite latent and difficult. 
    And you might feel some sympathy for the contractor even though he was a professional in having his men detect what's wrong. 
    But this was the most obvious matter. 
    Nothing except the claimed breach of the contractor's duty to his customer ship could possibly have permitted this to come about. 
    I think frankly it is a shocking thing that there was no criminal prosecution for the negligence in failing to inspect this matter daily so that Mr. Connolly was hit on the head. 
    So now, that is the very crux of the case, not that it was erected by the same stevedore contractor in New York but that after it had been a -- but a single day in the possession of the ship, the new stevedore contractor, because it's a different group of men even though it's the same company, the new stevedore contractor comes aboard and he doesn't do what he's paid for doing. 
    Now, we in our brief have set forth at great length the considerations of why it's necessary to have a breach of contract by the customer before the customer is deprived of his right to recover against the contractor who doesn't do the job he's paid for. 
    Now here, there can be no question that there was no breach of contract subsequent to the breach of contract by the contracting stevedore. 
    There is nothing in the testimony anywhere that suggests that the ship did anything to render the hatch shelter less secure once the stevedore contractor came aboard and started working.And that is the only kind of testimony we believe which would permit a denial of a judgment for reimbursement.

    Mr. Leavenworth Colby 
    It seems to me that the district judge should have granted the motion for a directed verdict in favor of the customer ship and against its expert contractor because --

    Justice Charles E. Whittaker 
    How could he have done that when you had just predicated in his submission to the jury the liability of the plaintiff upon the negligence of the Steamship Company in permitting these shelters to remain there?
speaker="leavenworth_colby" startTime="2511.386" stopTime="2557.221">
    Mr. Leavenworth Colby 
    Oh, but the negligence of the contractor is the negligence of the Steamship Company, too. 
    Because all the time the ship owed a non-delegable duty to Mr. Connolly. 
    And if Mr. Connolly was hit on the head by a board as a result of the negligent performance by the expert contractor of a duty which vis-à-vis Conolly, the ship had no right to delegate, there is no doubt about it if Mr. Connolly recovers judgment for negligence. 
    But it doesn't mean that the customer is not entitled to recover against the contractor to whom he delegated the non-delegable duty.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    If this had hit Connolly five minutes after it was erected, before any of the Steamship Company's officers could do anything about it, the Steamship Company would have been liable.
speaker="leavenworth_colby" startTime="2637.393" stopTime="2638.329">
    Mr. Leavenworth Colby 
    That is right. 
    Because --

    Because --
speaker="leavenworth_colby" startTime="2638.520" stopTime="2668.191">
    Mr. Leavenworth Colby 
    -- it would not have furnished a safe place for Connolly to work. 
    In other words, vis-à-vis Connolly, there is a non-delegable duty of the ship to furnish him a safe place to work but vis-à-vis, the contractor, the professional expert to whom the ship has delegated the performance of a non-delegable duty, the ship is entitled to recover reimbursement for its breach of contract. 
    Now, that's all, if Your Honors please, there is in the case.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2668.191" stopTime="2688.063">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    There is no -- there's no -- your argument gets down to this that if the Steamship Company, if the ship of taking out an insurance policy against such a judgment against it by Connolly could recover against the insurance company and the insurance company couldn't say, "Oh, you were negligent."
speaker="leavenworth_colby" startTime="2688.063" stopTime="2689.707">
    Mr. Leavenworth Colby 
    That is right.

    Do you argue that this is not (Inaudible) that has happened in Boston rather than in New York?
speaker="leavenworth_colby" startTime="2694.224" stopTime="2834.491">
    Mr. Leavenworth Colby 
    No. 
    And we think it is not different that by a circumstance, the contractor who breached his duty in Boston to inspect the flimsy structure before using it and make it safe was the same contractor who breached his duty by erecting an improper and flimsy structure in New York. 
    And the fact that in between, the ship should have torn it down does not affect the situation because there are two intervening acts of negligence. 
    And the last negligence and the last breach of contract is on the part of the contractor at Boston. 
    Now, of course we don't think that there is a breach of contract in failing to tear down the structure when they put to sea because there was no agreement to do so. 
    The jury found that there was no warranty of seaworthiness to anybody. 
    And so clearly, not to a contractor thus far a contractor is not entitled to a warranty of seaworthiness. 
    Things grow but there's simply nothing which insolates the contractor from the final breach of contract at Boston. 
    Now, of course we're very much interested in this because we hire stevedore contractors all the time. 
    And the typical situation is the ship doesn't have much in the way of witnesses because it only has two or three men aboard. 
    The stevedore contractor and the injured longshoreman, they have their people all over the ship and they will always testify for their employer and for their friends. 
    I don't mean that they would testify falsely. 
    I mean that there are people there who saw it and those people who were there who saw it are for the most part, persons who were not ship's people and who maybe presumed to be hostile to the ship.

    -- seems from what you say that it's all kind of contracts of obligations (Inaudible) stevedore or the other stevedore company, but no contracts of obligation on the part of the shipowner.
speaker="leavenworth_colby" startTime="3034.892" stopTime="3075.796">
    Mr. Leavenworth Colby 
    Yes. 
    That's the difference between the relationship of client and expert and customer and contractor. 
    When the client hires a lawyer, he does not undertake to advice the lawyer and protect him against difficulties and mistakes into which the lawyer may fall. 
    The lawyer is hired as the expert. 
    So in this situation, the ship hires the professional, skilled stevedore contractor to bring his supervisory personnel and his laborers down and do the job. 
    That's the reason they hire him.

    Mr. Leavenworth Colby 
    Yes. 
    And he has -- he has a responsibility under the decisions of this Court as to the contractors here. 
    In other words, if the contractor's gear breaks and injures the contractor's employee, the contractor's employee may recover against the ship because the ship owes a non-delegable duty to the contractor's employee. 
    And it must answer for the breaches of contract of the professional expert that he's hired to perform that non-delegable duty.

    The ship is to supply booms, adequate winches and good order with sufficient steam or current for their efficient operation, flops, topping lifts, guys, wire, or rope poles of sufficient length and strength, patch tents, lights for night work, tugs, derricks or cranes for such heavy lifts that exceed the capacity of the ship's gear and cranes in the absence of the ship's winches.

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    (Voice Overlap) whether that -- that contract because I understood you to say that made no difference.

    That's what their evidence shows. 
    The winch driver testified that he had expected to go aboard and erect a shelter. 
    He had his hammer and nails and other things available that when the ship came, he found there was one there in place. 
    So he went aboard and at no time from then until after Mr. Connolly was injured did he inspect the shelter. 
    Directly after Mr. Connolly was injured, the winch driver then got up on the winch where he could see the top of the structure which was seven feet high and looked at it and saw at a glance immediately that there were light dunnage boards merely are laid on top of a second tarpaulin.

   Argument of Patrick E. Gibbons

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Gibbons.
speaker="patrick_e_gibbons" startTime="3660.815" stopTime="3892.947">
    Mr. Patrick E. Gibbons 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court. 
    We had -- I represent the stevedoring contractor and we have two transactions here, one in New York, where we unloaded some of the lumber from the ship, and one in Boston, where we completed the unloading. 
    And Mr. Symmers who represent the ship claims that we are liable to indemnify him for negligence or breach of contract in New York. 
    And the United States Government says that we should indemnify the ship because of breach of contract which occurred in Boston. 
    I'd like to take -- take it from the New York first. 
    When the ship came into New York, it had a load of lumber which we started to unload. 
    The evidence which sustains the inference that we erected this shelter over -- over the winches is evidence given by the plaintiff's witnesses and by the ship itself that there was an invariable custom in every harbor in New York that longshoremen erected those shelters. 
    And that as soon as the work was done, the ship's personnel removed it. 
    When the contract was drawn between the ship and the stevedore that -- that custom was well-known to both sides and they must have -- we must presume that the -- the contract was made in full knowledge that that condition existed. 
    Now, the ship of course denied that there were any shelters on the decks when it came into Boston. 
    They swore that there were -- the witnesses swore there were not -- no shelters there that they would have been guilty of gross negligence if they had allowed the shelters to stay on deck. 
    The ship argues that they didn't owe us any duty to remove the ship. 
    But if that were so, we would still be responsible. 
    The were temporary shelters. 
    We'll be responsible for their condition if they had no duty to us. 
    We'd still be responsible if they caused injury to their seamen or to their -- to anybody on the deck until they were removed. 
    There's the -- we lost control of the shelters and I would think that under any reasonable interpretation, the ship owed us the obligation under this custom to remove those shelters. 
    And on the basis of that intervening negligence and that intervening if you might call it breach of their implied warranty to the implied agreement that they would remove those shelters. 
    The trial judge after the jury had returned the verdict holding that the ship was liable, the trial judge directed a verdict in favor of us on the indemnity claim. 
    And the majority in the Circuit Court affirmed that on the same basis that there was intervening negligence on the part of the ship which distinguished it from the Ryan case where there was no intervening negligence. 
    And the reason and other distinction in that case, not every -- I would think that not every act of collateral negligence that occurs in connection with the -- the performance of a contract gives rise to an action for a breach of contract. 
    It gives rise to an action for -- in tort for negligence against the contractor because he's responsible for his employee's negligence. 
    But I don't think that you can take every collateral act of negligence of that sort which occurs in connection with the loading and unloading of the ships and say that this is a breach of contract rather than this is tort. 
    And I don't think that the statute of limitations could be extended to give such causes of action after six years, benefit of the six years statute under -- rather than the benefit of the three year statute which is for negligence. 
    Now --

    The stevedore had undertaken to load the ship.

    And as a result of improper loading which was a breach of his contract, the injuries resulted. 
    In this case, there's no claim that we were negligent in unloading. 
    This was a -- a negligence in connection if its negligence at all in connection with some collateral matter, the shelter that was erected for the convenience of the employee.

    I would think so. 
    But there are -- there are collateral things which really aren't part of the contract in which I don't think would give rise to an action for a breach of contract. 
    But a part from that, the distinction made by Circuit Court that this -- the damage from the erection of the shelter in New York was not foreseeable as a damage was in the Ryan case. 
    In the Ryan case, the damage was foreseeable. 
    There was no intervening negligence. 
    In our case, once the shelter was finished, we understood and we had a right to understand that the ship would remove it, that it would not be left on standing until it got to Boston. 
    That it would not be used again. 
    It was just a temporary structure. 
    And for that reason, I think there is a substantial difference between this case and the Ryan case.

    No, when it got to Boston Your Honor, the ship turned it over to the stevedores for use as a shelter. 
    And the evidence in the case is that it looked perfectly all right when it came in to Boston. 
    There was no evidence at all that there was anything wrong with it. 
    You couldn't see it by casual inspection which -- to answer Mr. Justice Black's question. 
    I think that the law is definite that a stevedore does not owe a duty to the ship to inspect any equipment furnished by the ship for use by its employees, the American Mutual against Matthews and the Sieracki case, both hold that that if there's equipment furnished by the ship, the stevedore is entitled to use it without inspection unless it's obviously defective.

    Mr. Patrick E. Gibbons 
    Well, I think there would be no evidence to sustain a jury finding that we knew it was on top as to whether we should have known.

    Because the equipment was -- presumably, it was presumptively as it stood furnished to us for use by the -- for use by us by the ship. 
    We used it in the way it was supposed to be used and that it looked on casual inspection seemed to be all right. 
    Now, the -- the law seems to be clear that you don't owe a duty to the ship, at least the stevedore doesn't owe a duty to the ship to inspect equipment which is given to it for use so long as it uses the equipment in the way which is it supposed to be used.
