Caritativo v. California

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Number 562, William Francis Rupp, Petitioner, versus Fred R. Dickson, Warden. 
    Mr. Zirpoli.
speaker="a_j_zirpoli" startTime="11.608" stopTime="253.610">
    Mr. A. J. Zirpoli 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    In the case of William Francis Rupp, certiorari was granted by this Court to review the denial of the Supreme Court of the State of California of a petition filed by Laura (Inaudible), the sister of the prisoner in condemned role in which she alleges and set forth -- sets forth that there is good reason to believe that a defendant now under death sentence is insane. 
    And she proceeded in her petition to set forth factual allegations supporting this conclusion. 
    The warden had denied -- had refused to call the question of the sanity of the condemned prisoner to the attention of the District Attorney in the manner required by Section 3701 of the Penal Code of California. 
    Now, before reviewing the facts in the law pertinent to the instant case with the kind indulgence of this Honorable Court, I should like first to direct some preliminary observations to a question asked by Justice Felix Frankfurter, in order that thereby, we may clarify and focus as sharply as possible our attention on the specific issue before the Court at this time. 
    Justice Frankfurter, if I -- if I recall his question correctly, stated, "Does this record permit me to say I don't now have to decide constitutionality of this statute?" 
    I respectfully submit at the outset that the petitioner does not now necessarily question the constitutionality of Section 3701 of the Penal Code of California. 
    Hence, I would say in response to the question of Justice Frankfurter that it is not now necessary for this Court to pass upon the constitutionality of Section 3701 as a statute. 
    I say it does -- it is -- does not now necessarily have to question the authority or the propriety of having the warden make the determination of the sanity of the condemned prisoner. 
    The petitioner in this case does not question why did the California Court did summarily deny a petition for writ of habeas corpus where the facts alleged merely show a suggested insanity. 
    The words used in both the Noble's case and in the case of Solesbee versus Balkcom. 
    However, the petitioner in this case does insist that the California courts have the power to entertain judicial process when the facts alleged show a clear abuse of authority on the part of the warden. 
    This power closed from the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution. 
    The absolute refusal of the Court to exercise the power results in a denial of due process and because of these observations on the question propounded by Justice Felix Frankfurter, I respectfully submit that the question as suggested on page 1 of the brief by the respondent which reads, "Is the California procedure, which provides no judicial review of a warden's determination of a condemned prisoner sanity constitutional?" 
    This question in my opinion is not the proper question for this case, and while I set forth two suggested questions in -- in my brief and in the petition of writ of certiorari, I must confess that on further consideration of this case, the questions should be even more pointed and become even more precise -- precise. 
    And that the basic question here is, "Does the refusal of the California courts to grant a review of the Warden's ex parte determination of the sanity of a prisoner under sentence of execution, constitute a denial of due process when there is good reason to believe that the prisoner is insane."

    I say this that when the Supreme Court of the State of California says that it's not unconstitutional, to deny to give him a review. 
    The Supreme Court of California is for the moment setting aside the Fourteenth Amendment. 
    It is for the moment saying that there has been a suspension.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="448.803" stopTime="470.331">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Well then, setting it aside, it's construing the California statute.

    Well, I -- I --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="555.466" stopTime="564.163">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    The Supreme Court of California construed the statute, validated it and implying they had validated it on the Fourteenth Amendment, is that right?

    Yes.

speaker="a_j_zirpoli" startTime="577.650" stopTime="598.457">
    Mr. A. J. Zirpoli 
    Well, that is correct. 
    But when we look at the concurring opinion and you look at the dissenting opinion of Justice Carter, you'll find it in the concurring opinion. 
    Justice Shaw said, "I do not however concur in any possible implication that an insane person may be executed or the right of writ of habeas corpus may be suspended or denied absolutely."
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="598.457" stopTime="603.152">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Yes, but he didn't write the opinion of the Court, and it is his fair little incumbent to find out what he says.
speaker="a_j_zirpoli" startTime="603.152" stopTime="749.173">
    Mr. A. J. Zirpoli 
    That is correct, Your Honor. 
    But he expresses the opposite view and the view in the sense that I am expressing on this appeal. 
    Now, I might -- continuing with the -- with a presentation with relation to the case that Your Honors just heard and this case. 
    And that is that there are certain differences between the Caritativo case and this case, which I should like to direct the Court's attention towards to avoid the danger of a rationale that would -- that the decision which might be rendered in the Caritativo case would necessarily be conclusive on the Ruff case. 
    And the difference is, I respectfully submit are three in number. 
    The first difference is the difference with relation to the petitions themselves. 
    In the Caritativo petition, there are two paragraphs which are in effect conclusions of law if they relate to the question of the sanity -- claimed sanity of the prisoner. 
    Whereas in the Rupp case, there are 14 paragraphs relating to the claimed insanity of the prisoner which show a history of mental and physical disorder of the condemned man from the day of his birth to and including his incarceration and condemned row. 
    And I do not propose to go into all of those facts except to quote if I might from this including paragraph of the -- of a medical doctor, William F. Gray, who served on the staff at San Quentin who had seen Rupp at the time of his admission to the prison and who had visited him over a period of two -- two years in his rounds of the prison. 
    And he said, "I found William Rupp to be a deeply withdrawn child-like personality who mentally might be best be termed a low-grade moron." 
    I do not believe that William Rupp has the mental capacity to understand the nature and quality of his crime or his punishment. 
    The second difference is the fact that in the Caritativo case, there was an affidavit on file from the warden which was tantamount to a return to order to show cause. 
    In this case, there is no such affidavit on file. 
    There is no traverse of any kind for character. 
    And again, I repeat, we are bound by the phraseology and the words contained in the petition itself and the truth of which must be accepted under these circumstances if I correctly interpret the prior decisions of this Court.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Zirpoli, did he plead not guilty by reason of insanity as well as not guilty?
speaker="a_j_zirpoli" startTime="754.042" stopTime="795.722">
    Mr. A. J. Zirpoli 
    He had a trial in which he pleaded not guilty and not guilty by reason of insanity. 
    Both cases were tried before the same jury. 
    The question of the denial of due process in the trial itself had been raised in previous petitions and decided adversely by the Appellate Court and certiorari denied by this Court. 
    The question of his present insanity was raised for the first time in this petition for writ of habeas corpus. 
    I should say it was raised for the first time in a petition for writ of mandate which the Court denied. 
    And in this petition for writ of habeas corpus when it became apparent that mandamus would not lie with accordance with the decisions of the Supreme Court of California in Caratativo versus Teets.

    The more -- the substantial part of this went to a jury at the trial.

    Mr. A. J. Zirpoli 
    Not that I recall from the record. 
    The -- the case had been tried in Orange County. 
    The basic question which was raised to know or what they -- they attempted to raise -- there was no question of forces to the guilt and this old question was the mental capacity of the defendant to formulate the requisite intent on the charge of murder in the first degree while attempting to commit rape. 
    And the entire proceeding revolved on the question of whether or not certain evidence offered on the part of the defense was admissible. 
    And that was -- had been a contention made that because this was his sole defense and because of the complete limitations thereof, he had been denied due process in the trial itself. 
    All of those questions have been decided adversely to the petitioner and I, of course respectfully submit, are not now before this Court. 
    And the basic question before this Court is, "Do the facts in my opinion show -- show that this man -- that there is good reason to believe that he is presently insane?" 
    If the facts show that there is good reason to believe that he is presently insane? 
    "Was the action of the warden arbitrary, and if the action -- and if those two facts are established in the fear from the petition, does due process require that there shall be a judicial review of such finding of the warden?"

    And there is no showing in the form of a traverse or a response in order to show cause in this case on the part of the warden and in order to show -- cause issue as there have been a showing there on. 
    And of to subsequently developed then to the satisfaction of the Court that there wasn't adequate opportunity to present evidence to show the present insanity of the -- of the -- the defendant serving this sentence and awaiting execution, then it might be said that there's a basis for the findings of the warden that he does not find that there is -- there is reason, a good cause -- good reason to believe. 
    If I might state, the statute doesn't say that the warden shall find good reason. 
    Of course, I recognize he's the one who must do it but the statute says that there is good reason to believe and the warden must call it to the attention of the -- of the District Attorney.

    Let's say everyone but the warden that this man is insane. 
    And let's say that the warden then were to insist on his position.

    You don't want it.
speaker="a_j_zirpoli" startTime="1138.566" stopTime="1343.184">
    Mr. A. J. Zirpoli 
    I'm not laxing in my presentation of the case of this man. 
    Now, there are -- there are two basic arguments that the Attorney General has made and I might pull directly from his brief. 
    He says, the granting of reprieves for the reason that a condemned inmate has become insane is a matter of grace and not a requirement of due process. 
    Now, while there may be some historical basis for the argument that there were is some relationship between executive clemency and the power to retrieve. 
    The fact remains that historically and throughout the civilized world and as best as I can determine in every state of the union, the execution of -- of an insane person is deemed contrary to all humanitarian and moral principles and violates the universal sense of justice. 
    And in California, in recognition, you might say, this basic and -- and basic principle of universal justice, in the California recognition of it, we have two statutes. 
    We have Section 1367 of the Penal Code which says a person cannot be tried sentence or punished for a public offense while he's insane and as a further -- and in further implementation thereof, we find 3701 directs to warden when there is good reason to believe that the person is insane to call it to the attention of the District Attorney. 
    Now, this statutory provision is not a matter of grace, but it's a codification in the sense of the basic precept of justice to which I have previously referred. 
    If the conduct violates due process, it can't be a matter of grace. 
    Section 371 would conform -- would conform the due process when the award max within the discretion granted to him. 
    But when he disobeys the law, he completely refuses to adhere to the direction, a mandatory direction to use the language used by this Court in the filed case when he refuses to adhere to such mandatory direction that he shall call the prisoner to the attention of the District Attorney, then such refusal on the part of the Court constitutes a denial of due process and that is of complete failure to protect the prisoner who's about to be executed. 
    The District Attorney goes on and says, "Due process at most requires that the power to grant a reprieve to a condemned inmate who has become insane if he reposed in some officer tribunal." 
    He then says, "Due process does not require a jury trial or other adverse -- adversary hearing to the determination of the question. 
    Now, I would be prepared to concede both of those statements in their general sense. 
    I think that the power can repose in some officer or tribunal. 
    I do not think that it's necessary that there be a jury trial or adversary proceeding in that sense." 
    And then he says, "The procedure used in California affords due process." 
    Now, if the last call, the procedure used in California affords due process, if by that, he means the procedure proscribed by Section 3701, if followed, provides due process of law, then again, I would be in the Court ruling. 
    But the point we make, the procedure proscribed by Section 3701 was not followed in this case. 
    And hence, there was a denial of due process.

    Wherein did he not follow this proscription?
speaker="a_j_zirpoli" startTime="1345.918" stopTime="1379.167">
    Mr. A. J. Zirpoli 
    Well, he did. 
    I don't mean it in the sense that he didn't physically follow. 
    I mean it in the sense that there was -- there were facts to show a good reason to believe that he's insane, and such facts being in existence and being indirectly or not indirectly be -- being called to his attention as we had indicated that we have requested him to certify this case to the District Attorney. 
    Such fact is being called to his attention. 
    In that degree, there is a failure on his part to follow the mandate and directive, and there is the good reason.

    We hold that the Georgia statute has applied, it's not a denial of due process. 
    And I hold that 3701 as applied in this case is a denial of due -- due process because there are facts alleged, uncontradicted facts alleged which would give reason to believe that this man is insane, and therefore, he is about to violate the humanitarian policy of California against the execution of the insane.

    We are not talking here about the validity or any procedure which affects the validity of the judgment of conviction which would require a judicial type hearing.

    That the insanity at the time of the commission of the crime in an element which would go to the -- to the validity of the judgment, must be -- the determination must be made in a judicial type hearing. 
    But here, we have an admittedly valid judgment of conviction, a judgment of conviction after a trial on both the issue of guilt and on the issue of sanity. 
    The jury has determined this man to be sane, to have been sane at the time the crime was committed in all of these facts, but two exceptions were filtered through the jury.

    Mr. Arlo E. Smith 
    Which brings me to the observation that I was about to make and that is that if this Court follows its prior decision in Solesbee versus Balkcom, the only mistake the California legislature made if it made a mistake and denied due process -- the mistake it made in which resulted in the denial of due process was to grant these petitioners a greater right that was necessary under the decision of this Court in Solesbee versus Balkcom. 
    In other words, the power to grant a reprieve which is a common law of reprieve or purposes where the -- where the condemned person is insane is placed by the Constitution in the Governor. 
    Now, in addition to this, our legislature has added to the Penal Code, Section 37 -- 3701 which provides that the warden if he has cause to believe that a man is insane shall certify him to the District Attorney of the county which the prison is for trial on this question. 
    Now, under the Solesbee case, the legislature had not made such a prohibition but had simply left this power to be exercised by the Governor and to make it identical with Solesbee to have adopted the procedures which are actually utilized by the warden, that is to say reports from his medical and psychiatric stand to be furnished to the Governor, we would have Solesbee versus Balkcom right in point. 
    So that if California has denied Rupp and Caritativo due process of law, by this procedure, it has denied it them due process only because it has given them a greater right than this Court has held necessary in the decision of Solesbee versus Balkcom.

    May I suggest what you're implying is subject to comment, namely that considering the due process is what it is, an appropriate way of protecting certain rights.

   Rebuttal of A. J. Zirpoli
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3275.674" stopTime="3276.581">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Zirpoli, you have few moments.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Yes.
speaker="a_j_zirpoli" startTime="3278.562" stopTime="3431.198">
    Mr. A. J. Zirpoli 
    The Attorney General had said in responsible to a question of Justice Brennan, at least if I interpret what he said correctly. 
    He said that if there had been an assertion of a -- of a violation of the equal protections of the law's clause that the Court could entertain judicial -- judicial review. 
    Well, I just like to say briefly that I cannot see how he can consistently take that position, and at the same time take the position that there can be no judicial review if the question involved stood on another constitutional privilege and that is the privilege of due process. 
    And there was one other comment that was made and that's the fact of the four-year delay. 
    Well, I'm not here by way of apology, but the factor of four-year delay would require a -- a detailed statement as to all of the history of this case and it must be remembered that I came to this case four years ago at the appointment of the District Court under circumstances in which the petitioner and the petition previously filed had alleged that there was a violation of due process in the trial court itself. 
    But there had not been an exhaustion of the state remedies as a consequence of which and because of appeals that the petitioner insisted in taking in which I would not participate, at least as far as certiorari to this Court is concerned. 
    The case ran through the gauntlet then to determine the fact that he had not exhausted his state remedies. 
    Thereafter, I did file a petition to the Supreme Court of California for the purpose of determining that question and exhausting the state remedies if it became necessary. 
    That petition was denied, certiorari was denied. 
    And then having exhausted my state remedies pursuant to Section 2255 of Title 28, I went into the District Court and raised the question of the due process of law insofar as the trial itself is concerned and that case then went through the usual gauntlet and it was not until that point and until an effort to have the Governor commute the sentence of the prisoner to life imprisonment without possibility of parole that I came into Court and sought to establish the present sanity, the question of the present sanity of the accused. 
    Because his sanity at the time he committed the offense and that the question of where there's a denial of due process in the trial itself was a paramount importance because it went to the very innocence or guilt of the accused if he were incapable to formulate the intended -- if that were a defense, the denial of which would have constituted due process of law. 
    Hence, that is the history of this case. 
    It's an unfortunate gauntlet that one must go through in these circumstances but it's unavoidable. 
    However, regardless of justifiable or lack of justifiable cause, the question is now before this Court.
