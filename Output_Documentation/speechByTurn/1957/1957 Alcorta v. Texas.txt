    Mr. Fred A. Semaan 
    If the Court please. 
    This case is one of certiorari to the Court of Criminal Appeals of Texas. 
    The decision sought to be reviewed as a denial by the Court of Criminal Appeals of Texas of an application for writ of habeas corpus seeking the release of the petitioner from custody of the warden of the State Penitentiary of Texas for the reason that his conviction is void and that it was based on perjury and suppressed evidence. 
    Jurisdiction of the Court is invoked under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution of the United States. 
    The questions are, have the provisions of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments been violated or has an accused been afford -- afforded a fair and partial trial where (1) the prosecutor advised and encouraged the only eye witness to the killing who was also the State's main witness to deny and not to admit nor volunteer facts favorable to the defendant, which facts would have mitigated his punishment at the hands of the jury. 
    And further, where the witness, having received the foregoing advise from the prosecutor, committed perjury regarding matters vital and material to the issues of guilt or punishment. 
    And further, where the prosecutor before the trial had begun, received certain information vital and material to the issues of guilt or punishment favorable to the defendant but unknown to the defendant that such evidence was in possession of the prosecution, failed and refused to apprise the Court, the defendant or the defendant's attorney of the same so that such evidence would be available to the defendant. 
    But instead, having advised the defendant -- the witness to deny such facts, the prosecutor then proceeded to question the witness regarding these facts, received answers known to the prosecutor to be untrue, sat mute and neither informed the Court nor the defendant that the testimony of the witness was false. 
    In the trial of the case, the State of Texas, while putting on its main case, called to the witness stand one Natividad Castilleja, and after eliciting testimony from him regarding the stabbing of the wife of the defendant, Herlinda -- Herlinda Alcorta, got from him testimony that he was -- the girl meant nothing to him that she was a friend of his sister's, that he had met her at his sister's home, that his sister made statements to him to the effect that this girl is a friend of mine, she lives near you and she works near you and I'll appreciate it if you'll give her a ride home from time to time. 
    After bringing out that testimony and the testimony regarding the killing, this further testimony was elicited from that witness

    Questions by Mr. Barrera, “She's married. 
    Now, other than the time you saw or met Herlinda Alcorta at your sister's house, did you ever see her on other occasions?” 
    Answer, “Well, I gave her about two times, I gave her a ride.” 
    Question, “You gave her a ride about two times?” 
    Answer, “Yes, sir.” 
    “From where to where?” 
    Answer, “From where she was working to her house.” 
    And then again, “Natividad were you in love with Herlinda?” 
    Answer, “No.” 
    “Was she in love with you?” 
    “Had you ever talked about love?” 
    “No.” 
    “Had you ever had any dates with her other than to take her home?” 
    “No. 
    Well, just when I brought her from there.” 
    Question, “Just when you brought her from work?” 
    Answer, “Yes.” 
    The defendant then took the witness stand in his own defense after the State addressed it and testified about his wife's misconduct with several men including this witness, Castilleja. 
    He test about -- testified about her neglect to the children and the circumstances under which he found her immediately before the stabbing. 
    And he testified as to how all this affected him in his state or condition of mind at the type -- at the time of the stabbing and the -- I'd like at this point to read just a few excerpts from his testimony on those matters. 
    And I'm reading now from page 30 of our brief. 
    “From there I went to see my wife.” 
    Now, he's testifying -- testifying may I explain at this poin, with regard to a matter of time just a few minutes before the stabbing. 
    “From there I went to see my wife but I didn't see my wife alone or in the house or getting in from work or anything like that. 
    She was with another man in a car.” 
    Although he was here saying it was the only time he had seen her.

    Although he was here and saying it was the only time he had seen her, “I have seen him several times in the radio club dancing and she was with that same fellow and not only with that same fellow but with many others that I don't know the names of. 
    That's when I saw her in that place. 
    I didn't really have the intentions, that like, Mr. Barrera, has got in the statement, that I have decided to kill her right there. 
    I didn't have those intensions. 
    I only went to the car and this guy started -- well getting mad and all that. 
    Well, I never did carry a knife, either, because I had turned my job in and I was going away.” 
    Further down, “When I was getting to the car,” this is on page 31. 
    “When I turned the corner I saw my wife was kissing with this fellow. 
    I didn't know him then, I saw him dancing at the radio club up there. 
    She had so many that I don't remember their names. 
    I wouldn't be asking for that. 
    I just saw her and that's all. 
    And I saw them and they were kissing and I thought they were having a date up or something. 
    She had the door open, yes, but I had a feeling that something else was going to happen then, not only that they were kissing and all that but something else. 
    If I had a camera and waited a little longer, it would have been a different story than what they claim up here now.” 
    And then on page 32 or 35 at the top of the page, “I stabbed her. 
    I mean, I was just all carried away when I saw her with that guy and all of that. 
    I was drunk. 
    You get a man like that to think of everything like that and you get carried away and mad.”

speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="489.997" stopTime="493.073">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Under your Texas law does the jury fix the death penalty?
speaker="fred_a_semaan" startTime="493.073" stopTime="734.036">
    Mr. Fred A. Semaan 
    Yes, they do, Your Honor. 
    Under Texas law, murder is divided, so to speak, into two categories, murder with malice which is punishable by confinement in the penitentiary from two years to life or death in electric chair. 
    Included in that is the offense of murder without malice.The punishment for that is confinement in the penitentiary from two years to life and no more. 
    And on page 6 of our brief referring to Article 1257b Penal Code of the State of Texas and all the cases tried under the provisions of this Act, it shall be the duty of the Court to define malice or forethought and shall apply that term by appropriate charge to the facts in the case and shall instruct the jury that unless they find from all the facts, in all the circumstances and evidence that the jury believes the defendant was prompted and acted with his malice or forethought they cannot assess his punishment at a period of longer than five years. 
    The following article defines murder without malice. 
    Murder without malice is a voluntary homicide committed without justification or excuse under the immediate influence of a sudden passion arising from an adequate cause by which is meant such cause is what commonly produced the degree of anger, rage, resentment or terror and a person of ordinary temper sufficient to render the mind incapable of cool reflection and in connection with that I think we should make some reference at this point to Article 1257a on the preceding page, page 5. 
    In all prosecutions for a felonious homicide, the State or the defendant shall be permitted to offer testimony as to all relevant facts and circumstances surrounding the killing and the previous relationship existing between the accused and the deceased, together with all relevant facts and circumstances going to show the condition of the mind of the accused at the time of the homicide which may be considered by the jury in determining the punishment to be assessed and then it goes on to include the Suspended Sentence Act or Law rather. 
    Now, our position is this that the defendant under Article 1257a certainly had the right to tell and to show the jury, the circumstances under which he found his wife. 
    The suspicions that he had had about her conduct for sometime, suspicions that were confirmed when he woke up and found her under the circumstances, he said he did. 
    And since he had that right, he had the further right to be corroborative in his testimony regarding his state of mind by the honest and the unpurged testimony of the witness, Natividad Castilleja, who, had he told the truth would have corroborated the defendant or the petitioner to the extent that the jury, undoubtedly, in my mind would have come to the conclusion that what this man says is true, the conditions under which he found his wife are true and they are conditions that probably would render the mind of a man incapable of cool reflection and a killing under those circumstances is murder without malice and the punishment cannot be more than five years.

    Mr. Fred A. Semaan 
    That would be murder without malice. 
    The fact that Castilleja's testimony didn't corroborate but contradicted the testimony of Alcorta, damaged him I think more than anything in the trial of the case and brought about the death penalty at the hands of the jury.

    He said I've been going with her for several months and I've had intercourse with her five or six times. 
    The prosecutor took the position that, well that's not admissible, so I'm going to advise him not to tell about that, don't volunteer it and deny it because it's not admissible.But if you're asked anything, answer truthfully. 
    Then the prosecutor in the trial of the case asked these questions regarding the relationship that existed between the witness, Castilleja and the dead girl knowing that there had been acts of intercourse, having been told by the witness and sat mute and did nothing and said nothing to no one.

    Mr. Fred A. Semaan 
    “Did Gus Garcia asked you this question, if you did not in fact tell Castilleja that they did not have to testify by this relation with Herlinda Alcorta?” 
    Answer, “Whether he asked the question?” 
    Question, “Yes.” 
    Answer, “Yes, and did you not give this answer?” 
    “Yes, I told him it was not admissible unless brought up by the defense.” 
    “Did you give that answer?” 
    Answer, “That's not the full answer I gave him.” 
    Question, “Did you give that much of it?” 
    Answer, “Yes I did give that much of it. 
    Yes, I did that -- that much of it.” 
    “Alright, now go on further. 
    Alright now, did you go on further then and say that the defense had never introduced the question of Ms. Alcorta's infidelity and if they had you would object it?” 
    Answer, “Yes sir.” 
    “You said that?” 
    “That's correct.” 
    “But you did tell Mr. Garcia that you had advised Castilleja, the witness, that he did not have to testify about his relations with Herlinda Alcorta because in your opinion it was not admissible.” 
    Now, on another occasion, the same prosecutor, Mr. Barrera wrote a letter to the Board of Pardons and Paroles which was introduce into evidence in the hearing on the writ and in that letter, beginning on page 114 of the printed record, however, I refer now to the top of the page on 115. 
    Now, this is the prosecutor and an affidavit to the Board of Pardon and Paroles speaking of the taking of the statement from the witness Castilleja and thereto after the killing. 
    He verified that statements contained there were true. 
    There was nothing in the statement with respect to his ever having had sexual intercourse with the deceased, Herlinda Alcorta. 
    Pete Torres and I pressed him further and stronger about prior sexual relations with the deceased in this case and after a short time he finally admitted to Mr. Torres in that -- that he had sexual intercourse with her approximately four or five times, the last time being -- having occurred approximately one or two months before the night of the homicide. 
    He denied empathically that there'd any misconduct on his part -- on his or her part on the night of the homicide. 
    Then further down, the letter is -- is a very long one and -- and consists of some several pages even in this printed record, but in this letter he goes on to explain that I told him that if anyone asked him about that to deny it because in my opinion, it's not admissible.

    What he should do or say if someone wanted a statement from him to which I answered that he could give them a statement if he wanted to but certainly he did not have -- have to. 
    Needless to say -- say, I told him that I'd prefer that he did not, in view of my past experience with defense attorneys taking statements from the witness -- witnesses such as the -- such as this filed to a state case and who by force as certainly we'll know a little further on.

    Yes, I think it did.

    On page 121 of the record, beginning at 121, on page 123 or at the bottom of 122, “I want to be clear about this that Torres, this is Castilleja speaking.” 
    Torres never actually told me to deny that I had intercourse with Herlinda Alcorta, what he told me was this, “If you want to say it go on and say it, but if you don't want to say it then don't say it.” 
    He was talking about the testimony that I was to give when I was told there's a witness in Court.” 
    I had already admitted to Torres that I had intercourse with Herlinda Alcorta and he knew that I had.

    Your brief?
speaker="fred_a_semaan" startTime="1582.577" stopTime="1774.135">
    Mr. Fred A. Semaan 
    Yes. 
    Would it not have been the honorable and honest thing to do, Mr. Barrera, if you wanted to see that this man had a fair and impartial trial, when you heard those answers knowing that the man had had intercourse with her to notify the judge has to the true answers of the true facts. 
    Answer, “Mr. Seeman, the honorable thing is never to approach the bench with the facts of the case as I have often seen it done to try to influence the judge one way another.” 
    Question, “You never took it upon yourself in spite of the fact that the occasion never rules, you never felt it was your duty or took it upon yourself to tell the judge about that either before the trial or after the trial, either before this testimony was elicited or after it -- after it was elicited -- elicited, did you Mr. Barrera? 
    Answer, “Not anymore that so that I felt it was my duty to tell him about the character of the defendant, Alvaro Alcorta, or not more than the misconduct of Alvaro Alcorta knowing myself whether it is inadmissible to begin with. 
    It was not out of the ordinary to instruct any witness not to volunteer any information and -- and to answer only the questions asked of him truthfully.” 
    “Did you ever take it upon yourself, Mr. Barrera either before the trial or after the trial or before this testimony was elicited, this testimony I have just read you and you -- read to you and you have acknowledged either before it was elicited or after it was elicited? 
    Did you take it upon yourself or a feel of duty to inform the attorney for the defendant of the true facts regarding the relationship between Herlinda Alcorta and Natividad Castilleja?” 
    “Not anymore than I would feel it was if -- if there was a duty upon him to tell me what the defendant may have told him or the true facts of the killing as it might have occurred as he knows it.” 
    The point is this, from my reading and my interpretation of the facts in the record in this case, the testimony of the prosecutor Barrera and the hearing on the writ of habeas corpus the -- the testimony of the prosecutor Barrera and the hearing before the Board of Pardons and Paroles on commutation, the -- the affidavit of the -- of the witness, Castilleja. 
    All those things lead me to believe and I could be wrong but I sincerely feel that there was at least some subornation of perjury where he tells him, “You don't have to say this or that or the other unless you want to.” 
    But he always asked if you -- if you are asked answer truthfully. 
    Then when he on direct examination, after taking this position that those questions are not -- are not admissible, you can't go into them and if you do I'm going to object as to the questions regarding the relationship himself before the defendant has ever taken the stand, before he's had an opportunity to raise any kind of defense, ask those question and get answers that he knows are not true and say it's mute.

    Mr. Fred A. Semaan 
    Beginning on page 71 of the record where I think that part is a little further on. 
    No, that's wrong. 
    On page 72, that's not -- we're speaking -- Roy Barrera is on the witness stand and the hearing on the writ and he's being asked questions regarding his testimony before the Board of Pardons and Paroles. 
    “Did Gus Garcia ask you this question if -- if you did not in fact tell Castilleja that he -- that he did not have to testify about his relations with Herlinda Alcorta.” 
    Answer, “Whether he asked the question?” 
    Question, “Yes.” 
    Answer, “Yes.” 
    “And did you not give him this answer?” 
    “Yes, I told him that it is not admissible unless brought up by the defense.” 
    “Did you give him that answer?” 
    Answer, “That's not the full answer I gave.” 
    Question, “Did you give that much of it?” 
    Answer, “Yes, I did.” 
    Question, “Alright now, did you go further then and say that the defense had never introduced the question of Ms. Alcorta's infidelity and if they had, you would have -- you would have objected to it anyway?” 
    Answer, “Yes sir.” 
    Question, “You said that?” 
    Answer, “That's correct.” 
    But you -- question, “But you did tell Mr. Garcia that you had advised Castilleja that he did not have to testify about his relations with Ms. Alcorta, Herlinda Alcorta, because in your opinion it was not admissible.” 
    Answer, “I told him in addition to the proposition which is not in here that he should not and must not volunteer any information unless the question was asked of him, in which event certainly he had to tell the truth.” 
    I think he's saying practically the same thing himself right there.

    Question, “Mr. Barrera, going back to the taking of statement on July 20th, is I believe of 1955.” 
    “Yes sir.” 
    “You were present, and Mr. Torres was present and then Natividad Castilleja was present.” 
    “That's correct.” 
    “Just what did you tell Natividad at that time and place?” 
    The situation as I recall it was this, Mr. -- was this. 
    “Mr. Torres had been talking to Castilleja. 
    He had a statement in writing already and asked me to go in there and look it over and look at it before the witness signed it. 
    At that time I went in. 
    I read the statement. 
    I ask Castilleja if the statement contained therein was true.” 
    He said, “Yes.” 
    “I had a conversation with Mr. Torres in private. 
    I asked him whether or not he -- that -- that he asked if there was -- if there was or was not any intercourse between Natividad and -- and the deceased in this case.” 
    He said, “He wasn't too satisfied about that.” 
    We both then went back in and continued to ask him questions about prior acts of intercourse. 
    He finally admitted that he had had intercourse with Herlinda Alcorta on several occasions. 
    I asked him whether or not he had had intercourse with Herlinda on the night in question, that is, the night of the killing and he emphatically denied it. 
    He, as I recall was reluctant to sign a statement, with any statements contained therein about intercourse. 
    I was told at the time that the fact Alvaro Alcorta whose confession I had taken approximately or had been present at the time it was taken approximately a week or possibly two weeks before, that at the time of the taking of that confession from Alvaro Alcorta, he gave me no indication that he knew of any misconduct on the part of his wife. 
    That being the situation and not being a -- that being the situation, not being a price of it then such a situation could not have entered into his mind at the time he committed the killing in this case could not have contributed to it. 
    Keeping further in mind the obvious education or possible lack of education on the part of Natividad Castilleja and the possibility that there's -- that is always present in any case that a witness may later decide he will not get on the stand and tell you what he knows or the possibility of having to refresh his memory from the various statement you've taken from him or the possibility of arising of having to impeach him with the statement you have taken that those things certainly would be immaterial to the all over -- to the overall situation in this case especially at -- at that time there being no sure answer to that.

    Yes, sir. 
    That's on page 78. 
    I told Mr. Torres to go ahead and wind up the statement and leave those things out. 
    I told him, however, to put the information in the overall jacket which is a matter of public record and -- and contained therein at -- at this time -- contained therein at this time. 
    I told Castilleja at the time, an answer to his question, what shall I do or say if someone comes out to see me because I asked him has anyone been out to see you. 
    He said, “Nobody has been out to contact me.” 
    He says, “What shall I do if someone comes out to see me?” 
    I said if someone comes out to see you and wants a statement from you, then you may give them a statement if you want. 
    You don't have to give a statement if you don't want to. 
    I would prefer that you do not. 
    Now, speaking about putting this information in the jacket and this being a matter of public record, in this record Mr. Barrera, in the hearing on the writ, admitted that had any attorney, Alcorta's attorney or anyone else before the trial was over, came in and asked to see that information or to see that jacket that he would not have given it to him. 
    I asked him a specific question. 
    I asked him, “Would you after the trial wasn't over but in due time to raise all these on newly discovered evidence? 
    Would you give him that information?” 
    At that time he said, “No, not until the appeal is over and everything is closed. 
    But he, in several instances in the record, he refers to all this information being in the jacket and being a matter of public record and that all or any attorney had to do was to get custody, has his name off the indictment, go out and see him and get the same information. 
    However, he seems to overlook the fact that he has told Castilleja on several other occasions not to -- not to see anyone, not to talk to anyone, not to give anyone any -- any information at all.

    Mr. Fred A. Semaan 
    Yes. 
    But the -- the harm was this. 
    What he testified as to what his state of mind was -- was true and had he been corroborated by Castilleja, who might have said in effect that what this man suspected of my conduct with his wife was true and that we were hugging. 
    We were kissing. 
    We had done it before. 
    The jury would have believed and beyond the shadow of a doubt and probably would have felt that he had adequate cause to become enraged and angered and -- and put himself in a situation or state of mind were he was not capable of true reflection. 
    But when Castilleja says, “No, that's not true. 
    She's just a friend of my sister's. 
    I never had anything to do with that. 
    I was just giving her a ride home.” 
    The jury got the impression or felt this way. 
    That he not only killed his wife but now he is up here lying about it running down a reputation. 
    And the -- they, the jury, were in a frame of mind then where they were even more angry at him. 
    Angry because of the killing and angry because of what he was doing to her reputation. 
    That was the -- that was the real damage by the testimony of Castilleja. 
    Now, jury got this sort of picture. 
    That from the testimony of Castilleja, that -- that Alcorta for no reason at all and without just provocation or without any mitigating circumstance or reason, stabbed this well-behaved wife and mother when the truth of the matter is and if Castilleja had told the truth and corroborate it, the jury would have seen that he did kill his wife but she wasn't an innocent, well-behaved wife and mother. 
    She was running around just like Alcorta said she was. 
    She was in this man's arms just before he stabbed her and the sight of her in his arms so inflamed him that he couldn't reflect coolly and under those circumstances he stabbed her and under those circumstances, it's a murder without malice.

    She was telling me to tell your sister to call me so that we can go to church together in the morning. 
    I don't think they were talking about going to church. 
    Two people, by -- who by the admission of -- of Castilleja had been out together many times and had intercourse together many times and the record shows him at the house on other occasions as --as they were on this -- on this occasion when the stabbing took place.

    I take that to mean that after he brought her home, they pulled up in front of the house and had intercourse in the car just like they were about to do on this occasion when the defendant walked up himself.

    And that leads me to believe and I think anyone must have seen them from that if he was doing just what he did on other occasions.

    I will desperately, in the time that I have, attempt to show some of the misconceptions of the record that Mr. Semaan has, I imagine, inadvertently left before this Court.

    Mr. Roy R. Barrera 
    Yes, Your Honor, I certainly did. 
    Now, the reasons I will get to those questions that I do certainly intend to get to but I wanted to get on the proposition here of the overall picture and what brought about this matter here. 
    The killing as it took place and the facts of this case and some of the facts that we appeal the Court must have before it in order to properly determine what took place and the reasons that it did is that approximately 30 days before the deceased in this case, Herlinda Alcorta, died at the hands of her husband she had been threatened with serious bodily injury and death by her husband as a result of which he was placed under a peace bond 30 days before he killed her. 
    That -- that is reflected of course in the record on page 173 and also in his confession where he admits that he was placed under a peace bond by Judge Teilborg. 
    Two days before he took his wife's life, Alvaro Alcorta again threatened to kill her and then made statements to that affect which are reflected on page -- in the record -- 133 stating that, “I'm going to get even with her,” and stating that he intended to leave his job at Kellyfield that he was going to kill her and that he was going to go to Mexico. 
    Stating further as reflected in the record again page 133 to a barmaid that he was drinking beer with, “You're going to read about me in the paper on Monday.” 
    He admitted that he had his suitcase packed in a saloon and ready to go as is again reflected in the record in page 180. 
    He did in fact quit his job as reflected in one -- page 139 and thereafter, on the morning of the 19th -- Sunday morning of the 19th he did in fact stab his wife to death with a knife 32 times.

    Alcorta, the -- the defendant. 
    On the stand he said that he had gone over to the house to see his children at that time which is 1 o'clock in the morning. 
    That certainly did not coincide with the prior threats that he had made a month before or two days before -- immediately before and with his statement to this barmaid, “You're going to read me about me in the paper Monday.” 
    Now I'm getting to the admissibility of the testimony which was before the Court. 
    We have to take also into consideration the confession which was given by the defendant, Alcorta. 
    In which he relates these prior threats, in which he stated that he -- the reason that he had killed her on being asked the specific reason was that she was going out and not taking care of the kids.

    I asked in this question as to whether she had -- he had seen his wife with Natividad Castilleja. 
    “You didn't have an idea that that was your wife dancing with Castilleja?” 
    “Sure it was. 
    I wasn't too sure. 
    I wanted to make everything sure.” 
    “You just can't see?” 
    “You just can't when you see your wife and you can't tell him with a guy. 
    You can't tell him why I'm going to knock the block off of him. 
    I've got to find out.” 
    “Then you weren't sure that was your wife at that time?” 
    ”Yes, I was sure it was my wife. 
    I saw it when she climbed those steps.” 
    “Then you did know it was you wife, he was sure it was your wife.” 
    “Yes.” 
    “Didn't you?” 
    And answer, “She was dancing with a man.” 
    “Why didn't you do anything about it at that time?” 
    “Well, I didn't. 
    Well, I wasn't sure like I tell you.” 
    “Sure of what?” 
    “Well, that she was going around with him or anything like that. 
    I had to find out.” 
    “She was dancing with him,” is the question. 
    Answer, “Well, that don't mean nothing.” 
    Question, “That doesn't mean anything, does it?” 
    Answer, “No.” 
    Question, “If she was dancing with these other fellows that doesn't mean anything either?” 
    Answer, “A lot of times, I used to take her down to the dance hall to dance because I didn't dance, I was that good to her.” 
    Question, “The fact that you dance with other people occasionally, that doesn't exactly mean that there's anything wrong either, does it?” 
    Answer, “Not exactly, it depends.” 
    Question, “So when you saw your wife dance with Castilleja, if you saw her.” 
    “I did saw her.”

    “No, not dancing.” 
    “I see. 
    Well, did you ever see them doing anything wrong?” 
    “Well, not exactly except that night when I saw them there, the last night I saw them there.” 
    “And that's the night you told us in detail here about in your confession.” 
    “Well.” 
    Question, “Is that right?” 
    “And that's the same night that you failed to tell us anything about Castilleja kissing your wife.” 
    “Well, I didn't told you, I just didn't remember.” 
    Then, he again, goes into the question as to why did you kill your wife? 
    Isn't that why you killed your wife? 
    Because she was kissing Castilleja up on he's having -- now made the statement in open court that that was the reason. 
    He says, “In a way, yes, sir. 
    And she wasn't taking care of the kids either.” 
    Now --

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    But he says up there a little are there like, “I told you, if I had had a camera and waited a little longer, it would have been a different story. 
    I would have brought the picture and showed it to you.

    Mr. Roy R. Barrera 
    Yes. 
    Now, in the confession, I asked him and in -- during the time that he was on the stand, I asked him why didn't he tell us about these things, about the kissing, and about what he thought that was going to happen and what they were going to do and he says if I did -- “I know I didn't tell you if I had told you, I know that you wouldn't have put it in there.”

    Yes, but there -- there's something you left out there.

    I would've brought the picture and showed it to you.” 
    “Isn't that why you killed your wife?”

    Let me ask you this question. 
    These questions can be answered -- just were made be to be perhaps. 
    Did they or did they not leave the minds of the jury insofar as this witness concerned and he is the one who would know more about it than anybody else, that his relation with this woman were innocent relationship? 
    Isn't that the sum total? 
    That they had known that they were -- that there -- that there was no amorous relation between them.

    Mr. Roy R. Barrera

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Well, I -- he says very well and I will submit that what love is in here, has many meanings but will you be good enough to answer the question whether the questions and answers they're proposing by Judge Morrison, did they or did they not? 
    Assume you're tendering him as -- as a witness tell the jury on his testimony. 
    He tells the jury he did not have amorous relation with this woman.
speaker="roy_r_barrera" startTime="4214.363" stopTime="4224.775">
    Mr. Roy R. Barrera 
    The Judge, there's nothing in there about amorous relations. 
    That's -- that's what -- the point that I'm trying to leave which the Court and make and that is that he was not asked whether he had sexual relations or --

    Yes.

    No, well just when I brought her from there.

    Mr. Roy R. Barrera 
    The thing that was foremost in my mind, if it please the Court, is the fact that Alcorta, not having known about it, therefore, if they were and certainly they were that it was inadmissible and immaterial to his reasons for having killed her.
speaker="tom_c_clark" startTime="4689.438" stopTime="4699.324">
    Justice Tom C. Clark 
    Well, that's true but if you were to prosecute her or would -- for fairness, did you not, Alcorta?

    But do you think it was fair for you to leave an impression with the jury that this man whom you knew had had a series of absolute (Inaudible) and not taking her just home from work but had taken her via a vacant lot, at his house before he took her home is that --
speaker="roy_r_barrera" startTime="4722.868" stopTime="4753.404">
    Mr. Roy R. Barrera 
    The dilemma that the state was in at the time if it please the Court was had -- had we sought to introduce these acts of intercourse as a motive so to speak that we would have been reversed. 
    Because again, the crux of it being that not having known about him that we could not either attach him to him as a motive nor could we permit him to come in and use it to mitigate or to minimize the offense that had the State introduce that, it would have been just as inadmissible for us.
speaker="tom_c_clark" startTime="4753.404" stopTime="4805.147">
    Justice Tom C. Clark 
    So, I can understand that. 
    I'm talking about your action in asking these questions. 
    I can see why you wouldn't give a statement that he had made from the other side possibly although most (Inaudible) but where you take a statement and you know and you provide the statement is (Inaudible) as you did here and put one in the file and another in the summary section of the file. 
    And you knew one of these acts and still you asked him a question at least the impression with the jury his answer there that all he did was to run from work to whom each time when you know that's not true yourself.

    He could -- yes, he could have corroborated only his kissing, he could have corroborated the dancing which he said was the reason that he killed her or -- or that is that she was kissing Castilleja and not taking care of the children and he could not go beyond that to corroborate anything because it was not in his mind it could not have affected it.

    And left the impression with the jury that the relationship was perfectly platonic was doing nothing wrong with it. 
    Now, Mr. -- the defendant, just comes along and testifies that he looked into the car and he saw them kissing and embracing. 
    Now, whether he had any -- any knowledge, personal knowledge of intimate relationships before, would it not have been proper cross examination of Mr. Castilleja to ask him if he had had intercourse with this -- with this young woman because if he had, wouldn't there've been a greater probability that the defendant was telling the truth as to their kissing in that car than if there had been no sexual relations at all between the two?

    Mr. Roy R. Barrera 
    Castilleja was never asked a direct question by the defense attorney as to what they have been doing there. 
    There was no dispute, no particular issue made with respect to the kissing or the non-kissing in the automobile, in fact accepting it as a fact on the part of the State that's why we predicated the question isn't that why you killed your wife because she was kissing Casitlleja. 
    That's when he said yes and because she was not taking care of the children.

    Mr. Roy R. Barrera 
    -- we didn't even have the slightest indication on their part as to the fact that they even intended to use anything on the love making, in fact their defense was directed at the throwing of a rock. 
    Now, when Castilleja was on the stand, he was not asked about kissing. 
    He was not asked about hugging.

    Mr. Barrera, If you put to your mind the difficulty with this case differently I see it that's your problem. 
    I quite understand your -- the bigger problem of the issue namely, that fact is not known to a person who commits homicide are not admissible to prove that the homicide is murder. 
    If he didn't know it, the argument is in those cases if he could -- he couldn't say that he was in play as to that probability.

    As the result of that knowledge, yes, sir.

    You put him on the stand before you knew about what -- of course to be of what's certain. 
    Certainly before you do what he's going to -- nothing that came out of his mouth on the record, that came out as a result of your questioning. 
    And you asked him questions which are repeated, could have left no other impression on the jury's mind than the man in the room the victim was involved had innocence, that it was only platonic relations, is that right?

    At the time that you knew that the relation has not been platonic you tended the witness, you got him to testify and therefore affect the mind of the jury that the relation was one thing, what you knew very well at the time, that was something to be off.

    -- et cetera. 
    Already is irrelevant to the issue. 
    I put it to your view. 
    All that is irrelevant to the fact that you put a witness of yours down the witness stand and got him to testify for all practical purposes to the jury listening to this man you knew he must have been interested or effective to the defendant himself. 
    He was the most important witness, wasn't he?

    Yes he was.

    And for all practical purposes, the questions and answer with Judge Morrison that set forth in his opinion are exactly the same as though you'd turned this (Inaudible) Castilleja. 
    Did you not on your relations with this woman innocent and he would've said yes, that's not the issue with this question and answers amount to. 
    That isn't the question you put. 
    You didn't ask him in those words but the question you asked and then answer he gave add up to saying “my relation to this woman was --”.

speaker="hubert_w_green_jr" startTime="5606.968" stopTime="5705.291">
    Mr. Hubert W. Green, Jr. 
    May it please the Court. 
    First thing I'd like to do would be to answer some of the questions that were asked here a moment ago and to clear up some of the impressions that perhaps were left as to the record as to Mr. Justice Brennan's questions and Mr. Justice Clark's questions. 
    The question that was asked by Mr. Barrera was as to the number of dates that the witness had with the deceased Herlinda, and he said, “I had dates on the occasions that I brought her home,” and that's correct, that is truthful. 
    And so the thing that I'd like to make at the very outset is that we don't feel and we have never felt that the petitioner in this case has convicted the witness of perjury to begin with. 
    In other words, in order to have subornation of perjury in order to knowingly use perjury by the prosecutor, there must be showing of untruth. 
    And when he answered that, he answered truthfully. 
    The dates that I had, “I had no dates other than when I took her home,” and that's exactly what he said and that's what he testified too, later. 
    Even as to these -- as he said three or four -- or four or five or five or six, occasions of intercourse. 
    He said those occurred on those occasions and you'll notice here in the record when Mr. Semaan was questioning the man.

    Mr. Hubert W. Green, Jr. 
    Yes. 
    That the occasion in which he took her home. 
    In other words, his answer was, “I had no dates other than the occasion when I took her home,” you see and we just don't feel that that answer proves perjury upon his part because those are the occasion the occasions when he took her home. 
    In other words, he didn't picked her up and -- and go to X night club or he didn't pick her up and go somewhere else. 
    He testified of the occasions, that is, for instance on the night of the homicide when he found her walking by the street and picked her up and carried her home and on another occasions when he brought her home from work. 
    You see, he testified to those occasion when he took her home. 
    In other words, he had no date in the sense that he would go and pick her up at her home and take her out somewhere as --as anyone might understand in the meaning of a date, in that sense.

    May I -- I would like very much for you to take it as a whole and that was my very next point and that is to say that when you are looking at this language of Natividad Castilleja you must look at his entire testimony not just those two or three of four questions that wound up his direct examination. 
    Look at his entire testimony and when you look at his entire testimony, I don't think you'll find or I don't think you'll reach that conclusion. 
    I don't think it is a reasonable conclusion to the extent that the man has perjured himself willfully and falsely, told an untruth under oath because I think a fair examination of his entire testimony illustrates the very things that the defendant himself testified to. 
    The defendant said, “Well, I saw him dancing at this place.” 
    He said, “Yes, I was there. 
    She was there with the family.

    The defendant himself testified that the car started up, that the door was opened just as she was getting out when he jumped in and started stabbing her, and as a matter of fact, when he tugged over the car and drove off, the door was still open. 
    In other words, his wife was in the act of getting out of the car by his own testimony. 
    The door was open when he jumped in.

    Yes sir. 
    In the sense that the Court heard all of the evidence, heard the arguments and found that the evidence was not sufficient to support his allegations. 
    Further, the specific -- more specific findings made my Judge Morrison as to what actually was said and was not said between the witness and the prosecutor. 
    He says that he was advised to tell the truth at all times, right after the end -- that's right at the bottom of page 207. 
    Just tell the truth about such of this relationship but not volunteering the information unless he was asked. 
    And also, the finding at the top of page 208 by Judge Morrison, down a few lines, it was not shown that any of the answers were untrue. 
    In other words, you have a finding here of the Texas Court with the answers given by the witness, Castilleja, were not untrue.

    Well, I make this position that the -- they heard the evidence, not a Mooney versus Holohan case, where it's a question of the allegation. 
    The allegations are sufficient. 
    It's a question of the proof. 
    This is a factual matter. 
    That's simply where it boils down to. 
    This Court passed on the facts and found that the facts did not sustain the allegations. 
    Judge Morrison went further in a separate concurring opinion to set those matters out.

    Justice Charles E. Whittaker 
    (Inaudible)
speaker="hubert_w_green_jr" startTime="6605.844" stopTime="6915.039">
    Mr. Hubert W. Green, Jr. 
    It is a finding and I can suggest only that it is a finding of one of the judges in a concurring opinion of the Court of Criminal Appeals. 
    And I submit that that is within the rule of the Fay case and other cases where findings of a trial court or an appellate court are entitled to great weight by this Court. 
    I don't take the position that in a constitutional matter that the Court in all the cases is going to ignore what the findings might be and -- or be bound by it in advance, certainly not.B 
    ut we feel in this case here that the evidence being what it is so much of it is hearsay, hearsay based on hearsay, the fact that Mr. Barrera was supposed to have been quoted in some out-of-court hearing in the Board in the matters of that saw these as certain matters. 
    He is basing his contentions upon that. 
    He is basing his contentions upon affidavits from the witness Castilleja, one of the affidavits that he quoted from here exhibit C was a matter of the very, very first affidavit that he quoted from but he did not mention the portion in the affidavit where the witness is supposed to have said, "I admit that I lied at the trial. 
    I was asked the question by our court with this lawyer as to whether I had intercourse and I denied it and I admit purging in substance." 
    That's what he's supposed to have stated in one of the affidavits. 
    Then upon the trial, he repudiates those affidavits and evidence of that character and testifies openly in court and states unequivocally we have recited the places in our brief where he says, "I told the truth." 
    He makes explanations as to his answers here as I said a moment ago about dates and other matters. 
    “I told the truth and the reason I did not go into the matter of intercourse was that I was not asked those questions.” 
    Now, we feel that this case does not come within the ruling of the cases cited by petitioner, and that is, the Dyer case and the Baldy case and the -- the Dyer, the Baldy and the Reagan cases.We think those are extreme cases where Francis in the Reagan case, a man was prosecuted for rape. 
    The state had evidence at that time from the doctor who had examined the prosecutor, there was no rape. 
    The prosecutor to -- was a virgin. 
    In other words, the very prosecution itself was a fraud. 
    Then you have the two Circuit Court decision cited here, Dyer and Baldy concerning the matter of suppression. 
    We feel that those facts are far and above extreme the facts that we have in this case. 
    In one case, where the -- the bullets were an evidence. 
    In other words, there was a question where the men were robbing a store there and the question was who actually shot the deceased, was it the defendant or even policemen? 
    And the State sought to prove that the defendant fired the fatal shot knowing all the while that it had evidence, it had a bullet and it had an expert witness by hand to testify that no, it wasn't the defendant's bullet, it was a policeman's bullet that killed the defendant. 
    That basic, that extreme, in other words, keeping out evidence or trying to prove to the jury that the defendant did fire the fatal shot knowing all along that he had not fired the fatal shot and the Dyer case is equally extreme in a situation where the State there, the State of Pennsylvania sought to prove that -- and did prove by certain witnesses that the defendant was sober at the time of his arrest knowing at the very same time, a witness who did not testify and was kept away from the trial and was excused on the night of that night session was going to testify that he was drunk. 
    Now, you have compounded in those cases a situation where in the Baldy, where counsel for the defendant asking whether you have other bullets, you couldn't have it in certain bullets but do you have other bullets and no reply was made. 
    You have in the Dyer case, compounding this fraud is overt fraud to the Court and to the jury, you had counsel rising up and standing and saying there's no use calling this second State's witness, the second policeman. 
    He'll only corroborate the first policeman when he knew that was false telling them. 
    Also you have the situation there where in Pennsylvania, the jury was instructed that the prosecutor had called all of his witnesses and he sat there and listened to the Court instruct the jury in that fashion knowing that he had not called that witness. 
    Now, I want to get to a matter that I think is basic and that is the matter brought up and suggested in one of the cases cited by the petitioner, that is the matter cited in the Baldy case. 
    One of the reasons probably holding in the Baldy case was that this evidence was so well-concealed that you could not fairly accuse defendant's counsel of lack of due diligence and that's a matter that they have skirted around that they have avoided at all times in this case and in this litigation. 
    The matter of the diligence and we suggest in our brief that he has not exercised the diligence and all of the matters available to him to discover these very matters. 
   
   
   
   Argument of Raul Villarreal
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="6915.039" stopTime="6916.165">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Do you have anything further Mr. Green?
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="6916.165" stopTime="6920.621">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Mr. Villarreal I think has a word or two, Your Honor.
speaker="raul_villarreal" startTime="6920.621" stopTime="7192.486">
    Mr. Raul Villarreal 
    I might say, Mr. Chief Justice, Your Honor that we contend here as a size of the evidence that there's -- there's no disputed issue of fact. 
    One, the prosecutor admitted before the Court and before all the evidence that was submitted that he told a man that the evidence was inadmissible, that -- and further, that he knew about the intercourse and further, it's a public record that the questions that were asked of the prosecution -- prosecution witness. 
    Now, the -- the issue is as a matter of law, was there suppression of vital and material evidence beneficial to the defendant and they claim they make the attempt to even make the case stronger for the defendant. 
    They say, he didn't even know about it. 
    Now, I want to say that the prosecutor knew what, the defendant knowing about this, way before the case came to trial. 
    When he took the statement from Natividad Castilleja, that was about two weeks to 10 days according to his testimony on the writ of habeas corpus after he took the statement from Alcorta, he took the statement from Castilleja. 
    And on page 128, on 128 of the transcript, the last -- the paragraph of the statement given to Mr. Barrera personally because he -- he claims that he admitted under writ and he admits now that he was there at the time of the statement was given and he says here on the next to the last paragraph, one thing I went with, that's Castilleja talking to Mr. Barrera, the prosecutor, when the man first walked to the car, that is when he ran to get in the car. 
    He cursed Herlinda, he said and then the words in Spanish (Inaudible), yet that the scale which means literally, (Inaudible). 
    Now, I've caught you. 
    Now the -- notice the interpretation given by Castilleja, you bitch, I caught you leaving out the word "now". 
    Now, going back to the cross examination of Mr. Barrera, I think Justice Warren addressed that issue clearly when he interrogated Mr. Barrera about the -- the cross examination when Alcorta divulged that he knew or suspected and he caught him kissing and he felt and believed at that particular time that they were making love or having a date up and that compounded with the fact that Alcorta had made a statement corroborating the belief that he had caught her. 
    Now, this statement was never introduced in evidence. 
    Now, in the -- in the testimony itself, the transcript of page 155, it was sort of watered down. 
    The testimony was given as Castilleja said, "I caught you." 
    He didn't say the -- the profanity, he didn't say, “now.” 
    I believe that -- that it could have very well given -- taken home the message to Mr. Barrera that then he could've realized that Alcorta knew about this intercourse and at that time, the issue was very material as the issue of murder without malice was submitted to the jury. 
    For that reason, we ask the Court to reverse the case. 
    Thank you.
