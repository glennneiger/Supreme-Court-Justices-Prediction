    Mr. Kenneth C. Patty 
    May it please the Court. 
    I feel that my colleague, my Assistant Mr. Hicks has fully developed the essential question involved here and that I deem it unnecessary this time to go into the case any further unless the Court has some questions (Inaudible) 
    We feel that unless there is a controversy existing on the count of the breach of contract to the breach of compact that compact never was anything more than a scrap of paper that if -- if it was a contract, certain controversy has risen between the two states on the count of fact that one state has attempted to unilaterally abrogate the terms of the contract.
