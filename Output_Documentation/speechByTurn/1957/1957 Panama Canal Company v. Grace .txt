    Mr. Solicitor General you may proceed with your argument.
speaker="j_lee_rankin" startTime="9.591" stopTime="367.346">
    Mr. J. Lee Rankin 
    In regard to the last question that was asked me about the judgment of the Court, I'd like to make it clear first that the Court of Appeals sustained the motion for summary judgment. 
    That question was not supposed to be before the Court at all, because the lower court expressly stayed that question and examined into only the question of whether the court had jurisdiction to act in this manner at all. 
    But in spite of that and in spite of the fact the government was advised by the lower court that we would have a full opportunity to answer the some 60 pages of the affidavits and over 500 pages of Congressional record and materials that were presented under the summary, motion for summary judgment, the Court of Appeals proceeded to decide the case on its merits and it then proceeded after that as you will note by the opinion to examine into the question of jurisdiction and pass on that. 
    Now the court sustained the motion for summary judgment, except that it did not permit any refund of the tolls that had been paid or reparations, and the detail of the prayer, of the motion for summary judgment appears on page 11 of the record in this case. 
    And it is of particular interest, I'd like to call your attention to certain parts of it, because in paragraph one, the motion is that the defendant be directed to proceed, to prescribe tolls as provided in the statute, to propose changes in the tolls and to conduct a public hearing. 
    Then the second paragraph is enjoining and restraining the defendant from further unlawful withholding and unreasonably delaying the prescription of tolls, proposal of changes in the conduct of a public hearing and then the third paragraph commands and directs us which is mandatory, a mandamus or a mandatory injunction and it's the position of the government that this Court and other federal courts outside of the District of Columbia, except for action that's ancillary to their jurisdiction, do not have the power to grant relief of that character unless the statutes expressly so provides. 
    But regardless of that, we're directed expressly, commanding and directing and then the next one is enjoining and restraining us from using any account, that are less favorable than the Comptroller General use and the fifth one is retaining jurisdiction, so as to issue appropriate orders that the defendant prescribe tolls and proposed changes in tolls and conduct a public hearing according to law. 
    Now if you will refer to page 167 of our brief and about two-thirds of the way down, there is provided further and that is the language of the statute, 167 that says what we we're to do about changes. 
    Just ahead of that is the first proviso that says that we can maintain the prevailing rate and the measurement in effect on that date, shall continue in effect until changed as provided in this section. 
    That's the power that we rely on to continue the $0.90 rate that now is continued in effect if the petitioner finds that it is profit, and that the Congress so contemplated. 
    Then we turn to the next proviso and it says that the Fed Corporation shall give six months notice, what kind of a notice is it? 
    What is it going to give notice of? 
    By publication in the Federal Register of any and all proposed changes in basic rules of measurement and of any and all proposed changes in rates of tolls, so that until we decide, the petitioner decides at least and possibly the President too or at least the petitioner must decide, that there has to be a change. 
    We can't have any hearing because that's the construction of a statute. 
    The statute contemplates that the petitioner has to first decide that there is to be a change in the tolls. 
    Then it publishes it for six months in the Federal Register, and there after it proceeds to have hearings during that six-month period and those hearings are not administrative hearings during which you make a record for review of a court like in the ordinary regulatory agency. 
    They are legislative hearings just like the provision that was in effect before, when the President had the power to fix the tolls. 
    So if we don't start first to decide that there has to be a change in these tolls, there is no requirement for a hearing and none is contemplated, because there is no purpose for it and then it's only a legislative hearing. 
    Now that's clearly what the statutes contemplated and all that it provides and we are directed mandatorily to proceed to decide that there must be a change when we have decided that there need not be one and then proceed with hearings when we decided that there is no need for a change, therefore the statute doesn't provide for a hearing and that's the character of relief that was given.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Before you sit down I like to put to you, I hope Mr. Williams will deal with it when he gets on his feet, this question? 
    Suppose this Court affirmed the Court of Appeals, suppose it was to affirm it without an opinion to infer, and then the Panama Canal Company says here we've got an order of the Court, an order of the Supreme Court, and we go the Court of Appeals to figure, to find out what it is, that it contemplated and they say that we think, the rates that we fixed, the existing rates are within the scope and the authority in the act of Congress, but we are an obedient agency and we'll do the best we can on the basis of what we deem to be false assumptions in fact, to change the tolls. 
    The matter then goes to the President, he says they are all wrong and he disallows the changed tolls, he says the old tolls shall remain in force. 
    I would like to hear from both sides whether that determination by the President is then reviewable by any court, so that we go around and get the same result by the Presidential action?

    Mr. Charles Dickerman Williams 
    May it please the Court, I shall submit to Your Honors three propositions, first that long ago it became the duty of the defendant to prescribe reduced tolls, second that the defendant having failed to perform that duty, the plaintiffs were entitled to a judgment to compel it to do so and third that plaintiffs are entitled to damages for the defendants' unlawful delay. 
    Preliminarily I want to explain why we are asking for reduced tolls in a period of generally rising prices. 
    The reason is this --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="552.393" stopTime="568.624">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Williams, before you get to that, I wonder if it would disturb you too much to answer the inquiry that Mr. Justice Frankfurter made of the Solicitor General just a moment ago, would that disturb your argument to do that?

    Let me say this Your Honor.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Yes.
speaker="charles_dickerman_williams" startTime="583.857" stopTime="657.114">
    Mr. Charles Dickerman Williams 
    Our position is that insofar as compulsion is concerned the question of Presidential review, that is to say a judicial review of Presidential action is not yet before the Court. 
    At the present time we're merely trying to compel action on that phase of the case and for instance in Chicago and Southern Air Lines against Waterman which is a case upon which my learned friend relies, where it was held the President's action was not reviewable nevertheless the law indicates that if the Civil Aeronautics Board which was the subordinate agency in that case had simply sat on a proceeding for something like seven years and taken no action, the courts would have had power to compel it to act to move along, as for instance in Virginia Railway against System Federation or Wilbur against Krushnic or Interstate Commerce Commission against Humboldt Steam Ship Company or in Payne against New Mexico all of which are cases where the subordinate agency had filed to act or failed to act in accordance with a correct construction of the statute. 
    And the courts compel the subordinate agency to act in accordance with a correct construction of the statute although the court had no power to review the action when taken. 
    So here we say --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="657.114" stopTime="681.718">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Well may I, may I interrupt you, I don't know about the other, but I have a statute question in mind about the Interstate Commerce Commission and the Humboldt, it's a very different situation, because there a private shipper by statute is given authority to go before the commission and get action and unless you contradict what the answer given to Justice Douglas's question, is that the situation here?
speaker="charles_dickerman_williams" startTime="681.718" stopTime="724.289">
    Mr. Charles Dickerman Williams 
    Well it is quite true that this statute does not in specific terms say that we have the right to go before the courts and compel this action. 
    But this statute does impose upon this defendant in the most explicit terms a duty and of course my learned friend said that we haven't got standing to sue but the Hay-Pauncefote Treaty which is incorporated in this statute made a matter of domestic law for the first time says that vessels of commerce shall be entitled to just an equitable tolls and we say that a user who is entitled to reasonable rates has a standing to sue to enforce a particular statutory right.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="724.289" stopTime="730.709">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Then lots of actions commanded by statute upon members of the cabinet for which I don't suppose you would get mandamus?
speaker="charles_dickerman_williams" startTime="730.709" stopTime="743.850">
    Mr. Charles Dickerman Williams 
    That is true Your Honor but those are matters of executive policy. 
    We say this is a matter of executive administration of legislative policy. 
    Rate may be is a legislative function. 
    Here Congress has defined a policy and imposed upon this defendant a duty to execute it.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    I'm suggesting legislative policy on the part of Department to give subsidy, a grant and suppose if you can get mandamus it's advised in the parliament within discretionary power, ultimately it is the President to decide what the figure should be?
speaker="charles_dickerman_williams" startTime="759.164" stopTime="816.601">
    Mr. Charles Dickerman Williams 
    Well Your Honor there are a couple of answers to that. 
    We say that we have the right to compel the process to get going in any event whatever maybe the power of the President and that comes under cases such as Virginia Railway and System Federation. 
    We further say even if that that there is -- under the Administrative Procedure Act, the courts have power of judicial review after the action of the President, but whether we are right or wrong on that we say that the long line of cases which say that a, that a -- someone who is entitled to the benefit a statute, someone for whose benefit a particular statute has enacted has the power to compel an agency or a private corporation and this defendant is subjected to suit like any private corporation that the courts under those circumstances if the suit have such person for whose benefit the statute was enacted may compel the action commanded by the statute.

    Well Your Honor we don't think that the President can the next day may nullify it and we think that even in such cases such as -- take for instance -- well we have a variety of positions Your Honor. 
    Let's take Norwegian Nitrogen Products against United States that was a case where the President was to construe the statute beyond judicial review and yet this Court took jurisdiction over the procedure and wrote an opinion 28 pages long reviewing the procedure of the tariff commission.

    Mr. Charles Dickerman Williams 
    [Attempt to Laughter] Well the upshot of the 28 pages was that the tariff commission had acted properly according to the law.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="866.313" stopTime="872.155">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    I haven't read it, but I thought it went on the fact that the President has the ultimate say in the matter.

    Mr. Charles Dickerman Williams 
    The Court held that the interpretation of the statute was up to the President, but the Court did say, the courts did review the procedure and found that the procedure of the tariff commission had been correct.

    Mr. Charles Dickerman Williams 
    Your Honor we do claim that the courts have the power to review after the President has acted, but we also say that -- put it this way Your Honor, we think, we say that theoretically there are three possible interpretations of the, of the President's review power proviso, first that the President may act according to his own whim or fancy. 
    We think for reasons which I shall explain that that theory is not appropriate. 
    Second possible theory is that the President was to enforce the statute according to law, according to his definition of the law, but beyond judicial review that is the Norwegian Nitrogen Products or George S. Bush type of situation. 
    A third theory is that the action of the President is subject to judicial review for errors of law or misinterpretation of a statute, a limited power of review, but we say that whatever the power, the President of the power -- the power of the President maybe the courts have the power to compel this defendant to act to get the administrative process underway.

speaker="charles_dickerman_williams" startTime="1080.402" stopTime="1130.860">
    Mr. Charles Dickerman Williams 
    Well I may have misunderstood his argument, as I read his brief he -- in fact well I'll put it this way, perhaps I'll take that back, I'll say this. 
    As I understand the theory of the defendant it is that the Administrative Procedure Act precludes judicial review, I am sorry, I guess I misstated it. 
    It applies in the sense that it, that it precludes review only in that sense. 
    But we say that we have a right to compel this defendant to act both as a private corporation under ordinary case law and as a United States Agency under both case law and the Administrative Procedure Act. 
    Now may I explain it, I'll just very briefly –
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1130.860" stopTime="1131.474">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Yes you may do it now –
speaker="charles_dickerman_williams" startTime="1131.474" stopTime="1299.811">
    Mr. Charles Dickerman Williams 
    [Attempt to Laughter] -- excuse me, refer to why, why the theory of rising prices, to come back where I was, we are asking for reduced tolls. 
    The reason there is a tremendous increase in traffic through the canal. 
    The traffic has increased from 20 odd million tons to 40 million odd tons or 20 million odd tons in 1947 the last year before the agitation that resulted the act of September 26th 1950 and 1957 which was last year. 
    Defendant -- tolls and toll credits amounted to 90 million odd in 1947 and amounted to 39 million odd in 1957 representing an increase in traffic as I say from approximately 20 million odd tons to 40 million odd tons. 
    Now the defendant operates on pretty much fixed cost. 
    It cost very little (Inaudible) 20 ships a day through the canal and to get only 10 and the direct expense of operating the canal has gone from only 14 million odd dollars, to 16 million odd dollars. 
    So that on a per tonnage basis, the cost, the cost per ton of getting a ship through the canal or getting a ton through the canal has very much decreased. 
    Now the act of September 26, 1950, relates tolls to cost and the cost per ton, having gone down so much, we say that tolls also should go down, and in fact there has been the same increase at Suez and at Suez rates have been reduced to 40% in the post war period. 
    The defendant in his brief relates this situation somehow to Suez and yet the fact is that if rates here were reduced by the full 0.25 cents a ton, indicated by the Comptroller General's report, rates at Panama would still be higher, relative to Suez rates than they were either in 1937, when the present Panama rate was fixed or in 1948, when the legislative process, legislative history of this act began. 
    Now my first proposition is that long ago it came to duty of this defendant to prescribe reduce tolls and I say that because the statute compels, directs this defendant to prescribe tolls on the basis of canal activity and without regard to the losses of the so called business activities. 
    Now if I am correct in that construction of the statute, then the Comptroller General's report establishes beyond all doubt, that on a canal activity basis, the present rate is far excessive, that collections under this rate far exceed the cost prescribed or defined in the tolls formulated laid down by Act of September 26th.

    Mr. Charles Dickerman Williams

    He again held that the Court had no jurisdiction and the third he held that we had standing to sue, so never got to the question of the --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1458.603" stopTime="1500.591">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    But as I understand the government, and I understand the Solicitor General, you can correct me if I'm wrong, it is claimed that in any events the Court of Appeals had no business to go the merits, after they decided the jurisdictional question in your favor, because the District Court having gone into that, am I to take it for granted that the Court -- that the government is content to have that issue decided on the situation, in this posture in which it was left in the Court of Appeals, when the merits of that, for all I know, might be challenged by the government. 
    I know the Comptroller General is (Inaudible) nothing against him, but even he is an infallible creature, isn't he?

    Well Your Honor it is undoubtedly true that the District Court never got to these questions.

    Mr. Charles Dickerman Williams 
    No there was not Your Honor. 
    But I -- although the defendant here has written a long brief and has got into a -- gone into the bookkeeping to a considerable extent, I do not, I maybe mistaken, but I do not understand that the Comptroller General's analysis is challenged once it be assumed that the defendant was required by the statute to prescribe tolls on the basis of the canal activity and without regard to the losses of the business activities. 
    Mr. Rankin can correct me if I'm mistaken. 
    I find nothing in the brief which challenges the Comptroller General's analysis as a correct analysis upon that assumption. 
    Now our reason is the same that the Act of September 26, 1950, directed that tolls be prescribed on the basis of the canal activity and not -- and without regard to the losses of the business activities are as I say the language of the statute, the legislative history and defendants own admissions, and let me first take up the legislative history. 
    The Act of September 26, 1950 can be understood only in the light of the situation as it existed at that time, because that Act was passed to deal with a particular situation, as I suppose all statutes are. 
    Now in 1948 the canal authorities proposed an increased toll. 
    Now at that time the toll was $0.90 a laden ton, having been so fixed by the President in 1937, pursuant to the Act of that August 24, 1937 which authorized the President to fix tolls at not less than $0.75 and not more than $1 per laden ton. 
    The Panama Canal, the waterway itself was being operated by an unincorporated agency called The Panama Canal. 
    The Panama Canal also conducted the local government in the canal zone and it further conducted certain business operations such as a shipyard, a printing press and so on. 
    Now this is a key feature in the legislative history. 
    The cost of the canal zone government was a great deal more than it otherwise would be, because of the presence of armed forces, large units of the armed forces in the canal zone. 
    As Your Honors are undoubtedly aware, the canal zone is not only the site of a canal, but it is also a very important military base, and more than half the population of the zone consists of the armed forces and their dependants. 
    Now the cost to the government, the canal zone government was a great deal more than it otherwise would have been, because of the presence of these troops and their dependants, more schools were necessary, more hospitals were necessary, more police, larger highways, more highway maintenance and so on. 
    Now a third feature was that at that time the Panama Railroad Company, defendant or it's predecessor was operating other business activities. 
    The railroad, the shipping line, commissaries, these other business activities had been profitable for many years, and they paid large sums in dividends to the United States Treasury. 
    These business activities served the canal as such and also the armed forces and also the Republic of Panama and the public generally. 
    And a fourth feature, although perhaps only a detail but an important detail is that defendants reports were on an activity basis, that is to say the defendants in its budget program submitted to Congress and its Annual Reports, broke down each activity according to net results after the allocation of general expense, so anyone looking at these reports could tell the final result, financial result of that particular activity considering all factors including general expense. 
    Now, when the canal authorities proposed this increase, the shipping industry protested on this ground that the additional cost, the higher cost which were the justification for the proposed increase were higher governmental cost, military cost, commercial cost and not higher cost of ship transits. 
    Now Congress recognized force to that objection and after three years of consideration by the Bureau of the Budget and various congressional committees, the Court of Appeals said three years were spent hammering out a formula. 
    The net result was the act of September 26, 1950; that provided for the transfer of the canal as a waterway to the defendant. 
    And in connection with tolls, it provided that the toll should be based upon the canal activity, plus an appropriate share of the cost of the Canal Zone Government, the appropriate share to be determined on the basis of gross revenues. 
    It was recognized that this formula would result in tolls going up and down from time to time according to fluctuations in costs and canal traffic. 
    Now that left open the question of who would pay the remaining share of the cost of Canal Zone Government, and it was decided that, that remaining share should be paid by the business activities, that is to say the railroad, shipping line, commissaries and so forth, which as I say had been profitable over a period of many years. 
    Now, may I ask Your Honors refer to page of 167 of the record, which pages 164 to 167 set forth the report of the Armed Services Committee to the Senate on the bill which became the Act of September 26, 1950. 
    Now Your Honors will note on the upper right-hand side of page, on the upper part of page 167, a worksheet setting forth the anticipated results of the formula which was embodied in the bill. 
    Now the significant feature of this worksheet is that those are canal activity figures and not company wide figures. 
    If the formula would be on a company wide basis, the figures would be a great deal larger, would be around $90 million, $80 million to $100 million.

    Justice Harold Burton 
    What's that item other outside revenue?
speaker="charles_dickerman_williams" startTime="2000.789" stopTime="2175.505">
    Mr. Charles Dickerman Williams 
    That is the pilot charges. 
    The canal, not only charges tolls, but it also charges a fee for piloting a ship through the canal or certain small marine services which run to approximately, well less than 10% of tolls. 
    But, [Laughter] the outside revenue does not include the business activities, those would run the figures way, way up. 
    Now I would also ask Your Honors to look at the paragraph in the middle of the page. 
    All of the above figures are stated in round numbers and are based on currently available financial data, and then is this significant sentence 
    .The toll rate will of course be affected by any future changes in operating costs, interest rates and canal traffic and maybe revised either up or down. 
    Now I further ask that Your Honors examine the first two full sentences on page 166, of the top of page 166, the remaining cost to the civil government, that is after the appropriate share of the canal activity, would be borne by the other business activities such as hotels, commissaries and so on. 
    As a result the canal will be on a self-sustaining basis on the other collateral business operating in the Canal Zone must bear their proportionate share of the cost to the civil government, health and sanitation. 
    Now, so much for the legislative history; I've only hit the high spots. 
    Now, then the statute was enacted and I'll read to Your Honors Section 412(b) which is the key provision of the statute as we see it. 
    That's in Section 412, which is entitled ‘Basis of Tolls'. 
    Tolls shall be prescribed at a rate or rates calculated to cover as merely as practicable all costs of maintaining and operating the Panama Canal, together with the facilities and appurtenances related thereto, including interest and depreciation and an appropriate share of the net cost of operation of the agency known as the Canal Zone Government, then Section (b), goes on to provide that the appropriate share shall be determined on a gross revenues basis. 
    A further important provision of Section 412(b) was -- of Section 412 was subsection (d), which provides -- that -- which incorporates in domestic law for the first time Article III, Section 1 of the Hay-Pauncefote Treaty providing that toll shall be just an equitable, which I submit amounted to Congress saying that, that formula constituted its definition of what was just an equitable under the treaty.

    Is there anything in the history showing just what is meant by the words together with the facilities and appurtenances related thereto?
speaker="charles_dickerman_williams" startTime="2227.087" stopTime="2536.620">
    Mr. Charles Dickerman Williams 
    Well, as far as the legislative history is concerned Your Honor, I rely -- the legislative history shows beyond all possible doubt, and I've gone into it at probably excessive length in my brief, that the business activities which had always kept separate accounts and which should never have been included within the canal accounts were to remain separate and were to bear their share of the cost of the Canal Zone Government, and of course if they were to bear their share of the cost the Canal Zone Government and only an appropriate share was to be borne by tolls, that would necessarily imply that they would continue to be kept separate from tolls. 
    But however my learned friend suggests that the expression together with the facilities and appurtenances related thereto may refer to such remotely connected facilities as the railroad and the shipping line and so on. 
    Now, that suggestion is I submit not only answered by the legislative history, but it is also answered by the reference to Section 10 of the statute which is quoted at page 5A of the appendix to my brief, if Your Honors will refer to that. 
    There is the expression found again in language which from its context can only mean those facilities -- makes it clear that the language can only mean those facilities immediately connected with the canal, such as the lochs and the launches, towing locomotives and that sort of thing. 
    The President is hereby authorized to transfer to the corporation the Panama Canal together with the facilities and appurtenances related thereto, in other words exactly the same language used a little later in Section 12(b), heretofore maintained and operated by the Panama Canal under -- excuse me, together with the facilities and appurtenances related thereto, and in other words a distinction is made, any or all of the facilities and appurtenances heretofore maintained and operated by the Panama Canal under (Inaudible) Section 1 of Title 2 of the Canal Zone Code as amended by Section 2 of the Act of August 12, 1949. 
    Now the Act of August 12, 1949 shows that the other -- the facilities and appurtenances heretofore maintained are the business operations which the Panama Canal, the unincorporated agency has asked at that time. 
    Now as the defendant corporation already had the railroad, the shipping line, and those other business activities, this statute which provides for a transfer cannot possibly relate to them, because the statute authorizing a transfer cannot relate to things that the transferee already has. 
    Now I also rely on certain admissions by the defendant. 
    One of these is its 1952 budget program. 
    That budget program was prepared in the late Summer and Fall of 1950 and was given to Congress by the President in January 1951. 
    In other words, it was prepared at the time when the legislative process was fresh in everybody's mind. 
    That budget program was submitted completely on our theory of the case, that is to say it had presented separate accounts for the canal activity and the other activities and showed that tolls were expected only to cover the cost of the canal activity. 
    The second admission to which we point is an opinion rendered by the general counsel of the defendant company to its President, all we know about that is a reference in the Comptroller General's 1954 audit report. 
    And from that reference it appears that in December 1953, the defendant's President had submitted – prepared for submission to its Board of Directors a pricing policy statement, the gist of which apparently was that the prices of the business activities need a yield only enough to pay their direct operating expense, the implication being that all the overhead expense could be charged against tolls. 
    Now the defendant's general counsel, then according to the General Accounting Office report advised the President that that was unlawful, yet according to the General Accounting Office the President withheld that opinion from the Board of Directors, withheld the pricing policy statement from the Board of Directors and proceeded to go on and do exactly what his own general counsel had told him was unlawful. 
    I might say that I clamored in the District Court, I clamored in the Court of Appeals and I clamored in my briefs here for a copy of this opinion of the General Counsel but the defendant has not seen fit to give it to me, or give to the any of the courts. 
    The third admission to which I point is a --

    Is that a new method of bookkeeping Mr. Williams to charge those things against the tolls or is that, that had been done over a long period of years?

    Mr. Charles Dickerman Williams 
    Well Your Honor prior to this act, the Panama Canal, the unincorporated agency construed by the Act of 1912 operated both the canal, the civil government and certain business operations and the business operations were operated at a profit. 
    Of course the zone government made no profit, it was a government. 
    The tolls, according to the statute were not based on anything in particular, it was simply that the President was authorized to prescribe tolls within certain limits, but the statute did not prescribe a tolls-making formula. 
    The concept of a formula was introduced into the legislation for the first time by the Act of September 26, 1950.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3030.486" stopTime="3036.863">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    I take it then it was not based upon any budgeting at all prior to 1950?
speaker="charles_dickerman_williams" startTime="3036.863" stopTime="3132.527">
    Mr. Charles Dickerman Williams 
    Well there was -- the legislative hearings indicate that there was kind of an understanding between the governor of the zone and the Secretary of War and the President by which tolls would be fixed so as to pay all the costs of not only operating the canal, but also operating the Canal Zone government and also paying 3% on all the investment in the canal. 
    And it was against that situation, that the shipping industry protested in 1948 when an increase was proposed because of increased governmental and military costs. 
    At that time -- the situation was then brought to a head and we said, that's not fair, that's a national defense cost not a ship transit cost, and hence we should only pay part of the cost of the Canal Zone government. 
    And I won't go through all the arguments back and forth but the net result was that the force of that argument was recognized by Congress in Section 412(b) which said that tolls would be prescribed on canal operation, interest on the investment to be fixed at the current rate being paid by the government, plus an appropriate share of the cost of the Canal Zone government. 
    The other share, as to how the other share is to be paid the statute is silent, but the Bureau of the Budget report and the armed services report assert that the remaining share was to be borne by the business activities.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Then I take it that this is in your view, this is an old practice that was remedied by the Act of 1950 and that the government has not conformed to the 1950 act?

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    But you're not suggesting I'm sure that up to 1950 the tolls were fixed by Presidential authority under whimsical or willful basis, putting it to one side, you will agree won't you that from the beginning, the proper basis of determining what the toll charges should be was in the hand of technical advisors of the President, on the basis of which these toll charges from time to time were reviewed, do you agree with that?

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    I'm not saying what the basis was, but that the Presidential authority exercised up till 1950 was an effort to relate tolls to value of services. 
    What you're saying is that in 1950 the thing was formalized by Section 412, is that right? 
    I don't mean formalized was refined by the statute, is that right?

    Mr. Charles Dickerman Williams 
    Yes Your Honor, may I add just a little? 
    What Your Honor says is correct, but the President who was authorized by Congress only to fix tolls within certain limits, in other words he had to fix a particular toll within a framework of legislative policy. 
    But the particular toll that he selected within those limits was a matter which the President did on the basis of advice. 
    Now that was changed by the Act of September 20 and that was the purpose of the Act of September 26.

    Mr. Charles Dickerman Williams 
    Oh it allows them maneuvering room Your Honor because the -- I will agree with my learned friend in this, that the execution of the statute involves discretion, but that discretion must be exercised upon a correct construction of the statute. 
    We don't deny that the statute, that the -- I mean the languages of the Section 12(b) which I read Your Honors a little while ago clearly involves discretionary determinations, and we say that the approval power of the President is to review the exercise of the discretion within the legislative policy laid down by Section 412(b).

    As I understand the contention of the government, after the Act of 1950, and indeed before it, the Panama Canal Company and its various names each year had to come before Congress, give an accounting of what they did the year before, state financial conditions, its income, its expenditures, state what the tolls were on the basis of which the appropriations for the next year were made, is that right?

    These budget programs are submitted to Congress under Section 849 of Title 31 of the code and are for the purpose of Congress's action in making available for expenditure, such monies as Congress sees fit. 
    Now the language of Congress every year in authorizing expenditure, and I might say that because no appropriations are involved, the minutes of the Appropriations Committee considering these budget programs indicate that they are not considered very exhaustibly and here is a company that comes in that isn't asking for an appropriate --

    But if you're right, and if the government is unfairly or illegally extracting toll from your client when it shouldn't, in order to be relieved of the cost of other activities, then if you're right the government -- the Congress of the United States would have to make appropriations for those other non-canal operating activities.

    Mr. Charles Dickerman Williams 
    That is true but not to the extent that reg appropriations would have been required. 
    Now, Your Honor Congress in acting on these budget programs has not given its blessing to the toll rate which does not appear in budget programs. 
    All that appears in the budget programs is estimated income and the actual language of each act has been this, “The following corporation,” referring to defendants, “is hereby authorized to make such expenditures.” 
    In other words all that Congress does is to authorize the expenditures set forth in the budget program “within the limits of funds and borrowing authority available to it and in accord with law.” 
    Now I submit that what Congress is doing and that's quite consistent with the Government Corporation Control Act is saying to the extent that you can get your money lawfully, you may spend it as you propose.

speaker="charles_dickerman_williams" startTime="3870.800" stopTime="4133.250">
    Mr. Charles Dickerman Williams 
    I would like to make -- I have very little time left and I would like to direct my attention to the meaning in this -- skipping all other things I intend to say, to the meaning of the President's review powers provided in Section 411. 
    Now we say that the duty of the President under the Section 411 proviso was to enforce the law and to review the defendant's exercise of discretion, but not to act according to his whim or fancy. 
    We say that's because of the legislative history which shows that it was the intent of Congress to grant us relief here to establish a tolls policy, a policy which was very carefully considered, very carefully worked out. 
    The references to the President's review power are practically negligible as the Court of Appeals pointed out. 
    Again the statutory precedents tolls policy has always been a matter of Congressional policy although the President has had a limited discretion within the framework of that policy and when President Wilson, when President Franklin Roosevelt wanted changes in that policy, they went to Congress for that purpose. 
    We also say the language and the arrangement of the statute, Section 412 deals with policy, basis of tolls, Section 411 deals with authority and procedure. 
    If the President was to have policy making powers inconsistent with the policy laid down by Congress that would be have been in Section 412. 
    We also say because of the legal meaning which has been given this Court and other courts to the expression subject to the approval of, that has been repeatedly held to mean that the approving authority determines the lawfulness of the action of a subordinate. 
    Whether the subordinate has acted within the law and this Court has held most emphatically that it does -- that subject to the approval of, does not give the approving authority, the privilege of substituting his own judgment for the will of Congress. 
    And in Daniels against Wagner this Court most sarcastically described the very argument which is advanced by defendant here. 
    We also say that it is true under the law of rate making, under which the legislative -- rate making as a legislative function, the legislature lays down a policy and leaves it to the executive branch or an independent agent to execute that policy. 
    We say it's also shown by the anomalous character of the non-statutory factors which this defendant proposes or the defendant consider. 
    He proposes that for instance, the defendant proposes that the -- if the President may consider the welfare of the railroads, whether or not it will take business away from the railroads. 
    Now I submit Your Honor that it's anomalous and violative of our net good faith in the Hay-Pauncefote Treaty, that the shipping of the world, and 70% of shipping is foreign shipping, should have to pay a surcharge for the purposes of bolstering up a competing American facility, as a matter of fact only 10% of the traffic is intercoastal water traffic and that has been going down as compared with pre-war. 
    If there's anybody that needs relief it's the intercoastal water carriers and not the railroads. 
    The defendant also suggests that the purpose is to consider the welfare of Suez that he must -- this traffic is to be -- this rate is too adjusted according to the needs of our foreign policy. 
    Now I submit that, that is highly improper, I mean do we say that the United Arab Republic may adjust the tolls rate at Suez according to the needs of its foreign policy, I submit that, that -- the answer to that question is no. 
    And furthermore our construction fits in entirely with the Constitution which says that the function of the President -- that the -- a function of the President is to take care that the laws be faithfully executed and we say that the purpose here was that he take care that the defendant faithfully executed Section 412. 
    Now even if are wrong in that however, we say the President's views of the law are not reviewable by the courts, still we say that we have the right to compel that this defendant to make a correct application of the statute under cases such as Virginia Railway against Federation and United States against Wilbur which say that a corporation and an agency maybe compelled to exercise their discretion according to the law.

    Page what?
speaker="j_lee_rankin" startTime="4151.721" stopTime="4283.739">
    Mr. J. Lee Rankin 
    You don't have this but I -- it's the report of the Comptroller General that's been the subject of talk and debate all the way through this and upon which they rely from time to time when they think they can gain something out of it and which they overlook whenever they find it's to their advantage. 
    They overlooked the part in which the Comptroller General said that the formula for tolls should be changed to make sure that the cost to these business activities should not be charged against the taxpayer and that it should be incorporated in the tolls charge, that's one thing they overlooked. 
    They apparently overlooked this language of the Comptroller General in the same report on page 16. 
    If tolls revenue is insufficient to cover the minimum losses appropriations will be needed, such appropriations for the business losses would of course constitute a subsidy to the ship operators. 
    Comptroller General said that in exactly the same report that we've been discussing all the way through here. 
    Now in regard to the military, the military reimburses the Canal Zone government in full for all the school and hospital service, so that isn't in here at all. 
    They were allowed because of the defense features of this Canal Zone operation that the Congress recognized, they took out of the formula of the amount the government had invested in this canal, what they had -- the government had collected for some 40 years of time without any objection on the part of the Government of Great Britain or anybody else and that was the cost of the interest for the construction period. 
    And that's a proper accounting charge because it did cost this government that amount of money. 
    But in recognition of the defense aspect, the Congress took that out in figuring the amount of the investment that we had in the canal, and that's 2500 – that's $2.5 million a year, they've already got that credit for defense and they just want to try to get some more.

    And on -- that's in the record on page 202, at about the second full paragraph, down, and the court – “if you want assurance that I'm not going to pass on the merits or the reasonableness of the delay, but only this court's power to hear the whole question, why I will give that to you right now.” 
    In other words, the only question that is going to be raised on December 22nd is whether this court can hear the case to begin with and the only answer that you can get is either one, we can't even hear it; or two, we can hear it.

    Mr. J. Lee Rankin 
    I don't think you have to reach the question whether there would be no judicial review in any event because I think you have partially here the question that we say, we've acted, and under our construction of the statute it seems to me that in any event it isn't clear what we should do. 
    And so there isn't any claim that -- there can't be any proper claim under our construction of it, that were acting in bad faith and that that element comes in to require judicial review. 
    We also say that in any event it was improper for the Court of Appeals to consider summary judgment and decide this case on the merits because we were sure that it would not and the action of the lower court was expressly that it would not be. 
    Then on page 205, there is a further statement by Judge Walsh, about the middle of the page or toward the upper half of it, the court, “now I'm going to grant your motion to defer hearing on the merits until we pass on this jurisdictional point.”

speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="4832.687" stopTime="4853.070">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Well what I meant was, is there something about -- if they allege that the act is required to do certain things and they also allege that none of them had been done that the act requires, is it still your position that the court would no jurisdiction to proceed, and if so what is the ground for that?
speaker="j_lee_rankin" startTime="4853.070" stopTime="4985.222">
    Mr. J. Lee Rankin 
    Well my position on that is that the ground is that the difficulty of the discretion that's involved here, that counsel conceded there was some discretion. 
    Now if you examine this formula in 412(b) as we have tried to do in absolute good faith, then I hope this Court if it acts in this case and rules against the petitioner will give us some guidance as to how we're to try to fix these rates because if you examine this formula as we have tried to do in absolute good faith, you find first that they say the toll should be prescribed at the rate or rates calculated to cover the words ‘as nearly as practicable all costs,' not part of it, all costs of maintaining and operating the Panama Canal together with the facilities and appurtenances related thereto, including interest and depreciation. 
    Then it goes on to say, and this is the controversy between us, “and an appropriate share of the net costs of the operation of the agency known as the Canal Zone government.” 
    Now if you're in our position, as the petitioner, how would you try to interpret it there? 
    If you were told by somebody to try to pay certain obligations or bills, including the interest on a note to the bank or something, and that instruction was insofar as practicable, you should pay it all, and then you should go ahead and take an appropriate share of some other bills. 
    And if you try to not pay all these, which is the expense of operation of all of these various activities that are necessary to this operation of this Canal Zone, then your business can't continue any longer because you would have deficits, that's the problem that we have. 
    And we've done the best we could to apply that very formula to our operations, and it's --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="4985.222" stopTime="5014.935">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Suppose – suppose (Inaudible) you had acted on the basis of the cost of certain collateral, so called collateral activity (Inaudible), and if that was precisely prohibited by the Act, and that the result of what you did rested on that basis, would you say still the courts have no jurisdiction on this --

speaker="j_lee_rankin" startTime="5016.359" stopTime="5053.818">
    Mr. J. Lee Rankin 
    You have a different problem. 
    If you can look at that statute, the court can, with all respect, and say if this statute is so clear that there is no discretion that has to be exercised by the petitioner, and you can just take that statute, apply it to your affairs and it's clear as can be that you should do this very thing. 
    Then of course the court found that we were violating that, it would be just a clear act that the court could direct us to go, get about our business and do them, but that isn't this case.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="5053.818" stopTime="5060.197">

speaker="j_lee_rankin" startTime="5060.197" stopTime="5094.738">
    Mr. J. Lee Rankin 
    Well, I'd say it's different in this case, but that isn't here in this case, that there are circumstances where if this -- if you assume the statute was different, if you assume it was all clear, and there was nothing we should do except go ahead and change the tolls, anybody could see that, and that they should be changed because this formula was so clear, there was no discretion involved, no judgment, all of those things, well then the court would have the power to say go ahead and do your job, but that's not this case.

    Mr. Solicitor may I ask you before you sit down, where in this case is different from assuming, if you're not familiar with the case, then don't bother to answer, the Secretary of Agriculture against Central Reio Refining Company you have -- do you remember that case, which gave the Sugar Act of 1948 to authorize the Secretary to make allotment for control of sugar, sugar quota and in that case we reversed Court of Appeals for the district because (Inaudible) too severe a rate.

    I'd like to clear up this business of necessary facilities and appurtenances because I think the construction claimed by respondents is entirely unfair. 
    On page 157 of our brief, we set out Section 51 of this particular statute, which was passed by the same Congress that dealt with the 1950 Act. 
    And it is our contention that to try to limit the words of facilities and appurtenances, to what they claim in Section 10 of the statute, is not fair or realistic at all when the same Congress elaborates in Section 51, the latter half of that page, in detail, all of these various things; the dredging facilities, docks, wharfs, sewer systems, civil air terminals, the commissaries, store houses, quarters and any other necessary facilities and appurtenances. 
    Now that's the way this very same Congress used the words facilities and appurtenances within five or six months and clearly within the period they were considering this whole thing. 
    And they only use facilities and appurtenances in the limited manner they did in Section 10, because that was only that portion of those facilities and appurtenances that were contemplated to be transferred because the rest had been. 
    But if you read these together I think any reasonable construction and this Court in ex rel. Rogers versus Graves has already long before taken the position that all of these various activities were a part of the necessary operations of this canal.

    Mr. J. Lee Rankin 
    Apparently someone inquired of Mr. Chandler and Mr. Chandler said that he thought it was not a proper subject for judicial review and then he received a communication from Judge Clark suggesting that it should be and he changed his opinion and so advised the committee.

speaker="charles_dickerman_williams" startTime="5547.832" stopTime="5579.547">
    Mr. Charles Dickerman Williams 
    Well the only question was whether or not the review power should be in the Court of Appeals and Mr. Chandler wrote a letter to Senator Magnuson, I don't recall the incident very well, the gist of it was however that Senator Magnuson I believe wrote to Mr. Chandler and Mr. Chandler then wrote a letter to Senator Magnuson and then -- saying it wasn't appropriate for judicial review and then he wrote a letter saying that it was appropriate for judicial review, I believe that was the gist of it.

    Mr. Charles Dickerman Williams 
    Yes. 
    May I make just a couple of remarks Your Honor?
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="5587.446" stopTime="5591.822">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Yes you may Mr. --
speaker="charles_dickerman_williams" startTime="5591.822" stopTime="5630.804">
    Mr. Charles Dickerman Williams 
    My learned friend referred to Judge Walsh's remark saying he was only going to consider jurisdiction. 
    His opinion I submit shows that he went way beyond jurisdictional matters and that exercise -- he exercised jurisdiction and didn't merely decide whether or not he had jurisdiction. 
    In fact in the Court of Appeals I complained bitterly about Judge Walsh after telling me that he was only going to consider jurisdiction, going way beyond consideration. 
    I don't think there's -- one can possible reconcile Judge Walsh's opinions, but those remarks which he made, which Mr. Rankin read a few minutes ago. 
    And on this --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="5630.804" stopTime="5634.109">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    What was the action that he took Mr. Williams?
speaker="charles_dickerman_williams" startTime="5634.109" stopTime="5635.213">
    Mr. Charles Dickerman Williams 
    The answer that he took which --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="5635.213" stopTime="5636.848">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    The action that he took.
speaker="charles_dickerman_williams" startTime="5636.848" stopTime="5657.293">
    Mr. Charles Dickerman Williams 
    He dismissed the complaint. 
    And the reason I say that he went beyond jurisdiction is because you construed the statute as meaning that tolls fixing was a matter of the defendant's contentment. 
    As a matter of fact the Court of Appeals' opinion is largely devoted to that thesis of Judge Walsh.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="5657.293" stopTime="5670.691">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Am I right in saying that whatever he talked he thought was relevant to the determination whether he had jurisdiction and one may have different views at what the arguments which he adduced did or did not establish that thesis?
speaker="charles_dickerman_williams" startTime="5670.691" stopTime="5671.621">
    Mr. Charles Dickerman Williams 
    Well Your Honor –-
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="5671.621" stopTime="5674.081">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Just the thing he was concerned with.
speaker="charles_dickerman_williams" startTime="5674.081" stopTime="5722.468">
    Mr. Charles Dickerman Williams 
    Your Honor all I can say is that, if I understand jurisdiction correctly and that was my -- what I argued with the Court of Appeals at any rate, that he went beyond jurisdiction. 
    Now I make one request Your Honor with great reluctance because I'm afraid we've burdened the Court enormously here already, but Mr. Rankin late Tuesday served a reply brief on me, in which I think he has been mislead by what I -- what the Court of Appeals has regarded as defendant's ambiguous bookkeeping and makes a certain statement that I do not think is supported by the facts. 
    I think my -- and I don't blame him for it but I think he has been mislead by that bookkeeping and I wondered if I could put in a few, say something not more than five pages.
