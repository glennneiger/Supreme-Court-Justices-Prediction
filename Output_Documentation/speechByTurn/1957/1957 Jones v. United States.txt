    Mr. Engene L. Grimm 
    May it please the Court. 
    The facts of the case are these. 
    On April 30, 1956, federal agents in the Northern District of Georgia received a tip from an informant that petitioner had installed a distillery in his farmhouse. 
    He had -- he had previously had experience along that line and so the agents proceeded to his farmhouse, to the vicinity thereof to investigate the situation. 
    They found spent mash running from a rubber hose into a small river, in a hollow behind the farmhouse and traces to within approximately 50 yards of the house. 
    The following day, which is May 1st, 1956, they again returned to the vicinity. 
    They found at that time, spent mash was once again running into the stream. 
    They could smell the odor of cooking mash in the area. 
    They could hear the sound of a blower burner in operation. 
    Here, I might say that a blower burner is used to transmit fuel oil to the boiler, which generates steam and steam is then in turn used in distillation process. 
    They also heard voices and bumping noises and continued their surveillance at that time until about 2:00 a.m.on the morning of May 2nd. 
    So, as of that time, the agents knew that a distillery was in operation within the farmhouse and they knew that several persons were involved, because for -- from time to time they could see people moving around the premises.

    Mr. Engene L. Grimm 
    It was a drive for the federal officers of about 30 to 45 minutes, each way.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="163.274" stopTime="165.847">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    They of course had cars, did they, the federal officers?
speaker="engene_l_grimm" startTime="165.847" stopTime="303.512">
    Mr. Engene L. Grimm 
    They had one car for the five. 
    They were five in the group. 
    I -- I'd like to say on page 40 of the record, State Agent Hollingsworth is testifying and he testified, it took 30 to 45 minutes to drive out there. 
    Later on that day of May 2nd, in the afternoon, the agents procured a daytime search warrant and proceeded in a party of five again to the vicinity of the farmhouse. 
    They arrived there in about an hour before darkness. 
    It was a gray overcast the day. 
    They took up a position in a small grove across the road from petitioner's farmhouse. 
    And the agent in charge, elect in charge -- elected to continue his investigation rather than serve the warrant at that time. 
    He testified that he did this for two reasons. 
    Number one, he wanted to learn whether any other persons were implicated in the operation of this distillery. 
    He wanted to learn who they were and he also wanted to learn whether there were any vehicles involved. 
    It began to rain heavily and the rain slackened off then at about 7:00 p.m. or thereabout. 
    The agents heard voices from the farmhouse. 
    The voices inquired whether someone would like to bring up the truck at that time and an unidentified person left the premises and went down to the home of petitioner's father, which is about a quarter of a mile down the road. 
    Thereafter, a truck was driven into the farmyard and driven around behind the farmhouse, out of sight of the agents. 
    Then, the agents saw people moving around in the house through a window, a lighted window. 
    They heard heavy bumping noises, as though heavy objects were being moved. 
    And -- and about 9:00 or 9:15 p.m., the truck motor was started and the truck began to drive around from the corner of the farmhouse. 
    The agents then began to move across the road and as the truck arrived at the driveway to the farmhouse it became mired. 
    At that point, the agents overtook the truck and they arrested two persons who are on the truck. 
    Number one, James McKinney, who's driving the truck and Grady Jones, the brother of petitioner, was on the back.

    Mr. Engene L. Grimm 
    We rely upon it, only insofar that it contributes to the entering that the -- to the inference that the agents entered for the purpose of making an arrest and not for the purpose of searching for contraband, having made the -- as I will say later, having made two arrests, having known that several persons were involved, having known that one of those persons was petitioner, he not having been on the truck but having been vitally interested of course in the removal of the fruits of his operation from the premises. 
    We think that we have reasonable inference that the agents could believe that he was therefore in the house.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="361.097" stopTime="372.314">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Well, then that -- that it says a matter of evidence, in other words, that it is evidence which shows light upon that purpose in entering the house is really a purpose to make an arrest.

    Mr. Engene L. Grimm

    Mr. Engene L. Grimm 
    No. 
    As a matter of fact, it was not. 
    After seized -- after making the arrest on the truck and after seizing the alcohol on the truck, the agents then moved to both the front and back door. 
    And State Agent Hollingsworth, as a matter of fact, was the first one that came to the front porch. 
    Now, while they were making the arrest at the truck, an unidentified carrier had come down the public road, turned into the driveway through another entrance or turned into the farmyard through another driveway. 
    And so when Agent Hollingsworth arrived at the front porch, he found petitioner's wife and petitioner's 12-year-old son there present. 
    Now, the boy was standing inside the doorway and he was holding a shotgun at point arm. 
    Hollingsworth asked him to hand over the gun, he refused to do so. 
    Hollingsworth then asked his mother to tell the boy to hand over the shotgun, she refused to do so. 
    After some conversation then, Hollingsworth edged closer and finally succeeded in jumping through the doorway and seizing the shotgun.

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Well, now Mr. Grimm, in that respect, his testimony. 
    "I was standing in the door at that time,” I'm looking at page 38, "Hadn't entered. 
    So, ever when the kid got close enough so that I could get to the gun. 
    I got the gun, sir, got the gun from the kid." 
    Now, does that show that he entered?

    No, sir, but the District Court expressly found in its findings of fact that the first entry was made by Hollingsworth for the purpose of disarming the boy.

    Mr. Engene L. Grimm 
    On page 37. 
    "I went on the porch, Mr. Jones, was at the porch -- on the porch rather and as I run upon the porch, a small boy there grabbed a shotgun and held it up more or less as at port arms and he went to the back." 
    That is from front to back to the house. 
    "I hollered to Woody and Jim that he was coming to the back door with a gun, to look out." 
    And after he went to the backdoor, I told Mrs.Jones, "Make the boy put the gun down." 
    And she says, "I'm not going to do it." 
    Asked for a search warrant and I told her, "We didn't need a search warrant," and the kid came back toward me, through the house again and I kept telling him, "Son, don't you shoot me. 
    Give me that gun," and he never would do it. 
    I was standing in the door at that time.

    Mr. Engene L. Grimm 
    Well, once it would depend upon the lawfulness of their entry. 
    Otherwise, as we argued in Miller and as I say here, they're entitled to break-in or enter on over protest only if they have reasonable cause to believe that they can make a valid arrest inside the house, only if they have probable cause for an arrest and only if they have reason to believe that the person that they seek is within the house.

    Mr. Engene L. Grimm 
    Yes, Your Honor. 
    If I may -- if I may continue, after entry, the agents found petitioner's father and petitioner's brother inside the house. 
    They did not find petitioner. 
    They also found a distillery in a room on the main floor of the house. 
    Leading up in this room was a stairway to the attic. 
    In the attic, they found barrels. 
    They found 2700 gallons of mash, a mash found in all of the other paraphernalia, usually associated with the operation of a distillery. 
    They came back downstairs, inquired with Mrs. Jones and the boy and then went up on the front porch and waited for petitioner. 
    He returned home at about 10:00 p.m. and admitted ownership of the still and denied that the liquor found on the truck came from his operation. 
    Thereafter, the agents made the seizure of the still and destroyed that portion which they could not remove with them.

    Was a -- well, it was a search for Jones. 
    I say though on the basis of the fact that it is Roy Jones who tell this -- in his testimony, what it is that the agents did, in connection with this distillery. 
    On page 14, he says the question, “Now, then, did they seize that or destroyed or take it with them or what?” 
    They took part of it with them and destroyed the rest. 
    Destroyed it right there in the house or take it outside? 
    They destroyed everything in the house rather -- rather than the beer or the mash whichever one you might want to call it. 
    They pumped a good deal of heat out and left the rest. 
    This, I take it to -- from this, I believe you can draw the inference that he was there when they did it and that would have to be after he returned.

speaker="engene_l_grimm" startTime="1459.684" stopTime="1476.565">
    Mr. Engene L. Grimm 
    That would not necessarily be so, Your Honor, because we contend that the contraband having been in plain view after a lawful entry and the agents having come upon it in plain view after a lawful entry. 
    It was subject to immediate forfeiture and seizure by these agents.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="1476.565" stopTime="1487.060">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Well, that's the position you take in your brief, isn't it? 
    You don't relate this until Jones' returned home.

speaker="engene_l_grimm" startTime="1487.060" stopTime="1526.913">
    Mr. Engene L. Grimm 
    That's right, Your Honor. 
    However, that is simply the -- the way the facts happened as -- as I believe they are to be found. 
    We do not contend that the search of a dwelling house is justified on probable cause to believe that contraband will be found within. 
    However, we do believe that agents may -- if they have probable cause to make an arrest and reason to believe that the person they seek is within the dwelling house that they may enter for the purpose of finding him and arresting him.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1526.913" stopTime="1527.243">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    And --
speaker="engene_l_grimm" startTime="1527.243" stopTime="1608.581">
    Mr. Engene L. Grimm 
    And that having -- then, coming upon contraband in plain view, the contraband is subject to seizure. 
    Here, I might also say that this case stands on the same footing as one where an arrest is made after entry, even though no -- as it turned out, no entry -- no arrest was made thereafter because if the test of whether or not they're entitled to make an entry is reasonable cause to believe that the person is within there then the fact that the arrest isn't -- is not made thereafter, cannot be the determining issue. 
    We could not justify an entry by what is found thereafter on the person if someone who was arrested. 
    We could not justify his arrest by the fact that he might be found committing a felony. 
    The test is still whether there was probable cause to believe that he was committing a felony at the time of entry. 
    And so, the fact that an arrest could not be made ultimately, does not measure the lawfulness of the entry. 
    Nonetheless, we come back to the proposition that if they had reason to believe that the person they sought was within the house and if they had probable cause to make an arrest, then the entry is lawful.

    A day. 
    So that for a full day, they could have brought them -- held within the Fourth Amendment, namely, the right of the people to be securing their person, how could a state in effect, against unreasonable search and seizure? 
    The Government interfered with cases and I'm sorry to say that the Court I think has taken that brief out of context against unreasonable search and seizure shall not be violated as no warrant shall issue. 
    In other words, warrant appears there for the first time in relation to what we preceded, namely, an unreasonable search and seizure, is something by which no warrant was issued because it says there, no warrant shall issue. 
    That's the way to avoid unreasonable search and seizure, except in the restricted and limited, and closely confined situation of necessity where you couldn't get a warrant issued.

    Mr. Engene L. Grimm 
    First of all, when I used the word “came upon,” they -- they entered the house as we contend to arrest petitioner. 
    Now, there has been a good deal of commotion outside and they could reasonably infer that he might be hiding inside the house. 
    And so, they could look into each room in the house. 
    Now, they didn't know where in the house was the distillery was and when I say, “They came upon it,” I mean, “they came upon,” it's exactly the case (Voice Overlap) --

    Mr. Engene L. Grimm 
    Yes, sir. 
    Now, insofar as the Fourth Amendment is concerned, it is true as -- as you -- certainly true as you've just said that it begins a person -- people shall be secured against unreasonable searches and seizures and that no warrant shall issue. 
    However, I do not believe that the Amendment has been read by this Court, to mean that the latter portion of the Amendment limits the first portion. 
    And so, through judicial decision, we have evolved the concepts of certain kinds of searches that are reasonable, thus, the search on proper warrant. 
    Search warrant is reasonable, thus, the search incident to arrest is reasonable.

   Rebuttal of Wesley R. Asinof
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2169.737" stopTime="2175.099">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Asinof, you may close your argument.
speaker="wesley_r_asinof" startTime="2175.099" stopTime="2283.261">
    Mr. Wesley R. Asinof 
    I would like to take the remaining time that I have to answer a question from Mr. Justice Brennan, with reference to the force angle that was used in -- and call the Court's attention to the brief filed by the petitioner on page 19 of that brief. 
    There's an appendix in there of the testimony of Mrs.Roy Jones as to this particular portion, right toward the bottom of the page, this is her answer. 
    Speaking about the agent, the federal agent, he says, “We don't wait.” 
    So, he kept pushing and I kept pushing back and they'd sling me first one way and the other. 
    But then, I come back on them and there's one of them, that little old, I don't know which one he was, a little short one, he told my little boy, he said, “You stand back or I slap your brains out,” and I say, “You won't put your hands on my kid.” 
    And I asked the question, “How old is that little boy?” 
    And said -- she said, “Well, he was 12 at that time.” 
    I say, “You won't put your hands on my kid.” 
    He says, “I'll slap his damn brains out,” and there was another one there. 
    He said to that other one, he says, “Here, put this handcuffs on him.” 
    He slapped my hands behind me and got one of the handcuffs on me. 
    Woody come up and say, “You take the handcuffs off of her,” so he took the handcuffs off of me. 
    And then right on the bottom of page 20, in response to a question on cross-examination by the District Attorney. 
    Question “And they didn't do anything to you except to go pass you and get into the house?” 
    Answer “No. 
    They -- I was at the door and they pushed me against the side of the door and I run in front of them again. 
    They would push me back up against the wall and I'd come back and I'd pushed them again. 
    And when they put their feet and skinned -- well, they had skinned my feet all over kicking. 
    I reckon not stopping, as I was pushing them backwards.” 
    Now, the record just shows that this was --
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="2283.261" stopTime="2285.455">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Where do you recall that, in your appendix in your brief?
speaker="wesley_r_asinof" startTime="2285.455" stopTime="2287.738">
    Mr. Wesley R. Asinof 
    Yes, Your Honor. 
    It's in the appendix on page 19 and 20.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="2287.738" stopTime="2289.176">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    You have it printed in the record?
speaker="wesley_r_asinof" startTime="2289.176" stopTime="2425.871">
    Mr. Wesley R. Asinof 
    No, Your Honor. 
    We -- we omitted it from printing, but we put in the other -- in as much as the Solicitor General put this of it. 
    Now, I'd like to call the Court's attention also to another question as for Mr. Justice Brennan yesterday. 
    On page 51 of the record, this testimony appears in here a question. 
    “What was the reason, please sir, that you told Mrs.Jones that you did not need a search warrant or didn't have one?” 
    Answer “Because I thought we had sufficient evidence to go in the premises without a search warrant.” 
    Question “You didn't exhibit this search warrant that you had to her?” 
    Answer “I did not. 
    That was a daytime search warrant.” 
    And on page 54 of the record, the trial judge found this as a matter of fact, as to the entry. 
    Mrs. Jones asked Officer Woody Langford if he had a search warrant and Langford replied that he did not need one and the officers then searched the premises without a search warrant, with reference to question asked by Mr. Justice Frankfurter. 
    On the same page, the trial judge found this as a matter of fact with reference to the -- he says the house had only two or three doors and they were five officers watching the residence and would have been possible for the officers to watch each of the doors and still send another officer for a nighttime search warrant had the officers deemed this to be necessary. 
    At the bottom of the page, in the trial judge's findings of fact, he says, "The Court finds that probable cause for the search existed at the time the search was made. 
    There was no finding that there was any question of going in there for the purpose of making an arrest," as contended by the Government in this Court. 
    Now, this, if the Court please, we say that this case is on all fours with the Kaplan case. 
    It was decided by Judge Learned Hand in the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, I believe. 
    On page -- page 5 of our reply brief. 
    In that case, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals with reference to a warrant of arrest and this case was -- certiorari was denied by this Court. 
    The Court said this, “The statute certainly requires a warrant when there is time to obtain one that this concession is limited to occasions when it is not safe to wait,” and they were speaking of arrest warrants in that case. 
    Now, we respectfully submit that in this case, the record shows that there was no question, but what they did have was an ample amount of time to have obtained some warrant of some kind, either to search or to arrest.

    Does it mean the implication of what we've just said, if isn't it, that although they could have searched and seized more particularly to the extent that it was done in this case as an incident, in the Government's point of view, before there was an arrest, assume that.
