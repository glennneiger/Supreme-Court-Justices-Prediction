    Number 91, National Association for the Advance of Colored People, Petitioner, versus State of Alabama.

    Mr. Edmon L. Rinehart 
    Mr. Chief Justice, just before closing you asked me a question concerning the Alabama statutes dealing with these domestication statutes and the enforcement thereof.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="28.490" stopTime="30.225">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Yes.
speaker="edmon_l_rinehart" startTime="30.225" stopTime="67.234">
    Mr. Edmon L. Rinehart 
    There are two criminal statutes. 
    They are set out in the petitioner's brief at page 36 in a footnote. 
    They -- one of those denies a foreign corporation which makes a contract in Alabama the power to assert their rights under that contract.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="67.234" stopTime="69.017">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Yes.
speaker="edmon_l_rinehart" startTime="69.017" stopTime="112.855">
    Mr. Edmon L. Rinehart 
    They had also set certain penalties which are misdemeanors and those are enforced by the solicitors of our respective circuits and counties and on appeals where the Attorney General's Office would handle loss. 
    Those are the only statutes in Alabama which deal with what we would call the enforcement, that is the method of penalizing a corporation or its agents for coming in and doing business without a license. 
    We do not place our action or base our action in any way on those. 
    In fact, part of the basis of our action is that those do not provide an adequate remedy at law.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="112.855" stopTime="152.186">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    What I was thinking about Mr. Rinehart was whether it has a penalty for having -- having been delinquent in that query. 
    There was any authority in anyone to say to that corporation that you cannot now qualify. 
    I consider there will be many number of penalties that might attach to it but is there such a penalty as a denial of the right to register because of the delinquency in registering beforehand.
speaker="edmon_l_rinehart" startTime="152.186" stopTime="286.051">
    Mr. Edmon L. Rinehart 
    Not a penalty but we believe a power in the court of equity in its equity jurisdiction to police, perhaps police is not the correct word, to supervise corporations once it has jurisdiction of the subject matter in this case to maintain the status quo. 
    We petitioned not only for temporary injunction but a permanent injunction and ultimately an order of ouster basing it on the power of the state to exclude a corporation completely. 
    If we had not in the first place let it in, we don't -- we actually concede, if we let a corporation in, we allowed to qualify, we can't then turn around and say, “We're sorry, we just don't like you anymore.” 
    Or we can't ask them to waive their constitutional rights in advance and coming in as a condition preceding to entry. 
    But where they are interlopers as we consider this corporation to be doing business in Alabama without even the slightest action toward complying with our laws that they are interlopers and that they have absolutely no right to be here and that the equity power is the only effective way to protect and vindicate the constitutional provision which is involved here -- the constitution that is of Alabama, Section 232. 
    And that the equity courts have that power. 
    And if they have the power to oust, they have the lesser concluded power to restrain their qualified as a -- in fact, that's one of the reasons we think that the records to get to the merits of this case -- no I mean the merits before the Circuit Court is so important in this case to determine whether or not they should be ousted in a proceeding of equity in the nature of (Inaudible) such as Kansas did in State ex rel Griffith against Knights of the Ku Klux Klan. 
    That is the gravamen of the states petition, a sworn bill, I might add, a sworn bill in equity which was filed on June 1, 1956.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Does your statute regarding the domestication of foreign corporation have a provision that until such a certificate of whatever you call it, have foreign corporation can sue in your court?

    Mr. Edmon L. Rinehart 
    If they are doing business in Alabama without qualifying, they cannot sue at our courts. 
    That is correct. 
    I am -- I stand corrected on that. 
    They may not enforce rights in our court growing out of that business in Alabama. 
    Yes, a corporation may come in and sue for instance an insurance company in certain conditions and that is not considered doing business --

    We -- one of the most important phases of that business and there are others alleged which are not admitted is that they are soliciting members. 
    We allege and believe a large number of members. 
    That is a financial transaction conducted in Alabama by agents of this organization to support branches which we alleged they control on Alabama. 
    And if that is doing business in Alabama that we are in the position of proving that and it's going -- the best way of proving how a corporation operates that I know of, is to get their records and look at them and see what they really do, what their own record show.

    Mr. Carter said yesterday (Inaudible)

    Mr. Edmon L. Rinehart 
    No. 
    They we're prepared to admit and if I may, I shall read from the record.I am now reading from record pages 6 and 7, the last full paragraph on page 6 beginning on July 23. 
    Petitioner filed his answer admitting (1) that it was a New York corporation, (2) that it maintains its southeast regional office in Birmingham, (3) that it hired employee agents to operate this office but denied that he did organized local chapters in the state and that the agents of the corporation's solicited for said local chapters and apparent corporation, denied that he did employ or paid money to Autherine Lucy and Pollie Myers Hudson to encourage or aid them enrolling in the University of Alabama. 
    Admitted six, furnishing legal counsel to Autherine Lucy in prosecuting her suit against the University of Alabama. 
    Admitted seven, it had given moral and financial support to Negro residents of Montgomery in connection with their refusal to use the public transportation system of Montgomery and had furnished legal counsel to assist (Inaudible) M. L. King and other Negros indicted in connection with that matter. 
    But denied all other allegations and inferences contained in that allegation in bill of complaint and denied eight that its officers, agents or employees have engaged in organizing chapters for the corporation in Alabama and Montgomery County, collecting dues, soliciting memberships, loaning or giving personal property to aid present aim to the corporation, admitted that it had never filed with the Secretary of State, Articles of Incorporation or designated place of business or authorized agents within the state but denied ten, that it was required by Sections192, 193 and 194 of Title 10, Code of Alabama in 1940 to do so. 
    Petitioner denied that it has violated Article XII, Section 232, Constitution of Alabama 1901 and Section 192, 193 and 194, Title 10, Code of Alabama 1940. 
    Further, petitioner denied 11 that these acts are causing irreparable injury to the property of civil rights of the citizens, residents and citizens of the State of Alabama. 
    Now, we do not concede that that is an admission of doing business in Alabama.In fact, it is one of those things to say we're admitting we're doing A, B and C but we deny these other things and when you get all finished, your laws don't apply. 
    Now Section 232 was all inclusive, it says all corporations doing business in Alabama, and I could only construe that to mean that they're are saying that “While we admit doing certain things, we're not doing business in Alabama within the meaning of your laws.”
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="586.702" stopTime="597.645">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well, Mr. Rinehart, doesn't next paragraph though bear on that?
speaker="edmon_l_rinehart" startTime="597.645" stopTime="599.602">
    Mr. Edmon L. Rinehart 
    You mean the assertion that --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="599.602" stopTime="602.546">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    It's a short paragraph, I suppose you read that.
speaker="edmon_l_rinehart" startTime="602.546" stopTime="809.669">
    Mr. Edmon L. Rinehart 
    Yes, Your Honor. 
    In addition to the various defenses to the bill of complaint, petitioner, while asserting the Title 10, Sections 192, 193 and 194 of the Code of Alabama 1940 was not applicable, had procured the necessary forms from the Office of the Secretary of State, Montgomery, Alabama and had filled in the forms as required by law and offered to file the same. 
    Said forms were attached to his answer and petitioner stated that it would file these forms if the court would dissolve its orders buying petition from registering and would permit petitioner to file the forms attached to his answer. 
    We submit it does not and for some very definite reasons. 
    One, on reviewing the chronology of this case, you will see that petitioner didn't file any pleadings until 31 days after the temporary injunction of that, on the fifth of July which was three days after and I might add, that then the trial judge set down the hearing on a motion to dissolve a temporary injunction for the 16th of July. 
    The State then moved to produce -- rather moved for an order for them to produce, which motion was heard on the 9th of July which counsel for the petitioner was present. 
    The case was fully argued and presented on that question purely of the production and the order was granted on the 11th. 
    Then their time was extended. 
    Then the order said produce on the 16th which was the day before the hearing on the motion to dissolve the temporary injunction. 
    Now, Alabama procedure is that while oral testimony may not be introduced on such a hearing as a matter of right, you can put it in if it isn't objected to. 
    But in addition, the hearing can be on affidavits of both sides. 
    We thought it's extremely important to have those records to sustain and (Inaudible) the allegations of the bill to prepare affidavits, to obtain affidavits. 
    Then the trial judge extended their time to produce.He correspondingly extended our time for the hearing because we needed those documents in connection with the hearing. 
    Now then, at the last hour or if not the 12th hour, at least the 11th hour, they come in with an answer. 
    Now, we're not interested in a corporation filing these papers if they don't have to file them.If they are exempt, they don't need to tender it. 
    Alabama isn't interested in a corporation not doing business in Alabama, filing these documents. 
    We are not trying to assert a right we don't have but we think we're entitled to a hearing on the merits as to whether or not they are doing business in Alabama because our ultimate aim in this, admittedly, I couldn't deny it on what we've alleged here, is that we think they are long-past record of ignoring our laws warranted something more than a slap on the wrist saying, “Well, now you can pay it and go and send no more.” 
    But we felt that like Kansas, we had a right to oust them, completely.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="809.669" stopTime="871.523">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    May I ask you this. 
    You correct me if I misunderstand it -- if my understanding is inaccurate. 
    You brought out the proceeding against the NAACP. 
    They said they didn't come within your law either because they are a membership corporation of New York or because what they did in Alabama does not include what legally speaking is doing business in Alabama. 
    But they said as you can have them to say, I think to seldom say on the advice of counsel, well whether we are right or wrong and lead him first to comply. 
    So they say we're ready to file this certificate if this is what you want. 
    But they did contend the coercive power of Alabama to make this file. 
    That's correct isn't it? 
    Didn't they deny that they come within your law requiring to do anything including what they did do in Alabama?
speaker="edmon_l_rinehart" startTime="871.523" stopTime="874.907">

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Well, what they -- but you said, they have been doing over these years during which they didn't file -- that they should have filed a certificate and domesticate themselves, isn't that true? 
    You said they've been doing business for good many years in Alabama and certainly way back since 1918 or probably earlier in connection with their purposes.
speaker="edmon_l_rinehart" startTime="891.806" stopTime="892.698">

    That is correct.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="892.698" stopTime="914.212">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    So that you say, you've been doing business without the requisite provision of Alabama. 
    They said, “We don't come within your law.We didn't have to satisfy the requirements of getting a certificate but in the interest of whatever it is, convenience, we are ready to file this certificate.” 
    And you said, “No, we don't have to accept it.”

    Now, and on the basis of the facts that's quickly summarized, the State got a restraining order against them calling for the cessation of all business although they raised, what I supposed, is not a frivolous or a ridiculous objection to the claim asserted by the State.

    That being so, what I want to put to you is that pending the determination of what is not a frivolous question, what is a substantial question that respectable lawyers can raise and do raise and have raised, Alabama takes the position that although this organization has been in Alabama all these years without any attention or objection from the authority with Alabama. 
    I am not talking about a stopple. 
    I'm addressing myself to the nature of the remedy. 
    Although that has been so and although they raised that question ancillary to the proceedings of oust. 
    Alabama says, “You go out of business until this long trail of litigation because you have, standing on constitutional right said, “You don't have to obey this.” 
    Alabama then throws them in contempt but all this time they are executed.

    But that is the question before us whether they raise it by a -- whether a certiorari by which they sought to raise it, raised all these issues.

    Mr. Edmon L. Rinehart 
    I would like to address myself to that specific question in -- in considerable detail and explain the fairness of the Alabama procedure and that is this, the Alabama procedure on a subpoena duces tecum if in case of a third party or an order to produce documents is that that is an interlocutory order not appealable. 
    The proper remedy is petition for writ of mandamus. 
    And why is that? 
    Because the person does not have to set himself up as the sole judge of relevancy, the sole judge of constitutionality and bring himself to the position of flat out as this petitioner did in open court and saying, “We don't need anymore time. 
    We choose to stand on these rights.”
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1225.762" stopTime="1256.833">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Now, so far as I'm concerned, and that's the only person to whom I can ever (Inaudible). 
    So far as I'm concerned, if it can be established that the orderly, traditional, settled procedure of Alabama requires the rating of these questions solely by mandamus and I think the other side is out of court so far as I'm concerned because Alabama has the right to say, “It should be raised by mandamus and not by certiorari, if you're right.
speaker="edmon_l_rinehart" startTime="1256.833" stopTime="1345.794">
    Mr. Edmon L. Rinehart 
    If I'm right. 
    Well, we have cited in our brief at pages 9 and 17, thereof, Ex parte Monroe County Bank, 254 Ala. 515. 
    Now that I will grant you the Monroe County Bank was not a party to the action. 
    They were -- this was a subpoena duces tecum. 
    In that case, they didn't choose or felt that they did not have the duty to produce certain records in a divorce proceeding. 
    Husband against wife and of course these financial matters become very important. 
    If they proceeded by writ of mandamus to test the validity of that subpoena duces tecum in the Alabama court and it went to the Supreme Court and all the questions we're passed on it. 
    Now that isn't enough. 
    That doesn't make a great long line of cases. 
    In addition, Ex parte Hart cited in the Supreme Courts' opinion had a similar question of an order to produce. 
    The court didn't discuss that thing at length. 
    It was just the well accepted method in Alabama.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    If I -- if my reading with all the consciousness that one should have about reading the decisions of a state or the law which he isn't familiar except by reading. 
    If my reading of your cases were a consistent document that mandamus is the crucial remedy, I would have to go with you. 
    But if my reading of your cases is this that sometimes Alabama does and sometimes Alabama doesn't allow all the substantive questions to be raised on certiorari then I'd say to you that it can't invoke that doctrine when the federal right is asserted when it doesn't invoke at another instances.

    Mr. Edmon L. Rinehart

speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1390.860" stopTime="1412.218">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    That is what I suggested. 
    I don't think this Court -- I don't think I can say that that which the Supreme Court of Alabama treats a certiorari should be deemed to be a mandamus. 
    That's not my function. 
    But if I find that on certiorari, it has intermittently considered all substantive questions and then it can draw the curtain when a federal question is (Inaudible).

    Mr. Edmon L. Rinehart 
    The cases which both parties have cited, Ex parte Morris at pages 8, 14 and 15 of the respondent's brief, is a case which comes to mind as well as the instant case. 
    Of course we submit in the instant case the Supreme Court of Alabama said we are going to exposit essentially. 
    We're going to demonstrate for future guidance of use but they did not make them the basis of the decision. 
    And I think that's a very important distinction to make and extremely important one in this case and also in Ex parte Morris. 
    Ex parte Morris concerned this question. 
    A -- an officer of the Ku Klux Klan was directed to bring before the grand jury records of that corporation -- of that organization.

    And he said he stood on his constitutional rights not to do it and was held in contempt. 
    He -- he was brought in before the judge and the judge says, “You'll produce them.” 
    Now, he then filed a petition for certiorari which is the established law of Alabama for reviewing contempt citations whether civil or criminal and a writ for certiorari was denied because on the face of the proceedings, the Court had jurisdiction, nice little memorandum decision. 
    Then they said, “However, we're going to exposit our views on these constitutional questions, not as a basis of decision as I read the case. 
    But merely because we'd like people to know that corporations, for example, don't have a privilege against self-incrimination, don't have a right of secrecy.” 
    Now those are the chief cases which I have studied on this other than -- and that I know of myself that really face up to these problems except Ex parte Dickens also cited in petitioner's brief and our brief. 
    If you wish, I will refer the page number and I think I can explain that case too, and it shows that the merits of the case we're not considered. 
    In that case, petition for certiorari, what was considered was contempt of an order to deliver certain bonds and other documents to a receiver and equity. 
    The Court reiterated the traditional view that certiorari -- you look at the face of the proceedings. 
    You see whether there was jurisdiction of the persons -- the parties I should say, jurisdiction of the subject matter, whether there was a contempt, whether all the procedural aspects of a contempt proceeding are followed, remembering that it is a completely ancillary proceeding. 
    Now, and they held that in fact since the face of the proceeding is so that in fact the he had obeyed the order and that there hadn't been any new order, even though a new receiver had been appointed, there was no contempt. 
    They went on to say that if there was a question of a payment of a debt, the debt could be reviewed on petition for writ of habeas corpus. 
    Now they didn't say -- they didn't do as the Morris case and in this case. 
    They didn't say, “Well, now, we said all, we're got to say all we have to say.” 
    They just went on and discussed this question of writ of habeas corpus that had he been imprisoned in this case to pay a debt which might well had been the case, why then he could have reviewed it for petition for writ of habeas corpus. 
    Now, there maybe other cases in Alabama, I regret I don't know of any other which bears on this issue.

    There's no -- no serious ground for saying anything will happen.

    Because we break it down into -- into two steps, you have really two ancillary proceedings and ancillary questions. 
    You have first the validity of the order to produce which is tested by mandamus and secondly, then if they choose to just say as this petitioner did, we're not going to -- we ignore I don't know why they didn't file a petition for writ of mandamus but they did to test only the order to produce and if you then choose the route of saying --

    I just want to be sure I understand this.. 
    Are you suggesting that on your analysis of the Alabama cases, there is none where in fact in review on certiorari of an order of civil contempt, your Supreme Court has ever reviewed the merits of an order of the underlying order which -- which was disobeyed and upon which the contempt finding was made?
speaker="edmon_l_rinehart" startTime="2089.223" stopTime="2122.098">
    Mr. Edmon L. Rinehart 
    That is correct. 
    Now, there was a case cited yesterday which I was not personally aware of. 
    I believe I have that citation 68 So.2d 834, this Armstrong case which is a -- we maintained -- the Court did not look at the merits. 
    This is one of those cases where they applied for certiorari and it was treated as mandamus. 
    The case isn't at all that case.

    Mr. Edmon L. Rinehart 
    At Armstrong case, it's the only case that I know of that bears -- that seems to even bear on it. 
    And that in fact was an appeal from the denial of the Court to hold the man in contempt to take contempt proceeding against and even though he had very possibly on a record violated the order and then they threw in a sort of general prayer on top of the appeal. 
    And the Court reviewed the portion of the contempt proceedings, they also reviewed other matters on the merits of the whole case as I see it on the appeal feature but specifically on the contempt feature, they said, “Well, as far as this contempt -- pure contempt angle, we will consider to that extent certiorari,” and they did in fact. 
    They didn't look at the merits except to this extent which is the established Alabama law to see whether or not there was a contempt.

    There are a number of complicating features. 
    I -- I see the -- not only the drift of the question but you do get sort to that point and all I can say is that as far as the way the Court talks they say we're looking strictly at the face of these contempt proceedings for jurisdiction.

    Will he not think that that was an appropriate -- he might appropriately believe that the next time he came up by certiorari not only with the contempt itself whether there's been a disobedience but as well whether or not what was disobeyed was valid would be considered by your Supreme Court.

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    That's just the point but the way the per curiam reads this, it is the established rule of this Court that the proper method of reviewing a judgment for civil contempt to the kind here involved is by a petition for common law writ of certiorari. 
    And this Court as through the years upheld to grant the writ for the purposes of review where a reasonable ground for its issuance is properly presented in such petition. 
    And it was after that decision and that per curiam that the first petition for certiorari, I see it's all on the same page, on August 13 rather cryptically was denied on the ground that the insufficient to warrant the issuance of the writ, the averments of the petitioner insufficient as to say in what respect insufficient. 
    And then it was followed on August, the petition which led to the judgment and opinion before us and I'm just was wondering how anyone was involved in this very case. 
    If reading your cases before this one felt that there was going to be a review both of the underlying order as well as of the contempt itself. 
    I could help but take this as an instruction of your Supreme Court, go ahead and follow the root of writ of certiorari and we will consider both the contempt and the order upon which it would take.

    Now, there are really several questions of the merits involved here. 
    There is first the merit -- the question of the state's power to take any such initial action and we based that on the plenary common law powers of the Attorney General of Alabama to vindicate and enforce the public policy of Alabama concerning the domestication of foreign corporations. 
    I'm talking about that constitutional provision, Section 232 which is self-implementing.

    The legislature shall, by general law, provide for the payment to the State of Alabama of a franchise tax by such corporation, but such franchise tax shall be based on the actual amount of capital employed in this State.

    I was saying that we have the plenary common law powers that the Attorney General of Alabama is a constitutional officer who has the same powers which the Attorney General of Great Britain had at common law.

    Now, we think that the power to oust for past misconduct included the power to maintain the status quo as between the parties, and that is what this order denying the right to register did. 
    It's the traditional power of the court of equity.

    Mr. Edmon L. Rinehart 
    There's -- there is a dispute in our opinion which has never been written, I admit.

    I am.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="3129.437" stopTime="3203.542">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    So that one cannot say that there was anything but a single judgment. 
    But you will recall, Mr. Justice Jackson, in which he sustain standing to sue on the part of the corporate entities, the non-individual bodies that would be forced in that case on the ground that if the individuals cannot assert their constitutional claim, members, in other words in an organization which is asked to make disclosure and the individuals who are members can't themselves come in to protect what they claim to be a constitutional right without frustrating, without nullifying the very right which they claim by making a disclosure. 
    But then, the corporate body can assert those individual rights. 
    In short, assuming that individuals in Alabama, inherently appropriate (Inaudible) and say you can't ask us whether we belong to the N.A.A.C.P, that's a territory that is protected, I'm making that assumption.
speaker="edmon_l_rinehart" startTime="3203.542" stopTime="3204.079">
    Mr. Edmon L. Rinehart 
    I understand.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="3204.079" stopTime="3246.583">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Otherwise there's no point. 
    We -- we can withhold -- we don't have to tell Alabama or New York or anybody else to what club we belong provided that it isn't a tradition to organization. 
    I'm putting that to one. 
    That's our constitutional right. 
    But if we go -- have to go on to court and say, if what you were asking the organization to do make hindrance on my right and by that very proceeding, you nullify your rights. 
    Then the corporate body having this undisclosable -- this list of undisclosable membership does have a standing to speak for the individual members.
speaker="edmon_l_rinehart" startTime="3246.583" stopTime="3253.254">
    Mr. Edmon L. Rinehart 
    My first answer of course is I don't agree with that portion of the opinion but I will also direct --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="3253.254" stopTime="3255.120">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    It wasn't an opinion.

    Mr. Edmon L. Rinehart 
    Individual opinion, that's what I mean, Mr. Justice Jackson.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="3256.756" stopTime="3271.045">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    He maybe was quite candid in saying that he thought the corporation would not have standing to sue except in this (Inaudible) the individual right does come into action.
speaker="edmon_l_rinehart" startTime="3271.045" stopTime="3351.345">
    Mr. Edmon L. Rinehart 
    All right. 
    I -- I would -- if I may address myself exactly to that question. 
    First of all, Mr. Justice Jackson, preliminarily to holding -- making that statement held that a corporation had no right of privacy, that in fact if all the order of the Attorney General in that case had done was hold individual members up to contumely and unpopularity and all of the things which I might say are speculative in the instant case, through speculation, that if that were all, he would say that the corporation did have any standing but that would had happened and remind -- I want to remind you that it was entirely state action. 
    Both the first and second pressures brought there was entirely state action. 
    One was the ex parte action of the Attorney General in declaring the organization subversive which I -- insofar there is a majority opinion I would say the basis of it and then you get to the next step which was by virtue of that order, here, where a lot of innocent people who are going to lose jobs automatically state job -- and the jobs which they were going to lose automatically were government jobs so that was obviously government action. 
    Now I -- perhaps I haven't exactly answered the content -- that is how I explained that decision.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="3351.345" stopTime="3376.313">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    But I suggest and I suppose what is behind this claim of refusal to disclose the individual members of the N.A.A.C.P. and Alabama. 
    I've taken that direct to pleading but I take it the thought is and the reason for this claim why the individuals don't step forward is because they are potentially in a damageable condition if they do make disclosure. 
    That's how they were told.
speaker="edmon_l_rinehart" startTime="3376.313" stopTime="3383.654">
    Mr. Edmon L. Rinehart 
    Damageable from whom is that important question.

    Damageable by the State.
speaker="edmon_l_rinehart" startTime="3385.491" stopTime="3389.072">
    Mr. Edmon L. Rinehart 
    Oh, the State isn't going to bring any pressure to bear on these individuals.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="3389.072" stopTime="3413.126">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    The pressure derived from the fact that the State compelled a disclosure if they may just as it's going to fascist case if one of these organizations and the Attorney General had to make closed. 
    It would affect people. 
    It doesn't make any difference whether it's an private employment or public employment so long as the governmental authority takes away something that it can't -- can't take away?
speaker="edmon_l_rinehart" startTime="3413.126" stopTime="3427.425">
    Mr. Edmon L. Rinehart 
    I don't believe that there is anything in the law that says that the mere fact that a person may become unpopular as a result of a disclosure gives him a constitutional right to keep a secret.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="3427.425" stopTime="3442.578">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    That isn't the implication of my question.

    Is that inconceivable hypothesis?

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Well this person being -- the starting point is that the State of Alabama or any other -- the State of Massachusetts doesn't make a difference so far as I'm concerned, the state is asking me to make a disclosure which I am entitled to withhold and by making such disclosure, my business will be shut down. 
    The Government isn't shutting down the business but it is taking action which results in the shutting down and that's not justiciable.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Well, they can't -- they may not be able to make good on that. 
    They may not be able to make good on that but if you -- supposed the joint fascist suit that old case turned on the fact that the Attorney General have filed what is practically a demurrer and said -- well suppose everything you say is so, that's the basis on which I have -- one has to meet these legal question.

    I think that the -- the ultimate question -- the preliminary question rather of jurisdiction, of course will be decided by this Court on a reading of the cases but on the questions that were asked to Mr. Rinehart, I would like to direct the Court's attention to page 15, an excerpt from Ex parte Dickens which we set out on page 15 of our petition for writ of certiorari which I think shows without question that on certiorari the Court does go using the validity and the merits of the order which is disobeyed. 
    We think that --

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    It does go, Mr. Rinehart candidly admitted that in fact the Supreme Court goes ahead and talks about things which it says it merely talked about, it does so merely makes speeches because it restricts its decision to what it needs to restrict it to, namely, whether the jurisdictions may gain on the face of the document.

    I don't think Mr. Justice Frankfurter that a reading of the cases which you applied will sustain that position except here. 
    On certiorari, the Supreme Court of Alabama talks about First Amendment freedoms -- freedom from privilege of self-incrimination and indicate that this excerpt says that they will go into the merits and if they don't, these opinions are not that we need go no further. 
    These opinions are clearly on point but as I said, the Court will read the decisions that come to its own conclusions.

    Well the Armstrong -- the reason I say that the Armstrong case was the -- merely to show that at times the Supreme Court of Alabama has treated these various papers file as even though they would call something else that treated them as the proper paper. 
    In other words, Armstrong could have come up or should have come up to Alabama instead on certiorari. 
    It was to call the petition for writ of mandamus and the Supreme Court of Alabama said, “We will treat as a petition --

    Mr. Robert L. Carter 
    Because of the fact that in the Alabama pleadings, one asked on these pleadings for such other and further relief as the Court may deem appropriate.

    Mr. Robert L. Carter 
    Of the record, yes. 
    Well, we've set out the Court's opinion. 
    The Court says, “On the petition for certiorari, the sole and only reviewable order or decree is that which adjudged the petitioner to be in contempt.Certiorari cannot be made a substitute for an appeal or other method of review. 
    Certiorari lies to review an order of judgment of contempt for the reason that there is no other method of review citing Ex parte Dickens.

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    They also referred to and they distinguished it on the ground that one would show them on one criminal contempt?
speaker="robert_l_carter" startTime="4122.721" stopTime="4202.047">
    Mr. Robert L. Carter 
    They -- as I understand the decision here, they -- the distinction between civil and criminal contempt is not the reach of certiorari but the question of what fine the court below may impose. 
    In criminal contempt on Alabama law, the Court is limited by statutes to the amount of fine that for an individual, they can across toward an individual order and across with five days and a fine of $50. 
    On civil contempt, the court's power is unlimited to the -- to the kind of punishment it may impose and this was the distinction which apparently the -- which apparently to which the Court makes with respect to this case. 
    As we read the decision on Ex parte Dickens as referred to throughout the opinion, the Court was really misquoting and misciting its own decisions because Ex parte Dickens specifically says that certiorari used to be limited by jurisdiction of the questions of jurisdiction but now it could reach the question of the merits.

    Mr. Robert L. Carter 
    Thank you. 
    Well, our position here in our contentions that this is not appropriately a proceeding to require us out to register. 
    I think that's clear from what was said today and it's clear from the papers and what has been -- what has happened in this case. 
    If the Alabama wanted the corporation to register, we offered to register and we would have done so. 
    Now, so this is really not what this case is all about. 
    We think that Alabama, because of the ideas which we expose that Alabama has sought to use the far failure to register which they knew for a long number of years and which has been very obvious in Alabama for -- for many years, our failure to register as a -- as a device to suppress the organization and to get ousters from the State.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    I -- I don't want to take your time but I understand why you're arguing this because unless I completely misunderstood Mr. Rinehart, the State isn't arguing here that we have to pass on Alabama's right of ouster. 
    That isn't the issue at all.
speaker="robert_l_carter" startTime="4290.756" stopTime="4293.579">
    Mr. Robert L. Carter 
    Well, I understand the --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="4293.579" stopTime="4301.245">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    The -- the issue here is the validity of the contempt order as against certain constitutional claim, is that right?
speaker="robert_l_carter" startTime="4301.245" stopTime="4390.225">
    Mr. Robert L. Carter 
    Yes, sir. 
    But our position is, if the Court please, that at the very outset, the Alabama court, the Court in this instance took illegal action because the only action that we are aware of that Alabama could exert against the corporation for failure to register was the action which is the statutory penalties which are set out on our brief at page 35. 
    So, we are faced at the very outset, we're being put out of business without a hearing and then being ordered as a condition of -- of having a hearing on the merits. 
    Of that -- at that point, we are then required to either submit to what we consider unconstitutional conditions or in effect stay ousted and have a final judgment entered against us in effect because we cannot prosecute this claim until the contempt proceedings had been finally adjudicated. 
    As I indicated yesterday, our view is that the order requiring our members to -- requiring a production of the names of our members has no relevance to the question as to whether or not we are doing business in the state and particularly we believe this is so since we have taken that issue out of the case by ourselves indicating to the state that we are willing to comply with the law insofar as registration is concerned.

    Did you know Mr. Carter that the court's order of requiring such and that order stands until vacated by some procedure which Alabama (Inaudible)?

speaker="charles_e_whittaker" startTime="4425.263" stopTime="4465.638">
    Justice Charles E. Whittaker 
    And this is the same thing too on the temporary restraining order. 
    There, it was -- the Court has jurisdiction and power to handle it, the trial court whether it's right or wrong. 
    Now, until a motion to dissolve, it has been denied (Inaudible) that Court, no way to go -- any place else and -- isn't that right?And therefore you haven't -- can't have a review of that temporary injunction until you have had an order of willing the motion to dissolve.
speaker="robert_l_carter" startTime="4465.638" stopTime="4522.366">
    Mr. Robert L. Carter 
    Well, we think that that order was put in issue, necessarily put in issue by the opinion of the Supreme Court of Alabama which indicated that the Court below had jurisdiction that when it went to the question that we contend that it had no jurisdiction to oust this from the state on the basis of this pleading and that therefore the temporary restraining order is that issue because we raised it in the Supreme Court of Alabama. 
    In other words, we think that not only is that Alabama wrong in ordering us to produce the names of our members but we think that at the outset, the state court was wrong in dissolving in fact, barring us from the State without a hearing because our contention is that there is no authority under the Alabama law and on the basis of this record for this to be done.
speaker="charles_e_whittaker" startTime="4522.366" stopTime="4527.371">

    Well, our contention is that there is no jurisdiction in Alabama Court to do what the restrainer under the basis -- on the basis of this record as a bond corporation or our failure to register. 
    This is our contention and that we -- and that when the Court -- the Supreme Court of Alabama sustained jurisdiction that it necessarily approve the jurisdiction of the Court in this respect and that is before the Court here.
