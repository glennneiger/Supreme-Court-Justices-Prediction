    Mr. J. Lee Rankin 
    In answer to Mr. Justice Frankfurter's question, at page 29 in our brief in a footnote, the language of the passport is set out.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="12.984" stopTime="16.271">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Oh, yes, thank you.
speaker="j_lee_rankin" startTime="16.271" stopTime="34.078">
    Mr. J. Lee Rankin 
    Then on page 31, there are some references about at the bottom of page 30 and carrying on to 31 our references to some enactments by the Congress in which it had recognize the power of the Secretary was being exercised to grant or deny passports at that time.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="34.078" stopTime="42.364">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    This is the present passport. 
    It has the exact language for the passport issued by the Secretary of the State beyond certiorari.
speaker="j_lee_rankin" startTime="42.364" stopTime="136.162">
    Mr. J. Lee Rankin 
    Yes, Mr. Justice. 
    Now, turning to the appendix at page 102 of our brief, we think that the important language is in 1185, the paragraph numbered 1. 
    No, that's not it. 
    In paragraph B, I'm sorry, 1(b) that's on 103, citizens except as otherwise provided by the President and subject to such limitations and exceptions as the President may authorize and prescribe shall be unlawful for any citizen of the United States to depart from or enter, or attempt to depart from or enter the United States, unless he bears a valid passport. 
    And then, you proceed over to page 104 and on to 105 and there's an -- a proclamation of emergency. 
    Then, 106 and 107 is a proclamation by the President as to an emergency and to the need for the passport control under the statute.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="136.162" stopTime="142.183">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    That's the one on which, that Mr. Boudin is not -- and still being outstanding.
speaker="j_lee_rankin" startTime="142.183" stopTime="450.559">
    Mr. J. Lee Rankin 
    It -- it is still outstanding, yes. 
    Then, in paragraph numbered 1 on page 107, provides the departure and entry of citizens and nationals of the United States from entering the United States including the Canal zone and all territory and waters continental or insular, subject to the jurisdiction of the United States shall be subject to the regulations prescribed by the Secretary of State and published and so forth. 
    And then, in paragraph numbered 4, it goes on in regard to the proclamation and makes a part of the proclamation, all of the regulations of the Secretary in regard to the issues of passports in accordance with this statute and the proclamations. 
    Then, on page 109, we have the provisions in regard to the granting of the passports, the statute that empowers the Secretary to grant or deny passports and it incorporates in the first paragraph there at six -- Section 211(a) under such rules as the President shall designate and prescribe for and on behalf of the United States. 
    And in 213, it provides for an application for passport. 
    It requires that they submit a written application, duly verified by its oath before a person authorizes them the power to administer oaths. 
    We continue recital of every matter of fact which maybe required by law or by any rules authorized by law to be stated as a prerequisite to the issues of any such passport. 
    And the Secretary proceeded to make a regulation. 
    But first, we have the executive or the number of 7856 on 110, providing for affidavits and support an application for passport. 
    And then, Section 51.77 authorizes the Secretary of State to make the passport regulations. 
    531 provides that anyone who doesn't bear such a -- a valid passport issued under the authority of the Secretary of State shall not -- shall not travel beyond the Western Hemisphere. 
    Then, the Secretary of State prescribed certain regulations set out on page 112. 
    And 51.135 is the one of particular interest in this case and subparagraphs A, B and C. 
    Then, turning to page 115, Section 51.142 is the Secretary as distinguished from the President's giving it authority to the Secretary to provide for applications, affidavit and oath, the Secretary's requirement. 
    Then, before their affirmation by applicants be given as to membership in the Communist Party, at any stage of the proceedings in the Passport Division and before the Board, if it was deemed necessary, the applicant maybe required as a part of his application to subscribe under oath or affirmation to a statement with respect to present or past membership in the Communist Party. 
    If applicant states that he is Communist, refusal of the passport in this case will be -- be without further proceedings. 
    Now, that's the -- taking that frame through those various statutes and the proclamations and the regulations, the Government's position that the proclamations and regulations were provided for and authorized by law.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="450.559" stopTime="493.902">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Mr. Solicitor, may I ask you to -- to tell me what is meant by -- what is implied of the case by Section 27 in the first crime that says in 1790. 
    I believe that is the first crime accessed by the Congress, April 30th, 1790. 
    Section 27 says that if any person shall violate safe conduct or passports duly obtained and issued under the authority of United States shall be punished by -- by 42 years. 
    What does that mean, to violate any passport duly obtained and issued under the authority, how would you be violating that?
speaker="j_lee_rankin" startTime="493.902" stopTime="501.944">
    Mr. J. Lee Rankin 
    The Government construes that it has to be used to be violated and the -- that the --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="501.944" stopTime="504.254">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    But he wasn't -- the violations exist?
speaker="j_lee_rankin" startTime="504.254" stopTime="504.760">
    Mr. J. Lee Rankin 
    Well --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="504.760" stopTime="513.828">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Because this assumes that you got a passport, it was duly obtained and issued as the one by John Quincy Adams was in that early case? 
    How would one violate it?
speaker="j_lee_rankin" startTime="513.828" stopTime="520.414">
    Mr. J. Lee Rankin 
    Well, often this -- often the passports are restricted. 
    In fact, that's a common practice. 
    Now, to stamp on passports --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="520.414" stopTime="522.304">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Of the country? 
    The geographical --
speaker="j_lee_rankin" startTime="522.304" stopTime="523.006">
    Mr. J. Lee Rankin 
    Yes, if they cannot --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="523.006" stopTime="535.910">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    And this is not what this means. 
    If John Quincy Adams issued a passport to go to Peru or Belgium, and he goes to the then-Prussia, would that be within the statute?
speaker="j_lee_rankin" startTime="535.910" stopTime="536.675">
    Mr. J. Lee Rankin 
    Well, that's the way I would --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="536.675" stopTime="537.125">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Essentially --
speaker="j_lee_rankin" startTime="537.125" stopTime="544.713">
    Mr. J. Lee Rankin 
    -- read it. 
    And the Government construes that the person has to use the passport in order to be in violation of the statute.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="544.713" stopTime="547.059">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Could this provision continue down to date?
speaker="j_lee_rankin" startTime="547.059" stopTime="569.956">
    Mr. J. Lee Rankin 
    Yes. 
    In this particular Kent case, the evidence I think is uncontradicted but Mr. Kent went into iron curtain countries and to Moscow in violation of the provisions of his passport on several missions and that's one of the things that's discussed in the case, but it is not a ground for the action here. 
    The ground --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="569.956" stopTime="591.577">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    And Congress imposed a sentence of three years for that, James Madison and the Congress? 
    That's highly illuminating.
speaker="j_lee_rankin" startTime="591.577" stopTime="775.498">
    Mr. J. Lee Rankin 
    Now, the issue in this case is whether or not the termination of these proceedings or failure to furnish the affidavit is proper, lawful and whether not if the petitioners have lost rights that they are entitled to under the Constitution and law and is the cause of that and so it depends upon whether or not the Secretary having the power to require such an affidavit and in general terms at that time. 
    We believe that the statutes and regulations, proclamations that I referred to, do authorize the requirement of an application, that the application is necessary for the Secretary to get the facts from which he can be able to issue or deny the passport and also that the requirement under the oath is reasonable, it's expressly provided for by not only the -- the regulations of the Secretary, but also the proclamation of the President. 
    And going back into the history of these four matters, which largely developed in the war period of 1914 and later years the Congress addressed itself to this question of travel control because it found and there's a considerable history of the -- in the hearings about it that passports were being used by citizens of the United States to further the war efforts and the various espionage and subversive activities of Germany during World War I and prior thereto. 
    And it is because of that investigations have found that it's very expensive, both in this hemisphere and in Europe of this activity that's going on that the Congress authorized this authority to restrict this travel control and prevent or prohibit where the Secretary was able to find it, the conduct of American citizens in that way in aiding the war effort of -- of foreign power. 
    Then, the Act, I want to make it clear, too, that until the -- until the Act of 1952, this power of -- of travel control was limited to war periods and it was in the Act of 1952 that the Congress extended this to the emergency proclamation as well as providing that it should cover any war period.

speaker="j_lee_rankin" startTime="824.522" stopTime="856.071">
    Mr. J. Lee Rankin 
    No, we think that the -- the problem would be the same under that Act as it is under the 1952 Act. 
    There would be the same general provisions in regard to the authority for travel control and they were carried down through the years were the only difference in 1952, being the provision of adding that if a person declared an emergency as distinguished from war period and if --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="856.071" stopTime="858.479">

    Mr. J. Lee Rankin 
    That -- that's my recollection.And that further that he would have to declare that these travel controls were necessary under the 1952 law and the earlier statutes provided that in -- during a war period, they would be affected.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Am I right or wrong - I really don't know-in view of the judgment which they pray, is the question at all open to this Court to say that the Secretary of State must issue the passport, put aside the question of emergency? 
    The Secretary of State must issue a passport to these applicants for a passport upon refusal to answer any questions?
speaker="j_lee_rankin" startTime="912.368" stopTime="938.703">
    Mr. J. Lee Rankin 
    Well, I would think that question is only open to the Court. 
    If you should decide that the Secretary has no right to ask any questions or to control travel by refusing a passport in any event and that you were satisfied with a position of the petitioners that if they prove citizenship, the Secretary had no discretion whatsoever and had to issue a passport.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="938.703" stopTime="972.314">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Was I -- the question to the answer you gave us a minute ago in my question since they sent -- since they claimed rights under the Passport Act of 1926 that if their rights aren't on their own requested of their own prayers to be measured by their rights under the Act of 1926, then it becomes relevant to question whether the Government's position is that under that Act, the procedure of the Secretary of State is dependable or justifiable, right? 
    I understood that you said yes, is that right?

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Well, it doesn't say that the claim isn't -- that he can travel, though he's free to travel because if he be travels he might be violating a criminal law. 
    I don't think we can again give a declaratory judgment on that basis because you can't enjoin the criminal prosecution even though it maybe among those unconstitutional provision.

    So if you throw it -- it if the Secretary of State is justified. 
    I --I'm not -- I really am positive. 
    If the Secretary of State was justified under 211(a), not to grant a passport because the petitioner didn't ask the question, “Are you a member of the Communist Party?” 
    Why doesn't that -- why is it not justified with the Secretary of State and how can get a remedy against that?
speaker="j_lee_rankin" startTime="1493.621" stopTime="1518.453">
    Mr. J. Lee Rankin 
    Well, their position is that that action on the part of the Secretary of State by reason of 1185, reaches in to deprive them of the right to travel because of the fact that -- that the two are tied together by the Congress. 
    And therefore, by just the Act of denying a passport, the Secretary tells him he can't travel.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1518.453" stopTime="1531.056">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    But if by statute he's allowed to make that denial then you must reach the question of constitutionality of that denial under the 1926 Act.

    I'm not sure that that is, may be defended constitutionally when read in connection with the -- with the congressional regulation as the right to travel found in 1185.

    If you -- if you construe that it's a question of whether you can deny or grant a passport whether the Secretary has that power, it's the Government's position that there isn't any question, but what he has it inherently and Congress has recognized and granted over a period of -- long period of years. 
    But it's also the Government's position, we believe it's in this case that you can't disregard 1185 because that says that if you deny the passport over here, you take something away from the same time over here and that it would not be of something you take away is the constitutionally protected right --

speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1695.726" stopTime="1742.004">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Mr. Solicitor -- if you had nothing but the Act of 1926 and the Government was here or here defending the right before issuing a passport that he should answer certain questions would the Government do one this year saying Secretary of State was authorized to ask those questions, the refusal and the constitutional justification of asking those questions leading to the denial of the passport. 
    Of course, you would be taken away his rights to travel. 
    You'll have to talk about that because if -- if you may condition his travel on having a passport or if you want the risk of going to jail and traveling without a passport, but by denying him a passport, you're interfering with his right of free locomotion.
speaker="j_lee_rankin" startTime="1742.004" stopTime="1760.647">
    Mr. J. Lee Rankin 
    Well, but there were times when granting or denying of the passport would not preclude you from traveling. 
    It was a -- you could travel anyway without a passport during the history of our country and they were not the sanction that go with the provisions of the -- of the statutes.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1760.647" stopTime="1780.469">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    What I'm saying is that the statute -- the criminal sanction, namely, that he may land in jail for violation of -- of criminal statute.

    Mr. J. Lee Rankin 
    There were several periods during our history of the different periods when the -- the passport was required, but during the entire period that's involved in this case, he had to have a passport in order to travel because the statute required and there was criminal sanctions if he didn't. 
    Now, we in our footnote in our brief, we call attention to the Court the fact that we could claim that it -- what the argument could be made that under the statute in regard to the power of the Secretary to grant or deny a passport, that you didn't have to consider 1185 because all it was really involved here was that you didn't file the affidavit or you didn't make the oath. 
    And therefore, the Secretary was authorized regardless of anything else not to grant the passport. 
    But we felt that that didn't dispose of this case properly for the Court. 
    And the Court would have to go further to examine the effect of that Act and if you say to a man that unless you get a passport, you can't travel and he's got the right to travel, constitutionally protected right to travel subject to whatever due process and rights in the Fifth Amendment, whatever lawful limitations there are under the Fifth Amendment. 
    Then, you have to go on to examine that question and that it isn't as simple as it would be for the Government if we just said, “It all depends on Sectio 211(a),” and if you find it, the passport is probably denied, that's all there is to it.

    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Well, as I understood the petitioner's argument, it was that if you took the 1926 Act along 211(a), that that did not authorize the asking of these questions and did not authorize the request with the noncommunist affidavi. 
    But, the section merely related to questions and regulations that were incident to the mechanical procedural problem of issuing a passport. 
    Now, that is their position. 
    I understand your answer to that is you don't stop. 
    It was in the four corners of the 1926 Act. 
    You say you can't read that Act alone. 
    It has to be read in conjunction with 1185, the Presidential Proclamation, et cetera. 
    And when you put those two Acts together even though what they say might have been true, if 1926 Act stood alone, that Act must be read in conjunction with these other Acts and then you get the position you take.

   Argument of Leonard B. Boudin

    Mr. Leonard B. Boudin 
    If Your Honor please. 
    I must say that I gave the Court too hasty in examination of 1185 upon which the Solicitor General relies and will the Court look at page 61 and see from the language there --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2108.289" stopTime="2108.898">

    In your brief?

    Mr. Leonard B. Boudin 
    Of my brief. 
    Thank you, sir. 
    Whether there is any authority to the Secretary of State in 1185 on page 61 of my brief to control travel, to set up systems of classes of people who may not travel. 
    And if there is such an authority, are there any standards in the language of 1185? 
    All it says is under such rules of the President, it shall be unlawful for any citizen of the United States to depart from or enter, or attempt to depart from or enter the United States unless he bears a valid passport. 
    And I submit to the Court that that language does not say that the Secretary can decide who can travel and if they did say that the Secretary could decide who could travel, it would be an obvious unlawful delegation because there is no standard in that language, not a single standard. 
    It must be some standard. 
    Here, we have no authority and no standard and merely suggest --

speaker="leonard_b_boudin" startTime="2171.999" stopTime="2215.506">
    Mr. Leonard B. Boudin 
    This is also interpretation. 
    It would be constitutionality if it said the second -- alone if the Secretary can restrain travel, but it narrowly doesn't say that the Secretary can restrain travel. 
    But it says, at the Secretary -- it does not give any standards upon which the Secretary might act. 
    Well, I've been obscure, Your Honor, because I want to clarify my position. 
    If 1185 said the Secretary has the power to control travel with determined classifications, there would be authority. 
    And then, Your Honors would have to look at that statute and say, “Are there any standards?” 
    But since the statute does not contain even that authority, you may not reach this constitutional problem.

speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="2215.506" stopTime="2222.298">

    Mr. Leonard B. Boudin 
    And there is a reason, Your Honor why that can be done here. 
    In 1952 when this statute was passed, there was in effect a determination by Congress as to the kind of people who were required, who could not have passport, namely members of Communist Action organization. 
    But with the end of the war, emergency approaching under the Act of 1941, although Congress said that certain people couldn't have passports, they could nevertheless, have traveled because there was no statute except for the emergency statutes of the past which would make a passport a necessity. 
    Therefore, if Congress wanted to prevent, wanted to implement the Act of 1950, this was the way in which it could be done. 
    The Act of 1950 says this group cannot have passports and the Act of 1952 says, “You cannot leave the country without a passport.” This has nothing to do with the Secretary of Power.

    Every language is more words to put in the conflict of something in our position.

    Mr. Leonard B. Boudin 
    Well, my -- my problem is -- my problem is that they had imposed the condition to our lawful departure and that condition is a passport. 
    As long as 1185 is on the book, requiring us to have a document of a certificate of identity or whatever we call it, we have a right to that certificate of identity. 
    We cannot be deprived of it because we've exercised these rights of freedom of speech into dissociation.

    Mr. Leonard B. Boudin 
    I -- I think I can answer, Your Honor. 
    We have not claimed that 1185 which required the passport as the condition for departure is unconstitutional.

    1185 thus state what the law is. 
    You must have a passport to leave the country. 
    We are saying that in view of that state of the law, as represented by 1185 which we're not attacking that we cannot reside as the passport regulations.

    Mr. Leonard B. Boudin 
    Perhaps we don't have to reach that point. 
    And may I say to Your Honors have had a construction of 213, a construction of 211(a) which appears on page 59 of my brief, which is not supported by the language there. 
    It was suggested here and I'm not clear whether the suggestion is still made by the Solicitor General. 
    But under 211(a), the Act of 1926, which by the way has never been amended, Your Honors. 
    The Act of 1926 was not amended by anything. 
    That statute as is suggested by the Solicitor General at one point authorizes the Secretary to require an affidavit at the Communist Party membership and these other things. 
    There is nothing in 211(a) if Your Honors will see it, which contains such an authority.And in those several cases in which non-Communist affidavit said that it was upheld by this Court aside from the fact that they were relatively precise affidavits. 
    I have to use that term and not the kind of thing that was required here with the course of the examinations of Dr. Briehl and Mr. Kent. 
    In all of those cases, whether it would Garner or ACA against Douds, we found that it was a legislative body that had made the determination of such an affidavit should be required. 
    Here, there is no statute in the United States, which says that the Secretary of State can ask for an affidavit of that kind. 
    Congress has not asked for such an affidavit. 
    The Internal Security Act of 1950 doesn't ask for such an affidavit. 
    Only the Secretary of State here has asked for that affidavit. 
    They got a complete problem.
