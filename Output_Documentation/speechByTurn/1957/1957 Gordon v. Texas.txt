    Mr. C. K. Richards 
    -- Chief Justice and Associate Justices. 
    At the outset, I never did answer Mr. Justice Frankfurter's question. 
    There is no way under the laws of the State of Texas that liquor can be transported in a private automobile through the State of Texas and interstate commerce. 
    That has been definitely decided for the reason that there is no permit which an individual can get to transport intoxicating liquor in private automobile. 
    In fact, this Court had before if not so very long ago, the case of Cartlidge versus Rainey from the Fifth Circuit which involve the transportation from the State of Arkansas through the State of Texas and to the State of Oklahoma of a private automobile loaded down to the gunnels with various bottles of intoxicating liquor.

    He would have to leave the liquor there.

speaker="c_k_richards" startTime="90.840" stopTime="118.848">
    Mr. C. K. Richards 
    He could get it across by getting a customs broker before it entered Texas to put it in bond, deliver it to a common carrier who's also under bond and then it should go in interstate commerce to its destination. 
    They would be no custom's duty if it was exempt. 
    He would of course have to pay the customs broker's fee and the common carrier's fee.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="118.848" stopTime="120.460">

    Mr. C. K. Richards 
    No, he would be exempt from tax. 
    No, Your Honor. 
    It's specifically provided in the -- any person authorized to export liquor from the state and having liquor intended for shipment from one place to a point outside must keep it in a separate compartment. 
    They gave them a little sort of a -- let's say fare or passport which shows that that is intended for export and no tax is due thereon. 
    The tax is a possessory or used tax. 
    It is not a duty. 
    It is for possession or used -- or use in the state now. 
    To continue my answer, that is the only way that I know that this liquor could be transported by the individual who is coming in to the customs and having it for his own personal use could bring it to the State of Texas. 
    There is no provision for making bond. 
    The legislature did not see fit to do it. 
    Now, the legislature did --

    Yes, Your Honor, that is correct.

    Well, the -- there's a provision in the law that one -- one quart not to exceed one quart may be imported into the State of Texas, brought into the State of Texas but the stamp, the tax must be paid and the stamp to fix. 
    Now, the last legislature changed that so that non-residence of Texas could bring in not to exceed for a quart.

    Why was that the -- that Texas then in phase of his declaration of intention to take it in North Carolina insisted on the payment of the tax.
speaker="c_k_richards" startTime="255.405" stopTime="300.961">
    Mr. C. K. Richards 
    Your Honor, I don't understand the mental processes of some of these agents of the Texas Liquor Control Board. 
    I do know that the law says that the -- in there at least the way they concede -- construe it, if you have liquor in the State of Texas to which no stamp has been affixed, no tax paid, it is an illegal beverage except that is all that which is in excess of one quart. 
    Therefore, he's subject to seizure. 
    Now, if he had brought one quart in there and has refused to pay the tax, he might be confronted with a different situation but he had exceeded. 
    He and his two companions each exceeded the allotment for personal use. 
    He said it was brought in for personal use.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="300.961" stopTime="307.234">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr.

    No, the tax incidentally is a regulatory tax primarily.

    I will admit that I was in error not so doing. 
    We have the permit fees, the license fees.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Yes.
speaker="c_k_richards" startTime="475.999" stopTime="639.229">
    Mr. C. K. Richards 
    The -- this tax which is denominated as a sales tax but which is in fact a possession or used tax. 
    It is primarily regulatory tax and after the expenses of the enforcement of the Liquor Control Act have been -- that which the legislature choose to appropriate for that purpose have been expended and then the balance goes into the general fund and maybe used for other purposes. 
    I think that there's an allocation, one-fourth additional of that for the school fund. 
    The tax is generally -- the stamp is generally fixed by the retailer in the package store before he sells it. 
    And to that extent, it's a sales tax but if I bring it in from Arkansas as in the case of Chalmers. 
    He brought them from Louisiana. 
    He brought it in with the United -- with the federal stamp attached, the Louisiana stamp attached. 
    But no Texas stamp so it was seized. 
    He didn't have a permit to transport it within the State of Texas in private automobile. 
    That is a case in Bols versus State. 
    Now, there is an old case, Horton versus State where the man had in his possession, not quite a quart, and under the law before it was amended, you were allowed to import one quart in without the payment of any tax. 
    That law was later on amended and required with the proviso that provide the tax be paid and the stamp be affixed. 
    The Court in that case said that he is -- the Court under the -- within the exempt of provision. 
    He was not guilty of any offense. 
    In other words, the States contention in here is bottomed on effect the -- if the importer had brought this in as an import to be transported in interstate commerce any tax that we would attempt to levy upon him would be void. 
    It would plainly be a burden on interstate commerce. 
    But the amount that he brought in made itself ipso facto contraband and the fact that he had possession of it and could not get a permit to transport in -- in interstate commerce to North Carolina. 
    It was still contraband. 
    Therefore, it was subject to the tax. 
    That is on the basis of his possession. 
    He had it in there illegally. 
    Now, that is the gist of the State's case. 
    Yes, Your Honor.

    It's a -- it's a tax on the possession of unstamped liquor. 
    You might say it's a fine. 
    It might be a civil fine as opposed to the criminal penalty of the $100 for having possession of it. 
    There's a criminal penalty for transporting or having in your possession any illegal beverages. 
    This is an illegal beverage because it's not stamped. 
    I realize the fact that what Your Honor I think his question direct to me is why -- why catch an illegal beverage. 
    Well, the possession of an illegal beverage I think is always been subject to a tax. 
    As a matter of fact, I don't have the citation right with me but prior to the -- or during the prohibition here, the State of Pennsylvania have what they call the floor tax for the possession of beverages which was illegal to possess.

    First, they say that the illicit beverage is one which is possessed which doesn't have the tax stamp on it.

    Mr. C. K. Richards 
    Well, Tijuana is still with us and I think there are ports of entry in New Mexico, I think it's very small and there are two in Arizona, Douglas and Nogales. 
    What -- they require that military personnel, this amendment requires that military personnel stationed in Texas are restricted to one quart only. 
    Military personnel living outside the State or outside the State of Texas may bring in four quarts. 
    This whole Texas Liquor Control Act is a -- is a product of trial and error so to speak. 
    It's amended that every session in the legislature one way or another depending on the amount of pressure brought by the various forces. 
    Briefly, in order to conclude my argument, I don't think that any of the cases cited by counsel for the appellant or after the board, I think all the export-import tax cases I think it's good -- they're a good law but they're all ad valorem cases. 
    And there's no question that the findings of the Court particularly in that (Inaudible) case. 
    That was where the liquor was being assembled from outside of California, came to rest in the warehouse for export to the Hawaiian Islands.They attempted to let the ad valorem tax on it. 
    A great question before the Court was there whether that had come to rest and not to -- a tax could be -- would attach. 
    (Inaudible) case with the converse of that, that was importation into California and again there was the ad valorem tax. 
    To my mind, the Carter case is -- and the Duckworth cases are in our support. 
    The Jamison case that counsel cited was a case that arose under the read amendment which was purely against the transportation from dry to wet state. 
    The man had five quarts and he was transporting it by a private automobile. 
    The matter that was before this Court seemed to be that he said that those were of his own personal use and the Court's majority opinion said that it was immaterial whether it's his personal use or not. 
    And Mr. Justice Clark, not the present Mr. Justice Clark, but his predecessor, dissented, stating that he thought that since it was for his personal use, that it was excluded from the Commerce Clause, it's the Commerce --

    Mr. C. K. Richards 
    That was a pre-Twenty-First Amendment case. 
    We -- I fail to find any cases. 
    Our case here is bottomed on this Cartlidge versus Rainey that the transportation was illegal. 
    That is he couldn't go to Texas, therefore it was contraband. 
    Now, the fact that -- I think the State of Texas should afford some relief to a person who is coming through as a bona fide tourist and intends that for his own personal use. 
    The fact is the legislature is not seemed fit to do it except for these one and now four quart exemption. 
    We think that the conviction being for the possession of an illegal beverage, the illegal beverage being that which is not stamped. 
    And since it was not in interstate commerce, the conviction should be affirmed. 
   
   
   
   Argument of B. R. Stewart
speaker="b_r_stewart" startTime="2215.442" stopTime="2277.609">
    Mr. B. R. Stewart 
    Mr. Chief Justice and gentlemen. 
    I would like to clear up something that seems to have puzzled you as I see it. 
    The information in this particular case charged possession, illegal possession of the liquor and that the reason that possession was illegal was because the appellant herein had not paid the stamp tax due on that liquor. 
    If he had paid the stamp tax and affixed it on the bottle, he never would have been charged. 
    That was the sole point for the Court that he had not paid the tax, consequently, his possession was illegal because the tax was not paid. 
    He claimed that the tax was not valid, therefore he was not -- he did not need to pay the tax. 
    And if he did not need to pay the tax, he could not be charge with illegal possession of the liquor for -- for not having tax payments on it.

    Mr. B. R. Stewart 
    I don't think they could for this reason that the Congress has passed legislation saying that they may import that.

speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="2431.904" stopTime="2448.604">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Well, what's the meaning of Twenty-First Amendment? 
    Certainly, it must allow some leeway to a state, doesn't it, to regulate, to assure that there shall be no delivery or use of liquor that they do not want to be delivered or used in the State without regard to what the Congress has done?
speaker="b_r_stewart" startTime="2448.604" stopTime="2532.868">
    Mr. B. R. Stewart 
    Yes, sir. 
    But in this instance, I think -- I think that's what this Court has held that they may regulate, for instance in the Carter case. 
    They require that person to -- and incidentally, this was commercial transportation involved in the Carter case, in the Duckworth case and all cases that were cited by Mr. Richards, were all commercial transportation say 150 cases, a thousand cases of liquors such as that. 
    The State in those instances required a bond and they required a route designation showing the route that they will pass through in that State. 
    And this Court said that that was a reasonable regulation in absence of any action by the federal congress. 
    And each instance, the Court has qualified in his opinion by saying in absence of any regulation by Congress and I think here we have the regulation by Congress. 
    The Congress has assumed that the person returning from a foreign country may bring in one quart of liquor free. 
    Since it's an import, he has a right to carry it to his destination without interference from the State on the border.

    The possession was illegal because the tax was not affixed. 
    We say the tax is unconstitutional and not due. 
    Consequently, the possession would not be illegal. 
    Does that -- does that answer or am I just going around it and avoid it?

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Suppose there's no tax at all. 
    All fiscal, all dollar and cents (Inaudible) and Texas has a separable colloquially drawn statute which says that in view of the illusive character and the slippery nature of liquor when you want to concentrate attention or enforcement by providing that liquor can be transported within the bounds of Texas whether from one place to another or coming in from Mexico and going outside the other way around from north to south. 
    That can be only done by licensed carriers not a -- and anybody who brings the license carrier and carry this liquor shall be guilty of an offense. 
    No taxation and no money at all.

    In absence of federal legislation, Mr. Justice Frankfurter. 
    Now, the federal government comes along and says, “all right, you as a private individual can carry so much liquor through the State.” 
    Any state legislation contrary would be void.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    But if you're right then the Congress of United States having nothing else to do, (Inaudible) the purpose statute saying that Texas and all the other states may do what they please within their confines but may deal the liquor traffic so important for national security or whatnot, the enjoyment of people which enlarge their morale that liquor shall be allowed to come in every state -- in one state to another and one foreign country into other state.

    Didn't your argument get down that we must say that this is not related to the protection of Texas as a dry State?
speaker="b_r_stewart" startTime="3212.437" stopTime="3334.981">
    Mr. B. R. Stewart 
    That's correct. 
    May I emphasize that -- that in this particular instance that the defendant if he had pay the tax, there would been no regulation other than that. 
    That is -- I'm not stipulating but uncontroverted in the -- in the statement of facts that if he had paid the tax, he could have gone on his way. 
    There was no question of a permit before the Court of Criminal Appeals of Texas as to whether they have permit or not. 
    There was no question on that. 
    They seem to think that that came into it. 
    What we were attacking the entire thing on the tax base only, not as a regulatory measure but a revenue raising tax omission. 
    I think if you'll check our Liquor Control Act, Article 666, the same is used for revenue production. 
    I think perhaps my brief has cited this cases and I think they are pertinent and will bear me out that there is a definite separation of powers that should be maintained. 
    Let me -- let me give this one instance and then I'll quit. 
    For instance, if the State of Texas on tax decided to go in and tax Scotch whiskey at the rate of $10 a quart, all the imports from -- from Mexico tax Scotch whiskey at $10 a quart. 
    No tax for rum. 
    They would be affecting the general right of the Congress to control the import-export industry. 
    They would be affecting it locally, just as definitely as if they had gone in to say, you can't bring in rum but you can bring in scotch or you can bring in (Inaudible) or you might bring in (Inaudible).

    Mr. B. R. Stewart 
    As long as it's going through their State to a final destination and is an import, it is without the bounds of the State's regulatory powers or taxing powers.
