    Mr. Norton J. Come 
    May it please the Court. 
    This case is here on a writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals of -- for the Fifth Circuit. 
    The review of the judgment of that court in denying enforcement of certain subpoenas duces tecum issued in the course of a representation proceeding under the Section 9 of the National Labor Relations Act. 
    Section 11 (1) of the Act provides that the Board shall issue subpoenas forthwith upon the application of any party to the proceeding. 
    The section further provides that the person subpoenaed may contest the validity of the subpoena by filing a petition to revoke with the Board. 
    And the Board shall revoke the subpoena if in its opinion the evidence sought is irrelevant to the subpoena, does not describe it with sufficient particularity. 
    Now, by regulation, the Board has provided that whereas here, a subpoena is returnable at a hearing, the petition to revoke shall be filed with and ruled on in the first instance by the hearing officer. 
    His ruling is in turn subject to review by the Board itself under a special appeal procedure which I will describe in detail later. 
    The question presented is whether this Board regulation is authorized by the statute or a stated otherwise, thus Section 11 (1) require the Board alone to rule on petitions to revoke subpoenas or may the Board authorize the hearing officer to make the initial ruling on such petition pursuant to this procedure.

    Mr. Norton J. Come 
    There is a special appeal procedure whereby the party under the Board's rules can request the Board for permission to appeal specially at that stage. 
    The party makes out the -- the case that he has for offsetting the hearing officer and that question goes to the Board and if the Board determines that a substantial question is presented as to the correctness of the hearing officer's ruling, it will grant the special appeal, consider the subpoena question and upset the hearing officer if need be. 
    There are situations where the Board has revoked subpoenas pursuant to this procedure. 
    We have reproduced several such orders in the appendix to our -- our brief in this case.

speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="233.100" stopTime="234.028">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    The same way?
speaker="norton_j_come" startTime="234.028" stopTime="775.658">
    Mr. Norton J. Come 
    Yes, Your Honor as I understand it. 
    Now, the same question is -- is presented in the case which follows. 
    However, there, the subpoenas were issued in connection with an unfair labor practice proceeding and we believe that the Administrative Procedure Act furnishes an additional source or authority for the Board's procedure in such proceedings. 
    Now, briefly here, the underlying facts are these. 
    In November of 1955, a union, the retail clerks filed the petition with the Board's regional office for a representation election among the employees at a retail jewelry store in Miami, Florida. 
    At the hearing, the employer moved to dismiss on the ground that the business of the store did not satisfy the Board's jurisdictional yardsticks for the assertion of jurisdiction. 
    However, the store refused to furnish any information to substantiate that contention whereupon the hearing was adjourned for the purpose of securing the information by subpoenas. 
    Five subpoenas deces tecum and one testimonial subpoena, the validity of which is not an issue here, were, thereupon, issued and served. 
    They were issued to the store where the union was claiming representation rights and to three other stores allegedly part of the same intrastate chain, because under the Board's jurisdictional yardsticks, jurisdiction will be asserted over an intrastate retail store if its out of state purchases meet a certain figure and even if the purchases of the particular store do not satisfy the standard if the store is part of a chain and the total purchases of the stores is in the chain meet the figure then jurisdiction will be asserted. 
    So that the subpoenas here requested, merely, sufficient information to ascertain whether or not the Board's chain store standard was met. 
    They were issued in accordance with the procedures similar to that followed under the federal rules of civil procedure. 
    That is, the Board attorney assigned to the case made application to the regional director setting forth the person to be subpoenaed and the information sought and the regional director issued the attorney blank subpoenas bearing the seal of the Board and the facsimile signature of a Board member and were filled-in by the attorney and served. 
    Now, upon service of the subpoenas, the respondents filed petitions to revoke the subpoena alleging that they were burdensome and has not been properly issued which petitions were addressed to and filed with the Board in Washington. 
    And copies were sent to the hearing officer in Miami. 
    The executive secretary of the Board returned the petitions calling respondents' attention to the provision of the Board's rules herein issue which requires that these petitions be filed with the hearing officer. 
    The hearing officer then fixed a date for respondents to file briefs and argue orally in support of the petitions which respondents declined to avail themselves of and the hearing officer proceeded to deny the petitions to revoke on the ground that they presented no substantial issue as to the validity of the subpoenas. 
    And when the hearing was reconvened, respondents appeared through counsel and indicated they would not comply with the subpoenas, whereupon, pursuant to Section 11 (2) of the Act the Board then instituted proceedings to enforce the subpoenas in the District Court. 
    The District Court denied enforcement of the subpoenas on the ground that they were unreasonable and oppressive and were invalidly issued and that the regional director was not a party to the proceeding entitled to utilize the subpoenas. 
    On appeal, the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, agreed that the subpoena should not be enforced but for a different reason. 
    The court was of the views that this Board procedure or ruling on this petition to revoke in the first instance by the hearing officer, constituted an unauthorized delegation of authority to the hearing officer. 
    And since the Board itself had not passed on respondents' petitions to revoke, the suit in the Court's view was thus premature and could not be maintained. 
    Now, the Board's position is a two-fold. 
    We believe, first of all, that properly understood, the Board's procedure for revocation of subpoenas does not present a delegation problem at all and that the Board itself retains the power of final decision through this appeal procedure which I've indicated at the outset. 
    In the alternative, however, we submit that even if the Board's procedure were viewed as entailing a delegation of Board authority with the hearing officer, the Act does not preclude such delegation. 
    Now, I've indicated briefly that under this procedure, the Board requires that the petition to revoke first be filed with the hearing officer. 
    Now, in an unfair labor practice, this hearing officer is a trial examiner with the independent status conferred by the Administrative Procedure Act. 
    That's the situation in the case which follows. 
    In a representation case, such as we have here, he is a field examiner or attorney under staff of the regional office. 
    The reason for the difference is that a representation case is essentially an investigation and not -- not necessary a type of proceeding and is exempt from the hearing requirements of the APA. 
    In such cases, the Board is thus free, not restricted to the panel of hearing officers setup under that Act and can utilize other qualified personnel for the hearing officer function. 
    However, apart from the fact that the hearing officer in the -- our case does not make recommendations to the Board. 
    His function at the hearing is otherwise is responsible as that of a trial examiner in an unfair labor practice case. 
    He may call on and examine witnesses, rule on the admissibility of evidence, regulate the course of the hearing and ensure that it's his job to see that a full and complete record is developed for the Board. 
    Now, if a party is dissatisfied with the hearing officer's action on the petition to revoke, the Board's procedure as I indicated at the outset affords the party an opportunity to apply to the Board for permission to appeal specially and if a substantial question is presented, the Board will entertain the appeal. 
    Moreover, there is opportunity when the case is before the Board for final decision to obtain Board review of the subpoena question. 
    Now, of course, that does not afford an adequate remedy in the situation where the hearing officer has denied the petition to revoke but where he grants a petition to revoke the subpoena. 
    And the party aggrieved is the person requesting the subpoena. 
    He is afforded an opportunity to obtain Board review in regress of that situation when the case comes before the Board for final decision because the board can as it has in such cases ordered the hearing reopened should it find that the evidence denied to the individual was material.

    Mr. Norton J. Come 
    Now, I should point out that the Board has utilized this procedure of having the hearing officer make the initial ruling on the validity of the propriety of the subpoena subject to review by the Board itself since the earliest Wagner Act days. 
    Under the Wagner Act, however, the subpoena procedure was a one-step one rather than a two-step one and the decisional judgement was exercised at the stage of determining whether the subpoena should issue. 
    Whereas, under Taft-Hartley, the issuance is automatic and the judgment is deferred to the petition to revoke stage. 
    But apart from that difference, the Board's rules, since the earliest Wagner Act days, provided for the same method of having the hearing officer initially rule on the propriety of the subpoena. 
    And these practical considerations explain this procedure.

    Mr. Norton J. Come 
    There are no statistics in the reports of the Board Your Honor.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Well in short, if this comes up -- if the Board is called upon independent in lieu, there's only X number of times and X is twelve a year or five a year its one problem. 
    If this arrived as two hundred times a year, it's another problem. 
    I don't know which way it looked because the frequency of it, the dissatisfaction with the subpoena that's issued may prove the opposite thing. 
    It may either prove you shouldn't put that burden on the Board in the first instance or it may prove that so it's serious that it should be put on the Board. 
    I don't know which it is.
speaker="norton_j_come" startTime="1128.680" stopTime="1164.525">
    Mr. Norton J. Come 
    Well, the information I was referring to was set forth at page 36 of our -- of our brief. 
    It shows that in a recent fiscal year of period, there were total of about 218 subpoenas, duces tecum issued in a -- in connection with representation cases and roughly, petitions to revoke or file in about 20% of those cases. 
    Now, potentially, everyone of those --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1164.525" stopTime="1167.020">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    What was the period over a year?
speaker="norton_j_come" startTime="1167.020" stopTime="1173.515">
    Mr. Norton J. Come 
    Yes, Your Honor. 
    That was a -- the fiscal year ending June 30th, 1956.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1173.515" stopTime="1177.083">

speaker="norton_j_come" startTime="1177.083" stopTime="1224.279">
    Mr. Norton J. Come 
    That -- that is correct. 
    Now, however, in a representation case as the Court is aware, it is extremely urgent to proceed expeditiously and hold the election promptly because of the danger of strikes. 
    If the parties had a procedure open to them whereby they could come shooting into the Board in everyone of these subpoena cases, potentially, there's no way of telling how many the Board would get. 
    And when the Board would get them originally as distinguished from through the special appeals procedure, the hearings could be delayed a substantial period of time.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1224.279" stopTime="1244.844">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Not merely because -- because an attack against the subpoena is made for dilatory purposes, the delaying purposes but because of the burden on the Board, because if -- if delay is a danger, then there's great opportunity for delay of having first the examiner and then an appeal and all the rest of it.
speaker="norton_j_come" startTime="1244.844" stopTime="1274.855">
    Mr. Norton J. Come 
    Well, the parties though, over the years have appreciated that under this procedure, the Board will not entertain an -- an appeal unless there's a substantial question presented as to the hearing officer's ruling. 
    Now, if you wipe out the hearing officer and they come in, in every case, they don't have to make that showing and it also even assuming they're acting in good faith does put an additional burden on the Board because --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1274.855" stopTime="1278.955">

    And I suppose they'd want to have a full hearing, lawyers and all that.

    Mr. Norton J. Come 
    Well, we've been pretty careful in our use of subpoenas so that at least recently, that has not been a common complaint. 
    It's usually irrelevance. 
    It doesn't pertain to -- to any matter, an issue or privilege information they sought. 
    They generally fall in that -- in that category.

    The two things that looked against delegation if this were completely a -- a situation where the Board hadn't reserved an open call are that Section 11 (1) and this is what Judge Reeves emphasized, draws a distinction between the subpoena power and the power to inspect and copy evidence and the power to administer oaths.

    Now, if you stop there, I recognize that we have a difficult world to hold. 
    However, as Mohawk shows, the answer as to whether Congress intended the subpoena power to be delegated, depends upon the statute as a whole. 
    And we believe that on examining the other facts which are pointed out in our brief, they over balance the impression that you would get from just looking at Section 11 (1) of the Act.

    What would happen if every --

speaker="norton_j_come" startTime="2050.683" stopTime="2198.014">
    Mr. Norton J. Come 
    Well, that is -- that is correct but as I intend to show later and as we show in our brief, Congress, it could fairly be said was aware of the way the Board has been utilizing its procedure through the years, because the Attorney General's administrative committee made reference to how this worked under the Wagner Act. 
    Now, its report was published to the Senate document. 
    This has been in the Board's rules since as far a back as 1939 and in Taft-Hartley, when Congress got around to amending the Act, it looked at the subpoena provision. 
    And although there is no indication that it discussed this particular problem, it -- for the House Bill proposed to make some changes in the sense of depriving the Board of the use of subpoenas prior to hearings in unfair labor practice and appoints cases. 
    And they provided for this step procedure and then when the -- the Senate Bill proposed no change in the Wagner Act language and then when it emerged from conference, the only thing that they did was to adopt the petition to revoke a procedure, the House Bill rejecting the elimination of the use of subpoenas prior to hearing in unfair labor practice cases. 
    And Senator Taft said, the only change that we're making in existing law, insofar as subpoenas are concerned is to convert it from a one-step into a two-step procedure. 
    Now, granted that you don't have a specific dealing with -- with this -- this problem, we certainly do have a situation where Congress was looking into the Board's subpoena procedures and the only thing that they emerged with is a change which would convert it from a one-step into a two-step procedure. 
    So, we think that in -- in the face of that, we have to a degree at least a legislative ratification on the Board's subpoena procedure.

    Mr. Hamilton.
speaker="theo_hamilton" startTime="2278.199" stopTime="2520.750">
    Mr. Theo Hamilton 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please Your Honor. 
    It might be well to take just a moment to fill in some things in the beginning of this case. 
    The National Labor Relations Board entertained their petition against one corporation in Miami of a chain of intrastate stores. 
    This corporation appeared at the hearing. 
    It filed as a counsel for the Board has stated a motion to dismiss. 
    It filed also with that a sworn affidavit setting up in full the business of that corporation and showing that that corporation was not subject to the National Labor Relations Board's jurisdiction as it was then fixed. 
    The Board then went out and brought in three or four corporations, whose employees had nothing to do with this case in order to attempt to prove jurisdiction. 
    Then the subpoenas were issued. 
    And those subpoenas require that these corporations bring for an entire year all of their records into the hearing, covering every sale and every purchase between the corporations for an entire year in other words, the complete business of the corporations for a year. 
    In the answer in the District Court, the respondents stated and it has never been contradicted that it would have taken at least eight weeks to get this data up for the Board. 
    Consequently, the corporation refused to abide by the subpoenas. 
    One of the principal reasons was that they were oppressed -- oppressing the non-reasonable and the District Court so held. 
    There was some statement made with the hearing officer offered to permit counsel to -- to have oral argument and to file a brief. 
    That's true. 
    But the position of the respondents has always been that the hearing officer had no authority to either hear or rule upon those petitions to revoke. 
    We had asked the Board itself for our argument and the opportunity to file a brief, and the Board refused to permit that. 
    The Board merely sent our petition back and attempted to force us to hand it through the hearing officer. 
    Now, in this particular case, I would like for the Court to remember that we are dealing with a representation case, not an unfair labor practice case. 
    There's an innate and fundamental difference between these two types of cases. 
    Generally speaking, representation cases and hearing officers whose authority is in question here are not covered by the Administrative Procedures Act at all. 
    Hearing officers are called trial examiners in unfair labor practice cases and they are covered by the Administrative Procedures Act. 
    Another thing to remember is that we are not concerned with the issuance of subpoenas. 
    We're concerned with a much more important problem, the revocation of subpoenas. 
    There has been some question about what might happen hypothetically in the future, where this Court through the hearing officers had no authority to revoke subpoenas. 
    And I might point out that the first court that made a decision along these lines was in the National Labor Relations Board versus Pesante case which was decided in 1954 by the District Court of the Southern District of California. 
    And it doesn't seem to me that there's been very much disruption of the National Labor Relations Board procedures, although that case was entirely against the National Labor Relations Board on the very issues that are concerned here and it was not appealed.

    Mr. Justice Douglas, the wording of the Act is that you say it is one of the most important features but I'm going to point out to the Court what happened in Congress prior to the time this Act was passed, which has a direct bearing on it. 
    I need not tell this Court anything about the importance of subpoena power merely mention the fact that the subpoena power is one of the most important, one of the most delicate, one which involves the most intricate problems of constitutional statutory law. 
    And we have that involved here, where a hearing officer tried to issue a subpoena requiring a private citizen to produce his books and records for a period, in this case, of an entire year. 
    The source of all subpoena power in a hearing officer arises from the National Labor Relations Act as amended.

    In the Wagner Act, there was no provision for revocation of subpoenas. 
    It was not mentioned and the Act did not require the mandatory issuance of subpoenas. 
    Now, those two factors were introduced by Congress and Congress presumably knew at that time what the practice of the Board was, and yet Congress changed that Act in two material particulars, each of which materially changed the handling of subpoenas, not only the issuance but the revocation of subpoenas. 
    The Act has passed this, the Court knows in 1947. 
    Administrative practice prior to that time, I would say has no bearing on this because Congress knew what the Board was doing and changed it in these two material particulars.

    -- quotation there. 
    As I said, the entire source of authority for the powers of a hearing officer in reference to subpoenas must be contained in the National Labor Relations Act as amended. 
    It is our contention that the National Labor Relations Board does not have the authority under the Act to issue or promulgate a rule by which it can delegate power to revoke a subpoena to a hearing officer, whether it's in the initial instance or in the final instance. 
    The Act itself clearly states that petitions for revocation shall be referred to the Board and it has no language such as it has in many other instances of the Board handling administrative matters through its agents. 
    The fundamental issue is whether a hearing officer in a representation case has authority to rule upon revocation of subpoenas. 
    As we see it, the -- the validity or invalidity of the Board's rules and regulations has to be determined primarily upon the authority that -- that the hearing officer or the Board has in relation to revocation of subpoenas. 
    And since the Act itself clearly says that petitions to revoke shall be referred to the Board and it does not mention the possibility of any agent or agency or does not permit the -- expressly permit the delegation of that power. 
    We say that the Board rules are (Inaudible) the Fifth Circuit so held. 
    We think that citizens, appearing before the National Labor Relations Board, employers appearing before the National Labor Relations Board, witnesses, should have a responsible agency to rule upon such an important matter. 
    We think that the Congress intended that a responsible agency rule upon revocation of subpoenas to wit, the Board itself.

    Mr. Theo Hamilton 
    One of the -- one of the Sections of the Act clearly shows the intent of Congress that the hearing officers should not have any extensive powers. 
    In the Taft-Hartley Law, the Labor Management Relations Act passed in 1947, Congress inserted the provision that hearing officers could not make even recommendations as to any issue that was to go to the Board. 
    A hearing officer is merely, in effect, a reporter. 
    He takes a record.

    Did they have that authority under the statute?

speaker="theo_hamilton" startTime="3451.496" stopTime="3510.959">
    Mr. Theo Hamilton 
    Well, I'd just wanted to go into the reasons for changing the subpoena procedures in Taft-Hartley. 
    It's pretty well established. 
    In fact, the Board admits it in its brief that the Board was one of the administrative agencies, which was under severe criticism because they permitted their own counsel to have subpoenas and -- and required everybody else to only get them on a showing of relevant -- relevancy on a written application for it. 
    So, Congress undertook to correct that criticism and changed it so that they made it mandatory that a subpoena be issued when it's requested. 
    Now, that became the law in 1947. 
    So there was a criticism against the Board and other administrative agencies in that respect. 
    Then in addition to that, Congress attempted to put in the hands of the Board itself a responsible agency the question of ruling -- judicial ruling, if you please, on revocations of subpoenas.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="3510.959" stopTime="3532.731">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    I noticed your self-restraint if that's what it is. 
    If you don't say it with -- the -- the Cudahy case is on the books, Congress presumably knew all about it, more than half of the members of it, two-thirds of the members of Congress have voted therefore, they read our opinions usually with great care and understanding and therefore they knew about Cudahy and applied, they adopted it.
speaker="theo_hamilton" startTime="3532.731" stopTime="3561.361">
    Mr. Theo Hamilton 
    I wouldn't want to disappoint you, Mr. Justice Frankfurter. 
    I intended to say that before (Inaudible)[Laughter] 
    The -- I would like to quote one statement from the Act relating to the hearing officers." 
    Such hearing may be conducted by an officer or employee of the regional office, who shall not make any recommendations with respect thereto." 
    That's about as broad as it could be in cutting his power down to nothing.
speaker="william_o_douglas" startTime="3561.361" stopTime="3562.656">
    Justice William O. Douglas 
    That's in representation?
speaker="theo_hamilton" startTime="3562.656" stopTime="3697.555">
    Mr. Theo Hamilton 
    That's in representation proceedings only. 
    Now, the Board's practice prior to the passage of the Labor Management Relations Act, in 1947, was to permit hearing officers, and they were all called trial examiners in those days. 
    Both hearing officers in representation cases and hearing officers in unfair labor practice cases, was to permit them to rule in the first instance on applications for subpoenas and if they chose not to issue a subpoena, they didn't issue. 
    Now, the practice of the Board since the Labor Management Relations Act has been exactly the same. 
    The Act of Congress has not changed it and practically affected all, and the only way we can get it changed is to have a court change it. 
    As a practical matter, a person who's asked for a subpoena in a hearing, in a representation case hearing, is told by the hearing officer, I've got to issue it because it's mandatory but I will revoke it and he tells the other party how to revoke it. 
    In the (Inaudible) case cited by the Board, I quoted from the transcript in that case in my brief, "The hearing officer told the person that was asking for a subpoena I've got to issue it but I will immediately entertain a motion to revoke it and grant it." 
    And then the union's representative who had asked for it says, "Now, let me understand clearly just what you want me to do." 
    So, in -- in practical effect, what the Board has been doing ever since the Labor Management Relations Act is just exactly as it's been doing before. 
    What good does it do in any respect, insofar as the words and the mandate of Congress is concerned, to permit a hearing officer, in a representation case, instead of saying, I will issue the subpoena. 
    I will issue it but I will immediately revoke it. 
    It subverts the intent of Congress entirely in respect to the revocation of subpoenas.
speaker="charles_e_whittaker" startTime="3697.555" stopTime="3702.921">
    Justice Charles E. Whittaker

    Mr. Theo Hamilton 
    That and the committee reports. 
    And at this time I will point out the committee reports, which have a direct bearing on it. 
    First, again, I want to point out that the words of the Act aren't ambiguous. 
    They are just as clear as the English language can make them. 
    Congress knew what the -- the practice in the procedure. 
    The Board wasn't just as obviously intended to change it so, no amount of speculation, no concern of the Board as to its convenience. 
    No question as to what is wise or expedience ought to be used to change that plan and on unambiguous meaning, but we can go further than that to show what Congress meant. 
    House resolution --
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="3751.945" stopTime="3788.621">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Well, (Voice Overlap) -- and are you suggesting -- was there any evidence of the abuse that you've described namely, of -- it couldn't have been the Court until this provision got under Taft-Hartley Act as I get it. 
    But you should now describe for us is that the hearers understand that they have no choice but to issue the subpoena upon request but promptly they revoke it so that the requirement that they issue it becomes meaningless and the requirement as you see it under 11 (1), that the issue of revocation will be determined only by the Board as they come in. 
    Is that it?

    And then -- then what -- what -- what could a party do? 
    Would they have to obey the subpoena or would -- could they await an the enforcement proceeding then?

    Mr. Theo Hamilton 
    Well, if -- if we -- well remember, we didn't have an Administrative Procedures Act to make any differentiation between these two officers and he would just have to fall back on general law. 
    Frankly, I did not -- I have not ever had a case involving subpoenas until after the Taft-Hartley Law. 
    So, in my present experience is nil on that. 
    And I know of -- I have no personal knowledge of other cases involving subpoenas that's prior to Taft-Hartley.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Are you also going to argue that it seems the statute says the Board or members thereof that they had in mind not to put too heavy a burden on the Board of the collectivity?
speaker="theo_hamilton" startTime="3870.144" stopTime="3979.498">
    Mr. Theo Hamilton 
    I think they intended to permit the Board to handle matters of this kind with a three-member panel as you know they now do and I think that would -- I think it has very greatly helped the Board in the handling of its cases. 
    House Resolution 3020, has a reason to pass by the House, contained a provision about revocation stating that the person subpoenaed might petition the Board and I quote, "Or its duly authorized agents or agent to revoke the subpoena." 
    And I quote again, "If in its, his or their opinion, the subpoena did not meet the requirements of the Act." 
    Now, the House conference report 510 on House Resolution 3020 contained wording of the present law, leaving out references to the agents of the Board. 
    And the Board's counsel has stated here that Senator Taft made a statement. 
    They only intended to change the Act in one particular in his brief says and I quote from page 47, "As stated by Senator Taft, Section 11 authorizes the Board to conduct hearings and investigations in the subpoena witnesses. 
    This Section has not changed in the Senate amendment and was modified by the countries in only one respect. 
    Now, what he says is true but what he doesn't tell you is that that's the Senate amendment, not the Act that became law. 
    Because that changed it in two respects, not only the filing of mandatory issuance of subpoenas but as to revocation of subpoenas.

    Do you think this matter is affected at all by the fact that before the subpoena can be enforced, the District Court has to take a look at it?

    Mr. Theo Hamilton 
    I think, of course, that it is.

    The Board always alleges, I think, it certainly has in this case, that the respondents have been guilty of contumacious conduct.

    But I think that probably that's a reason that they have. 
    Now, Congress could have made expressed provisions for delegation of authority if it wished to do so.

    Now, the Board has -- not dwell too much on the Cudahy case. 
    The Cudahy case we think is ruling here. 
    The Court considered a -- a case very similar on the law. 
    The Act in Congress had a prior history exactly the same as this Act and we think that the reasoning of the Court there should apply here.

    Thank you, sir. 
    I'd appreciate making one more statement. 
    The Board has talked about exhaustion of remedies. 
    I merely want to point out that the rule of the Board does not require a person to use that appeal. 
    It's merely a permission to ask for permission to appeal and therefore the administrative exhaustion of -- of remedies does not apply in this case.
