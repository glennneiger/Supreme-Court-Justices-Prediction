Dessalernos v. Savoretti

    Mr. David W. Walters 
    -- is relying on the theory of -- the various subsections as the basis for which this man was denied the right to have his application for suspension of deportation considered. 
    In other words, they are saying that the excluding provisions in each of the subsection will travel over to one or the others and particularly subsection (1) and prevent him from qualifying under subsection (1). 
    That argument might have varied except that self-contain in each one of the subsections, there is a reference to classes of aliens who are excluded from consideration under that particular subsection. 
    In subsection (1) it says, "Is deportable under any law of the United States" and the word "any law” is most significant. 
    It means every law including the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 and all its subsections, and is not a member of a class of whose deportation could not have been suspended by reason of Section 19 (b) of the Immigration Act of 1917 which has pertinence to criminal and moral type of aliens. 
    Section 2 says, "It's not within the provisions of paragraph (4) of this subsection," this subsection. 
    Section -- subsection (3) says, "It's not within the provisions of paragraph (4) or (5)." 
    Subsection (4) says. 
    "It's not within the provisions of paragraph (5) of the subsection." 
    And in paragraph (5) enumerates numerous subsections within Immigration and Nationality Act but has no reference whatsoever, to any provisions of the Immigration Act of February the 5th, 1917 as does Section 1. 
    Now, as I can be permitted with some liberties of the respondent's brief as far as this question of mutual excludability is concerned, I would like to read from page 13 of the brief -- the respondent's brief which they cite the reason for mutual exclusive theory. 
    One, the only overlapping between (1) and (5) under the literal language of the statute is as to pre-1950 entrance. 
    Deportable for failure to report or for worse, security offenses. 
    This is probably due to the fact that while these offenses were not so seriously regarded in 1940, they were considered very important in 1952. 
    The over -- overlapping in this limited respect probably represents a legislative oversight. 
    And not -- in other words, what they are saying is that there does exist a legislative oversight and -- they want this question of mutual excludability between the sections that this oversight could be supplied by this Court. 
    I don't think it was an oversight at all. 
    I think it was designed. 
    I think the legislative history which I referred to in my brief with exact quotes from the authorities shows that there was an intention that this subsection (1) stand out differently form all the others. 
    They say that this must be the case, although they don't cite any reason for it in -- in language or expressions of any legislative body. 
    This must be the case, because it deals Section 5 -- it deals with more -- a criteria of a more great nature. 
    And the consequences that there must be a more stringent application of the law. 
    Well, I would like to call the Court's attention to the fact to Section 5 as contained within it, as a qualification. 
    Under paragraph (2) of Section 240 (a) -- 241 (a) is a person who has remained longer in the United States than the period for which he was admitted. 
    That's precisely the ground on which the petitioner's deportation was sought originally. 
    It cannot be more stringent in this paragraph than it is paragraph (1) or more grave in paragraph (1) than it is in paragraph (5). 
    In addition to that, we're faced with the unusual phenomenon but let's suppose for example, that this man never came to the attention to the immigration service that he entered in 1947 prior to 1950 as he did. 
    He never came to the attention of the immigration service. 
    Subsequent to December 1957, he does come to the attention of the immigration service. 
    He is not charged with the additional charge that he is subject to deportation because he failed to report on a particular genre. 
    There is no place within this section or any of the subsections wherein this man could qualify for suspension of deportation. 
    I can't think of anything more stringent than that. 
    So, the application of the law under subsection (1) in my opinion, the people of this class is more stringent than number (5).

    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    First, if I may, I should like to refer the statement made by counsel that the first reference made to the jurisdictional point was made in our brief on the merits. 
    I believe that is not exactly so. 
    We did raised the point in our brief in our position.

speaker="maurice_a_roberts" startTime="396.172" stopTime="725.267">
    Mr. Maurice A. Roberts 
    That is true, Your Honor. 
    The facts briefly are these. 
    The petitioner has been ordered deported after entry in 1947 on two grounds. 
    First, as a seaman who failed maintain the conditions of his admission as a non-immigrant. 
    And second, as an alien who willfully failed to comply with the alien registration provisions of the 1952 Immigration Act. 
    The latter violation is covered by Section 241 (a) (5) of the 1952 Act, and I stress that (5) because that is the Section which is referred to in the suspension provision which I shall shortly come to. 
    In 1954, he applied for suspension of deportation in the course of the deportation proceedings and was given a hearing. 
    The special inquiry officer found him deportable on the two charges, and after taking the testimony which he had a full opportunity to present his evidence incidentally, the special inquiry officer denied his application for suspension finding first that he was single and had no one in the country dependent upon him for support, and therefore he could not meet the hardship prerequisite to suspension which lies in every provision of the suspension statute. 
    The special inquiry officer also found that since the petitioner lacked 10 years of residence in this country, he could not meet the requirements of subdivision (5) of the suspension statute which is Section 244 of the 1952 Act. 
    The fifth subdivision applies to persons who are deportable after entry on specified charges and one of those charges specified is the group deportable for failure to comply with the registration requirements. 
    Having denied suspension of deportation, special inquiry officer ordered deportation. 
    The petitioner appealed to the Board of Immigration Appeals contending that since he arrived in 1947, and in 1954 he had seven years of residence, he came within the literal terms of the first subdivision of the suspension statute which applied generally to aliens who arrived in the United States prior to June 27, 1950 who were deportable generally under any law of the United States and who are not within the inhibition of Section 19 (d) of the 1917 Immigration Act which I shall discuss briefly. 
    And the petitioner contends that his seven years residence qualifies him under the first subdivision and that his case should not be governed exclusively by the fifth subdivision which it -- with its 10-year requirement of residence which he concededly cannot meet. 
    The Board of Immigration Appeals after considering the evidence as stated in its opinion, show no reason to change the special inquiry officer's decision and the board specifically held that it was the fifth subdivision which governed exclusively in the petitioner's case. 
    The petitioner thereupon instituted declaratory judgment proceedings in the United States District Court in which the only ground he raised was the interpretation by the immigration authorities and the Board of Immigration Appeals with respect to the suspension statute. 
    He contended there that his eligibility could rest on the first subdivision notwithstanding the fact that he did not meet the requirements of the fifth. 
    And in the District Court, there was a hearing which took into account solely the administrative record. 
    There was no testimony or hearing de novo. 
    There was a stipulation -- an oral stipulation among the parties according to the judgment of the District Court which stated that the facts as found by the special inquiry officer and by the Board of Immigration Appeals was a correct statement of the factual situation, and there was also a stipulation, a narrow one, with respect to the issue before the District Court. 
    And in stating the issue, it was conceded that the petitioner was ineligible under the fifth subdivision because he lacked the physical requirements meeting the 10-year physical presence of the fifth subdivision, but it was stated he fully meets the requirements of the first subdivision. 
    And it was on this issue that the District Court rendered its declaratory judgment finding or declaring that the petitioner was ineligible to suspension of deportation under the suspension statute Section 244 (a) of the 1952 Act. 
    On appeal, the Court of Appeals of the Fifth Circuit affirmed in an elaborate opinion which goes into great detail and which is printed in our -- in the record. 
    The issue posed here --

    -- Mr. Roberts.

    Yes, sir.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="726.327" stopTime="793.050">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Is that then the only question is before us, the one that the court -- District Court and its judgment stated with the issue? 
    It's the only one thing he said that's been orally stipulated before the Court that the sole question to be decided by the court was to wit it. 
    Does the fact that plaintiff is admittedly statutory ineligible for suspension and deportation under Section 244 (a) (5) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, either plaintiff is not being able to meet the physical requirements of that section, preclude the plaintiff from presenting for consideration his application for suspension of deportation under Section 244 (a) (1) of said Act. 
    It's being admitted that the plaintiff fully meets the requirement at the latter section, and it says in the Court having heard the argument, a defiance. 
    Now, is that the sole question that we have before us here?

    In this sense, Your Honor. 
    And I may said this, we would be most happy to have a decision on the issue tendered by the petition, but we feel that it's our duty to bring -- to present this issue to the Court. 
    And the jurisdictional issue as we it is this, that there is no justiciable controversy between the parties because on this record, the petitioner being unable to satisfy the hardship prerequisite of the suspension statute, cannot possibly be eligible for suspension of deportation regardless of whether it is found that the first subdivision applies to him as he contends or the fifth as we contend.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    I'm not stopping you but I think it's important that this Court should decide a case or not. 
    That seems to be important.
speaker="maurice_a_roberts" startTime="1623.981" stopTime="1805.439">
    Mr. Maurice A. Roberts 
    On the question of statutory construction, the sole question is whether the overlap which seems to be apparent between the first subdivision and the fifth, was intended by Congress to constitute a real overlap or whether Congress intended the one or the other to govern. 
    It is our contention that the fifth subdivision was intended by Congress to govern because in the fifth subdivision, Congress specifically made reference to aliens who are deportable under specified sections of the Act and that Congress therein enumerated the aliens who are deportable on the most serious charges. 
    The fifth subdivision requires the alien to establish ten years of good moral character from the date of the commission of the deportable offense. 
    It also requires that before the suspension administratively granted by the Attorney General can become final, the Congress must take affirmative action by a concurrent resolution. 
    And the fifth subdivision applies to aliens who are within the specified categories regardless of the day of entry. 
    Now, in contradistinction, the first subdivision under which the petitioner claims applies generally to aliens who entered the United States prior to June 27th, 1950 who are deportable under any law of the United States generally except certain specified laws enumerated in Section 19 (d) of the Immigration Act of 1917 which precluded suspension on the part of the most serious offenders. 
    The narcotic violators, the immoral classes, subversives et cetera. 
    The first subdivision requires a showing of seven years of residence and good moral character immediately preceding the application, so that there was immediately apparent, a difference, a qualitative difference in the approach of the Congress to the two classes, and it seems clear that Congress intended the fifth subdivision with its more stringent requirements to govern the more serious offenses. 
    In the 10-year residence period and good moral character period following upon the commission of the deportable offense, Congress evidently set up a reformed period, a probationary period, and it must be born in mind that most of the enumerated groups of deportable aliens set forth in the fifth subdivision were the ones who were absolutely precluded from suspension altogether under the 1917 Act because of the serious nature of their deportable offenses.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="1805.439" stopTime="1806.925">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Not all of them.
speaker="maurice_a_roberts" startTime="1806.925" stopTime="1831.720">
    Mr. Maurice A. Roberts 
    Not all of them. 
    As I see it, there are 11 categories and of these 11 categories, nine are the same as those encompassed within Section 19 (d) of the 1917 Act. 
    There are two new categories that have been added. 
    One happens to be the petitioner's category and then there's another one, a group of persons guilty of war time offenses.
speaker="william_o_douglas" startTime="1831.720" stopTime="1837.158">
    Justice William O. Douglas 
    But it is a fact that under the 1917 Act (Inaudible)
speaker="maurice_a_roberts" startTime="1837.158" stopTime="1838.066">
    Mr. Maurice A. Roberts 
    This petitioner?

    Unknown Speaker 
    (Inaudible)
speaker="maurice_a_roberts" startTime="1838.887" stopTime="2084.552">
    Mr. Maurice A. Roberts 
    There is an anomaly because under the 1917 Act, this petitioner wasn't even deportable in the first place. 
    On this alien registration violation, this alien registration violation was not made the deportable offense until the 1952 Act. 
    And the history of the alien registration offenses indicates that by 1952, Congress had taken a very deem view of them, and had therefore included them within the most serious offenses and therefore covered them into the fifth subdivision. 
    Now, there are certain anomalies which follow if an alien who is deportable on this serious charges is found also to be suspendable under the more lenient provisions of the first subdivision. 
    And in the brief time available, I should like to point out a few. 
    For example, the statute also permits voluntary departure which a lesser form of relief and suspension of deportation. 
    In the case of aliens who were deportable on these serious types of charges, the statute requires ten years of residence before the alien can qualify for this lesser form of relief, so that it would be odd if Congress should preclude a person in the petitioners' class from the lesser form of relief of voluntary departure, and at the same time permit him to have the major form of suspension of deportation under the first category. 
    Then there is also this. 
    The reform provision in the fifth category requires 10 years of residence and good moral character since commission of the deportable offense. 
    The first subdivision requires seven years of character -- of good moral character and residence, immediately preceding the filling of the application. 
    The petitioner arrived here in 1947 as a seaman. 
    He could first establish the seven years of good moral character by 1954, but that was the very year in which he committed this alien registration violation which led to his being ordered deported under the fifth subdivision, and it was indeed anomalous for Congress to want him to be suspendable under the first subdivision when they extracted a 10-year probationary period from all the persons listed in this fifth category. 
    In our brief, we also developed at some length the fact that this various categories were designed to be neutrally exclusive, and there was some legislative history to support that.Unfortunately, most of the conclusions with respect to this legislation must be based on inferences drawn from facts because these suspension provisions were not the most controversial of the McCarran-Walter Act when it was in debate. 
    But in closing, I should like to point this out. 
    The fifth subdivision is the only one which applies without time limitation whatsoever, it applies retrospectively as well as prospectively, it applies to all aliens of the specific classes enumerated. 
    And we believe that this is one instance where it can clearly be said that the rule of statutory construction should govern which states generally that a specific provision governs a general one. 
    This Court has stated it very aptly in the Ginsberg case. 
    The general language of a statutory provision although broad enough to include it, will not be held to apply to a matter specifically dealt with in another part of the same enactment. 
    And --

    Mr. Maurice A. Roberts 
    There are others -- there are other sections of the statute which deal with this specific type of offense and preclude some relief to this whole group of 11 types of offenders. 
    This is merely one of the instances in which these serious group of offenders are handled in a special form. 
    More is required of them than of other types of deportable offenders. 
    And since this group has been so singled out, we believe that this overlap which is present if we read the statute literally, we believe that this overlap was not designed or intended by Congress to permit an alien who happens to fall within the overlap to take advantage of the more lenient provisions of the first subdivision. 
    When it seems to us that Congress was most interested that those who fell within the fifth subdivision which encompass the most serious offenders should show a longer period of genuine reform and that Congress should be required to have a concurrent resolution before their suspension would be effective which is not the case with the first subdivision.
