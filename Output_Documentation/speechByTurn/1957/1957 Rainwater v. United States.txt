Rainwater v. United States
speaker="leon_b_catlett" startTime="0.000" stopTime="657.464">
    Mr. Leon B. Catlett 
    -- the complaints in this case were filed in the United States District Court at Little Rock, Arkansas. 
    One of the complaints is against R.S. Rainwater &amp; Sons, a partnership and other against Citizens National Bank of Walnut Ridge, Arkansas. 
    Jurisdiction in both complaints is grounded upon a False Claims statute. 
    It's alleged that these petitioners made and caused to be made and presented and caused to be presented false claims to the Commodity Credit Corporation, an agency at instrumentality of the Government of the United States. 
    Briefly, it's alleged in these complaints that these petitioners caused to be transmitted to Commodity Credit Corporation, 14 transmittal letters on which were listed 98 cotton producers' notes, secured by bales of cotton, which was ineligible under the Commodity Credit Corporation cotton program for 1949 and caused Commodity Credit Corporation to pay these notes. 
    And as shown by the transmittal letters, which Commodity Credit Corporation would not have done if it had known the true facts. 
    Now, motions to dismiss were filed in the United States District Court and those motions were sustained. 
    The case was appealed to the Court of Appeals for the Eight Circuit.Eight Circuit reversed in 242 F.2d, this case came upon certiorari. 
    Now, as I say, the jurisdiction in each of these complaints is based upon the False Claims statute. 
    The False Claims statute was enacted in 1863. 
    It originally provided in the one statute for criminal punishment and civil recovery against any person who should make or cause to be made or present a cause to be presented, a false claim against the Government of the United States or a department or officer thereof. 
    It was just the one statute provided for criminal penalties and civil recovery, and that was in 1863. 
    In 1878, the False Claims statute was divided into a civil portion and a criminal portion, 1878. 
    The civil portion became revised statutes 3490 and it provided that any person who should do any of the acts -- commit any of the acts recorded in the criminal portion of the statute, which is Revised Statutes 5438, should be responsible to the Government by a suit for double damages and a forfeiture in the amount of $2000. 
    In other words, the -- the civil portion of the False Claims statute was 3490 and yet adopted by reference, the provisions of the criminal portion which was 5438. 
    5438 remained that any person should be punished criminally for making and presenting to the -- a false claim to the Government of the United States or a department of the Government of the United States, or an officer thereof. 
    Now, that's the status in which we find ourselves in this case. 
    Now, 3490 has never been amended or dealt with or touched in any manner by Congress. 
    Its Revised Statutes 3490 that we're treating with in this case and it adopted by reference the provisions of the criminal section 5438. 
    Now, 5438 was repealed in 1909 and superseded by Section 35 of the criminal statutes. 
    It didn't change it in any other manner. 
    It still says that a man shall be punished criminally for making or causing to be made or presenting or causing to be presented a false claim against the Government of the United States, or a department or officer thereof. 
    Now, that's 1909. 
    Now, in 1918, due to the Government corporations which had or began to spring up, in 1918, this criminal statute now, 5438 which subsequently in 1909 became Section 35 of the Criminal Code was amended. 
    The criminal section was, to provide that -- add these words, that anymore persons who makes a cause to be made or presents a cause to be presented of -- of false claim against the Government of the United States or a department or officer or a corporation in which the United States is a stockholder, shall be punished criminally. 
    Now, that was in 1918. 
    Now, at the present time, that criminal section is found in the Code in Title 18 Section 1001 and Section 2 -- Title 18 287. 
    It was split but the criminal section is still to all intense and purposes as it was, after it had been amended in 1918. 
    But again, we are not concerned with the statute. 
    It's -- this case is brought under the Revised Statutes 3490. 
    Now, in the code, it says that it's Section 231 of Title 31 but that is just the West Publishing Company's idea about it, I guess you'd say, because when I read and traced it back, I wrote West Publishing Company to find out if they haven't made an error and they then gave me the details of the history of Revised Statutes 3490. 
    And as I say, that is the section that we are dealing with and that section has never been ordered or amended or dealt with in anyway by our Congress since 1878 and when it adopted that reference 5438. 
    And of course, this Court held in the In re East Company and Kendall against United States and of course, it's always been the law that when one statute adopts another statute by reference, any changes in the adopted statute does not affect the adopting statute. 
    So, any changes that were made in the criminal section, Revised Statutes 5438, as it was changed in 1918 did not affect the civil -- False Claims statute 3490 on which these complaints were based. 
    Now, the -- this Court said in United States Marcus -- ex rel. Marcus versus Hess case that it was the duty of the Court to discover and not direct the legislative will. 
    Now, in this case, we would love to see, what was the intension of Congress in the amending of the criminal statute 5438, the best place to look we thought would be the record at the time of the passage of that Amendment. 
    It -- Mr. Gard, Congressman who -- Congressman Gard, who was the Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee at the time of the proposal of the amendment to the criminal section 5438 said that it was proposed in order to extend the provisions of 5438 so as to cover a corporation in which the United States was a stockholder. 
    That is the House -- Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee at the time the amendment was proposed. 
    Now, when it was presented on the floor of the House for passage, in the absence of the Chairman of the Committee, Representative Argall again explained to the House, that the purpose of the amendment was to expand or extend the provisions of that criminal statute 5438. 
    Not simply to interpret it but to extend it to make it cover something that it hadn't covered before namely, the pre -- presentation of a False Claim to a corporation in which the United States was a stockholder. 
    This Court in a footnote in the late case of United States against Bramblett, I think, it's found in 348 United States, briefly explained the legislative history of the criminal statute 5438 by stating in that footnote that the amendment in 1918 was to extend the provisions of that Section, so as to cover, of course, something that it had not covered before, namely, a corporation in which the United States was a stockholder. 
    So, it seems clear to us that the intention of Congress was that 5438, which was adopted by 3490 in 1878, did not at the time of the adoption include a corporation in which the United States was a stockholder and did not so -- and as -- and the criminal statute did not include that until 1918 at the time the amendment was made to that Section.

    Mr. Leon B. Catlett 
    I believe, it would have been the same, Your Honor, because it's our position that 5438, it -- it has to be read into 3490 in 1878 and -- and can't be any amendment to 5438 affects in no 3490. 
    I believe, we had been in the same position or we wouldn't have had if it hadn't been amended. 
    We wouldn't have those expressions of Representative Argall or of Representative Gard, the Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee.

    Well, anyway it -- it appeared to me too, that the intention of Congress could be gathered from its -- what -- what was done at the time the Commodity Credit Corporation Act was passed. 
    The Senate proposed that a certain section of the Commodity Credit Corporation Act would give the Commodity Credit Corporation Government immunity. 
    Now, that wasn't -- the House didn't concur. 
    So, when the bill was passed, I think, it was 714 (e) of that -- of Title 15 which is Commodity Credit Corporation Act. 
    When the -- when the bill was finally passed, the Commodity Credit Corporation was given priority in payment of claims against insolvents, bankrupts and the estates of deceased persons.

    Mr. Leon B. Catlett 
    It wasn't done, Your Honor. 
    And then came along the Corporation Control Act of 1945 and there again, we can look at what the Congress intended about Commodity Credit Corporation because in this Commodity -- in this Corporation Control Act of 1945. 
    It provided that this Government corporation of -- should have not a Governmental audit, as that term is viewed but should have a commercial audit. 
    In other words, they shouldn't -- an audit would be made of a Government corporation, such as Commodity Credit Corporation would be an audit not to the -- as -- as you give a Government agency would -- would see whether the money had been expended according to congressional authorization but in audit on one of these Government corporations. 
    It's an audit just like you would have of any other corporation, to make up your profit and loss statement and to determine if the money had been expended by the corporation according to the -- authors of the directors of that corporation. 
    So, it provided for a different type of audit for these Government corporations then for a Government agency. 
    And also, the Corporation Control Act of 1945 provided that they -- this Government corporation should not lose their separate identity.

    Mr. Leon B. Catlett 
    Now, within a -- not -- not only this, I think, Congress recognized that there's a -- that is a separate identity to a Government corporation, such as Commodity Credit Corporation. 
    But the Commodity Credit Corporation recognizes itself in the false -- in the assignment of claims statute which is found in Title 31 Section 203. 
    That provides that no claim against the Government of the United States shall be assigned unless it is -- the assignment is witnessed by two witnesses unless the amount of the claim has been audited and approved and a warrant for payment issued. 
    But Commodity Credit Corporation comes along, and under its power to promulgate its own rules and regulations, as they all have. 
    It provides under its whole program that claims against Commodity Credit Corporation may be assigned simply by going to -- by having the assignment witnessed by two witnesses or executed before an order public, just hand them out. 
    But that's not -- then you see Commodity Credit Corporation then recognized this that it is a separate entity, it's in a different position from the Government of the United States because it doesn't recognize the False Claims Act of the -- under which the United States and its Government agencies -- and its agencies must employ.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1248.844" stopTime="1302.338">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Catlett, the thing that I have in mind, when I asked that question was -- was this.In 1863, the functions of Government were quite simple compared to what they are today. 
    I -- I wonder if every time the Government changes its method of -- of operating and assigns functions to -- to different agencies or adjuncts of -- of Government, if it would be required that the -- an act of this kind be amended when obviously, the purpose of it is to protect the Government against any false claims made against it.
speaker="leon_b_catlett" startTime="1302.338" stopTime="1417.210">
    Mr. Leon B. Catlett 
    Well, Your Honor, I -- evidently, Congress thought that it was necessary to amend it, the criminal portion of the statute because it had a -- prosecutions had been attempted under Revised Statute 1500 -- 5438 for presenting false claims against Government corporations and they had been unsuccessful. 
    The courts had held against the Government. 
    And that's when the 1918 that came along and amended that Government statute after 5438 to make it cover. 
    Now, yesterday, in the discussion in this companion case of (Inaudible), whichever it -- is was, Mr. Justice Black asked a question about prosecution. 
    Now, this -- this Commodity Credit Corporation Act has a criminal section. 
    It's 714 (m) (a) to (d) I believe inclusive and it sets up its own penalty provisions and it provides that there shall be a penalty for the presentation of a false claim against Commodity Credit Corporation. 
    So, in drafting the Commodity Credit Corporation Act, they did not intend to depend on prosecutions under the False Claims statute. 
    You see, the 5438 or the -- as you will, Section 35 of the Criminal Code, that they set up their own section under which the prosecution should be instituted for presenting a false claim against Commodity Credit Corporation. 
    They could just easily have said that -- if they have wanted to avail themselves of this False Claims statute, the provisions of it, similarly, they could have written that into the Act. 
    Now, they hadn't anything --

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    The Congress sometimes has things called to its attention that the -- that impels them to amend a certain -- a statute because of particular things, you said here --

    Mr. Leon B. Catlett 
    No, Your -- Your Honor. 
    But I -- I think, I agree with my friend Mr. Doub yesterday, when he said that the -- that Commodity Credit Corporation should take this problem up with Congress and not with this Court because if they want to avail themselves, if Commodity Credit Corporation wants to avail itself of the right to pursue similarly under the False Claims statute, it ought to ask Congress to amend the law, so that that can be done. 
    Now, this doesn't preclude Commodity --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1477.533" stopTime="1513.780">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    But doesn't that assume though that -- that this isn't a Government -- part of the Government. 
    It isn't a department of the Government and that therefore, it isn't included in the Act of 1863 or 1878. 
    Now, as I understood Mr. Doub this is -- this is part and partial of the Department of Agriculture and that therefore it's a part of the Government and therefore it applies in -- in the case of Credit Commodity Corporation.
speaker="leon_b_catlett" startTime="1513.780" stopTime="1595.241">
    Mr. Leon B. Catlett 
    Mr. Chief Justice, it -- it certainly is a corporation. 
    It -- the Act says that it shall maintain its separate identity. 
    The Congress provided that it should be audited differently from a simple Government agency and it was organized for the purpose of flexibility and -- and so that it wouldn't have to be responsible to the Government for so many different matters but could handle them much more easily as a corporation. 
    And it could if it was an agency of the Government. 
    Now, suit isn't precluded by a -- by -- I mean Commodity Credit Corporation has the right to sue and be sued in its own name. 
    It can bring a suit against these people. 
    It has that right. 
    What I do say, may it please the Court, that it cannot bring a suit against these people under Revised Statutes 3490 because 3490 only adopted 5438 and that was done at a time when 5438, which is a criminal statute and must be strictly construed, did not have within its terms a corporation in which the United States is a stockholder.

speaker="george_cochran_doub" startTime="2006.696" stopTime="2317.926">
    Mr. George Cochran Doub 
    Before discussing the 1918 Amendment, I would like to emphasize just a few things. 
    First, as to the fraudulent claims which were made in this case. 
    There are two separates suits, one against the Rainwater's and the other against this Arkansas Bank. 
    Now, we alleged that the Rainwater's purchase cotton from producers and at later dates, they arranged for the sellers to sign notes and loan agreements on this previously sold cotton for this fraudulent purpose. 
    And that purpose was to put themselves in a position to -- if the market continue to decline and the price of cotton to make this fraudulent loans from the Commodity Credit Corporation. 
    And that they did that by going to the bank which they control and where officers are and the bank had full knowledge of the fraudulent character of the representations contained in this -- in these notes. 
    And the bank sent forward those notes to the Commodity Credit Corporation and obtained the payment of the value of the cotton with interest and the cotton went up as collateral. 
    Now, the fraud was that the Rainwater's and the bank, both had full knowledge that this cotton had not been produced by the persons presenting those notes as was required under the terms of the Cotton Loan Act and the notes did not represent any advances to be made to the cotton producers. 
    Now, the Commodity accepted those notes and it made full payment on the notes with interest. 
    Now, subsequently, the price of cotton went up. 
    So, what happened was the Rainwater's redeemed the collateral for the notes and the notes repay Commodity Credit and the notes were canceled. 
    So, there was no actual loss to the Government except that imputed under the Civil Clause Claims Act. 
    I'd like to point out the reasoning of the Court of Appeals in holding that these transactions were false claims under the False Claims Act. 
    They said where the ultimate source of payment of the fraudulent claims with the Federal Treasury, there can be no distinction between a Government corporation or the Government itself being defrauded. 
    It said with respect to its funds, Commodity and the Government are indistinguishable. 
    And finally, it said that even though no specific damages were proven, the Government was still entitled to its forfeitures under the Act. 
    Now,I -- I like to point this out to the Court, the corporate veil has already been pierced by the decision of this Court and others as to holding on Government corporations. 
    The fundamental principle of the separate legal identity and the separate legal staffs of a corporation, immunizing its stockholder from liability has been destroyed already in the case of holding on Government corporations. 
    Under Cherry Cotton Mills decision, the United States, the sole stockholder and parent may sue in its own name upon the obligations of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation or any other holding on Government corporation. 
    You said this, that the Congress chose to call it a corporation does not alter its characteristics, so as to make it something other that what it actually is, an agency selected by the Government to accomplish purely Governmental purposes. 
    And then, under the decisions of the Court of Claims, suits maybe brought directly by the United States upon the Claims of its wholly owned corporations. 
    It -- one case illustrate this is Crooks Terminal Warehouse, 92 Court of Claims which is not on our brief, solving the Federal Surplus Commodities Corporation. 
    So, what is left then -- what is left then of the corporate section? 
    Its principal components no longer exist in the case of wholly owned corporations.

    Justice John M. Harlan 
    I wish you deal with the two -- two points that the opponents make and that you don't seem to excerpt to so far as I'm concerned. 
    Number one, the fact that Congress went in and enacted the Commodity Corporation, established it, provided a specific criminal penalty in that Act which would indicate to me that they didn't consider that it was covered in the Federal -- in the -- the General Claims Act. 
    And secondly, when they came to amending the Claims Act itself, they -- I haven't heard any good reasons stated yet as to why they put that in added corporations unless it was that they didn't consider, that they were already covered. 
    Now, that's my --
speaker="george_cochran_doub" startTime="2582.643" stopTime="2628.918">
    Mr. George Cochran Doub 
    No. 
    For -- for -- on your first point, you'll find a similar criminal statute included in statutes relating to a number of the agencies of the United States. 
    For instance, 1010 applies to F.H.A. frauds but those aren't criminal statutes. 
    This is not criminal statute. 
    My friends on the other side talked about us prosecuting -- bringing prosecutions under the Civil False Claims Act. 
    They are not prosecutions. 
    They -- this is a statute authorizing a civil recovery on the part of the Government of the United States for losses which it has sustained.

    Justice Charles E. Whittaker 
    Mr. Doub, before you do, may I ask you please? 
    Aren't the penalties to which the counsel referred contained in the Commodity Credit Corporation Act, all penal or are there civil penalties is there also?
speaker="george_cochran_doub" startTime="2780.540" stopTime="2782.079">

    No civil there -- there no civil --

    Not at all --
speaker="george_cochran_doub" startTime="2782.743" stopTime="2947.656">
    Mr. George Cochran Doub 
    No civil penalties at all. 
    It's entirely penal, entirely criminal. 
    Now, if they had provided in the Commodity Credit Corporation Act for a civil recovery by the United States, of course we couldn't be under our -- the statutes. 
    I -- we would agree to that. 
    Now, what was the effect of this 1918 Amendment to include corporations in which the United States was a stockholder? 
    Because as I understand it, the -- almost the entire argument of the defendant setters upon that amendment. 
    Now, you've already interpreted that amendment authoritatively. 
    You said that amendment was intended to protect the Emergency Fleet Corporation, in which the United States was a sole stockholder and that was a pioneer, a Government corporation. 
    That was the first of these Government corporations and it was designed to purchase and operate a fleet of cargo vessels. 
    In competition I might say with private interest. 
    Now, at the time that corporation was created and at the time that statute was passed, you said this, Congress contemplated a corporation in which private persons might be stockholders and which was to be formed like any business corporation under the laws of the District. 
    That was from shipyards. 
    Now, the point is not, that subsequently the United States became the sole stockholder, the point is not, that this Court suggested in United States against Walter that if you construed that statute to apply the corporations in which the United States had a mere stock interest, it might be unconstitutional. 
    The point is what was the congressional purpose of the statute? 
    What was contemplated by the Congress in passing that statute because the whole argument here relates to the intention of Congress. 
    So, Congress manifested an intention to apply that criminal statute to this corporation in which they contemplated -- there would be outside interest. 
    Now, the language of the amendment, not merely supports that, it says any corporation in which United States is a stockholder. 
    It doesn't say wholly owned Government corporations.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="2947.656" stopTime="2953.623">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Were there other corporations in existence at that time? 
    Government corporations, they were wholly owned?
speaker="george_cochran_doub" startTime="2953.623" stopTime="3033.539">
    Mr. George Cochran Doub 
    No -- no. 
    What the Fleet Corporation -- it was chartered only what was tantamount to local law, the District of Columbia as a private corporation with the power to purchase construction and operate merchant vessels. 
    The Shipping Board Act of 1916 authorized the Shipping Board on behalf of the United States to purchase not less that the majority of the stock and with the President's approval, it could sell all or such part of such stock, except it couldn't be left is a minority stockholder. 
    In other words, this corporation was organized under a statutory power vested in the Shipping Board to create corporations and they were designed to be private corporations in essence, organized under local law. 
    Now, you were in that call, that at the time of these early cases construing this Fleet Corporation situation, the current legal thinking was that there was major distinction between proprietary functions of the Government and Governmental functions. 
    And I think that that --

    Is it -- is the thrust of your argument that if the Emergency Fleet Corporation had been set up as a wholly owned Government corporation, there would have been no occasion to amend the False Claims Act, is that the thrust of your argument?
speaker="george_cochran_doub" startTime="3048.537" stopTime="3078.776">
    Mr. George Cochran Doub 
    No. 
    The thrust of my argument is that when Congress passed this 1918 Amendment to apply to any corporation, in which the United States had an interest, that if then contemplated, corporations which were not wholly owned by the United States and to illustrate it in this very situation. 
    It was contemplated at that time that it would be only partially owned.

    The sole occasion for this enactment, 1918 enactment was this circumstance if this first corporation was to be not wholly owned.

    Mr. George Cochran Doub 
    No. 
    I know of none but I would like to point out in view of the -- what has been said about the -- I don't know if whether I brought the right book here or not. 
    I did want to refer to the distinction in our law between the wholly owned Government corporations and the hybrid corporation. 
    You'll find it in the -- in the Government Corporation Control Act of 1945 and Section 846 defines wholly owned Government corporation. 
    It says it's used in this chapter the term wholly owned Government corporation means the Commodity Credit Corporation and enumerates innumerable others. 
    And then later on, after providing how their budget shall be handled and how their budget should be approved by the President and he may modify and amend, has been cut down. 
    It then provides for mix ownership Government corporations. 
    Section 856 says, it's used in this chapter the term mixed ownership Government corporations means, one, the central bank for cooperatives and the regional banks for cooperatives. 
    Two, Federal Land Banks. 
    Three, Federal Home Loan Banks and four, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporations, Now, the -- the methods of auditing are very different. 
    So, there's -- there's a clean cut distinction which Congress has made between the two. 
    Now, we're not contending that the hybrid corporation is covered of frauds on them or covered by the False Claims Act here, but we are claiming that the wholly owned Government corporation is an integral part of the United States.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="3263.435" stopTime="3268.224">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Would a 51% Government owned corporation be covered it on -- covered on your theory?

    Mr. George Cochran Doub 
    No.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="3269.137" stopTime="3269.939">

    It would not.

    No, it would not, sir
speaker="charles_e_whittaker" startTime="3271.065" stopTime="3279.685">
    Justice Charles E. Whittaker 
    And your theory, a 99% Government owned corporations would not be covered, it has to be wholly owned?
speaker="george_cochran_doub" startTime="3279.685" stopTime="3333.447">
    Mr. George Cochran Doub 
    It has to be wholly owned. 
    It has to be an integral part of the Government of the United States. 
    And when you reduce it down to that point, you reach the point where there is nothing left of a wholly owned Government corporation except the name because you've already just pierced the corporate veil, you've already destroyed the -- the major legal incidents of -- of legal status and legal entity. 
    Mr. Justice Frankfurter asked me yesterday, when the False Claims Act was -- the statutes were first codified. 
    I find it, sir in -- it was in the 1934 code. 
    And the first edition of the code in 1926 carries the statute separately.

    Now, when 1934 came along, have we got anything comparable to the annotations of 18 and 28, or 30 or -- that is the -- the present one was it -- was that in Title 31 then, Mr. Doub?

    Mr. George Cochran Doub 
    I think so. 
    I'm not sure though, sir. 
    I would like to point this out that -- that the certain titles of the code like 18 and 28 which by act of Congress became a positive law, that -- that wouldn't apply to Title 31.
