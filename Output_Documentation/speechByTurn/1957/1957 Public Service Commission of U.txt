    Number 15, Public Service Commission of Utah and Utah Citizens Rate Association, Appellants, versus United States of America and Interstate Commerce Commission. 
    Mr. Rampton.
speaker="calvin_l_rampton" startTime="27.968" stopTime="320.625">
    Mr. Calvin L. Rampton 
    If the Court please. 
    This is an appeal from a three-judge court in the District of Utah. 
    The action was brought by the appellants here, the plaintiff below, for the purpose of setting aside an order of the Interstate Commerce Commission taking jurisdiction of and raising Utah intrastate railroad freight rates under the provisions of Section 13 (4) of the Interstate Commerce Commission. 
    The decision below was a 2-to-1 decision. 
    The majority report was concurred in by Circuit Judge Pickett and Judge Ritter and a minority opinion written by Judge Christensen. 
    The opinions are -- appear in the record. 
    The manner in which this case arose is as follows. 
    In 1951 or shortly before that date, the railroads, class one railroads of the United States made application to the Interstate Commerce Commission for an increase in substantially all interstate rail freight rates. 
    The first hearing on this application which was given the Number Ex Parte 175, and by which I will refer to the proceedings hereafter, all railroads in the United States were granted permission to increase their freight rates by 2% with certain hold-down which are not material here. 
    At a subsequent hearing, the eastern roads were permitted to take an additional 7% and the western and southern roads an additional 4%. 
    And there's still a third here on hearing under Ex Parte 175. 
    The eastern roads were permitted to take an additional 6% and the western and southern roads an additional 9% so that all told under Ex Parte 175, the interstate rate -- freight rates of all the railroads with, as I said, certain hold-downs which are not material here were increased by 15%. 
    Shortly after the original application was made with the public or with the Interstate Commerce Commission, the class one railways which operated within and through the State of Utah, made application to the Public Service Commission of Utah for authority to increase their intrastate rates by the same percentages being sought in the Interstate Commerce Commission on interstate rates. 
    The time of the first increase before the I.C.C., a hearing was held for the Utah Commission. 
    The conclusion of this hearing, the Utah Commission ruled, the railroads have not introduced evidence sufficient to authorize the increase of the intrastate rates. 
    The time of the second order in the Ex Parte 175, a further petition was filed with the Utah Commission but no hearing was ever had on that. 
    And then at the time of the final order, in Ex Parte 175 on the -- that had build up to 15%, a third petition was filed by the Utah Commission with this class one railways and a full hearing was held thereon and at the conclusion of the hearing, the Utah Commission ruled that the petitioning railroads have not introduced evidence sufficient to authorize the increase of the Utah intrastate rates and held that the application was denied subject to the right of the railroad to make a petition to reopen to introduce the additional evidence if they could do it. 
    The railroads did not make further application to the Utah Commission nor did they take any appeal in the Utah courts, rather they made application to the Interstate Commerce Commission under the provisions of Section 13 to have the Interstate Commerce Commission take jurisdiction of this Utah rates and raise them. 
    The Interstate Commerce Commission proceeded with a hearing of the Utah intrastate rates. 
    And at the conclusion of that hearing, issued the report and order which appears evidence in the court below in which they held that the requisite jurisdictional facts had been established to authorize the Interstate Commerce Commission to take jurisdiction of the Utah rates. 
    They did take jurisdiction of the Utah intrastate rail rates and ordered them increased by 15% with certain restricted hold-down which again are not material here.

    Mr. Calvin L. Rampton 
    I'm not sure, Your Honor. 
    The case was heard by an examiner and tried to visualize the -- I argued the case but I can't recall whether one of our Commissioners sat at the time the Section 13 case was held. 
    On the opinion, he did not. 
    An action was brought --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="343.594" stopTime="345.740">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    He must have been notified of course?

    They appeared as a party. 
    The Commission appeared as a party
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="347.954" stopTime="348.980">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    A party but --
speaker="calvin_l_rampton" startTime="348.980" stopTime="352.381">
    Mr. Calvin L. Rampton 
    Yes, but not -- it wasn't in a joint board hearing --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="352.381" stopTime="352.531">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    It's not.
speaker="calvin_l_rampton" startTime="352.531" stopTime="526.681">
    Mr. Calvin L. Rampton 
    -- if that's what Your Honor want to know. 
    No, it was not. 
    This action as I've stated then -- was then brought in the three-judge court to set aside this order. 
    A preliminary injunction was entered holding the rates out of effect while the matter was considered and this stayed in effect until a matter was decided on its merits and as I've stated by two to one decision, the action if the Interstate Commerce Commission was upheld by the Utah three-judge court. 
    Now, we are not here of course protesting the power of the Interstate Commerce Commission to take jurisdiction of intrastate rates in a proper case. 
    We recognized the necessity where interstate and intrastate service is rendered by a common economic unit that somebody must have overall control to determine that too much of the burden is not shifted one way or the other and even before the Section 13 was adopted, this Court have already decided that that power existed inherently in the Interstate Commerce Commission. 
    That was in the Houston case. 
    The interstate -- the Section 13 was merely a codification of the Houston case and it decided or it establishes that the Interstate Commerce Commission can take jurisdiction of purely intrastate rates only if one of two conditions exists. 
    The first condition is, if the intrastate rates are so low that they make a discrimination between persons shipping on -- in interstate commerce on the one hand and intrastate commerce on the other. 
    Now, with regard to that first ground of jurisdiction, the Interstate Commerce Commission decided that the railroads did not establish that ground of jurisdiction in this case and so we need to concern ourselves no further here with the first ground of jurisdiction under the 13th Section. 
    The second ground of jurisdiction under which the railroad or the I.C.C.may take jurisdiction of intrastate rates is this, if the rates are so low that they cast a burden on interstate commerce. 
    In other words, if the intrastate revenue -- net revenue that is the amount of railroads can keep after paying the expenses is so low that it does not pay the railroads return on that portion of the capital, devolves the intrastate commerce and therefore that an extra financial burden must be placed on interstate commerce then the Interstate Commerce Commission in that situation may take jurisdiction of intrastate rates and raise them.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="526.681" stopTime="534.921">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    That was not codification. 
    That was new -- that was new legislation. 
    That was not -- it could not have done that under the Shreveport doctrine.
speaker="calvin_l_rampton" startTime="534.921" stopTime="537.564">
    Mr. Calvin L. Rampton 
    That may well be, Your Honor. 
    At the present time --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="537.564" stopTime="537.582">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Yes.
speaker="calvin_l_rampton" startTime="537.582" stopTime="549.892">
    Mr. Calvin L. Rampton 
    -- because that is under the Section 13. 
    That is the basis upon which the I.C.C.took jurisdiction in this case. 
    They held that the evidence did establish that the Utah intrastate rates were so low that they did cast a burden upon --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="549.892" stopTime="573.934">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    But it makes an important distinction Mr. Rampton because under the Shreveport doctrine, it was merely -- Interstate Commerce Commission has power to find specific discrimination against a specific rate or commodity by virtue of the state rate. 
    In other words, the area of jurisdiction was ever so much more restricted. 
    This has nothing to do with your case (Voice Overlap)
speaker="calvin_l_rampton" startTime="573.934" stopTime="575.382">
    Mr. Calvin L. Rampton 
    That is right.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="575.382" stopTime="576.947">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    But this is a very different thing.
speaker="calvin_l_rampton" startTime="576.947" stopTime="612.598">
    Mr. Calvin L. Rampton 
    I appreciate that, Your Honor. 
    We're concerned here with the overall earnings and not with any specific rate that is being considered. 
    Now, furthermore, we're not here attacking the findings of the Interstate Commerce Commission in this case. 
    We'll agree that the findings of the Interstate Commerce Commission in this case meet the requirements that this Court laid down in the recent King case. 
    In fact, they were copied verbatim from the King case as merely as I can determine with merely a change in the word here and I make the Florida case fit the Utah situation.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="612.598" stopTime="613.764">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    You mean the ultimate finding?
speaker="calvin_l_rampton" startTime="613.764" stopTime="614.391">
    Mr. Calvin L. Rampton 
    What's that?
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="614.391" stopTime="615.637">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    You mean the ultimate finding?
speaker="calvin_l_rampton" startTime="615.637" stopTime="663.796">
    Mr. Calvin L. Rampton 
    The ultimate findings. 
    Yes, Your Honor. 
    The ultimate findings I should say subsidiary findings we do quarrel with, but the ultimate findings, we do not. 
    They meet -- they meet the demand of the King case.But we do say that there is not sufficient evidence under the King case, even under the King case to find in this situation that the Utah intrastate rates are as low as to cast a burden on interstate commerce. 
    Now, obviously, the most practical and direct way if you could do it, I think they can but the railroad said they can't. 
    In the King's case said they don't have to, to show what your intrastate rates were returning, whether it would be breakdown revenues, cost, and make an allocation of your equipment and work up an intrastate rate of return.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="663.796" stopTime="672.533">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Would it -- would it trouble you, your argument -- the order of your argument if you tell us now what specific findings you challenge?
speaker="calvin_l_rampton" startTime="672.533" stopTime="679.601">
    Mr. Calvin L. Rampton 
    Yes. 
    We challenge the findings -- I'll try to give it verbatim. 
    I may not be able to.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="679.601" stopTime="681.016">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Don't -- just indicate what kind of issues were --
speaker="calvin_l_rampton" startTime="681.016" stopTime="707.908">
    Mr. Calvin L. Rampton 
    The findings that conditions affecting the transportation of Utah freight intrastate are not more favorable than those affecting interstate traffic. 
    With -- from the points in Utah to points beyond Utah, that is the specific finding that we attack and we say that is the thing which they didn't prove even under the formula which is laid down in the King case. 
    Now under the King case --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="707.908" stopTime="717.973">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    You -- you challenge -- you say there's no support for that, if there were support for that, would the conclusion of the Commission flow from that finding?
speaker="calvin_l_rampton" startTime="717.973" stopTime="719.121">
    Mr. Calvin L. Rampton 
    Yes, under the doctrine in the King case.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="719.121" stopTime="729.614">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Yes. 
    So that we -- so that you invite us, indeed we have to go to the record to find out what the Commission could on this record have reached that -- made that finding, is that right?
speaker="calvin_l_rampton" startTime="729.614" stopTime="733.596">
    Mr. Calvin L. Rampton 
    That is right. 
    That's -- that's the whole -- that's the whole case we have, Your Honor.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="733.596" stopTime="735.413">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    That's the case.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="735.413" stopTime="760.948">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Well now, may I ask in that same connection. 
    I'm looking at page 118 and 119 of the record. 
    By numbers, which of those findings are involved under your position?
speaker="calvin_l_rampton" startTime="760.948" stopTime="878.871">
    Mr. Calvin L. Rampton 
    Well, all of them would be involved in directly but the one that is involved directly at the moment would be number one. 
    The one we attack directly, we say their balance of them falls along one if one falls, that's at the top of page 118. 
    And that finding of course, number one finding on page 118, that's -- that's something you got to have under the King case and you've got to have it supported under the King case because the King case rest upon just exactly that finding there. 
    The King case, as I read it, and also the Illinois Commerce case which it quotes, is merely a syllogistic reasoning, it says this in effect, “You're relieved to breaking down your revenues, your expenses and your investment between intrastate and interstate, if you can meet this test. 
    And it's a test -- it is a syllogism in fact”. 
    The King case based upon a syllogism is this. 
    Your major premise is the railroads are in need of a general overall increase in their railroad rates. 
    Your minor premise is this, “All factors which affect the reasonableness of rates are identical or reasonably similar as to both intrastate and interstate commerce. 
    Therefore, you should have an increase in intrastate rates”. 
    Now, if either your major or minor premise breaks down of course your conclusion doesnt follow. 
    And we say that in this case, the finding number one being the minor premise in that syllogism has broken down and so that the conclusion, that Utah intrastate rate is abnormally low doesn't follow.

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Well now your -- your minor premise is all factors.

    Mr. Calvin L. Rampton 
    Oh I -- I assume so. 
    But all material factors affecting the thing we think must be shown -- if you're going to rely on the King case, must be shown to be not more favorable in favor of intrastate commerce and they aren't. 
    They have interstate commerce.

    Mr. Calvin L. Rampton 
    I believe the King case is an exercise in formal logic, Your Honor. 
    In other words, you -- you are -- all you've got in regard to the -- to the earnings of the railroad or your overall earnings, they say they can't break them down. 
    They say they can't break their earnings out or maybe they could break their earnings out but they couldn't break their cost and their investments on intrastate. 
    And so, we're dealing with overall figures of the railroad --

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Yes.
speaker="calvin_l_rampton" startTime="979.112" stopTime="1008.756">
    Mr. Calvin L. Rampton 
    -- with both intrastate and interstate lumped in there. 
    All right now, I will agree and I'm not calling with the fact that they did a good job in this case of establishing a need for overall revenue about 80% of their evidence goes to that point and they've established that they need some additional money. 
    All right, now the question is, where does it got -- come from it? 
    It doesn't prove a thing merely to prove you need additional money. 
    That doesn't prove that the intrastate rates aren't contributing their share, if we just go that far.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1008.756" stopTime="1009.425">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    All right.
speaker="calvin_l_rampton" startTime="1009.425" stopTime="1029.839">
    Mr. Calvin L. Rampton 
    All right, now we come to the second step which I say is the minor premise in syllogism which is this. 
    They must show that all of material factors affecting the two classes of traffic are the same and if they can establish that, then under the King case it follows that both intrastate and interstate rates should move out.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter

speaker="calvin_l_rampton" startTime="1051.278" stopTime="1314.586">
    Mr. Calvin L. Rampton 
    Well I -- I quite agree with that, Your Honor. 
    But, I feel that -- and I might say that I had one for the judge's below that felt along with me that this matter of density of traffic was a major factor that not all -- now, we felt the burden of proof on that belong to them. 
    We should felt that they should show that all major factors are the same. 
    They didn't put a word in on density of traffic then we picked up the ball when we don't think we have to carry it and we showed that there was a great deal of difference in density of traffic only to have the Interstate Commerce Commission rather dismiss our figures. 
    Now, I'll come to that a little more fully in just a moment if I may. 
    On the question of the level of the rates themselves and of course that's the first thing you've got to consider is which now is higher for a comparable service, the intrastate or interstate rates. 
    There was a -- there was evidence on both sides there and we're not asking this Court to weigh that evidence at this time. 
    We feel that the evidence heavenly preponderates in favor of the -- of our position that the intrastate rates from Utah were already considerably higher for a comparable service without the 15% increase in the interstate rates or before they got. 
    But once again I say there was evidence on both sides of that and we're not here asking the Supreme Court to weigh the evidence that was before the Interstate Commerce Commission of the court below. 
    But now, going to the other side of the picture, and you've got to go to both sides of the picture in determining the thing. 
    That is the question of cost in rendering the service because we're not worried of gross revenues here as Mr. Collins so well points out in his brief. 
    What we're worrying about is how much the railroads have left over to spend. 
    So you've got to go to the other side of the thing and look at the cost factor. 
    What do we have in the way of identity of factors that affect the cost of rendering railroad service intrastate and interstate? 
    Now, the railroads introduced one bit of evidence on that point, a one bit of evidence only and if that evidence is sufficient, I suppose, I have no standing before this Court. 
    If it's not, I should prevail. 
    The evidence that they introduced and they didn't have to introduce it at all because this Court has taken the judicial notice of it several times and so as the Commission. 
    The evidence they introduced is the identity of cost factors was the fact that intrastate and interstate shipments are commonly mingled on the same cars, handled over the same rails to the same station to the same billing crews and so forth. 
    Now, I -- it's our position that while that does establish that many of these factors are similar, it does ignore entirely the question of density of traffic which we feel that one of the major items which go to make up the revenue cost of rendering the service of the railroad. 
    And I think the reason that the density of traffic is a major factor affecting cost is quite obvious. 
    You can break railroad cost or any transportation cost or I suppose the cost of doing business in any business down roughly into two categories. 
    That is your fixed cost and your variable cost. 
    Your fixed cost stays just about the same regardless of how much you produce. 
    Your variable cost tends to vary almost exactly with your output. 
    And generally, your output on the railroad is raised in terms of ton miles. 
    So your fix cost saying the same regardless of your output of ton miles will bear heavier on each ton mile as your density decreases. 
    And as your density goes up, your fixed cost staying the same will be scattered out and spread over a greater number of ton miles and so the greater the density, the lower the cost of producing each ton mile.

    Mr. Calvin L. Rampton 
    It's Exhibit 64 on page 548 which shows the density of traffic intrastate or system-wide on the various railroads concerned for the years 1950 to 1953 and the density of traffic intrastate within the State of Utah. 
    And if you will examine that, you will see that in every year for each of the four railroads and these railroads makeup all 95% to 98% of the traffic that we're concerned with here. 
    In each of those years, on each of those four railroads, the density was materially higher within the State of Utah than it was system-wide. 
    Now, this is true. 
    I don't want to mislead the Court on that.

    Justice William O. Douglas 
    Main-line, isn't it?

    Mr. Calvin L. Rampton 
    This is main-line.

    Not first line?
speaker="calvin_l_rampton" startTime="1511.341" stopTime="1614.798">
    Mr. Calvin L. Rampton 
    No. 
    That's the ground that the Interstate Commerce Commission attack it on. 
    There's another ground that the counsel for the Government is attacked on in his brief. 
    And I'd like to mention both of those, the counsel for the Government attacks on the ground that what we call intrastate statistics are not purely intrastate. 
    They do include bridge traffic but of course the bridge traffic goes clear across. 
    We have no way of breaking it out. 
    But the fact that -- but bridge traffic would be constant system-wide and the fact that there was a difference within the State of Utah, the density much higher there than system-wide with the bridge traffic remaining constant could be a tribute and only to the fact that Utah intrastate traffic was considerably higher than the intrastate traffic in the other States. 
    Do I make myself clear? Now, the problem that the I.C.C.raises to this study is this. 
    They say, “Well the problem of that study is they practically pushed it out of consideration was that its density of traffic for main-line rack only and not for main-line plus branch.” 
    Well that's true but for the life of me, I can't see what difference it makes, if we use branch -- included branch on one side and only main-line on the other, obviously, it would be a false comparison. 
    But if we have main and branch system-wide as well as intrastate while it would change the density figures, it wouldn't change their relative position. 
    In other words, both of them would move up or move down. 
    And I believe that the main-line study --
speaker="william_o_douglas" startTime="1614.798" stopTime="1619.966">
    Justice William O. Douglas 
    (Inaudible) systems do not include branch.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Well, now -- let me ask you a simple-minded question that's maybe has no bearing. 
    This plot, statistical comparisons leave out of all account as I've seen them. 
    The difference is in cost. 
    In other words, you may have less density over interstate -- I mean interstate shipment and yet the burden on the road because of the great -- greatness and whatnot, tunneling and so on, may have relevance it so seems to me that would not be reflected by these figures.

    But I think the railroads are attempting to unduly simplify them. 
    I believe what the railroads are doing in this case, not only in the State of Utah, but throughout the nation in 175 -- it is 175, they're attempting to push the King case to a length that this Commission never intended it to go. 
    I might say that I don't agree with the King case but there is --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1797.631" stopTime="1799.186">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    We'll start from there.
speaker="calvin_l_rampton" startTime="1799.186" stopTime="1908.004">
    Mr. Calvin L. Rampton 
    We'll start from the King case and what it is and they're attempting to prove -- to push it to lengths that this Commission never intended it to go so that it forces absolute, automatic uniformity in a rate, every time you get a rate increase. 
    And if what -- if they can prove the case before the I.C.C.by the evidence they've got in here then there's no need for a Section 13 hearing. 
    There's no need for a Public Service Commission hearing because every time the -- the Interstate Commerce Commission says, “The railroads are entitled to additional revenues overall then by the mere application that this matter of common knowledge that you intermingle your freight, then automatically that increase should go on to intrastate freight as well as interstate. 
    And so, all of your -- all of your problem before your State Commission and your Section 13 case is a mere surplus because they can only come out one way in the end anyway. 
    Now, that's -- that appears to be Mr. Collins' position. 
    Now, the Government doesn't go quite far in their brief. 
    They don't say that the King case forces you definitely to that position but they say the fact that you intermingle your freight, raises a strong presumption that all factors are the same and to quote the Government's brief, they say it is possible although not probable that notwithstanding identity in the character of interstate in interstate operations therein may exist certain circumstances. 
    In other words, they say once we have proved this matter of common knowledge and to intermingle them, then the burden of proof approve is on the -- the opponents of an increase and to show that the factors are different.

    Now, we could have done it like the Interstate Commerce Commission said, we could have taken your total ton miles and divided it by your branch line plus your main-line. 
    If you did, it would have given a somewhat lower density figure because you'd be taking the same ton miles in using more miles of track to divide it by. 
    But it would -- we say it wouldn't have changed the relative position between your intrastate statistics and your system statistics because lower them both and substantially the same proportion.

    Do you know of any interstate commerce determine -- commission determination which rejected this factor in the 13 case?
speaker="calvin_l_rampton" startTime="2234.585" stopTime="2375.677">
    Mr. Calvin L. Rampton 
    Other in this one, I do not. 
    We introduced some other evidence which I just -- my time is almost up. 
    I want to leave some for -- for rebuttal. 
    There was other evidence which we introduced that we didn't think we had to which tends to show that the railroads are a lot better-off under Utah intrastate traffic than they are elsewhere. 
    For instance, Bamberger Railroad Company, the only one -- the only general commodity carrier that was making application that operates entirely within the State of Utah in the year preceding this hearing, showed a rate of return of some 15.93%. 
    In addition to that from the railroad's own figures, you can glean these facts that Bamberger, as I say, solely within the State, showed a rate of return of 15.3%. 
    Denver and Rio Grande which is about half in the State of Utah and half in the State of Colorado showed a 6.06% rate of return. 
    The Union Pacific which has some in Utah although a much smaller percentage showed 3.56% returns while the Denver or the Southern Pacific that pass just a minute fraction of its business in the State of Utah showed only a 3.48% rate of return. 
    In other words, on these roads, that -- from their own evidence as the percentage of the railroad business in Utah intrastate traffic tends to increase the rate of return of those roads tends to increase right along with. 
    Now, we say there -- ones again you can determine the reason for that from the economic studies that have been put in here. 
    Now, they put in economic studies in this case for the purpose of showing, I think, that Utah could stand the increase. 
    We say it doesn't mean anything from there because that isn't a basis for a jurisdiction under the 13th Section. 
    In other words, if the I.C.C.have general jurisdiction, they may say, “We'll put the burden on the high moving traffic” but they can't say to Utah shippers, we know you're paying your share now but can afford to pay more so we'll take jurisdiction under the 13th Section.

    Mr. Calvin L. Rampton 
    No. 
    My answer to that is no, Your Honor. 
    If they -- if -- if they want to -- If the railroads want to address that kind of logic, the place they've got to go is to the Commission that holds primary jurisdiction of intrastate rates. 
    That is to the various state commissions. 
    If they could go to various state commissions and say, the intrastate -- the interstate rates can't bear their full burden, therefore, unless your men take up to some of the burden they can't bear, you're going to lose your rail service.

    Mr. Calvin L. Rampton

    I think, under the Section 13, the I.C.C.may take jurisdiction only when the interstate rates are contributing their fair share on the intrastate rates that they're going after are not contributing their fair share. 
    I don't see how you can read anything else into Section 13 or into the decisions of this Court, interpreting Section 13 other than that. 
    I know that you have held and I think quite properly, that 15 (a) should be read in connection with 13 (4). 
    But I don't think it expands the power of the Commission under 13 (4), when you got a jurisdictional question involved. 
    Once you get over the jurisdictional question, I think, then perhaps 15 (a) does come in to operation, but until you get to jurisdictional requirements, I think you've got to look at 13 (4) further.

   Argument of Charles H. Weston

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Weston.
speaker="charles_h_weston" startTime="2730.871" stopTime="2874.773">
    Mr. Charles H. Weston 
    If the Court please. 
    As it has been said, this case grew out of the 15% increase in interstate rates, which the Interstate Commerce Commission authorized in its 175 proceeding. 
    And this was the fourth general increase, rate increase given by the Commission since World War IV. 
    This rate increases have not been granted previously, they have been granted because of the constantly or gradually at least, rising price cost of operation. 
    As operating cost go up, revenue has to also otherwise that the weak roads will suffer deficits and they go into receivership. 
    And the stronger roads will have difficulty in financing, capital improvements, purchase of new equipment which is necessary or desirable to increase efficiency and improve service. 
    Now, this clear statutory authority for the Commission's action in granting this across the board rate increases. 
    Section 15 (a), which was written into to the Act in 1920, they did the duty of the Commission in determining or prescribing just and reasonable rate to give consideration to the need of the carriers for revenues sufficient to enable them to provide adequate and efficient transportation service. 
    In effect, Congress recognized that it's in the public interest to preserve the economic health of the railroad industry. 
    This new statutory provision was prompted by the par less condition, credit and income conditions of the railroads, following termination of war time federal control. 
    Now, the results of the railroad operation or both -- those of its intrastate and its interstate operations, it was therefore appropriate for Congress when it --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2874.773" stopTime="2877.354">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    What was that you said about both interstate? 
    I just thought --
speaker="charles_h_weston" startTime="2877.354" stopTime="3041.835">
    Mr. Charles H. Weston 
    I say it's -- well if the revenue needs or determined by its entire operations which are naturally both intrastate and interstate and when Congress gave the condition prior to adjust interstate rates in relation to revenue requirements. 
    It was appropriate to give it some control over interstate rates so that the additional revenue derived from higher rates would not come exclusively from interstate commerce. 
    And Congress, when it enacted 15 (a) also enacted subsection (4) of Section 13. 
    And that Section directs the Commission if it finds that existing intrastate rates aren't justly discriminate against interstate commerce to order those rates to remove the discrimination. 
    But with constant Railroad Commission case in 257 U.S., this was the first case under this Section to come before this Court. 
    The Court said that there was dovetail relation between 13 (4) and the present 13 (a). 
    And that there must be equality between the intrastate rate level and the interstate rate level if interstate commerce was to bear its fair proportionate share of the carriers total revenue affirmance. 
    There has been no departure from the meaning that was given by the Court in that first decision, to Section 13 (4). 
    Now, I also going to point out that the Court has consistently refused to construe either 13 (4) or 15 (a) as imposing requirements which would defeat the statutory purpose. 
    When revenue and expense were out of balance, a long lay in correcting the imbalance is certainly tends to defeat the statutory purpose. 
    And this Court has held that when the Commission is acting under these Sections, it is not to be held to requirements of proof that are so exacting, that they would make the administrative test practically impossible and would paralyze the administrative order of the Commission and thereby prevent the prompt administrative action which these Sections contemplate.

    Mr. Weston, could we agree as a starting point that the Commission could not in looking at the needs of the road and finding it needs more money and raise without more -- without more to raise the rates both of intrastate and interstate. 
    Was the same considerations or on merely on the same basis or under basis of the same data by which it raises the interstate rates, 7%, 9% whatever you wish, could we agree on that?

    In addition, it has to be fair that the rates has raised will be reasonable rates. 
    And that the increase in the intrastate rate will in fact add to the railroads income. 
    It's frequently -- the issue is frequently raised in these cases that if rates were raised, the traffic will be lost and there would be no income return and sometimes the Commission recognizes that and therefore, it does not increase rates, other times it thinks that that is not the correct conclusion and that does present an issue that has to be passed upon.

    The traffic which is -- with which we're concerned in the 13 (4) proceeding.

    Mr. Weston, could I ask you this in order to make this case more concrete at least for me. 
    Would you mind stating, forgetting all about law for the moment. 
    Would you mind stating, what there was before the Commission that justified its conclusion that Utah traffic wasn't bearing its fair share in the sum total of the cost of maintaining this system, isn't that the real question?

    Mr. Charles H. Weston 
    Well, let me devote myself to the question of the evidence relating to similarity in operating conditions. 
    Officers of the Union Pacific, in the Denver and Rio Grande and those are the two roads that carry most of the Utah traffic. 
    Testified that in Utah, intrastate and interstate traffic were carried in the same trains, same cars were handled by the same men in every respect in the same manner. 
    And that in effect, in actual operation, interstate and intrastate commerce were inextricably intermingled. 
    Now, where you have one transportation system serving in part interstate commerce, in part intrastate commerce. 
    That would seem to me the strongest possible kind of evidence that the operating conditions of the two are the same.

    Mr. Charles H. Weston 
    Could I -- wait just a minute. 
    I will come to that, yes. 
    Now, I don't think that the fact that, you might say the universality of the facts to which the witnesses testified, destroys this testimony, it would seem to me to strengthen it. 
    It doesn't lose its probity force because what is true in Utah is true in other places. 
    Now, the appellants did attempt to show or introduce evidence to overcome this proof that was before the Commission.

    Mr. Charles H. Weston 
    Yes. 
    Of course, it would in -- in freight collected from the -- from transporting that number but the question would be whether they should pay at a higher rate.

    Mr. Weston, your argument leaves me a little doubt. 
    I understand you to say that in all cases, you have that special identity of operation. 
    Suppose they operate the same kind of car, place the same kind of wage in it, and therefore since there is an identity of operation is automatically followed that the Commission had a right to equalize the rate. 
    Now, if that's the case, why isn't that true all over the country with reference to every railroad?

    And why didn't -- why isn't that urging if that that they have the power to say that despite Congress' definition there that they can show identity of operation by showing what everybody knows the average kind of train with the same kind of employees is entitled to equalized rate.
speaker="charles_h_weston" startTime="4038.724" stopTime="4040.478">
    Mr. Charles H. Weston 
    I think that --

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Maybe that's right. 
    But I'm -- I'm just wondering how you -- well the way you define identity of rates, it sound -- operation, it sounds that's what you mean.
speaker="charles_h_weston" startTime="4047.972" stopTime="4085.923">
    Mr. Charles H. Weston 
    That's -- that's absence in showing they would take it out of that general proposition. 
    Now, such proposition -- such situations you gave earlier. 
    Let me say, supposing there was a branch line running from the mine to main consuming center. 
    The traffic movement was by trains, train movement regular and substantial from a showing like that that would, in my opinion, justify a lower intrastate rate for that branch line traffic then for corresponding interstate traffic.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="4085.923" stopTime="4095.048">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Well, should the Commission show that is the burden on them or is the burden on the other end to show that there are special lines of that kind in such a state.
speaker="charles_h_weston" startTime="4095.048" stopTime="4106.707">
    Mr. Charles H. Weston 
    I think that because of the identity in the manner of handling and which I think grows out of the fact that we have one way over the systems.

    Mr. Charles H. Weston 
    Well, that is the case really where the burden lies. 
    I think that when you establish that identity and it might not always be true then I think the burden does shift.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="4122.433" stopTime="4165.125">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    But isn't that just the same fact by saying that what we are faced with here is there are two sections. 
    One of them says you've got to consider all national railroads. 
    There's not any doubt about that. 
    This Court recognizes time and time again that another one gives power to change the intrastate rates if they're unjust and discriminatory. 
    But if -- if all you have to show there is that operations are alike because they're always are, except maybe in special isolated instances (Inaudible). 
    Now, it doesn't -- doesn't your argument leave to the conclusion that the Commission has a right to do this automatically because the train is over a line?

    Mr. Charles H. Weston 
    It maybe various things that might be shown that for example in raising the interstate rates would not increase revenue.

    In other words --

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Well, I guess that would be a little difficult to show when you get a 15% raise of freight.

    I think that when you consider that, you have to consider the fact of what the Utah Commission did. 
    In nearly all prior 13 (4) proceeding which at least those which have come before the courts, the State Regulatory Commission has authorized an increase transferring to interstate increase except as to particular commodities. 
    Now, here the Utah Commission just didn't allow it on anything and the 13 (4) proceeding then involved all commodities.

    Mr. Charles H. Weston 
    I think that where you show differences, it should be shown with reference to what is intrastate as distinguished from interstate rather than just on what moves within the State is distinguished from what moves somewhere else. 
    Now, the -- it has been mentioned that this -- this density figures were based solely on main-line traffic. 
    It's perfectly true that branch line traffic was excluded in both sides. 
    That is on the system-wide figures and the state figure. 
    But without the total trackage certainly, the figures are uncertain as to whether they really reflect operations. 
    But I think a more important consideration is that, what is called interstate density represents all movements within the State of Utah. 
    It includes the Utah league of shipments which start in Utah going to an out of state destination. 
    The Utah league of shipments coming in the Utah from outside the State and the movement through Utah what is called bridge traffic which goes across the State and doesn't have either an origin of destination in Utah.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Yes. 
    I understand that but I -- I like to put it my way not out of vanity but because it lies at in my head. 
    When I say intrastate as against interstate, I mean traffic that begins in the State and ends in that same State.

    Mr. Charles H. Weston

    No. 
    That is not what is covered by intrastate on this exhibit.

speaker="charles_h_weston" startTime="4745.997" stopTime="4835.238">
    Mr. Charles H. Weston 
    I think that that is the real explanation for that extraordinary difference is to the Southern Pacific in the density figures which you know that when you question Mr. Rampton. 
    Now, there's one other thing on density, it does not necessarily mean lower operating cost, is the number ton miles transported per mile of track. 
    Now, take a case where -- where two trains, each of 50 cars operating within a giving time over a certain track and at the same time over another track, one train of 75 cars. 
    The first track would have greater density, track density -- traffic density, there would be hundred cars in the same time as there were 75 cars in the other line but would have higher operating cost because it would be two train movements instead one. 
    Now, the same point that I've made, the same basis for computing the intrastate density figures was the basis for computing the so-called interstate operating ratios. 
    They also include the Utah leg of every movement coming or passing through the State or going out of it.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="4835.238" stopTime="4893.088">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Well, but Mr. Weston as I understood Mr. Rampton, he isn't offering this to prove any beyond that indicates that there was a reason for a railroad to the law of any factor which was not develop and which the Commission didn't require them to develop. 
    And as I understand you now all that you feel that is required within the definition of operating condition is that to use the same tracks, the same train crews, the same billing methods and same billing procedure, if you established that and at the same -- those procedures apply both to intrastate and interstate, thereby, there is a established in identity operating conditions from which in the absence of anything from the State Commission in our position, there must follow an increase to the interstate level of the intrastate rate. 
    Is that right?

speaker="charles_h_weston" startTime="4932.366" stopTime="4940.298">
    Mr. Charles H. Weston 
    That at least is the initial step and when that has been taken then I think the burden the proof shifts.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="4940.298" stopTime="4966.576">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Well now, supposed that all appeared in this whole case were the statements of the two officers which you referred us to, in which they said and they could say it in five minutes, we used the same crews, the same rails, the same cars, the same tracks. 
    No cross examination when they sat down. 
    On the basis of that evidence, could the Commission have increased these rates up to the level of the interstate rate?
speaker="charles_h_weston" startTime="4966.576" stopTime="4980.567">
    Mr. Charles H. Weston 
    No, it would have to show that -- for one thing, it would have to show that in fact the increase would bring a return an income and additional revenue and it would have to --

    Mr. Charles H. Weston 
    I -- I think that there may be many circumstances in which there would be special operating conditions. 
    I think that it probably could have been established here in -- what I see in the evidence, a case could have been made as particular traffic for a lower intrastate rate than for interstate.

    Do you contend that this testimony that the railroad officials gave to the effect that -- that the traffic, intrastate and interstate, both went over the same lines and the same trains meant that there were no such conditions as Justice Frankfurter mentioned. 
    Namely, that on some -- on some branch lines that there might be transportation of cattle only on -- on a branch line to the main lines and so forth maybe -- maybe minerals carried that way.

    Mr. Elmer B. Collins 
    May it please the Court. 
    I would like to say first to this Court that this case follows a pattern that has been followed since this Court decided the Wisconsin Commission case on February 27th, 1922. 
    The first case decided after the Interstate Commerce Commission or rather after it declared the 13th Section powers and exercise them in that case. 
    No two cases are identical. 
    There'll be variations between this one today and another one tomorrow. 
    This Court in that case sustained the constitutionality of the grant of power and rejected the contention that the federal government was encroaching upon the States and laid down the law to be that whatever encroachment there might be, I mean it was not an unconstitutional encroachment and that whatever encroachment there were was in -- was essential to the maintenance of an adequate national railroad system. 
    Now, from that day until this, this Court has upheld and ordered the Interstate Commerce Commission which followed that pattern. 
    I'm constrained to suggest these things to you because the State of Utah, in an effort to try to frustrate the Commission's powers under Section 13 of the Act is resorted to all sorts of free arguments like this density of traffic thing and we -- they're much pleased with themselves to try to break up the pattern that this Court has followed for 35 years within -- within the last few months or certainly since your decision in the King case, the Florida case. 
    This Court has adopted or has -- I'm not sure over the mechanics of it, granted motions to affirm decisions of three-judge lower courts which decisions sustain or is of the Interstate Commerce Commission in the Louisiana Public Service case, the North Carolina Commission case, the Arkansas Commission case. 
    Now all those three had been affirmed by this Court without listening to argument, without taking them for argument, without citing a single decision as the Court in way back when I was young did cite some decisions in a per curiam affirmance. 
    Now --

    Mr. Elmer B. Collins 
    In this case, I was sorry to notice so many questions from the bench employing the use of the term burden of proof. 
    In this case, the railroads petition the Interstate Commerce Commission to please conduct an investigation into the question whether or not the Utah intrastate rates do as claimed by the railroads, discriminate against interstate commerce. 
    Then the Commission sets a hearing, the railroads come in and submit what they think is proof of the discrimination by the intrastate rates against interstate commerce. 
    And the in this case as in all the previous ones they showed.I might interrupt myself Mr. Justice Frankfurter to -- to express my appreciation for your observation a while ago that the jurisdiction under this Section 13 is far in the way then extension over the old Shreveport jurisdiction. 
    The thing we are prone to call discrimination against interstate commerce in these cases under Section 13 of the Interstate Commerce Act is not just that alone, it's a -- it is a matter of providing revenues sufficient to enable the railroads to maintain an adequate national railroad transportation system which was a matter of such concern to Congress that they decided that they put a stop to the state commissions from forcing undue preference of its state traffic and that's the history of the 1920 Transportation Act. 
    We prove the discrimination, if anybody wants to read the record, will show that the intrastate rates in Utah were lower, except of few rare instances and those who will be save for the saving clause in the Commission's order and report.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    All right.
speaker="elmer_b_collins" startTime="5786.640" stopTime="6038.451">
    Mr. Elmer B. Collins 
    -- that the Commission has properly characterized the testimony that was introduced in the Commission's reports begins at page 94, volume one of this record. 
    You'll see that the Commission there dealt with some 20 commodities in detail as to volume and revenues and all of that sort of thing. 
    Now, the needs of the revenues were going into the fact that we derive from intrastate traffic in Utah, a lower ton mile reward or earning from hauling the traffic of that State then we do for holding traffic in the western district generally, the interstate traffic I mean. 
    The shipper of interstate traffic pays more to get this traffic across the State of Utah mile from mile in all but a few isolated distances then the intrastate shipper pays for a holding having his traffic hold from inside the eastern border to just inside the western border of the State. 
    Now, our lower ton mile earnings that is a lower compensation for the word that we do in hauling this intrastate traffic has been referred to by this Court as one of the reasons for exercising the power given the Commission under Section 13 of the Act. 
    They said that this Section 13 was intended to make states traffic pay for states work by railroads in hauling that traffic. 
    Now, I want to call your attention, if you please, to the fact that a fair return as such so that the investors can have better dividends is not the purpose of the Section 13 power. 
    It is that I said to make state traffic pay for states work in transportation but the fundamental purpose has been stated over and over by this Court since the original decision to maintain or to produce revenues sufficient to unable the carriers to maintain a transportation system. 
    And now, since 1933, when Section 15 (a) (2) -- 15 (a) paragraph two was amended, Congress struck out or rather repealed, remember the old recapture section and language there that enable the Commission to give the railroads rates which as nearly as maybe might earn five-and-a-half or five-and-three quarters percent return. 
    Well, that wasn't workable. 
    In 1933, they amended that to in -- in this present language to require the Commission to give the railroads or rather to take into consideration in its exercising its power to provide just and reasonable rates. 
    To take into consideration among other factors, the effect of rates on the movement of traffic and to the need and the public interest of adequate and efficient railway transportation service at the lowest cost system with the furnishing of such service to the neither revenue sufficient to enable the carriers under honest, efficient and economical management. 
    Now, the Commission has been delegated to duty by Congress to the make the determination as to when the carrier's revenue for national purposes and for all purposes is inadequate. 
    The Commission makes that determination and they've not let any of that power as such to the Utah Commission which seems determined to try to usurp the Interstate Commerce Commission's jurisdiction to make the determination as to whether or not trans -- more revenues are needed for national purposes. 
    I did want to say to you. 
    I don't know whether this light means me or not.

    And you will see why the Interstate Commerce Commission would not accept any conclusions drawn in the -- I'm referring to the quoted language on top of page 84 and --

    84?
speaker="elmer_b_collins" startTime="6074.943" stopTime="6347.251">
    Mr. Elmer B. Collins 
    84, yes. 
    The discussion that follows that two to three pages in that brief. 
    The Commission in treating the testimony introduced by the Utah Commission, patiently explained in each instance and with respect to each item of testimony why the testimony was so undependable. 
    It had a -- it had a freak or phony I can't think of a defective basis because of the annual reports and the method of reporting that the Utah Commission forces the railroads to submit to it. 
    In other words, they forced defective and misleading and erroneous breakdowns, they want to credit to the State of Utah the -- the revenues allocated on a mileage basis and then credit that states into intrastate traffic for a -- with the revenue that interstate traffic pays for crossing the State. 
    You can't -- I don't see how it could be hoped that this Court could sustain a doctrine to the effect that the Utah intrastate shipper is entitled to have lower rates just because we have a lot of (Inaudible) little traffic moving at higher interstate rates across that State of Utah. 
    The density of traffic question are cited at page -- well I forget what page in the railroads brief, will show there by reference to the Interstate Commerce Act annotated the publication of official status. 
    If you'll look at the decision you will find over 600 back doors or elements that have been considered by the Interstate Commerce Commission to have a relevance in the determination of the -- of the reasonableness of interstate rates. 
    The Commission is though in its exercise of the Section 13 power determining reasonableness of rates as such in Utah. 
    It is already laid down the guide as this Court said in the King case, its action in Ex Parte 14 -- 175 became the natural basis for the action in the State to determine whether the State rates in Utah bore a proper relation to income. 
    If you look on pages 52 and 53 of the railroads brief, you'll see illustrations there just examples of the rate relationship. 
    They're put in juxtaposition to each other to show you what was before the Commission in this record and then if you'll look at further -- or at page -- I can't locate the sentence. 
    It's in some place in the railroads brief where they -- I quote from a Commission report as far back as 1935 in which they said prior to that date, the rail -- the intrastate rates in Utah and the interstate rates in traffic to through and from the state and in adjoining areas was generally on -- on approximately equal level. 
    Now, Utah Commission and none of the opposing shippers have cited you to anything that has brought about the change in the rates or any reason why if -- as the Commission made the finding there then and nobody is the position now to challenge it, there's no evidence to the contrary in the proceeding before you now. 
    And nothing has happened following the constant increases since 1946 when they went into this inflationary spiral. 
    Nothing -- the only thing that has happened to bring the two sets of rates intrastate and interstate out of the line and to each other is the refusal of the Utah Commission to go along with the Interstate Commerce Commissions finding that such and such revenue is needed for the maintenance of the (Inaudible). 
    You'll find no law that says that the Commission must have a -- have evidence of density of traffic in order to render a decision at all. 
    I thank you.

    Well, the difficulty that -- you may have the difficulty as to what it means.
speaker="keith_sohm" startTime="6393.521" stopTime="7090.187">
    Mr. Keith Sohm 
    Thank you, Your Honor. 
    The -- Mr. Weston I think mentioned in great detail and the first part of this testimony, I mean the argument of Mr. Calvin, excuse me, mentioned in great detail on the fist part of his argument and it seemed to infer all of it that the only thing they think is necessary is to show that there is substantial conditions that are the same in interstate and intrastate commerce. 
    We submit that they did not so do and came far from it is a matter of fact because much of the Utah evidence introduced shows that the rates, in a lot of instances in intrastate commerce was higher than rates on in -- interstate commerce in similar conditions and similar situations. 
    This was observed by the Honorable Judge Christensen in the Circuit Court of Appeal when he dissented from the majority decision -- Circuit Court and District Court excuse me, when he stated this. 
    Other evidential matters mentioned in the prevailing opinion as a foundation for the Commission's conclusion are belief insufficient to permit possible inferences to that effect in view of the record as a whole. 
    Such disparity of rates as were shown are in both directions and it is well established that a mere disparity of rates establishes no sufficient basis for such an order. 
    We recognize the fact that there may have been a disparity rates but the disparity was of course in both directions, some of them in favor of the Interstate Commerce Commission and some otherwise. 
    Now, an argument, Mr. Collins mentioned that there was a saving clause which was suppose to protect the State Commission in case any rates where slightly higher in intrastate commerce than in interstate commerce and we submit that that saving clause has no effect and gives us no advantage because the principal number of rates and the principal structure of rates within the State of course. 
    It is impossible to identify similar circumstances and similar instances under which we can take advantage of that saving clause so that with the exception of very few instances that saving clause has no effect or no advantage to the Public Service Commission of Utah and the rates within the State of Utah. 
    Now, we have no argument with the railroads and we're not attempting to frustrate the Court nor the Interstate Commerce Commission though I may admit we probably frustrated the railroads to a short degree because we haven't fallen in line with all of the States that have been asking for increases, all of the States that have denied or granted these increases for instance. 
    On November or October the 10th, 1957, the -- Alabama Commission granted an increase in rates that was petitioned before them by the railroads and this is the -- in granting it, they state this. 
    “It is with reluctance and a definite misgiving that we authorize the sought increase.” 
    Nevertheless, we cannot ignore the strong compelling consideration of the ever threatening mess to our power in jurisdiction and existence of the federal statute books of the 13th Section of the Interstate Commerce Act. 
    The rights of the State of Alabama as well as other individual states to regulate the intrastate general rate level according to its best judgment has been all but negated by federal encroachment under the strained and continue -- continually broadening construction of the provision of federal law. 
    We just haven't been quite as remiss in allowing railroads to take over our rates had the Interstate Commerce Commission as the Alabama and other Commission's have. 
    Now, we haven't then unfair with the railroads. 
    In this last case in which they're appealing from now, we held a hearing, asked them for evidence to prove that they needed this increase and they failed to produce it so we left the record open. 
    They left the record open as they stated for 60 days but instead ended up by living record open for three years. 
    They're asking the railroads to comeback and give us some evidence and show us where you need these rates in the State of Utah and they did not so do. 
    There's lots of -- lots of problems suggested that are complicated and involved by the arguments and the briefs on both sides in this case but it's fundamental. 
    And I think Your Honors can appreciate that, that this railroad whether it's in an Interstate Commerce Commission proceeding where the Interstate Commerce Commission initiates the proceeding upon petition by the railroads or whether it's a railroad case before the State Commission that they've got to make a case and they've got to carry the burden of proof to show that they need these rates in the State of Utah and that the State of Utah is not bearing its fair share of the interstate and the overall revenues of the railroads. 
    They did not so make a prima facie case and carry that burden of proof and as counsel for the appellants have argued the first instance, stated, the Utah Commission, when he state further -- step further and did introduced evidence to show that in many instances the rates in the State of Utah are already higher that the -- the density was higher and therefore of a greater benefit to the railroads that the -- and I refer to the brief of counsel in this matter that the ton mile figures as a matter of fact. 
    In the record, page 116, an analysis of the revenue for ton mile produced by the Utah Commission statistical expert show -- break -- brought down the products into manufactured and miscellaneous agriculture, animals, and mines. 
    And showed that the total of these products in intrastate was produced a revenue for ton mile of $1.21. 
    In interstate it produced a revenue of $1.06. 
    The railroads have produced a ton mile study of their own and introduced it in the record in page 99. 
    And that they have taken the overall of the whole United States to show what the revenue for ton mile was. 
    They have taken the Western District and they have taken the figure in connection with Utah to show what the ton mile figures are. 
    We submit that the -- that the railroads not only have failed to carry their burden of proof but they have -- but we have already actually taken the burden and shown that they should not have the increases within the State of Utah and that if they did so have them, they would be discriminating against the intrastate commerce. 
    In the railroads position that they should have automatically an increase the same as and identical to that increase granted on Interstate Commerce Commission is an absurdity to presume that the conditions within the State of Utah are identical to the conditions in Alabama for instance or the conditions in New York. 
    And that they -- the exact amount of increase should be imposed upon Utah as in those areas. 
    For instance in the original case of the Interstate Commerce Commission's investigation in which time they actually imposed this 15% increase, their order called Ex Parte 175. 
    Three of the Interstate Commerce Commission commissioners joined in a dissent and they stated this, it was written by Atchison. 
    “I cannot agree that the revenue needs of the petitioning railroads and all three great territories are so equal as to warrant a uniform nationwide increase in rates. 
    And that same Commissioner, I'm sure would look at this thing and say, “No. 
    I can't understand and I can't agree that the needs of all of the railroads throughout the United States is equal and exact than all of the States of the union that Utah has to be exactly the same as these others that the uniform rate increase on other states is not necessarily the particular rate increase that should be imposed upon the State of Utah. 
    It's time to say that our little Tulare Valley Railroad in Salt Lake, in Utah or the Bamberger Railroad in Utah has to have and has the exact revenue needs that New York Central has that that obviously is not true. 
    The railroads gave us no evidence upon which we could really determine what the revenue needs were of the railroads in Utah as distinguished from the railroads that are out of the United States. 
    The railroads gave no evidence of their cost of operation in Utah as compared to the revenues in Utah. 
    They did state that we need $1,860,000 in order to -- to make the operations in Utah and bring us a fair return but that's like an employees saying to his employer that last year if you had given me 15% increase, I will donate 1000 more dollars. 
    And therefore I'm losing $1000. 
    Therefore this year given 15% increase in my wages so that I won't lose $1000 this year. 
    It's not evidence. 
    It's a conclusion and a finding. 
    The carriers in the west by evidence is shown in the exhibits are in a more favorable position than the carriers in the east. 
    The illustration given by the counsel in the first argument, Mr. Rampton showed that the D &amp; R.G.had a 6.06 rate of return, whose operations are 50% within the State of Utah. 
    The Bamberger Railroad which is all commodity railroad operating with its line solely within the State of Utah has a very high rate of return 15.98%. 
    It has never been adequately explained by the railroads nor the Interstate Commerce Commission why that high rate of return exists within the State of Utah on an all commodity road.

    We -- we feel that -- that it is just an exemplary railroad of the -- of the railroads that's operating within the State of Utah and that be in a representative railroad all in all commodities as much as the Denver and Rio Grande and the Western Pacific and the Southern Pacific and Union Pacific that it is represented with the type of returns that are being gained from those railroads in the State of Utah. 
    And that the railroads have not carried the burden of proof to show that's not true.

    In these -- in these orders, am I wrong in being under the impression that Interstate Commerce Commission in making these certain full orders, usually, has a saving clause in the line --

    Is that right?

    -- if they usually do it or not but we -- we surprise them --

    Did they do appeal?

    They did here.

    Yes.

    We surprise them --

    It's a conventional form of the order I think.
speaker="keith_sohm" startTime="7218.914" stopTime="7229.163">
    Mr. Keith Sohm 
    Yes, maybe so. 
    I know that the pattern they used in lighting up the order imposing the increase is up on the State of Utah is almost identical than you can put it page for page --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="7229.163" stopTime="7229.411">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Yes.
speaker="keith_sohm" startTime="7229.411" stopTime="7232.862">
    Mr. Keith Sohm 
    -- on the patterns used by the other orders of the Interstate Commerce Commission against to other states.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="7232.862" stopTime="7235.377">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    But in -- they didn't discriminate against Utah.
speaker="keith_sohm" startTime="7235.377" stopTime="7281.538">
    Mr. Keith Sohm 
    No. 
    [Laughs] To that degree, they did not. 
    So I believe that the fact that the railroads have argued that all conditions are the same in Utah as in Interstate Commission as stated by counsel is -- is not the same, not only because the density figures we introduced to show were not the same whether they're or for against us, they show that they're not the same but because the railroads in their own exhibit stated that the revenue needs of the railroads were for $1,860,000 as $60,000 and that most of that is actually products of mines $1,500,000 so that that alone shows that the movements are considerably different. 
    Thank you, Your Honors.
