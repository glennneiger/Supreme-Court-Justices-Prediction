    Mr. Brooks, you may proceed.
speaker="neil_brooks" startTime="30.547" stopTime="215.427">
    Mr. Neil Brooks 
    If the Court please. 
    The centric issue in the case is whether certain regulations issued by the stockyard owner in Denver pursuant to the Packers and Stockyards Act are invalid as a matter of law or stating the question in the language used by the Court of Appeals. 
    The question is whether the regulations in the absence of evidence are illegal on their face. 
    These regulations were issued by the stockyard owner with respect to the furnishing of what the statute calls reasonable stockyard services. 
    The Denver Stock Yard has been posted for regulation under the Packers and Stockyards Act since 1921. 
    And the market agent says and the dealers at that Stock Yard are also subject to the regulatory terms of the statute. 
    This litigation had its origin in a complaint which was filed with the Department of Agriculture by a market agency at the Denver Stock Yard. 
    A market agency is by statutory definition, a person engaged in the business of buying or selling livestock on a commission basis at a posted stockyard. 
    A complaint in this case was filed by the Producers Livestock Marketing Association, a corporate entity which is registered with the Secretary of Agriculture as a market agency at this stockyard. 
    That is to say the complainant is engaged in the business of buying and selling livestock on a commission basis at the Denver Stock Yard. 
    It is alleged in the complaint that certain regulations issued by the stockyard owner are for various reasons invalid. 
    And the prayer of the complaint is that the Secretary of Agriculture, after an adjudicatory proceeding, set aside the Stock Yard Company's regulations or as the complaint terms it, annulled those regulations. 
    Before explaining the regulations --

    Was there any objection here by anybody?
speaker="neil_brooks" startTime="238.117" stopTime="325.677">
    Mr. Neil Brooks 
    There was an objection here by the market agency, the complainant in the administrative proceeding. 
    That objection was filed properly after these regulations were filed with the Department of Agriculture. 
    Perhaps, it will be helpful too, Your Honor, if I explain at once two or three of the statutory provisions which are at the very center of this case, statutory provisions which are cited in the complaint and which are relied on by the complainant now as well as then. 
    The Packers and Stockyards Act imposed certain duties on a stockyard owner and a market agency. 
    And it provides that if there's a breach of one of those duties, a complaint maybe filed by any person, a private person or the Secretary of Agriculture and after adjudicatory proceeding, a decision maybe made by the agency with judicial review later. 
    Now, the first of the two statutory duties that are involved here is this. 
    The statute provides that it shall be the duty of a stockyard owner and a market agency to furnish upon reasonable request without discrimination, reasonable stockyard services at the stockyard.

speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="344.233" stopTime="346.147">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    He can't just refuse to accept it.
speaker="neil_brooks" startTime="346.147" stopTime="475.062">
    Mr. Neil Brooks 
    No, Your Honor. 
    The first duty then that's specified in the statute is the duty on the part of a stockyard owner and a market agency and this is the very language of the statute. 
    It's the duty on the part of a stockyard owner and a market agency to furnish upon reasonable request without discrimination, reasonable stockyard services at the Stock Yard. 
    Now, the pivotal term in that statutory language, the pivotal term reasonable stockyard services is not defined in the statute, neither is there any definition of the word reasonable as it's used in that term, reasonable stockyard services. 
    There is, however, a statutory definition of a part of that term, namely, stockyard services as such. 
    The statutory definition of that term is in words of -- throughout generality. 
    The definition is this. 
    The term stockyard services means facilities undefined or services undefined in connection with the receiving of livestock, the watering, the feeding and the holding of livestock and the buying and the selling and the marketing of livestock and the shipment of livestock at a posted stockyard. 
    So the first duty is that a stockyard owner and a market agency must furnish upon reasonable request without discrimination, reasonable stockyard services. 
    The second duty specified in the statute is this. 
    It shall be the duty of a stockyard owner and a market agency to issue, observe, and enforce just, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory regulations with respect to the furnishing of stockyard services.
speaker="charles_e_whittaker" startTime="475.062" stopTime="476.191">
    Justice Charles E. Whittaker 
    As of duty?
speaker="neil_brooks" startTime="476.191" stopTime="795.499">
    Mr. Neil Brooks 
    A duty, Your Honor. 
    That's the very language of the statute. 
    It shall be the duty of a stockyard owner and a market agency to issue, observe and enforce just, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory regulations with respect to the furnishing of stockyard services. 
    The last statutory provision in the group that Justice Douglas probably referred to is this provision. 
    The statute says that any person, that's the term in the statute, any person, who has agreed by what he regards as a breach of one of those statutory duties, may file a complaint with the Department of Agriculture. 
    Also, the statute provides that the administrative agency itself may, on its own motion, file a complaint if it regards inappropriate in the situation. 
    The statute then provides that in either event whether the complaint is filed by a private person or whether the complaint is filed by the administrative agency itself in either event. 
    If the Secretary concludes on the basis of the hearing record and the statute refers to what it calls a full hearing, if the Secretary concludes on the basis of that record that any rate or charge or any regulation or practice in connection with the furnishing of stockyard services is unjust, unreasonable, or discriminatory, then the Secretary may set aside the rate or charge or the regulation or practice, and the Secretary may, on the basis of that record, prescribe the rate or charge or the regulation or practice which is and will be just, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory. 
    Those I believe are the three statutory provisions which are at the center of the case. 
    The complaint, as I said earlier, was filed by a market agency asserting that certain regulations issued by the stockyard owner are violative of those statutory provisions and are also in other respects that I will get to later, illegal and invalid. 
    It was decided by the administrative agency and that decision appears in the record that this proceeding should go forward on the basis of the complaint filed by the Producers Livestock Marketing Association as the complainant and the of course the Denver Union Stock Yard Company, the stockyard owner as the respondent. 
    Accordingly, the complaint was served on the respondent, an answer was filed denying the various allegations in the complaint as to whether or not these regulations are just, reasonable and nondiscriminatory. 
    The answer filed by the respondent admits -- admits that it issued the regulations as they're quoted in the complaint and it admits that the complainant is registered with the Secretary of Agriculture as a market agency at Denver. 
    But in all other respects or at least in all other material respects, the answer denies the factual allegations in the complaint and demands what it calls strict proof on the part of the complainant. 
    We come now to an interesting and unexpected development in the administrative proceeding. 
    This case was assigned to a hearing examiner and the parties were preparing for the hearing. 
    The respondent filed a motion with the hearing examiner for a subpoena duces tecum for certain books and records of the complaint. 
    It being alleged in the motion filed by the respondent that those books and records of the complainant were relevant and material to the practices in the market which gave rise to the issuance of these regulations and which would show the need for the regulations and the reasonableness of the regulations. 
    The complainant resisted the issuance of the subpoena duces tecum although it did not deny and the record shows it. 
    It did not deny the relevance of the books and records.

    Mr. Neil Brooks 
    The stockyard owner has the records with respect to livestock that actually passed through the stockyard. 
    The main thrust of the regulations or at least a main thrust of the regulations, relates to transactions in which a market agency at the stockyard circumvented the delivery of the livestock to the stockyard or as the regulation terms it interfered with the normal flow of livestock to the stockyard either by diverting direct to packer or diverting to some other market. 
    Although the stockyard owner has records of all shipments that actually went through the stockyard, the records of the stockyard owner were not complete with respect to these off market transactions which are largely and critically involved in the issuance of the regulation.

    Mr. Neil Brooks 
    -- if I may. 
    In its stout resistance to the issuance of the subpoena duces tecum, the complainant filed what he called an election, an election to state its case on the narrow circumscribed proposition that these regulations in the absence of evidence are illegal on their face. 
    The election filed by the complainant stated and these are the words in that election. 
    That the complainant will not present evidence in this case, and that the case is to be disposed of so far as the complainant is concerned. 
    On the one narrow proposition that these regulations are invalid on their face as a matter of law. 
    Accordingly, the hearing examiner was of the opinion that the complaint should be dismissed. 
    The matter then went to the judicial officer in the Department of Agriculture and in a rather elaborate opinion in the record of course. 
    The judicial officer concluded that these regulations are not as a matter of law just in the abstract in vacuo illegal. 
    Perhaps, I should say a word at this point as to the regulations themselves. 
    In the main -- in the main, the regulations provide that a stock -- that a market agency or a dealer at the stockyard shall not interfere. 
    That's the critical word in the regulation, shall not interfere with what the regulations refer to as the normal flow of livestock to the Denver market. 
    That the interference shall not be by way of diversion elsewhere and that a market agency or a dealer at the stockyard shall not solicit, that's the word used in the regulations, shall not solicit livestock business for disposition elsewhere.

    What I want to know is whether, when you speak of the normal flow, does the normal flow bring livestock to the Denver yard or to other yards and at the yard, practices or services rendered by the yard which hereon the proper protection of the ultimate needs consumed by the consumers of United States? 
    What do they do? 
    In other words, what is there that should justify a regulation making a flow normal? 
    Why shouldn't the -- why shouldn't the dealer do with his cattle, his livestock what he wants to do? 
    Why should there be a normal flow?

speaker="neil_brooks" startTime="1149.609" stopTime="1183.401">
    Mr. Neil Brooks 
    It is difficult to see them in the abstract. 
    In fact, that's the main position that our department takes that the validity of these regulations in their entirety can be ascertained only on the basis of a thorough evidentiary consideration of all of the conditions and circumstances in that great market that you cannot just as a matter of law in the abstract as Justice Frankfurter just said, that you cannot in the abstract pass upon the validity of these regulations.

    The Court of Appeals disposed of the case on the basis of a hypothetical situation. 
    It assumed. 
    It indulged in what we call dualistic assumptions of fact. 
    It said that if, and that's the word of the Court of Appeals, if a market agency is registered at Denver and is also registered at some competitive posted stockyard and if the regulations in their application would prohibit the market agency from performing reasonable stockyard services at one stockyard or the other then in that undisclosed hypothetical situation, said the Court of Appeals, the regulation would be invalid even though it added that the condition existing on the part of a market agency in subverting the business of the stockyard where it is afforded free space to do business might bring about what the Court of Appeals called inefficient operations at that stockyard even redounding to the failure to have reasonable stockyard services there. 
    But nonetheless, the Court of Appeals, on the basis of that dualistic assumption of facts, said that accordingly the regulations are illegal and ordered the administrative agency to issue a cease-and-desist order.

    Mr. Neil Brooks 
    I understand they are not registered at Kansas City. 
    Perhaps I should explain. 
    I understand that there are two or three corporate entities in this country by the name of Producers Livestock Marketing Association. 
    They are separate entities although as I understand all of this outside the record, if the Court please. 
    As I understand, there is some overwriting association or I don't know just what the nature of that association is between those various corporate entities. 
    But I can still say to the Court in all candor that there are two or three, maybe more, corporate entities for the name of Producers Livestock Marketing Association which operate in various stockyards throughout the country. 
    I should say also in complete candor to the Court that I understand that this particular corporate entity is registered as a market agency at Los Angeles and at one or two other stockyards, Salt Lake City and Ogden. 
    Now, harking back for a moment to the hypothetical situation on which the Court of Appeals disposed of the case. 
    I don't know Your Honor and there's no evidence here to deal with it. 
    I don't know which stockyards are competitive with the others and how much they are competitive. 
    I do know that there are about 600 posted stockyards throughout the country. 
    Some of them are great terminal stockyards like Denver and Chicago and six or eight others. 
    Many of them are very small auction markets, and the way of doing business, even the way of selling livestock widely various in those hundreds of stockyards throughout the country. 
    In the terminal stockyards, livestock is not ordinarily sold by the auction method. 
    The buying and the selling of it results from the livestock being consigned by the owner to a market agency or a dealer at the stockyard and then its -- it's sold by negotiation between that agent and the prospective buyer, whereas, probably 400 or 500 other stockyards throughout the country where they have auction methods of sale is disposed off by the auction method, but even that is not uniform and never has been prior to the Packers and Stockyards Act or since the passage of this Packers and Stockyards Act.

    Mr. Neil Brooks 
    I'm eager to explain that, Your Honor. 
    I just hope it won't be a charge to my associate's time. 
    Well, when this complaint was filed, it had factual allegations in it. 
    Those allegations were denied by the Stock Yard Company. 
    Our department, as a matter of administration, had every reason to believe at that time that these two litigants would develop the facts forthrightly and fully. 
    These two litigants, if Your Honor please, are very substantial corporate entities. 
    The Producers Livestock Marketing Association in its own brief here today describes itself as a public utility and it characterizes the Stock Yard Company also as a public utility. 
    Both of these litigants have had experience an important and nature litigation under the Packers and Stockyards Act. 
    They have been operating at that stockyard for years and years, both the stockyard owner and the Producers Livestock Marketing Association. 
    When our department received this complaint by this market agency with various factual allegations as to conditions and circumstances in the market there and when those factual circumstances were denied by the Stock Yard Company, our department at least in reason and we had no reason to believe otherwise, thought that these two litigants if they proceeded with the case would develop the evidence forthrightly and fully. 
    Now, this practice is not a novelty either under the statute or under the Interstate Commerce Commission Act. 
    Title III of the Packers and Stockyards Act is patterned expressly so this Court said in the Tarrant case in 280 U.S. and the legislative history shows it. 
    Title III of the Packers and Stockyards Act, the very title involved here today is adopted almost exclusively on the basis of the Interstate Commerce Act with respect to their jurisdiction overrates and regulations. 
    The practice there and the practice before our own agency since 1921, since the adoption of the Packers and Stockyards Act, has been that in some situations, we would allow a private litigant to go forward with his own complaint either with respect to a rate that's challenged or with respect to a regulation that's challenged. 
    May I say again, when this litigation had its origin, our department had every reason to believe that these facts would be developed. 
    And as I said earlier in my remarks, we were surprised when the case took the turn that it did. 
    Now, if you suggest -- now I don't know that Justice Frankfurter suggested it but let's assume it for a moment. 
    If you suggest that at the time, the complainant refused to -- refused to go forward with the presentation of evidence, if at that time the department on its own motion had issued a complaint, no doubt these books and records would again have been sought by means of a subpoena.

    On reversal, and I believe this is the heading of that section in our brief, on reversal of the decision by the Court of Appeals in this case, the department will then be free to take whatever action is appropriate with respect to these regulations, and in further answer, and I must not run over my time further, the department at times is the complainant. 
    In fact, I believe the brief filed of the Producers Livestock Marketing Association here refers to a situation in Indianapolis not related to this but refers to a situation there in which the stockyard owner issued some regulations and the department itself filed the complaint and it's going forward with that proceeding. 
    Within the limits of our personnel and they are limited of course in this broad appeal of regulation, our department proceeds forthrightly in these cases as best we can. 
    And here, at the time the administrative decision was made, there was ever reason to believe that all of these facts would be developed.

    What they found was the statute that has one special provision which said it shall be (Inaudible) of every stockyard owners and market agents that have furnished a reasonable repair without discrimination, reasonable stockyard services that's been stopped. 
    I understand what the Court then said was that it found that the Denver yard have refused to render to every stockyard (Inaudible) services of unreasonable repairs. 
    That it said that the stockyard had imposed condition which attempted to control the other business activity of those who dealt with them. 
    The Court may have been wrong but it held, as I understand it, that there was nothing could take evidence on in that field that if the Denver -- the Denver agency absolutely barred the -- any regulation which would prohibit people from doing business with them, anyone of them, on equal terms with others and there's nothing for the Secretary of Agriculture to determine.

    Mr. Ashley Sellers 
    The regulation bears upon market agencies. 
    It does not bear upon farmers or shippers to the market. 
    The regulation has to do only with those few people. 
    By saying few, I don't mean to suggest that that means its going to bear. 
    But in order to get an understanding of the compass of the rule only upon those people firms who do business at the Denver market as agents, as people operating on the market as instrumentalities or if you please, facilities of the market. 
    A stockyard within the contemplation of the Act and as it has gone up, consists of the Stock Yard Company of course which owns the facilities and which performs the services and which under the statute as construed by the courts is a business affected where the public interest -- public interest has the duty to provide reasonable stockyard services and facilities upon reasonable request. 
    Itself could have started out by providing the buying and selling of services itself. 
    In some stockyards, that is the situation. 
    In other stockyards, there are agents there who come on the market, who have to register with the department, and who have to obtain the approval of the Stock Yard Company in order to do business at that yard. 
    Now, the market agencies and that's the case here is involved only market agencies, market agencies has facilities or instrumentalities on the yard are themselves public utilities within the language of these cases. 
    They too have the obligation to render reasonable services upon reasonable requests without discrimination. 
    The marketing agencies at Denver or at any other stockyard have as their initial responsibility so provided by the regulations of the department itself to render it -- the -- render their primary duties to the consignors to the market. 
    That is their whole reason for being on the market is that they serve that market. 
    Otherwise, you could have, well have situations where people come on the market. 
    They come registered with the department which is in very large part of ministerial act, the registration. 
    Obtain the consent of the Stock Yard Company to operate on the yard, they made assignments of tents, free of rental, get an established place on the market, there's a room only for so many, 10, 12, 15 at Denver and advertise themselves throughout that great area as being Denver market agencies but set themselves to taking business elsewhere than in Denver. 
    And the result would be that this -- the market would be -- would inevitably decline without any ability to help itself in the interest of the patrons both the buyers and sellers of the market. 
    Now, the Stockyard Act, the whole background of it is definitely grounded in the theory that it's in the interest of the farmers and the producers of the area to have a market, a central market such as this great stockyard at Denver is which would provide free competition in the bidding and the sale of livestock which would provide an ample supply or different kinds of livestock at all times to suit different buying demands and which would be the price fixing setting mechanism through that whole marketing area. 
    As everyone knows in the industry, prices that are established at great markets like Chicago and Omaha and Denver and the large markets have a tremendous influence over the transactions of livestock made locally and out into the country. 
    Now, with that in mind, the regulation bore only upon market agencies. 
    The regulation does not say to any farmer or any producer in a shipper to the market that you have to ship to Denver. 
    The regulation does not say to any farmer, you have to ship all of your livestock or none to do. 
    The regulation only bears upon market agencies. 
    It in effect is telling to market agencies, “It is your primary job made so not by us but by the statute and by that regulation to the department. 
    It is your primary job to serve this market and -- and if you devote your energies elsewhere than at this market then other market agencies who could -- who could better serve this market in the interest of the market as a whole should take your place”.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Mr. Sellers, may I ask you this question for me to understand this more clearly. 
    I suppose nobody on this Court is more eager to deny it but cattle countries or livestock industry for a better understanding. 
    Do I understand it the Denver market has x number, 12 or 15 to indicate a relatively small number of people who get a license -- out of license from the department or an authorization from the Department of Agriculture to do business within the Denver market and that means to have certain store or whatever you call them in order there to do bidding with other people, other market agencies. 
    Presumably, if they ask me to do business in the Denver market, they wanted to do business in the Denver market. 
    Now, do I understand that this regulation circumscribed their freedom to do business elsewhere?

speaker="ashley_sellers" startTime="2545.377" stopTime="2551.678">
    Mr. Ashley Sellers 
    That's right. 
    If regulation does limit, their activities are to roam around and buy and sell and trade any livestock.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2551.678" stopTime="2581.647">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Now, what I want to know is this. 
    What is there in the Packers and Stockyards Act which define, if not in terms by the implications of the duties and services to be rendered, the obligation to carry on business for the Denver market for which their license -- license and (Inaudible) their unlimited freedom to do business in any other markets to which they also may have a license.
speaker="ashley_sellers" startTime="2581.647" stopTime="2659.399">
    Mr. Ashley Sellers 
    If the Court please, the regulation or the -- the statute doesn't say that you may only do business at one market neither does this stockyard regulation say that you may only do business at one market. 
    It says that as far as Denver is concerned and that's all that the Denver Stock Yards could do that you should in operating as a market agency at this yard, give certain of your functions, certain of your activities to the service of this market. 
    Otherwise, there's no reason for you being here. 
    Now it could well be, although, again if the Court please, there is not one ounce of evidence in this record as to what the regulation means, as to what its impact is, as to how many other markets there are, as to how many agencies there are, as to what sort of organization that producers marketing association is, we don't know what they are of this record.

    -- validity under faith must either mean that to make any regulation curtailing their freedom although they own a license for the Denver market and there is this statutory construction scheme that's been summarized or that on the basis, the kind of limitation of freedom that it sees the Denver agency, it's obviously a discriminatory or exemplary jurisdiction.
speaker="ashley_sellers" startTime="2694.394" stopTime="2742.334">
    Mr. Ashley Sellers 
    May I say that this is only one regulation. 
    There is a great body of stockyard regulations, not merely at Denver but Stock Yard Companies all over the country have regulations. 
    Many of those regulations impose limitations upon the freedom of action of market agencies. 
    It's -- as this Court said in the Board of Trade case, every regulation restrains to a certain extent that is true of practically of a regulation I can conceive of not only of the Stock Yard Company but of -- almost in the other utilities.

    What you have is a regulation of the Denver Stock Yard, and if it can make it every other every other one, you'd make it, which tells all these market agencies to do business, that you can't do any business if you solicit for any other agents or any other -- other place, if you -- in manner divert or attempt to divert livestock in this market even yours which would otherwise normally come to the stockyard.

    To furnish upon reasonable request without discrimination, reasonable stockyard service at such time. 
    Now suppose the stockyard service they want and for purpose of reason for the amount of cattle they want, pleaded and process there and willing to pay the price but the man comes in and says, “The company comes in with a regulation decision.” 
    You can't do business with us because you've been soliciting business on those markets. 
    We don't -- you -- you can't do business with us if you do that. 
    For selling outside these stores, you've attempted to divert business from this agency to go to Utah or to Los Angeles.

    So that the two, both the Stock Yard Company and the market agencies are under the same statutory duty to render stockyard services to patrons of that market.

    It maybe the act for instance in certain way, the Secretary can with evidence being introduced, permit the local places like Denver and Utah to say that we're not going to have anybody. 
    We won't have the business with Denver agencies. 
    We're not going to let you have anything to do, maybe it does. 
    But what I'm interested in is why does this section on which the Court relied not permitted?

speaker="ashley_sellers" startTime="3164.614" stopTime="3183.696">
    Mr. Ashley Sellers 
    Well, that's right. 
    But before you get to that if the Court please, the complaint alleged that the regulation was invalid. 
    We filed an answer in which we denied the allegations of their complaint, all factual allegations except the mere fact that the -- that there were -- there were two people involved and that there was a regulation.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="3183.696" stopTime="3185.420">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Can you justify the regulation in your answer?
speaker="ashley_sellers" startTime="3185.420" stopTime="3434.360">
    Mr. Ashley Sellers 
    We -- we denied that the regulation had the meaning that they attributed to it, and we put the matter into issue for a hearing as to what the regulation would mean. 
    In preparation for the hearing, we filed an application for a subpoena to get certain records and books that they have which would demonstrate the unreasonableness of their conduct and their failure themselves to render reasonable stockyard services and which in turn made it necessary for us to have such a regulation. 
    At that point, they did not as we -- as we've said before challenge the subpoena in terms of its propriety. 
    They simply answered by saying the subpoena should not issue because the regulation is invalid on its face. 
    That would have not been their reply to the complaint. 
    It was only in response to the subpoena. 
    At that point, after oral argument on that feature as to whether the -- the subpoena should -- should issue with that type of response, the examiner held that a hearing was necessary in order to determine the reasonableness of the regulation that he deemed that a subpoena should -- should issue but that he would await until the complainants have made out a prima facie case. 
    He expected them to put on evidence. 
    He set it down for hearing. 
    Thereupon, they filed a document entitled an election to rest in which they said, “We will not put on evidence. 
    We will not attend the hearing in January the 24th that they set or at any other time and we stand on the proposition that the regulation is invalid on its face.” 
    The Stock Yard Company at that point moved to dismiss the proceeding because of the failure of the complainant to prosecute its case. 
    These were the only two parties involved. 
    I was -- it was their task. 
    They had the burden of proof. 
    Admittedly, under the law and under the rules of the department and they had failed to go forward with the evidence to even put on any evidence whatsoever, so we moved to dismiss. 
    And that gave rise to the decision of the judicial officer who residing those facts said that the issue before me is whether the regulation is invalid on its face, is evidence needed in order to determine the issue. 
    He also then said my conclusion about dismissing the case because he found that the regulation was not invalid on its face that it needed evidence. 
    He -- he greatly explored the different areas in which -- of their attack. 
    They attacked it on the basis of the public utilities obligation and of our obligation under the antitrust laws. 
    He explored all of those features holding that in any event that evidence was necessary in order to determine whether the evidence -- whether the regulation was involved -- invalid on its face. 
    And he said, “My conclusion is strengthened by the fact that the specs upon which I may act gives to the respondent in a proceeding, the right to a full hearing and upon the basis of that procedural right which this Court as he adverted to time and again has upheld the famous Morgan cases, the comparable cases under the Interstate Commerce Act which is a counterpart to this statute. 
    He held that I -- that the regulation should -- should go to hearing and since they had refused to go to hearing, he said I have no choice but to dismiss the complaint.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Now this -- is this your case, Mr. Sellers? 
    That Packers and Stockyards back of 1921 took over packers and stockyards business in interstate commerce. 
    That extent is elaborated or rather detailed scheme subjecting the stockyard public utility regulations and creating things called market agency as business for the conduct of the stockyard. 
    While it maintained a competitive system in order to make the scheme functional, in order to enable the stockyards to carry out their belief, they had to be effective functioning market agency. 
    And in order to have effective market agencies, there have to be a certain (Inaudible), a certain circumscription of freedom of action by the market agency. 
    And whether or not, a restriction from the conduct of the market agencies in carrying out not only their duty but to enable the stockyard to live and function, you have to know what the facts are in a particular market.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Thomas.
speaker="hadlond_p_thomas" startTime="3826.438" stopTime="4029.823">
    Mr. Hadlond P. Thomas 
    May it please the Court. 
    We stood before the Secretary of Agriculture. 
    We stood before this Circuit Court of Appeals. 
    We stand here and we will continue to stand upon one proposition. 
    That proposition is this. 
    This regulation is illegal and invalid upon its face as a matter of law. 
    Evidence without ambit cannot be given vitality. 
    Now, something being invalid upon its face isn't -- shouldn't be so strange. 
    This Court has recently, that's January 13 in the Staub against City Baxley case from Georgia held that that city ordinance down there was invalid upon its face as a matter of law which required one who had solicit membership in a labor union to secure a permit from the mayor of the city. 
    Mr. Justice Whittaker ought that decision and he said that it deprived the -- the defendant in that case of his right of free speech without getting a permit from the mayor and for that reason, the ordinance was invalid on its face. 
    Now, this ordinance here is nonetheless invalid on its face. 
    And it is an ordinance. 
    It was ordained by the Denver Union Stock Yard. 
    I say that it stands out on the face of this ordinance like Mr. Justice Black said in his opinion issued this morning in the Northern Pacific Railroad case that it was adopted to fence out competitors. 
    That's the language, His Honor used, and that's the purpose of this unwholesome regulation I submit. 
    Now, the only question anymore in this case to begin with was and still is, is this regulation here on trial illegal on its face as a matter of law? 
    How did it come up? 
    The Packers and Stockyards Act says two things. 
    First, that every stockyard company must furnish reasonable stockyard services on reasonable request without discrimination. 
    I would emphasize those words without discrimination. 
    Then it says also that every stockyard company must adopt regulations and practices that are -- that are just, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory and that every regulation which is unjust, unreasonable, or discriminatory -- discriminatory is invalid. 
    Now, there is where we start out. 
    This stockyard company --

    Mr. Hadlond P. Thomas 
    Up to that time every stockyard company had regulations but I affirmed none like this. 
    They had regulations which -- from which the -- their amicus, the American Stockyard Association in their brief have taken selective excerpts in which -- which prohibit going on the yards or in the streets so that entering the yards and interfering with the movement of livestock like the Fort Worth case where they climbed on -- where they stopped the trucks in the -- in -- in the yards and dealt with the drivers and bought the livestock, unloaded them and put them on their own trucks and went of. 
    Then they cause traffic jams. 
    Now those are the regulations they have with other yards. 
    They say that -- that they can't on the ways -- on the highways, and the streets adjacent and adjoining. 
    This -- the fact that no one has ever had one of these regulations in the Court before that test, in my opinion, the fact that there are none such.

    What the --

    How does it work against the producer?
speaker="hadlond_p_thomas" startTime="4215.668" stopTime="4287.858">
    Mr. Hadlond P. Thomas 
    I -- I'll explain. 
    The Act recognizes three agencies. 
    There is the stockyard, there is the market agency, that's us, commission firms who buy and sell on commission and the dealers. 
    The dealer buys and sells on his own account. 
    He speculated it. 
    Denver Union Stock Yard here is the stockyard where the commission firm. 
    Now, this regulation says that no market agency or dealer engaging in business at this stockyard, what, shall upon the stockyard company property or elsewhere, or elsewhere even anywhere else nor show any other person on the Stock Yard Company solicit business for other markets and so on or in any manner to further attempt to divert livestock from this market or engage in any practice or device which you would be impair or interfere with the normal flow of livestock to the public market at this stockyard and then it sets up its own definition, say the normal marketing area from which livestock would normally come to this market is so and so.

    Mr. Hadlond P. Thomas 
    Let me explain how the case came up. 
    Let me explain the posture of this case. 
    We filed this complaint and we said in our complaint before the Secretary this regulation is wholly invalid. 
    Why? 
    Because it's discriminatory. 
    And then they answered. 
    And we said, “We're going to stand does we say here we do now upon the illegality of this regulation upon its face as a matter of law. 
    Now, so on December the 23rd, 1955 after the case had come an issue, we filed complainants “election to rest” and we say, “It comes now the complainant and the above entitled cause and states that the challenged regulation of respondents is illegal and invalid upon its face. 
    That as a matter of law and that the complainant elects to stay and upon the illegality of said regulation as a matter of law and states that it will not present evidence in this cause as the taking of evidence is unnecessary to determine the illegality of said regulation as a matter of law wherefore the complainant hereby rests and submits its case for final decision by the Secretary --

speaker="hadlond_p_thomas" startTime="4538.083" stopTime="4614.527">
    Mr. Hadlond P. Thomas 
    Then what did they do? 
    They filed -- they took up the challenge. 
    They -- they met and head on. 
    They filed respondent's motion to dismiss and that reads thus, comes down the respondent by its attorneys and moves that the complaint in this proceeding be dismissed with prejudice. 
    They state their case upon it too, because of the complainant's failure on the record to sustain the burden of making a prima facie case in support of the complaint as evidence by its election not to offer proof of its allegation and not to proceed in accordance with the hearing examiners rule respectfully submitted. 
    There the issue was sharply drawn. 
    What did the -- what did the hearing officer say at that point? 
    Here is what he said. 
    He said the complainant was freed away herein and to state the outcome of the proceeding solely upon the question as to whether the disputed regulation is invalid on its face as a matter of law. 
    Now, he elects this. 
    He said you're wrong. 
    It's not illegal on its face. 
    You have the right to state your case on it. 
    Sure. 
    And they state theirs too because they'd rather head on with the motion to dismiss when we filed “election to rest”.

    Right. 
    What it says is that on all livestock which originates in the West 56 of Colorado, our market agency and all others as well who deal out there must see that every head of livestock we handle is routed in the Denver Stockyard. 
    Now what does that do? 
    That makes us -- prevents us from routing any to Kansas City and it prevents to see what is also from this. 
    It prevents us from selling from one grower to another grower right out there in Colorado Springs as Mr. Justice Douglas referred to. 
    Now, it means that under this regulation that if we propose to sell from one grower in Colorado Springs to another grower in Colorado Springs, we can only do it by routing that livestock to the Denver yard and shipping it back to that bar, a little decrease process or else pay in tribute to the Denver yard.

    Mr. Hadlond P. Thomas 
    Now, of course every public utility is bound to serve and we have cited the cases, many of them, which hold that a public utility may not demand exclusive patronage or exclusive allegiance for example an electric company cannot say if you -- if you burn gas also, you can have our electricity. 
    And a railroad company can't say if you ride the airplanes, you can't ride our -- our trains and so on and so forth. 
    Nor public utilities deny service because of something which is a collateral matter -- something which is collateral to the service they furnish. 
    For example, I can't say to you that if you can have water and electricity but only if you install a septic tank. 
    Now we say here that this regulation demands our exclusive patronage our exclusive allegiance and also it denies us service because of a collateral matter namely doing business out in the country. 
    The country business is big if the Court please. 
    That's one reason we're objecting and we say we've got a right to go out in the country and sell from one grower to another and that the Denver Stock Yard Company can't stop us by regulation.

    Now, let me say this too, that the American Stockyard Association in their brief amicus curiae has pointed out that very thing that when the Packers and Stockyards Act was passed in 1921, 90% of all livestock moved through these posted stockyards. 
    Whereas today, only about 60% moves through and it's going down all the time, you can see the reason for the regulation, trying to force this economic effect.
