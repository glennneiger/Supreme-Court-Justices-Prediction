    Mr. Roger D. Fisher 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    This is a criminal tax case of a different sort. 
    It is here on writ of certiorari from the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. 
    The basic issue is whether Federal Income Tax Evasion is proved by the net worth method. 
    When you're doing this, it is indispensable to prove a likely source of the income or whether guilt may be established by other circumstances. 
    The Court of Appeals for the First Circuit held that proof of a likely source of a net worth increases was indispensable to a conviction on a net worth method.

    Mr. Roger D. Fisher 
    I think it is, Your Honor. 
    The respondent was indicted in 1953 for evading income taxes for the five years, 1946 through 1950. 
    During this time, he was a policeman in Worcester Massachusetts. 
    The voluminous evidence which was developed over a 12-day trial has been summarized and has put in some detail in our brief.I'd like to summarize it here in a few minutes. 
    Respondent was a member of the Worcester Police Department from 1923 until his retirement in 1951, the year after the last year here involved. 
    His principal duties were motorcycle patrol and vice squads of which he was the head in a few years prior to 1943. 
    During two of the indictment years, not based on calendar years, but during the period of about two years, he was a -- the license board officer who handled applications for licenses for taxi cabs, gas stations and parking lot within the city of Worcester. 
    During three years, he was a personnel officer whose duties were those of an inspector. 
    It was his duty to see that other officers particularly the uniformed officers carried out their duties, their assignments. 
    At all times, prior to 1945, which is the last of the first years afore which we are here -- which we‘re concerned, his salary was less than $3000. 
    During the indictment years, it went up until it was $4080 during 1950. 
    His wife with whom he had married 1933 did not work and had no income and at no time had any gifts or inheritance of any kind. 
    During the years prior to 1946, the respondent and his wife deposited in banks and spent some of the money greatly in excess of their reported income. 
    At the end of 1945, he and his wife had a net worth of at least $61,000. 
    During the indictment years, the respondent reported income bearing from $3200 to $6000. 
    During the same five years his net worth as was established by proof below, increased by $88,000 to a total of $149,000. 
    This -- there was evidence dividing up these increases by years during the five-year period. 
    Funds were divided among nine different accounts in eight different savings institutions. 
    And both prior and during the indictment period, he purchased and paid a -- for time and annuity contracts in large amounts, each policies over $25,000 -- each of three policies over $25,000 all purchased in cash. 
    And throughout the indictment of five years, he made large purchases in cash continually. 
    There were half a dozen or more of over a thousand dollars each in cash enlisted some of them in the reply brief.

    Mr. Roger D. Fisher 
    Our basic premise is that circumstances in a case may support the inference that increases were taxable income even though by themselves, they might not support proof beyond a reasonable doubt of a particular source. 
    We think the Court -- no, I mean a divide circumstantial evidence up in too many categories which each of which must be proved independently. 
    We think the circumstance here is highly relevant that he was a policeman in Worcester in a position where he could receive grant on the outside.

    The -- the circumstance which should be considered, I'm afraid in the case -- I'm not withdrawing any conclusion from this and you can therefore conclude anything at all. 
    In fact, the court below charged the jury. 
    They could -- there was a presumption that he did not take any bribes during that period.

speaker="roger_d_fisher" startTime="395.033" stopTime="529.158">
    Mr. Roger D. Fisher 
    No, Your Honor. 
    I'm saying that the Court charged the jury below. 
    This is a -- there was a presumption that he did not take bribes that -- unless they found evidence that he did. 
    They had to find out before they could find the source, but we think that the -- it is a circumstance that people have different opportunities for outside income. 
    One more item on the fact that I would like to get across is there were some problems of admissions here. 
    Mr. Garrity, a lawyer represented the respondent during the investigation. 
    On four occasions, once in the presence of the respondent himself and three other times with agents, he told the investigating officers that respondent had received grant while he was on the vice squad. 
    The admissions went further. 
    One of them stated that -- has testified too later that respondent was the number one man responsible for gambling supervision in Worcester. 
    Garrity told the agents that respondent had accumulated a cash hoard through graft prior to 1945. 
    And during the investigation, this was the general explanation of the ending resulting net worth of $149,000 at the end that he had all these in a cash hoard at the beginning. 
    He explained he had a net worth in the beginning about $100,000 to $110,000. 
    This would not have explained the entire resulting net worth and Mr. Garrity stated that respondent had inherited a certain sum from his father, an unspecified sum who quote, “Had saved a lot of cash.” 
    The respondent's father had accumulated a large sum of cash with reference to liquor sales. 
    Investigation showed that respondent had not inherited any cash from his father and he inherited a half interest in the house in which he was then living and that's all. 
    Investigation also indicated he did not have a cash hoard on-hand at the beginning. 
    There were proofs of small loans against his passbook that was cashing in some Government funds which he then spent, things of that kind, indicating that he did not have a large cash hoard on hand.

    Mr. Roger D. Fisher 
    Past income tax returns, there were no income tax returns during the period when the municipal officers were not taxable up to 1939. 
    They would -- their salary was not taxable. 
    There was no outside income reported prior to 1939. 
    From 1940 to 1945, the return showed his salary plus some interest income from dividend and interest on the various accounts which were known. 
    He reported all those accurately as far as investigation could tell. 
    On the stand, Mr. Garrity testified that he has asked the respondent if he had any nontaxable receipts during the five years and that respondent had told him of nothing except a half interest in the house. 
    The jury found the respondent guilty on all five accounts. 
    He was sentenced to two years, $5000 fine which is less than authorized on any one count.

    Mr. Roger D. Fisher 
    A general sentence in total. 
    It was not -- not -- the sentence was not by counts, a gross sentence. 
    The Court of Appeals reversed the conviction. 
    The Court's theory was that proof of a likely source from which the increase of the net worth came with indispensable element in the proof of tax evasion. 
    There are a lot of prior civil case of their own which the suit protects efficiency. 
    The Court found that the admissions of Garrity and the admissions of the respondent himself that he had received graft that a discussion -- conference with Garrity and the respondent together with the agent. 
    They formed a corner stone of the Government's theory, they were -- the Court regard this as crucial and that they had to be corroborated. 
    They then found that there was no independent proof of source and found that therefore there was lack of corroboration. 
    They found that we had to corroborate -- we have to give evidence which would corroborate not only the final conclusion but the -- pin it back to the source. 
    The Court also said that the admissions of graft in prior years would not have been relevant and this was not the main ground but it is covered by their opinion that he could not introduce evidence of one crime to prove another because a man sinned once, he couldn't presume he would sin again and that should have been excluded on that ground. 
    And the Court concluded that the evidence as to the admissions was struck, there was no proof of a likely source. 
    And therefore, a directed verdict should have been entered in favor of the respondent. 
    Because of the conflict in Circuits, the Government petitioned for certiorari which this Court granted. 
    The issues of those, the sufficiency of the evidence to support the conviction in this case and any of the five counts, with particular regard of it, proof of source. 
    There's a subsidiary question as to whether the admissions that respondent took graft were, (a) corroborative and (b) relevant. 
    The case turns on the construction and application to this Court's opinion in Holland against the United States on which both sides consider controlling. 
    I think I can narrow the question from respondent's brief. 
    He agreed that the only issue here is whether or not there was sufficient proof of a likely source. 
    If you turn to page 18 of his brief which I invite your attention, he listed what he considers the five elements where -- in which the Government must sustain the burden of proof. 
    He attempt to evade tax that the attempt was willful, that there was an additional tax owing that -- to establish a starting point with reasonable certainty. 
    The fifth he lists is the Government must introduce evidence to the likely source to account for the increases in net worth. 
    He then states, “This case resolves itself another question of whether the Government satisfied its burden of proving the essential element of a likely source.” 
    We regard this as an agreement with us that the -- there has been proof that the attempt was willful, adequate proof, that there is an additional owing, we tried to evade it and we've established the starting point and that unless proof of the likely source is indispensable, the crime has already been made up. 
    The -- the -- I'm turning to page 20. 
    The first point of his argument states that the Government investigation showed the respondent received no nontaxable receipts. 
    And the -- the heading of his argument that evidence proving no nontaxable receipts does not support the inference that increases in net worth must be attributable to unreported taxable income.

speaker="roger_d_fisher" startTime="986.966" stopTime="1012.397">
    Mr. Roger D. Fisher 
    No. 
    I believe they -- the Court -- the court below in -- before it treated the evidence, the Court of Appeals said, “Proof of a likely source is an indispensable element." 
    And they then said, “Since that this is the corner stone of the Government's case, it must be corroborated, it cannot be proved by admissions of prior crimes which are prejudicial. 
    Strike that.” 
    Then there's no proof of likely source.

    Do you think they do not have to show -- the Government doesn't have to show that it was a likely source?
speaker="roger_d_fisher" startTime="1024.501" stopTime="1195.068">
    Mr. Roger D. Fisher 
    The Government does not have to prove that an in dispense -- as a separate element and a circumstantial evidence, a likely source. 
    We believe that -- that in the Holland case which I'd like to turn. 
    To the Court it was very clear in length considering what were indispensable and what were requisite and what -- or other points that should be born in mind. 
    Now, they said that -- this is in 348 U.S. three years ago and the Court had the Holland case and a group of net worth cases. 
    The Court stated, “We agree with petitioner's essential condition,” in cases of this type with the establishment with reasonable certainty of an opening net worth. 
    There's no question here about the net worth and under two headings later, they say, “Also requisite to the use of the net worth method is evidence supporting the inference.” 
    That is evidence supporting the inference that the defendant's net worth increases are attributable to currently taxable income. 
    The -- in that case, there were -- the petitioners claim that the Government failed to adduce adequate proof, have been negative, all possible nontaxable sources. 
    The Government said to -- the Court said to require the Government in every case to negative all possible sources of being insuperable burden and about proof, increases in net worth standing alone cannot be assumed to be attributable to currently taxable income, proof of a likely source from which the jury could reasonably find net worth increases sprang is sufficient. 
    Now, we read that opinion as not saying, proof of a likely source is indispensable, but that in that case where the Government had failed to disapprove or failed to adduce much proof rebutting nontaxable sources, but they did not have to in the absence of relevant leads by the petitioners there, but could introduce evidence of a likely source. 
    Now, we -- we think that the -- that other evidence maybe equally or more persuasive that in a circumstantial evidence case, it is be a poor idea to put proof of a likely source as a separate structure toward which evidence must be given. 
    Since inherently, if you could prove the source itself, it wouldn't be a net worth case. 
    So, you don't have to prove the source beyond reasonable doubt. 
    No one has suggested that. 
    Petitioners -- the respondents here suggest that the Government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the source is like, but we think that a possible source is not the most persuasive evidence that there can be adduced but other circumstances, may be equally or more persuasive.

    This is a burden on United States, whenever a -- a taxpayer, he could stay solid and make us prove the case, but he have the additional tabs that he can -- that if there -- an innocent taxpayer, he can suggest sources and we -- if they were reasonably capable that the ones that -- are possible of being checked, the Government has a burden of going out with two doors and soon trying to check.

    I think the evidence that he was a policeman and not a statistical clerk is relevant even though you cannot by itself it wouldn't mean a thing. 
    I think the evidence -- he was the head of a vice squad while gambling was in Worcester. 
    It's relevant, but not by itself not enough.

    We read it -- I read it that way that there -- that they -- the -- as to our rebuttal of nontaxable sources and as to our proof of the -- they -- they specifically stated that the net worth opening was established, that the increases were established. 
    I'd like if I may to touch on the -- before -- before I touch on the evidence here of non -- non-taxability, I'd like to just point one further consideration why we think that source should not be picked up as the touchstone of a critical point. 
    It is not what determines taxability. 
    If we had proven the source of these funds to be John Smith, we do not know whether they're taxable or nontaxable. 
    It was a gift or a bribe. 
    If we have proved these funds to come from the Jones Corporation that he wasn't interested in, we wouldn't prove it was a withdrawal of capital or whether it was income. 
    Source is relevant. 
    Proof of source makes it easier for a jury to -- to appreciate the facts and be -- be satisfied that it was taxable, but proof of source is not the crime. 
    The statute doesn't indicate source has anything to do with it. 
    If it's taxable, it makes no difference from what source it came.

    Testimony of his lawyer that he had asked the respondent of any other nontaxable receipts and has responded and only told him of the half interest in the house, not in controversy. 
    The statement of his lawyer representing has found to be authorized that all the funds had been on hand at the beginning of the period.

   Argument of Richard Maguire
speaker="richard_maguire" startTime="1754.296" stopTime="1754.772">
    Mr. Richard Maguire 
    Mr. Chief Justice --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1754.772" stopTime="1756.005">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Maguire.
speaker="richard_maguire" startTime="1756.005" stopTime="1947.496">
    Mr. Richard Maguire 
    -- may it please -- please the Court. 
    I'd like to direct my attention first to the first of three lines of proof which the Government say are in the case which support the conviction. 
    The Government in its brief argues and the trial judge at the Court charged the jury that an increase in net worth plus a negation of nontaxable sources is sufficient on which to base a conviction. 
    I say that clearly under the Holland decision, as well as any other case I have ever read, that that is just not correct law and I have recited in my brief from the opinion of Judge Hand in the Costello case where he talks about just what this Court meant in the Holland decision when it talked about the negation of nontaxable sources. 
    And I think if I may just to read briefly to you just what he says with which I wholly concur, he states however, it is not that it does not follow that all the taxpayer expended was necessarily taxable income or indeed income of any kind. 
    Conceding something for the difficulty of establishing by impregnable proof, how much was an income? 
    The Court is satisfied with proof of a likely source from which the jury could reasonably find that the net worth increases sprang. 
    Through a likely source may not be the true source so that it is necessary in addition to exclude the possibility that what he received did not come from gifts, inheritances or loans. 
    Now, in this case, the only evidence that was introduced as to a likely source were these admissions, which I will come to in a minute, I would like to go -- go ahead to state that the Court of Appeals said on two grounds, one of relevance and one of lack of corroboration that these admissions should not have been received and therefore, it should have been a -- it should have been a directed verdict. 
    And they specifically state in their opinion that they do not disagree or do not either agree or disagree with the Adonis decision of the four decisions. 
    In other words, they never came to that point, but that is the first line of proof which the Government apparently argues and as I say as the trial court charged the jury that simply showing the bulge plus the negation of nontaxable sources that that's sufficient in which to base a conviction.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="1947.496" stopTime="1957.047">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Do you mean by that that the Court of Appeals said that whether a likely source is necessary or not with this other evidence out, the case is insufficient?
speaker="richard_maguire" startTime="1957.047" stopTime="2347.791">
    Mr. Richard Maguire 
    Exactly.They never got to that question. 
    The second argument which was also charged by the trial judge is the fact that the defendant through his attorney made a calculated fabrication such as we find in the Adonis case. 
    During the course of arguing what the district counsel of Internal Revenue, Mr. Garrity representing the taxpayer, stated that in the year 1949, his client received a sum of money from his father's estate, cash. 
    Mr. (Inaudible) was the district counsel says there was no amount mentioned. 
    He says it was X dollars. 
    Mr. Hirst who was the intelligence agent also at present, his testimony was that no sum was mentioned. 
    That is what the Government argues and the District Court charged is a calculated fabrication such as we find in the Adonis case. 
    The Court of -- the court below, the Court of Appeals said, “We find without agreeing or disagreeing with the Adonis decision that that evidence is just not that calculated fabrication.” 
    So that we don't have to have to come to the question as to whether we agree or disagree with the Adonis case and the Adonis case is a -- the defendant was indicted for tax evasion in the year 1948. 
    The increase in assets was sum of $38,000 which was represented by the purchase of a house. 
    And it seems that Mr. Adonis testified in a judicial proceeding in Holland in the year 1951 and he was in -- asked as to the source of the same $38,000. 
    And he gave explanation as to where he got the money, getting it from three different sources. 
    His mother gave him some, the Government at the tax trial, a year or two later proved beyond any question that the mother was impoverished and a very elderly lady living with her -- one of her daughters. 
    Secondly, there was a question of a highly, just from reading, at a highly fictitious loan and to sum it up very briefly, they completely exploded in the tax trial. 
    Mr. Adonis' explanation is advanced in this Holland judicial proceeding. 
    The Court in the Third Circuit held that that calculated fabrication could be in effect a substitute for the likely source as I understand it is demanded by the Holland case. 
    Now, if I may at this point, go back to what I understand, this Court meant in terms of the decisions prior to the Holland case and the Holland case itself as to what was meant by proof of a likely source. 
    That was done under the cases in one of two ways. 
    First, you show that the taxpayer was in an income producing business, witness the Holland case where he's in a hotel business, the Johnson case where the taxpayer owned a string of gambling houses. 
    The second item is by evidence of specific items of undisclosed income and two illustrations of that is the Chapman case, all of these are cited in the brief, Chapman case where they brought in witnesses that they were paying the defendant over this in-cash, over the ceiling black market payments. 
    In the Skidmore case where the -- where they were paying protection, the bookmakers were paying protection to these fellows on a monthly basis. 
    Now, we filed in this case a motion for bill of particulars and the Government in answer to our bill of particulars as to the question of source, specify that the source of the income in this case were illegal payments received by the defendant in the course of his duties from various people engaged in illegal activities. 
    Well, as far as were concerned, we had no doubt in the world what they were going to introduce evidence of specific payments to him during the prosecution years of graft or bribes, whatever you call it. 
    There is not one eye order of evidence in the case of anything of that nature, not -- not an eye order. 
    At the morning of the trial and now I'm coming to the question to these admissions. 
    On the morning of the trial, we learned for the first time that the Government intends to prove the source in this case basically through admissions of the taxpayer's attorney. 
    Now, those occurred on three different occasions. 
    In the course of the investigation, of course Mr. Garrity representing the taxpayer was in constant touch with Mr. Hirst who was the intelligence agent and you will find from reading the record that in effect, there's no dispute about the assets or the increases in assets which occurred during the indictment years. 
    In fact, all of that information was furnished to the Government by Mr. Garrity acting on behalf of the taxpayer. 
    The issue was always that Mr. -- that -- the -- the defendant had this money in his possession at the start of the period. 
    Mr. Garrity pointed out that he was on the vice squad on three different occasions prior to 1945 which is the starting period in this case. 
    He was on it for some 10 months back in 1932. 
    He was on it for a year and eight months in 1938. 
    And from 1940 to 1943, some three years, he was in charge of the vice squad.

    Mr. Richard Maguire 
    Yes, the respondent's counsel. 
    And his whole approach was if he had -- if this money did not come when he was relegated to in charging of peddler's licenses or looking after the physical plant as a police officer. 
    It came -- if it came at all, it came back there. 
    Now, Mr. Garrity testified on the stand that he had no personal knowledge of the defendant's activities. 
    That never concerned him. 
    And the only thing that was -- concerned him is the defendant's counsel was -- what he did, did he get any graft during the years under indictment? 
    In any event, the Government seeks to introduce these admissions made by Mr. Garrity to prove likely source. 
    At the trial, they were objected to on the grounds that they're irrelevant. 
    Secondly, they're objected to in the grounds of materiality that -- secondly, they're objected to in the grounds of incompetence that whatever knowledge Mr. Garrity would have of Mr. Massei's activities would obviously come to him by a reason of his attorney-client relationship and he certainly would be a violation of that to disclose it. 
    Secondly, that there was no proof in the case and there was a great deal of time spent on this in the record. 
    There is no proof at all in the case that Mr. Garrity was authorized to make these admissions.

    The third occasion is a conference with Mr. Isba, the district counsel and Mr. Hirst where Mr. Garrity is endeavoring to convince Mr. Isba that the Government did not have a case and that it should not be recommended for prosecution. 
    And he in effect goes into this conference and makes a lawyer's argument and says in effect, well, look at this man -- have this money of the -- he didn't get it during the indictment years.

    Can a client restrict his lawyer to make an admission for a limited purpose and if later what the client or the lawyer said to that limited purpose offered in a criminal case, made by the client that objects his introduction as exceeding, as breaking the relationship because the relationship is allowed to be made public only to that (Inaudible)

    Mr. Richard Maguire 
    Well, I -- I think to some extent, Your Honor. 
    We have, I think, two other very substantial grounds, one is relevance and one is lack of corroboration, but on that question, I would agree with you, Your Honor and I would like to point out that during the trial, we endeavor to bring out that all certain hypothetical statements which Garrity made in terms of arguing his case to Isba. 
    And at the early stage of that, that was all excluded by the trial judge as being not important. 
    And of course, what we were trying to bring out was that Garrity in effect was making illegal argument here. 
    He was citing cases, for instance, this one specific illustration. 
    I asked Mr. Garrity in the stand, “Well, did you cite some cases to Mr. Isba on this question of source and showing that you have to prove a likely source during the prosecution period that was excluded?” 
    Later, at the very end of the testimony, he did allow us at the very end to put in some of it that by and large most of it was excluded.

    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Did I correctly understand you (Inaudible) to say that Mr. Garrity had said in these discussions with the (Inaudible) that he had no personal knowledge of the facts?
speaker="richard_maguire" startTime="2867.977" stopTime="2885.964">
    Mr. Richard Maguire 
    No. 
    There is no testimony. 
    He testified to that himself on the stand in the case, but his testimony as to what transpired at this conference, Your Honor is simply that he was making an illegal argument.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="2885.964" stopTime="2888.634">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Yes, but at the trial he testified.
speaker="richard_maguire" startTime="2888.634" stopTime="3093.842">
    Mr. Richard Maguire 
    He testified flatly that he had no personal knowledge whatsoever of Massei's activities in the pre-indictment years. 
    On the question of lack of corroboration, at the close of the Government's case, we move to strike all these evidence if not having been corroborated and it -- it went in and the judge charged the jury that you can find corroboration which means some sort of independent evidence which strengthens your belief it's true. 
    We submit on this that there is no -- no evidence whatsoever of corroboration. 
    The Government argues that in the pre-indictment years or they start them off with an opening net worth of $61,000 and they say that because he had a very limited salary not more than $3000 in his 20, almost 20 years that he was on the police force that he in effect couldn't have accumulated this money. 
    I would point out to you that his salary as a municipal employee down to 1939 was exempt. 
    In addition to that, of course he had the usual $2000 exemption which was in effect at that time. 
    His living standard would have cost him to live according to the Government's evidence which was introduced in 1945 was $1300 so that we have, as I say it, he could have very well during that period have saved at least $2500 a year. 
    Furthermore, let -- let me if I may come to this question of relevance and I'm not going to dwell on it. 
    It's covered in the Court of Appeals below and in our brief. 
    And the basic proposition is simply if I rob a man's apple tree 10 years ago, cannot be introduced in evidence against me on the charge that I robbed this man's apple tree or robbed an apple tree today. 
    And I say under the cases and the Court of Appeals stated that definitely that cannot be done. 
    I think in conclusion, if I may please, incidentally in terms of -- I think Justice Black's question. 
    As I see it, this Court will very definitely have to read the entire record. 
    As I see it that this evidence -- this evidence of the admissions should have been excluded and without that, I say there is absolutely nothing on the record to support this conviction on the proof of a likely source. 
    Now, as I pointed out before and I'd like to say it again in conclusion of the court below never reached that conclusion and they say and I'll read if I may -- well, I can't put my finger on it, but, well the court below said in its opinion at page 905, “We have mentioned the Adonis case above and the Second Circuit Ford case earlier in this opinion. 
    We do not mean to infer that we either approve or disapprove of the exceptions to the necessity of proving likely source that this holding seemed to have established.”

    The jury was charged in the alternative that they had to find likely source for most years or for those years after his father died that if they found that the story was false and it was a delivered fabrication intended to convey a material evasion of where his funds were, the story inherited money from his father who have a lot of cash.

    Where is the -- what was the evidence of authorization to make that statement?
speaker="roger_d_fisher" startTime="3269.862" stopTime="3352.635">
    Mr. Roger D. Fisher 
    The -- there was -- about half of the trial was devoted to authorization of these points. 
    The evidence was that Mr. Garrity's whole course of conduct was to not to let the agent see respondent but to have factual matters conveyed through him. 
    He admits and counsel concedes that every time in the repeated letters which he stated -- which Mr. Garrity stated something, Garrity -- that is a binding admission authorized by the lawyer if it's in writing. 
    The judge asked Garrity on the stand. 
    If he would have spoken to the agent, if he had not been authorized to speak orally as well as in writing and he said you -- that's a fair assumption that I was authorized to speak, there was testimony, powers of attorney. 
    It was admitted that a power of attorney -- if it's undoubted testimony, the power -- general power of attorney that it had -- a power of attorney of undefined terms have been filed and Garrity testified to these bribe takings in the presence of respondent that he had received grant during prohibition error by charging every truck that rolled out (Inaudible) and so much of each truck. 
    This was made in the presence of the respondent. 
    This issue was first passed on a 100-page of the record of (Inaudible). 
    The judge found and authorized and he then decided to protect the respondent and was submitted to the jury, charged and they must find it authorized. 
    The jury found it authorized --

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    What is the relevancy of that to what had occurred in prohibition?
speaker="roger_d_fisher" startTime="3357.956" stopTime="3370.720">
    Mr. Roger D. Fisher 
    Showing -- the relevancy of that is it showed that respondent authorized Garrity to make statements about his prior receipts prior to the opening net worth. 
    That's -- that's why it's definitely a question of authority.

speaker="roger_d_fisher" startTime="3372.970" stopTime="3443.926">
    Mr. Roger D. Fisher 
    That was the general contention. 
    There was no ever any contention that any nontaxable receipts came into the -- the estate. 
    If I may answer one question of Justice Black, Your Honor, the -- you asked, if you would find the admissions admissible, we think they are of course.I 
    f you find them admissible, what would you do with case? 
    The -- the Court of Appeals on -- this is on page 32 of our petition where the section of the opinion is printed. 
    Concluded -- they said, “The Government had to present some evidence of actual graft taking or opportunity for such in order to establish the element of likely source. 
    Since it failed to do this, the District Court should have stricken the evidence concerning the admissions in the record. 
    So, under the test as they construed to the Holland case as requiring proof of the likely source is indispensable. 
    They also construed that as requiring directed evidence of taking money from that source. 
    So, under their view, our case would not be sufficient even with the admissions and under their standard if they construed the case.
