    Mr. George J. Todaro 
    May -- Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    I don't want to transgress on the previous case but I had an idea with regard to these so-called beeps that are heard on the telephone. 
    The reason for it is to indicate to the other party to the telephone that there is --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="37.213" stopTime="37.422">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Yes.
speaker="george_j_todaro" startTime="37.422" stopTime="38.581">

    -- a tap going on --

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Sure.
speaker="george_j_todaro" startTime="38.635" stopTime="48.463">
    Mr. George J. Todaro 
    -- and that's a very obvious reason therefore the person knows that there is a telephone message being tapped in an indirect manner.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="48.463" stopTime="49.818">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Yes.
speaker="george_j_todaro" startTime="49.818" stopTime="201.597">
    Mr. George J. Todaro 
    I wanted to get down to this case. 
    In this case, the petitioner was convicted of violating the federal act in that he had in his possession, 11 cans of alcohol without proper stamps affixed thereto and in transporting those 11 cans of alcohol. 
    A part of this situation, if Your Honor please, is that the police of the State of New York, pursuant to the authority of the State of New York and the law of the State of New York, had tapped a bar known as the Reno Bar. 
    And on May the 10th, a message was intercepted wherein the petitioner informed someone else that 11 pieces was going that night. 
    The officers -- the state officers thought that the 11 pieces meant 11 pieces of narcotics, and following that interception and that – that and having obtained that information, they followed the car and when they stopped the car and arrested the driver, instead of 11 pieces of narcotics, they found 11 cans of unpacked alcohol, thereupon -- thereupon turned over to the federal authorities for prosecution. 
    Now, the heart of this question -- this case is whether a federal statute that prohibits both interception and divulgence of a telephone message and which goes on to the -- to prohibit the -- the use of intercepted message thus it's used in the federal court. 
    It seems to me that every case that I've read up to the present time even this last case, the Rathbun case. 
    They started with the principle that the state officer could not testify. 
    Otherwise then they -- they wouldn't have to go on to the next question as to whether it constituted an interception.

    Mr. George J. Todaro 
    -- statute. 
    Now, we get down to the question as to whether a state officer may testify in a federal court. 
    We know, Your Honors, all know that the Nardone case, the first Nardone case and the second Nardone case have answered this question very clearly. 
    In the first Nardone case, the Court -- this Court stated, the plain words of 605 forbid anyone unless authorized by the sender to intercept the telephone message and direct in equally clear language that no person shall divulge the message to any person, to recite the contents of the message in testimony before the court, is to divulge the message. 
    The Act forbids that, such testimony. 
    It thus does becomes a -- a play with words if we say that the Nardone represents the laws of the State of New York -- the United States as enunciated by this Court that by reason of the fact that this particular tap was made by state officer and the testimony is being made by a state officer that it puts it out of the protection of 605.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="362.654" stopTime="369.442">
    Unknown Speaker 
    And in your point here that the -- that Act should make no distinction between state officers and federal officers or anybody else.
speaker="george_j_todaro" startTime="369.442" stopTime="370.448">
    Mr. George J. Todaro 
    The statute --

speaker="george_j_todaro" startTime="370.703" stopTime="390.677">
    Mr. George J. Todaro 
    -- is so crystal clear, Your Honor that it can't possibly make -- make any distinction. 
    The statute says no person, not being authorized by the sender shall intercept and divulge a communication to any person. 
    Now, no person, to my mind, is zero and you can't make anything out of zero but zero.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="390.677" stopTime="408.854">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Well, assuming -- assuming that a state officer could not divulge the communication itself in a federal court, does it necessarily follow that he also can't divulge the fruits of the communication.

    Mr. George J. Todaro 
    This is the facts as stated by the Government. 
    There is no dispute as to the fact, the facts are fully recited in the opinion of the lower court, that is, the Second Circuit Court. 
    The Government in its brief here, in the recitation of the fact states as follows. 
    “The New York City Police, believing the petitioner and his brother were violating state law by dealing in narcotics, obtained a warrant to tap the telephone of the Reno Bar in New York City, frequently used by the Benantis. 
    On May the 10th", I'm reading from page 6 of the Government's brief, if Your Honor please. 
    “On May 10th, 1956 the state police intercepted a message between petitioner and another person to the effect that 11 pieces was to be transported that night. 
    So there was an interception of a message which gave the police a clue that something was going to happen that night. 
    Acting on this information, the police stopped the car driven by the petitioner's brother, Angelo Benanti. 
    They did not find any narcotics but did find eleven five-gallon cans of unpacked alcohol. 
    Federal authorities were notified and this prosecution followed and it may be of interest to this Court that the lower court, the Circuit Court made this -- made this observation in -- in its decision. 
    But it is equally clear that what, for the wiretap there would have been no basis for any prosecution whatsoever as the apprehension of Angelo and the seizure of the 11 pieces led to the discovery of appellant's participation in the violation of the federal law for which he had been convicted and the sequence, of course, in effect is clear. 
    There is -- this is an (Inaudible) there has been an interception and the fruit of the poisonous tree or the tree itself was brought into court in the form of 11 cans of alcohol.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="561.999" stopTime="575.462">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Well, the tree and the fruit, there was no testimony here, as I understand it, by the state officers as to what they heard over the wires, am I right?
speaker="george_j_todaro" startTime="575.462" stopTime="637.127">
    Mr. George J. Todaro 
    No, no, Your Honor. 
    If I may say – we -- we went up on -- on a very short statement of facts here because the U.S. Attorney and I agreed on this -- on the fact. 
    There was a testimony by the district attorney of New York County who obtained the order from the New York Supreme Court to authorize the tap of this Reno Bar. 
    The district attorney testified for the conversations. 
    In fact, the Court wanted to caution me not to have it brought in because it involved the word narcotics. 
    You understand? 
    And the district attorney testified that there was a tap, that the conversation was that 11 pieces were going and that the car was followed and they said they found 11 cans of alcohol. 
    The record is not completely, but it's conceded, it was was admitted in the –- in the lower court. 
    It was so agreed that the U.S. Attorney's brief followed the same principle in the lower court and the lower court so found in its decision --

    The Government.

speaker="george_j_todaro" startTime="645.041" stopTime="652.610">
    Mr. George J. Todaro 
    Well the Government brought -- it meant to justify the -- the tap because they wanted to show that this tap was authorized --
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="652.610" stopTime="653.534">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    For whatever the reason is --
speaker="george_j_todaro" startTime="653.534" stopTime="653.719">
    Mr. George J. Todaro 
    Yes.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="653.719" stopTime="654.563">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    -- it was on the Government's case --
speaker="george_j_todaro" startTime="654.563" stopTime="655.023">
    Mr. George J. Todaro 
    The Government's part --
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="655.023" stopTime="655.822">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    -- as the result came in?
speaker="george_j_todaro" startTime="655.822" stopTime="779.263">
    Mr. George J. Todaro 
    That's -- that's the Government's part. 
    So though factually, there's no disagreement. 
    There was no disagreement in the Circuit Court of Appeals and there's no disagreement (Inaudible) in the case. 
    And the brief by the Government indicates that there is no dispute as to the facts. 
    Now, in answer to the Justice's remark with regards to the fruit of the poisonous tree, the second Nardone case covers that. 
    Before I get to that, in the first Nardone case, we have the clue and the answer as to why Congress passed 605. 
    And this Court stated, the answer to the question is one of policy. 
    The Congress may have thought it less important that some offender should go on with the justice than that the officers should resort to the methods, inconsistent with ethical standing -- standards and destructive of personal limit. 
    Now, that I think is the crux of the thinking beyond Congress and by this Court that it would be destructive of ethical standards. 
    Those are ethical standards that Congress adopted for the whole of the United States, not just a portion. 
    Now, in the second Nardone case, this Court stated, the essence of a provision forbidding the acquisition of evidence in a certain way is that -- that merely the evidence shall not be used before the Court but that -- that it shall not be used at all. 
    That it is no evidence, it cannot be admitted before the Court nor can it be used at all. 
    That is strong language by this Court and it's sound language because it intended to do away with this -- the evils of wiretapping and that it intended --

    Mr. George J. Todaro

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    I was trying to ask you now try to distinguish --
speaker="george_j_todaro" startTime="813.178" stopTime="839.756">
    Mr. George J. Todaro 
    In the Weeks case, the violation -- the violation involved there was a Fourth Amendment, unlawful search and seizure. 
    And the unlawful search and seizure being the Fourth Amendment, the first eight Amendments were prohibitions. 
    They were limitations rather. 
    They were imposed on the Federal Government as the price for ratification of the Constitution. 
    Those were limitation imposed on -- upon the Federal --

    Government.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="840.409" stopTime="847.126">

    -- that, were the state officers who were guilty of those unlawful searches and seizures, do they violate federal law?
speaker="george_j_todaro" startTime="847.126" stopTime="868.624">
    Mr. George J. Todaro 
    No, because there is nothing in the Fourth Amendment that says that -- that the evidence C shall not be used in Court, that's only by judicial implication. 
    The Court made that rule. 
    In the Weeks case by judicial implication, the Court said if a federal officer makes an unlawful search and seizure it shall not be used in the federal court.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="868.624" stopTime="876.341">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Well, the jury's distinction here then, that the state officers in that instance are not guilty of violations of federal law were as innocent.
speaker="george_j_todaro" startTime="876.341" stopTime="876.754">
    Mr. George J. Todaro 
    They are.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="876.754" stopTime="883.261">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    The interception of the telephone call was a violation of federal law even though authorized under state procedure.
speaker="george_j_todaro" startTime="883.261" stopTime="905.193">
    Mr. George J. Todaro 
    That is correct sir and the lower court so held too. 
    Judge -- Judge Medina said the sooner the officer testified despite the fact that he did it pursuant to the laws of the State of New York, as soon as he divulged, he violated the federal law. 
    And there's no -- no possible doubt as to that because the statute is so clear.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="905.193" stopTime="912.161">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr.

speaker="george_j_todaro" startTime="912.161" stopTime="930.770">
    Mr. George J. Todaro 
    Oh, no. 
    The evidence is inadmissible in the federal court. 
    In a federal court, as soon as the officer testifies and divulges, he is committing a violation of 605 in the presence of the Court. 
    In other words --
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="930.770" stopTime="932.682">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr.

    Mr. George J. Todaro 
    Yes. 
    And -- and I say Justice that as soon as the officer testified in -- in the Court and divulged the conversation, he was violating Section 605 of the Communication Act.

speaker="george_j_todaro" startTime="955.888" stopTime="989.761">
    Mr. George J. Todaro 
    Because they distinguished it -- I -- I think that the -- the mistake they made is they -- that they likened it to unlawful search and seizure. 
    Now, unlawful search and seizure is not the same as 605. 
    605, is the statute's specific, crystal clear and admits of no doubts while the Fourth Amendment merely said that no -- no the -- the home of the person shall be secured against unlawful search and seizure.

    That's right and Irvine versus California. 
    Now, there are some question with regard to the case of Schwartz versus Texas and that is being urged as an example as to why this evidence was proper -- properly admitted. 
    But there is a distinction in Schwartz versus Texas. 
    In that case, the State of Texas prosecuted the petitioner Schwartz for a state crime of robbery. 
    The officer testified to a telephone conversation which was intercepted. 
    One of the confederates in that particular case made an arrangement to have a telephone call with Schwartz and the officer would listen in and made a recording of that conversation. 
    At the trial, the petitioner Schwartz objected to the introduction of evidence in the state court of that testimony because it violated 605. 
    The Court allowed in an evidence and the case ultimately came up to the United States Supreme Court where they affirmed the conviction. 
    Of course, I believe Mr. Justice Douglas dissented (Inaudible) 
    In that case, this Court held -- held, we hold that 605 applies only to exclusion in federal court proceedings of evidence obtained and sought to be divulged in violation thereof. 
    It does not exclude such evidence in a state court proceeding since we do not believe that Congress intended to impose a rule of evidence under state courts, we do not decide whether they have the power to do so.

   Argument of John F. Davis
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1475.584" stopTime="1487.196">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Davis, would you address yourself first to that -- that particular question? 
    Did they testify at the trial to what the conversation was?
speaker="john_f_davis" startTime="1487.196" stopTime="1596.092">
    Mr. John F. Davis 
    Mr. Chief Justice, if the Court please. 
    On direct examination, the police officers were called to testify with respect to possession and transportation of the alcohol. 
    They were called by the U.S. Attorney on the direct case. 
    When the Government got through with the direct examination of the first police officer of the call, Mr. Todaro on cross-examination, may I say that there is no printed record in this case as it came up, you'll recollect the Court granted certiorari and it came up in this brief quickly so there is a transcript -- this is what I'm reading from here at the appendix in the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, which is a copy of the transcript which is on file with the clerk, although it has not been printed because of no -- no opportunity to do so. 
    Then, Mr. Todaro, on cross-examination said, "Officer, you were in the vicinity of this Reno Bar quite frequently?" 
    "Yes, sir." 
    "Did the Police Department have a tap on the Reno Bar, if you know?" 
    And the police officers, "Yes, they have several taps on the Reno Bar." 
    Then Mr. Todaro, on -- as a basis for objecting to the testimony and raising his objection brought out this information with respect to the tap and there is no question that when the next officer came up there was also the discussion with respect for the tap. 
    This, however, was not a part of the Government's case. 
    It didn't help to prove the Government's case anything that was in the -- in the conversation. 
    It was brought out as a objection as the basis for an objection to receiving the evidence in that -- the information in evidence.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="1596.092" stopTime="1611.106">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Yes, but apart from that, was the subject matter of the conversation testified? 
    Did it come out or as to it's ever intent -- did it come out of the trial or just a mere fact that there was a tap.

    Let me see if I can find the 11 pieces. 
    I don't think it's in this -- in this appendix.

    It was until cross-examination and the defendant brought it out as part of its defense, as part of its objection to the interference -- to the acceptance to this evidence that the United States Attorney knew that there'd been an interception.

    Both of you rely on Weeks.

    That the Weeks also -- and we mean that -- that as against that -- the fact that state officials not collaborating or being the catch for or acting under federal authority obtain illegal evidence.

    Mr. John F. Davis 
    That is right. 
    I'd like to move, if I may, to the question of whether or not there was a violation of 605 because if there was no violation, then we've -- we have none of these problems. 
    The New York statute is specific that -- it's -- it's found in its Constitution and its Code of Criminal Procedure and it specifically provides for the issuance of a warrant by a court on application under oath showing probable cause of the necessity of intercepting telephone message. 
    The length of time which the warrant can be used is -- is limited by statute. 
    It was under this particular application, under this particular law that this New York City police made this interception. 
    They did apply to the New York Court. 
    They got a warrant. 
    They listened pursuant to the warrant. 
    So, this case raises, very squarely, the question of whether or not that New York procedure is outlawed by Section 605 of the -- of the Communications Act. 
    Now, it's also clear that Section 605, in language, covers everyone. 
    If it's to be read literally, it applies to the judge who issues the warrants and the policeman who -- who listened to the call because it makes no exception for -- for anybody. 
    But in dealing with a problem of balancing federal and state legislation, this intergovernmental problems, it is not infrequent to -- for the Court to interpret what appeared to be blanket prohibitions so as to permit the States to apply their local policies. 
    Let me give you an example, an old example. 
    There's been on the statute for many years a law which says that nobody shall interfere with the -- the carriage of the mails. 
    Many years ago in Philadelphia, the local law officials found a man driving sleigh down Chestnut Street without any bells on the sleigh and proceeding in an unlawful rate of speed. 
    And the local law official arrested the mail carrier. 
    And the question came up before Justice Washington sitting on the Circuit, as to whether or not, the blanket prohibition against the interference with the mail covered the -- this interference by the local law official. 
    And --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2882.980" stopTime="2886.363">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    And this man, an employee or a contractor.
speaker="john_f_davis" startTime="2886.363" stopTime="2887.379">
    Mr. John F. Davis 
    He was an employee --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2887.379" stopTime="2887.543">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Employee?
speaker="john_f_davis" startTime="2887.543" stopTime="2888.883">
    Mr. John F. Davis 
    I mean he was a regular --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2888.883" stopTime="2889.406">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Regular employee --
speaker="john_f_davis" startTime="2889.406" stopTime="2961.004">
    Mr. John F. Davis 
    -- as far as it appears, he was a regular employee. 
    At least there's nothing in the case that would indicate that there was any -- anything different. 
    This case that I refer to was the United States against Hart and I quote on page 16 of our brief from Justice Washington's construction of the Act to say that it would be unreasonable to apply the Act with this kind of a stoppage. 
    Now, that's an old case. 
    There's been more recent cases that -- that apply the same thing. 
    One fairly recent case is the Penn Dairies case, Penn Dairies against Milk Control Commission in 318 United States where there was a blanket law that said that military installation should buy their -- their supplies by competitive bidding. 
    It's a blanket regulation. 
    The question of -- which arose here was whether the Penn Dairies which was subject to a local law as to milk control, setting prices, whether they -- whether the -- the competitive bidding requirement apply.

    Mr. John F. Davis 
    Well, that -- I am not -- my argument -- all right so I got to accept it that I mean it -- it is the law and -- and it does not seem to me inconsistent with the position that I am taking. 
    In -- it's been possible to -- to separate interstate and intrastate communications over an interstate system as the telephone system is. 
    And when there is wiretapping, it maybe interstate and it maybe intrastate and 605 applies to both, at least this Section, this clause of 605 applies to both. 
    But that does not mean that local state officials may not be exempted from the prohibition and I'm -- I'm not even suggesting that they are limited to the interception of intrastate communications because when they listened under one of these warrants, they can't tell whether it's going to be intrastate or interstate that they are intercepting. 
    But what they are doing is, in -- in pursuant to the New York State's provisions for law enforcement and pursuant to a warrant of the Court, they are in New York and without preventing the -- the system from operating, they are listening in on interstate or intrastate messages to this -- to this bar. 
    This, we say, since it is pursuant to a local law enforcement policy, is not forbidden by 605 of the -- of the Communications Act.

    Violation of the Act.
speaker="john_f_davis" startTime="3102.002" stopTime="3248.470">
    Mr. John F. Davis 
    In violation of 605 of the Act. 
    Well, but not under any specific authority of -- of law, of Congress. 
    May I say this, that the Nardone case itself, the first Nardone case says that there is no -- that it applies to law officials, as to others that the prohibition does, applies across the board to everybody. 
    But it was not there dealing with a case of any specific government authority to intercept, as we have in this case. 
    In Nardone, the -- the officers were -- were intercepting as part of their law enforcement but without any -- they were federal officers and obviously there was no specific authority given to them to -- to intercept. 
    So, we feel that -- that the -- the fact that this Legislature of New York and specifically dealt with this problem, considered that it is necessary to their local law enforcement, should lead this Court to consider very carefully, whether or not these two laws can be reconciled or whether they are irreconcilable. 
    If they are irreconcilable, of course, the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution must control and the -- the Constitution and the law of -- of New York must be held invalid. 
    But one doesn't arrive at a conclusion like that if it is possible by construction to -- to let both of them stand together. 
    In passing the Communications Act, Congress was very -- was very insistent that the State's interest in telephone communications should continue to be recognized that it felt this was a -- this was -- and utility in which they were both federal and state aspects and that the Federal Government – that the Congress was very careful not to preempt the entire field. 
    They said we want to save for the States certain amount of regulation and certain amount of -- of local autonomy. 
    And it seems entirely consistent with -- with that general policy, although they didn't deal with this problem -- specific problem before United States, specifically. 
    It seems only consistent with that if they would have intended that a local law permitting interception under court warrant would be -- should be -- should be legal.

    Suppose Mr. Davis that instead of having a positive law such as New York had permitting officers to use these wiretaps say, they have the policy of permitting them to do it without having any law against wiretap, would the situation be the same here?
speaker="john_f_davis" startTime="3269.925" stopTime="3298.560">
    Mr. John F. Davis 
    That would be much closer to the Nardone case itself. 
    It would be possible in a -- in -- in that case to -- to draw a distinction when you have a state official doing it in accordance with the state policy. 
    But by and large, the first Nardone case says that law officials, like anybody else, would be subject to the Act.

    I think it comes from reading the -- the dissents -- the dissents in the -- on -- on the original Olmstead case.

speaker="george_j_todaro" startTime="4250.400" stopTime="4346.649">
    Mr. George J. Todaro 
    That's this Murphy, the district attorney of New York County testified to the actual divulgence and these 11 pieces was not -- was not obtained as a figment of the imagination of anyone. 
    It was conceded by everyone. 
    The U.S. Attorney conceded. 
    The Circuit Court of Appeals knew that that was brought out at the trial. 
    And there was no question about it. 
    Even the Solicitor General in his brief refers to 11 pieces going -- where do these 11 pieces go and come from? 
    It took part during the trial as an officer of the court would make a statement of this sort unless he knew that it happened. 
    Now, the -- the -- and the Circuit Court judge in his review of the facts, page 3A of the appendix says -- states, “On May 10th, 1956 by listening in on a conversation over the telephone between appellant and some other person, the state police learned that 11 pieces will be transported that night at a certain time and place in New York City.” 
    Now, this is just Medina talking. 
    He'd learned that -- he states that the police learned that 11 pieces were going. 
    Well, that must transpired the -- that it'd taken place during the trial that somebody testified 11 pieces were going that -- that night and that's exactly why they followed the car. 
    They thought they're going to get 11 pieces of narcotic instead they found 11 cans of alcohol. 
    Now, then there's no dispute about that. 
    I don't think there's any serious dispute on the part of the Government that this conversation -- that this tap didn't take place, that this conversation wasn't overheard and this wasn't testified to in Court.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="4346.649" stopTime="4351.812">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    You mean that they'd testified to actually what they overheard.
speaker="george_j_todaro" startTime="4351.812" stopTime="4480.011">
    Mr. George J. Todaro 
    Correct. 
    Other -- otherwise, how would Justice Medina say that on May 10th, 1956, by listening in on a conversation on the telephone between the appellant and some other person, the state police officer learned that 11 pieces would be transported that night at a certain time and place in New York City? 
    Having heard that conversation over a tapped telephone, they followed that car and then they were disappointed. 
    They only found 11 cans of alcohol and they couldn't make an arrest for narcotics. 
    Now, as far as the record is concerned, if Your Honor wants to -- I need to go by and get all the record and file a supplemental brief, all right. 
    But I don't think it's necessary because all along the line, the U.S. Attorney has conceded the tap, it has conceded the divulgence. 
    The only question is that I brought out the tap. 
    Sure enough, I might have brought it out when I questioned the police officers as to whether there was a tap on the telephone and that they got some information on the telephone. 
    And having got that information, they followed this car. 
    They overheard something and they followed the car. 
    But how else can I bring about -- how else could I proceed under the second Nardone case it's incumbent upon me to first -- to establish that there was a tap. 
    Now, in this case, if Your Honors please, I have exactly 10 minutes preparation. 
    There was another attorney involved. 
    There was a conflict of interest in the last minute, I was in the case and Judge Walsh wouldn't consent to an adjournment and I borrowed a piece of paper from the U.S. Attorney to -- to proceed with the trial. 
    I know nothing about the case. 
    So, when I got up to cross examine, I don't know, something hit me maybe there was a wiretap and I asked the foolish question and just expected to get a big no, when I got a big yes. 
    And then I had something to -- to play ball, start the cycle. 
    Now, with regard to the validity of the statute of New York --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="4480.011" stopTime="4487.786">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    So, that explains -- that explains the answer to the question of -- the Chief Justice's question. 
    There was no motion to suppress.
speaker="george_j_todaro" startTime="4487.786" stopTime="4491.820">
    Mr. George J. Todaro

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Yes.
speaker="george_j_todaro" startTime="4500.212" stopTime="4649.513">
    Mr. George J. Todaro 
    -- to suppress it via divulgence, Mr. Chief Justice. 
    As to the question of the -- the valid -- the conflict between the state law and the United -- in 605, we did not really raise that issue. 
    The Government raised it. 
    I presume because of Justice Medina's ruling that the -- as soon as the officer testified, he violated a federal act. 
    I'm inclined to agree with the court below because the two -- two statutes are diametrically opposed to each other and both cannot survive. 
    One is destructive of the other because one says no person shall intercept, and it doesn't mean except the office of the State of New York, while the other will say, we may intercept under certain condition. 
    Now, this is a law of general application. 
    If it -- it involves the whole United States. 
    It does not exclude the State of New York from its -- from abiding by it and the legislature of the State of New York cannot put Congress out of business by legislating in a different way. 
    It would seem to me that they're -- that they're diametrically opposed and there's a be conflict that must be resolved in favor of the Congress of the United States and the policy of the Congress of the United States. 
    Now, may I add and close here that there have been repeated attempts made to outlaw wire -- that is to amend 605 by permitting limited wiretapping by Congress. 
    And the omission being that despite the pressure from our -- some of our governmental agencies, the Congress of United States has refused and still refuses to change 605. 
    Now, it would indicate that they have a good reason why they don't want to change 605. 
    And on -- if Congress wishes to change 605, and permit the legislature of the State of New York to have limited wiretapping, Congress can certainly do it by passing the proper act. 
    While 605 stands at -- this now that no person shall intercept the communication, as I've said before, no person means zero and zero cannot be made into numerical numbers other than zero. 
    Thank you.
