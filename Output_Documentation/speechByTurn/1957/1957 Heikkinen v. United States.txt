    Number 89, Knut Einar Heikkinen versus United States of America. 
    Mr. Rein.
speaker="david_rein" startTime="31.867" stopTime="289.106">
    Mr. David Rein 
    Court please, petitioner here was convicted on both counts of the two-count indictment charging a violation of Section 23 of the Internal Security Act of 1950. 
    The offenses alleged in the indictment provided under statute in which he was convicted were one, a willful failure to depart; and two, the second count, a willful failure to make a timely application for travel documents necessary to his departure from the country. 
    Both of these failures were alleged to have occurred during the six-month period following an order of deportation entered against the petitioner. 
    In other words under the statute, under the statute the crime is for an alien against whom an order of deportation as been entered, willfully fails to depart or willfully fails to apply for travel documents. 
    As I say the petitioner is convicted on both counts. 
    He was sentenced to a five-year of prison term on the first account, and imposition of sentence on the second count was differed until completion of the sentence on count one. 
    Petitioner is a 67-year old alien, a native of Finland. 
    He was ordered to be deported by the immigration service on the basis of a finding that he had been a member of the Communist Party from 1922 to 1930 and he was therefore deportable in accordance with the provisions of Section 22 of the Internal Security Act of 1950. 
    This order of deportation was affirmed by the Board of Immigration Appeals on April 9th 1952. 
    Some nine or ten days after the order of deportation was affirmed by the Board of Immigration Appeals, the petitioner was visited by a representative of the immigration service, Mr. Maki. 
    The purpose of this visit was to complete a service form, to prepare and complete a service form headed Passport Data for Alien Deportees. 
    This was the form regularly utilized by the service to obtain the personal history of any deportees in order to procure in accordance with its usual practice, the necessary travel documents for aliens. 
    Mr. Maki told the petitioner that the form would be used by the government for that purpose. 
    The petitioner fully cooperated with Mr. Maki. 
    He gave him all the necessary information and the form was duly forwarded to the Chicago office of the service for processing. 
    The record does not indicate what happened to that form subsequently. 
    The government introduced no evidence on the point. 
    Petitioner's efforts at the trial to discover what had occurred with that form was blocked by the Trial Court, the Trial Court saying it was completely irrelevant since the government owed the petitioner, in the Trial Court's language owed the petitioner no duty to assist him in affecting his departure. 
    On April 30th 1952, and this is about a week to ten days after the visit to the petitioner by Mr. Maki, the officer in charge of the Duluth service, Duluth office of the immigration service sent a form letter to petitioner. 
    It was on a mimeograph form and that letter is set out in full at page 8 to 9 of our brief beginning, “Dear sir, an order of which you have been notified directing your deportation on the following grounds has been entered.” 
    The crucial paragraph, we'll now deal with that letter, we have italicized, upright italics at page A and that paragraph reads as follows. 
    “Arrangements to affect your deportation pursuant to search order are being made and when completed, you will be notified when and where to present yourself for deportation.”

    Mr. David Rein 
    -- in which the petitioner -- all the information on the form was filled out by the petitioner, in which he gave his name, his birthplace, his residence, where he might have been a citizen and the purpose of that, sole purpose of that form was so that the service should have the necessary data to procure travel documents for him to be deported. 
    The petitioner had in the deportation proceeding indicated, as he is entitled to under the statute, as it is granted the right on the statute, the choice of country to which he should be deported as Finland, his native country and this form is to get the necessary information so that the immigration service can go to Finland or the proper authorities in Finland to get travel documents for him to go to Finland and he did not keep that form, that form was then taken by the representative of service.

    Mr. David Rein 
    Well it normally does so far as it is in this record as a matter of fact, within the service that is usual practice to take the labeling. 
    As a matter of fact, we have the only testimony on this Court, in this record, the testimony given by the same Mr. Maki that so far as he knew, the petitioner could not have gotten a passport or travel documents except by going through the service. 
    He did not know, well, let's put it this way, the question was asked could the petitioner have gotten travel documents on his own and he said, “I do not know if that would have been possible.”

    Mr. David Rein 
    Just something that seems to be their normal practice, I can say that under the statute they are required to do it or they have the legal obligation, it just seems to be their normal procedure, procedure which -- that people get deported. 
    As I understand the purpose of it and the purpose of the statute was in a case where they in some reason or rather didn't succeed they could call upon the petitioner or the alien to do whatever might be necessary to pull out whatever documents might be necessary or to assist them in any way. 
    I don't say that statute puts that upon the service, but that does seems to be the normal practice at least far as appears from this case and is, that is my notion. 
    Now perhaps the government might say otherwise.

    In other words, we know that he filled out the questionnaire, Mr. Maki took the questionnaire. 
    It was sent from the Duluth office of service to Chicago, and then we have a blank as to what the service did with it, whether they sent it on to Finland, the Finnish Embassy or didn't or just what happened, I mean that aspect was excluded, but the actual questionnaire is an exhibit in evidence I think it's exhibit number nine.

    Well, it was excluded by the fact -- it was done at the -- prior to the trial, a motion was made, for the documents which would show what the government did in order to process his application and at page -- the record at page 19, that motion was denied by the court on the ground, you'll find the colloquy from 19 to 21 in which the motion was made at pre-trial to get the correspondence that the government may have had with Finland, Canada or any other country on the basis of that questionnaire and the court there said, that it would not permit that to be brought into evidence, we were directed to be produced on the ground and I think it is set out on page 19. 
    I don't care what correspondence the government had with Finland or Canada or anywhere else for the records to his deportation after that order was entered. 
    They owe him no duty. 
    It was his duty to obey that order. 
    That is all to this and that's what the court's view point. 
    We proceed then on the chronology of events here, this letter of April 30th which I have read the italicized paragraph informing the petitioner that the government was proceeding to make arrangements to effect his deportation and that he will then be notified when and where to present himself for deportation. 
    The letter then set out the text of Section 23 of the Internal Security Act of 1950 and concluded at page 9 with a paragraph, “Therefore you will recognize the importance of making every effort in good faith to obtain passport or other travel documents so that you may effect your departure pursuant to the said order of deportation within the time prescribed by the quotation above in the Internal Security Act of 1950.”

    Mr. David Rein 
    The record does not show what the counsel's arguments to the jury, and I don't know what -- what arguments were made to the jury. 
    I don't think they were transcribed at all, and the record does not contain the jury arguments. 
    I would indicate as I get to later that under the instructions, it would have been completely irrelevant as far as the court seem to think. 
    Petitioner was again interviewed by representatives of the service on February 12th 1953 at which time he gave them a sworn statement that was introduced into evidence at the record and it is set out or the pertinent portions of them were set out in full at our brief from page 9 to 12. 
    The gist of this statement was the petitioner's acknowledgment that subsequent to the interview, which he had with Mr. Maki in April of 1952, he had taken no steps and had done nothing to obtain travel documents. 
    He gave as a reason for this failure that it was his impression as a result of his interview with Mr. Maki in April that the government was taking care of the matter and that if the government wished anything further from him, he would be so informed. 
    Petitioner had in fact informed his counsel of his interview with Mr. Maki and he had been advised by his counsel that there was nothing further for him to do until he received further advice from the immigration authorities. 
    The petitioner at this time, February 12, again stated that he was willing to cooperate, do anything necessary to obtain a passport and depart to Finland and he would do anything the Attorney General wished him to do. 
    He did say that if the attorney general wished him to depart to some other country, he would wish first to consult with this attorney before stating his position. 
    Even at this late date, February 12th after this interview which, on which the government so heavily relies in showing a failure of the petitioner to carry out his obligation, the question as to what the service wished the petitioner to do is left up in the air. 
    The service officials still did not indicate to the petitioner that they thought he was delinquent in any respect, or that there was anything that they thought he should do at this time. 
    Now this really in substance is the government's case. 
    They have the letter of April 30th, they have his sworn statement of February 12th 1953. 
    They have one other item of evidence and that consisted of the testimony of Mr. Maki who gave his version of the April interview with the petitioner. 
    Maki's version of that April interview, upon which the petitioner stated, gave him the impression that he need do nothing, in all important respects fully corroborated the petitioner. 
    Maki said he didn't recall the details of the interview. 
    He denied when asked whether he had specifically instructed petitioner that he need do nothing on his own until he heard from the service, but this denial of course in no way conflicts with petitioner's statement because petitioner never said that he was specifically told by Maki that he need to do nothing. 
    He stated only that that was impression had gained as a result of the interview and on the basis of Maki's testimony even if we don't credit the petitioner of his own statement, that was the only reasonable impression he could have gotten. 
    Maki did testify that he informed petitioner that the purpose of the interview was to obtain information which will be forwarded to the Chicago office so that it might take the necessary steps to obtain travel documents. 
    Maki acknowledged further that so far as he knew, there was no other method by which petitioner acting on his own could have obtained the necessary documents and there was no question under any version of the interview and Maki himself conceded that he did not tell petitioner that he had to proceed independently of the service to obtain travel documents.

    Maki, he is the government's only witness?
speaker="david_rein" startTime="953.168" stopTime="1020.616">
    Mr. David Rein 
    Well they had two other witnesses who testified to really nothing, they had another witness who testified, the officer in charge identified the letter of April 30th which he had sent. 
    They had another witness who is the one who took the interview, the sworn statement, a Mr. Bolden who took the sworn statement in the interview of February 12th 1953 which was then introduced in evidence. 
    I mean there were two other witnesses but they testified to nothing of any consequence. 
    And Maki was the only government official who spoke to the petitioner between the time of his deportation and the time of the February 12th 1953 interview. 
    There was no other contact between him and the service except for the letter of April 30, which was sent to him. 
    In other words there was no other conversation between the petitioner and any other official of the service other than Mr. Maki. 
    So I say that there weren't other government witness to identify the documents so that this really is the government's case.

    Mr. David Rein 
    That's correct, I said the government will now get to it, government did not prove either the failure to apply for the travel documents and certainly did not prove whatever failure that might have been was local. 
    Your Honor certainly to be local the petitioner must have had some knowledge of what was required and that -- I think on the basis of these facts the petitioner then only, the only reasonable thing to do, he took the government at its word, when they said they were taking care of the matter, when they sent him a letter saying arrangements to effect you deportation of being made we will notify you when and where to report, he took them at their word and waited to hear from them.

speaker="david_rein" startTime="1076.906" stopTime="1143.259">
    Mr. David Rein 
    That's right. 
    There is no evidence presented on behalf of the defendant at all. 
    He did not take the stand or did he present any evidence so that's the government's case, a complete picture to conquest. 
    I should say this with regard to Mr. Maki's testimony and one real item that the government attempts to make something out it, out of. 
    Mr. Maki in response to a leading question said that he did not make any statements to petitioner that would give petitioner the impression that he should wait until he heard from the service. 
    We argue that that does not help the government at all because this was simply an inadmissible erroneous opinion characterization of the clear meaning of his words. 
    The impression that petitioner could or would have gotten from his interview with Maki should be gotten from what Mr. Maki told him, not from Mr. Maki's characterization of what he told him, should not have given him that impression. 
    I'd say short of that piece of evidence the government has nothing to indicate that --
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="1143.259" stopTime="1144.879">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Petitioner was tried before a jury, wasn't he?
speaker="david_rein" startTime="1144.879" stopTime="1398.052">
    Mr. David Rein 
    Yes, he was tried for a jury. 
    To change our argument as I have indicated earlier the government, the petitioner here was convicted on two counts; one is failure to depart from the country, two a failure to apply for travel documents. 
    However, as indicated by the instructions of the court and by the evidence both counts rest entirely on the government's position that there was a failure to apply to travel documents. 
    I wanted to deal with it later with the fact that that in itself was an invalid position but I want to address myself now to the insufficiency of the evidence to show a failure to apply for travel documents. 
    The indictment and the language of the statute charged the petitioner failed, “To make timely application in good faith for travel or other documents necessary to his departure.” 
    The statute does not require an application in any way or indicate to whom the application must be made. 
    The petitioner here did in fact make an application for travel documents within the meaning of the statute. 
    He did fill out this passport data for alien deportees, which was a form supplied by the service and regularly used by the service to obtain travel documents for aliens under orders of deportation. 
    If moreover was told that the documents would be used for that purpose and the evidence in this record as indicated by Mr. Maki's testimony shows that the government had in the past obtained travel documents on the basis of just such a form and indeed as I've already indicated, Mr. Maki indicated he didn't know of any other procedure for obtaining travel documents. 
    The validity of this particular section of this statute was before this Court in Spector, at which time this Court sustained that provision of the statute against the charge that it was too vague, it would be impossible. 
    But as I read Spector, we read Spector, it did it only on the ground and it could only upon the ground that in any particular case the passport visa requirements of a particular country were ascertainable, and that evidence would be shown in any particular case as to what was required. 
    The government apparently assumes that the application which the alien here made to the service was not a proper application for travel documents, it was insufficient to satisfy the statute, but there is no evidence here to support such an assumption. 
    There is no evidence here, the government introduced no evidence to show what would have been a proper application or what it apparently maintains or contends that the petitioner should have done in the way of making an application for travel documents. 
    Thus on this record, petitioner was convicted for failing to take some undefined action, which was not shown to be the necessary, useful or appropriate for the obtaining of travel documents, but he did apply for travel documents which was the normal channel for such application through the service, and although it does not appear that any other application was needed or would have even been useful. 
    In Spector, which I have indicated earlier, the Court sustained this provision of the statute against the charge of vagueness, the Court said, the statute might well be a trap, if for example if required the alien to know the visa requirements for one or more countries. 
    I would say that the government's view of the statute, which it takes here and which says that petitioner could be guilty of a crime without defining exactly what it was he failed to do, would so convert the statute into a trap.

    Mr. David Rein 
    No, the exhibit is not actually printed in the record, but here in the office it's part of the record here and it's been furnished to the Court. 
    The government does concede, I wish now to turn to what the government does concede is a necessary element in this crime, but even if there was evidence that the petitioner had failed to apply for travel documents within the meaning of the statute that as I say under the government's concession, the petitioner would not be guilty unless that failure was a willful failure. 
    That it was incumbent upon the government to prove that the petitioner's failure to take action was in-spite of his knowledge of what was required of him and with the intent of completing his obligation under the statute. 
    In other words, because of the presence of the word willful in the statute, as a matter of fact under the doctrine of this Court in Morris Act we have to prove not only his failure to do something, but we have to prove his criminal intent. 
    Now the evidence to support a finding of willfulness in this case, is not only total lacking, but on the contrary all of the evidence that there is here shows not only that the government did not prove willfulness, but it completely negates any possibility of willfulness. 
    First there was petitioner's statement which was introduced by the government. 
    Now that clearly negates willfulness. 
    He explained his failure to take any action by the impression he obtained from the interview with Maki, that he need do nothing until he heard from the service. 
    He indicated he checked with his counsel. 
    His counsel told him that he need do nothing until he heard from the service. 
    The government concedes that if that statement is taken on its face, that it does establish the petitioner's innocence. 
    In other words if the facts as stated by the petitioner there were true, that was indeed his honest impression, the government concedes that a judgment of acquittal must have been entered. 
    It argues however, that the jury could have disbelieved the petitioner's assertion of good faith on the basis of other evidence in the record, but as I have indicated earlier in my statement in that case, there is no other evidence that conflicts with petitioner's assertion of good faith. 
    On the contrary all of the other evidence corroborates it. 
    Now I'll go so far as to say quite apart from the petitioner's statement, as to why he took no action because he was relying on Mr. Maki, but even the evidence aside from that proves his good faith and what is this evidence? 
    One, there is Maki's version of the interview with petitioner. 
    I've already gone over that to show that it's fully collaborating the petitioner and he told him that he was going to use this form, it was going to be sent to Chicago, and he did not say to him that he need do anything on his own; secondly, the letter of April 3rd. 
    Now the government makes the point in that letter, in which it says that, sure they did have this paragraph which I have italicized, in which it said arrangements to effect your deportation are being made and we will let you know when and where to present yourself for deportation. 
    But says the government, the letter then did go on to set out the text of the statute and presumably according to the government, the petitioner should have read the text of the statute as nullifying the flat statement of the government, saying that they were taking care of the matter and they would let him know when they wished him to do something. 
    Now I submit the text of the statute does not indicate to me, does not indicate to this Court in Spector and cannot possibly indicate to anyone, that there is a requirement, an unequivocal plain requirement on the petitioner to do something independently of his own. 
    If they had sent him the text of the statute alone it would not have given him that notice, but to argue as the government does that he should read from the text of that statute, that nullification as clear language by the government, that they were taking care of the matter and he could wait until he heard from them, I say is simple nonsense. 
    As a matter of fact, if the government had the burden of proof (Inaudible), even if we wind up with the conclusion that there was an ambiguity or confusion, then the petitioner here was innocent, because even if he failed to do something because he was confused, he is entitled to a judgment of acquittal.

    Mr. David Rein 
    It's mimeograph form, yes, presumably sent to all aliens in a similar position as the petitioner. 
    In the absence of any evidence to prove willfulness, the government relies on the curios argument that the petitioner was mature and literate man and should not have misunderstood the service. 
    But as I have indicated, I think on the basis of these facts, there really was no misunderstanding. 
    He did what the service asked him to do, he gave the information, he took the service at their word. 
    The real confusion if there is any in this case, is exactly what it was that the service was up to and why they not follow out the usual procedure, why they didn't process the documents and why after having mislead the petitioner in believing that he could rely up on their records to obtain travel documents, they then pounced up on him and brought this indictment.

    Mr. David Rein 
    That's all I know of Your Honor. 
    There was an indictment in Spector which came up before this Court, but the government has never proceeded to take that case to trail, even after this Court sustained the indictment that we've gone through. 
    I've heard of one other prosecution which was not appealed, so far as I know this has been the only other case under this statute.

speaker="david_rein" startTime="1832.427" stopTime="1924.804">
    Mr. David Rein 
    No, as a matter of fact he was there when they went to see him in April, he was there when they went to see him on February 12, 1953 and he has been readily available at all times. 
    No contention. 
    I do want to deal with one aspect of this case, which the government I think tries to rely on in appeal although at the trial, no emphasis was placed upon it all. 
    The petitioner, although a native of Finland, had been a citizen of Canada before he came to the United States and there was some question at the time as to whether or not he might be able to go into Canada. 
    Now as I've indicated earlier, the statute gives him an absolute statutory right to pick the country of his choice and under the statute he must be deported to that country unless and until that country refuses to accept him, and there was no refusal here by Finland to accept him. 
    The government attempts in its brief to say that in any event the petitioner could have gone to Canada during this period. 
    Now obviously this makes no sense because he would have needed travel document to go to Canada, the same way he needed to go to Finland. 
    It's indicated by the opinion in Spector, the statute when it says to depart from the country means to lawfully depart in accordance with the regulations of this country and the other country, and you would have had the same problem if he was still waiting to hear from the service.

speaker="david_rein" startTime="1941.685" stopTime="2040.856">
    Mr. David Rein 
    Well I don't know. 
    I'm just saying that speculating as to the fact that this apparently was the citizen of Canada, he could have gone to Canada, but he couldn't go to Canada anymore than he could go to Finland until he had the permission of Canada to enter, and so he could not go into Canada. 
    He would be in the same position vis-à-vis Canada as he was in Finland, but he was waiting to hear from the service as to what further he should do. 
    I make the added point that he could not be compelled to go to Canada under this statute unless Finland had first turned him down and Finland had not turned him down. 
    One other aspect of this deals with the instructions of this case. 
    Even if we assume for the moment that the government did prove a case on the failure to apply for documents and did prove the case on willfulness, certainly the instructions which the Court gave the jury here were totally inadequate to support any conviction. 
    The government concedes that the factual issue for the jury to decide was whether the petitioner's failure to take any action subsequent to his interview with Mr. Maki was due to his honest belief that the matter was in the hands of the government, but whether the failure was done with the knowledge by the petitioner that he was obliged to take some independent action and in total disregard of that obligation. 
    Now that could have been the only real factual issue present to the jury, but the jury was never informed in any manner, shape or form that, that was the issue before it. 
    Consequently --

    Mr. David Rein 
    I don't know that a specific exception was taken to that charge. 
    Other instructions were given which were rejected, but I would say this Your Honor, that under that decisions of this Court, where there is a conviction in which a charge is so completely inadequate to define guilt or innocence in all, this Court has held that that's reversible error.

    Mr. David Rein 
    Well, it should plain error, but it's so clearly error where the jury is given absolutely no guide and is not even informed of the nature of the crime, but I think this failure in the instructions in this particular case falls in that type of a category. 
    In addition to that, the Court eliminated by its instruction the requirement to (Inaudible) and that he did affirmatively, not negatively. 
    We have set out briefly in our reply brief at page seven, some of the language used by this Court, some of these leading questions as to the meaning of the word willful in the statute and what it means in terms of criminal intent. 
    The leading case on that is Felton against United States in which this Court said that doing or omitting to do a thing knowingly and wilfully implies not only a knowledge of the trend, but it's determination with a bad intent do it or omit to do it. 
    Now this is what the Court told the jury.

    Mr. David Rein 
    Well, in any event, let's look at what the Court did tell the jury here. 
    He told them, and I'm reading now from page 32 of my brief, he told them that the petitioner can't remain idle. 
    He must take the necessary steps to affect his departure from this country within that period of six months and if he fails to do so, he has violated the law and the statute involved in this case. 
    He has also told them that wrongful acts knowingly or intentionally committed can be neither justified nor excused on the ground of innocent intent.

    Mr. David Rein 
    Well, it indicates -- I think the clear meaning of that is in this context, in this case, particularly in view of the instructions given by the court to the jury, for further instruction, and it was not the government's duty to deport the witness, the petitioner, but his own duty, and once he has failed in that duty, and he was no longer -- had not departed from the country, he was guilty regardless of the circumstance and regardless of his intent.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2263.864" stopTime="2267.455">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    I was hoping to help you by suggesting it wasn't clear.
speaker="david_rein" startTime="2267.455" stopTime="2302.625">
    Mr. David Rein 
    Well I say it was clear. 
    Imagine that even though the jury found that he had failed to take action, because he honestly relied upon his belief that the government was taking care of the matter he was still guilty, that is the clear import, that instruction and the top of instructions given by the Court to that jury. 
    I say it was unambiguous in that respect, perhaps if there had been some confusion the jury might have acquitted. 
    But in effect –
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2302.625" stopTime="2307.568">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    I didn't think if a charge was ambiguous that's pretty bad.

    Mr. David Rein 
    Well this far worse when it is very, very clear that on a set of facts, which would warrant a judgment of acquittal, the jury is told you should convict on that set of facts. 
    I think that's even far more or far worse than an ambiguous construction. 
    I wish now to turn to one another point before I reach the question of the constitutionality of the statute, in the remaining time left, and that is as I've indicated earlier, the petitioner was convicted both of a failure to depart and a failure to apply for travel documents. 
    That on evidence and on instructions by the Court, that the gist of the failure to depart offence consistent of his failure to apply for travel documents.

    Mr. David Rein 
    I am making no point to the sufficiency of that, independent as the appellant relates on the question of willfulness. 
    As I say under the instructions and under the evidence, he was convicted of the offense of failure to depart solely upon evidence, which approved anything. 
    It only proved a failure to apply for travel documents. 
    We contend that these two crimes are not identical and that one cannot be convicted of a failure to depart where that value is due solely and entirely to a failure to apply to travel documents. 
    Now the government tries to turn our contention around their brief to say that we are arguing that an individual cannot be guilty of both offenses in the same prosecution. 
    I want to make it clear that that is not our contention, but we say that since the crimes are not identical, one cannot make out a failure to depart solely by showing a failure to apply for travel documents. 
    One must also show something in addition and that may be either that despite his failure to apply to travel documents, travel documents were obtained and he still failed to depart, or that one reason or another he could have departed without obtaining any travel documents. 
    Both those elements are absent in this case.

    Mr. David Rein 
    He would actually have to have -- before the crime of failure to depart came about, he would actually have to have travel documents. 
    Now that principle of not multiplying offenses making two offenses, two crimes out of one offense, there is a line with the canons of interpretation which this Court has set out. 
    We have set them out briefly on page 25 to 27. 
    I think that I don't want to go into it any greater detail here and I think it's fully and adequately covered in our brief, the general principle and we have a number of grounds to that general principle as to why we do not normally make two offenses out of one. 
    And in addition to that, it seems to me the government's position would conflict with the Fifth Amendment's probation against double jeopardy. 
    On this particular point in issue there is no legislative history to indicate the congressional intent and that is contrary to the government's assertion. 
    The government in their brief cite some legislative history which they say indicates that Congress desired to make two offenses out of the failure to apply for travel documents. 
    We wish to comment only that the legislative history which they cite is not upon the statute which was passed but upon some previous proposals which were rejected by Congress and which had no reference whatsoever the question out of crime by virtue of a failure to apply for travel documents. 
    We submit therefore that in the absence of any legislative history illuminating of any kind or character the court should follow its usual canons of interpretation and limit the failure to apply for travel documents evidenced to failure to apply for travel documents as being evidenced only of that offense and not of the offense of failure to depart and under that construction, certainly that -- there would be no proof of a failure to depart in any event.

    Mr. David Rein 
    Yes there is a judgment of conviction and I think under the (Inaudible) case that is before Your Honors to review even though no sentencing was reversed. 
    I think it was (Inaudible) and I think this Court cited on that. 
    Turning to how -- my remaining time to the question of the constitutionality of the statute, the deportation order on which this proceeding is based was issued against the petitioner as a result of an administrative proceeding before the service. 
    In the first trial, I should indicate at this stage Your Honor that this conviction which is coming up here as a result of a second trial on this indictment, the first trial was reversed by the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit because the validity of that deportation order was not considered at all in the trial. 
    In the second trial in which our present appeal was taken the trial judge reviewed the record of the deportation procedure. 
    He made a finding on the basis of his review of the record that there was evidence to support the findings of the immigration officials and that the deportation order was valid. 
    He ruled, however, that the validity of the order or of the facts underlined -- underlying facts justifying the order was not a jury issue and that would not be determined by the jury. 
    We contend that the statute is unconstitutional on its face as applied. 
    We relied principally for this argument on the dissenting opinion of Justice Jackson in the Spector case and on his reasoning there. 
    I should note although I call it a dissent, it is not a dissent from majority views in that case because the majority in that case said with regard to the aspect of the case covered by Justice Jackson's opinion, the case did not reach the issue since it had not been briefed and argued before them and they were not going to consider it. 
    So the view point is presented although a dissent, majority has not spoken upon the matter. 
    It was left open specifically in Spector -- it was stated to be an open question for consideration by this Court at an appropriate time.

    Unknown Speaker 
    (Inaudible)
speaker="david_rein" startTime="2981.871" stopTime="3193.732">
    Mr. David Rein 
    That's correct, whether the statute was valid on its face because as Justice Jackson put it, the statute in effect split up two elements of the crime, that there were two essential elements of the crime; one was the deportability of the alien and the second the willful failure to leave the country or to apply for travel documents. 
    And that the first of these elements was submitted to an administrative proceeding, thus avoiding the constitutional guarantees for the trial of this portion of the crime. 
    We have set out, and I want to make only very brief reference to it, the number of constitutional guarantees which would be available in a criminal trial, which is denied in an administrative proceeding on a deportation. 
    They are briefly the right to trial by jury, the right not to be prosecuted against except by indictment, the right against double jeopardy, the right guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment to be confronted with witnesses, the right in accused failure to testify is not evidence of guilt guarantee by the Fifth Amendment, the right not to be tried by your accuser, and that your guilt must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt. 
    Now all of these elements are not present in an administrative proceeding. 
    The government latches on to one phrase in Justice Jackson's opinion. 
    Mr. Jackson and at time of the Spector case had said in his opinion that the deportation order would be conclusive in the trial proceedings. 
    The government says that therefore apparently Justice Jackson's objection was met, because here, the validity was not conclusive because the trial court made an independent review. 
    We submit as a matter of fact, that Justice Jackson's reading of the statute is probably the correct one. 
    There is nothing in the statute which justified what the trial court did here in making its own independent review, because the statute only refers to an outstanding deportation order. 
    But even assuming that the statute can be so interpreted in order to save constitutionality, it does not meet the real basis of the objections made in the Spector case, because even if the matter is reviewed by the Court, we still have the problem as put by Justice Jackson, the adjudication that an alien has been guilty of conduct subjecting him to deportation is not made by procedures constitutional or judgment of crime. 
    And even where there is review all that the judge reviews is that there is some evidence to support it, that there has not been a violation of some regulation. 
    It does not, therefore substitute or give him the right that you would have in a criminal case of trial by jury.

    It's perfectly (Inaudible). 
    As a matter of fact that's just the point made in the dissent of Justice Jackson's opinion, that all of this procedure and this lack of procedure and differences between the administrative procedure and the criminal procedure, that we have sustained that, speaking of the Court throughout its history has sustained that in deportation procedures, on the government's continued insistence that a deportation proceeding is a purely civil matter, with absolutely no criminal consequences, and that is the reason why you have sustained it and sustained the validity of that procedure to support a deportation order. 
    But when that deportation order is made to carry consequences, as it is here, resulting in an imprisonment of five years, then that procedure falls because the deportation order is now not purely civil in its aspect, but its criminal, because of the factors being employed criminal, no tax is being made on validity audit as an order, standing by itself.

    Dissent of Mr. Justice Jackson, by I like to have a constitutional question thoroughly argued instead of resting on a dissenting opinion, and I'm surprised that neither you nor the government make any reference either to Union Bridge or Monongahela in 216 in which that problem was reconsidered on a rehearing and thoroughly canvassed. 
    This business of just pulling out a dissent opinion, and I'm thinking that's all you have to do isn't very helpful towards the determination of a statute which has stood all these years and I suggest you consider both of you, Union Bridge Company in 214, and Monongahela in 216, which on principal is decisive as kind of a situation, namely that's where the Secretary of War made a declaration and there was disobedience, criminal prosecution for disobedience, and the question was whether the administrative determination was conclusive in the criminal trial.

    Mr. David Rein 
    The distinction made, if I may turn to question of the Yakus case, or between this case and the Yakus case, is that the Yakus case was an administrative regulatory procedure setting out standards of conduct to guide people in the future, in contrast to the nature of a deportation order which is an adjudication of guilt in a particular case against a particular individual, and it is not a general regulatory matter. 
    As a matter of fact this is significant, I think this point should be made clear, that this statute, that is this self deportation statute does not apply to any order of the deportation, it applies only to orders of deportation based upon certain grounds, and those grounds are grounds which apparently the Congress had some guilt attached to that, because they referred to some persons, criminals. 
    This particular alien here was ordered deported on two grounds, one his entry into this country without a visa as well as his past membership in a Communist Party. 
    The order of deportation so far as it rests on the first ground would not be a basis for application of the statute here. 
    So that the very conduct of deportation, this very cause underlying the deportation is part and parcel of the crime in this particular case, and it's because of that the procedure adopted here of eliminating that portion of the crime, in the consideration of the jury runs into constitutional grounds.

    What do you do with the Cox case?
speaker="david_rein" startTime="3542.707" stopTime="3660.427">
    Mr. David Rein 
    We argue that the Cox case, really in this respect can prove and prove on my brief at all, the Cox case is unlike Yakus, in the sense that it is not a general regulatory procedure. 
    But that case we say where you have an administrative classification for draft purposes is very different from a determination that an individual is guilty of some past misconduct. 
    You had in Cox, an application by an individual to be exempt from a rule that applies in general to all people, and the determination made there by the Selective Service boards is not a finding of guilt, but simply that a person is not entitled to an exceptional privilege, and we here say as a matter of fact, the whole procedure which is employed in the Cox statute, seem to indicate by this Court's opinion also in the Nugent case show that was a type of procedure in which this Court thought because of the exigencies of the situation that the individual was entitled to very low in the nature of due process and as I said, that also underlie the aspect of the Nugent case. 
    I would say that Cox a very special case limited it to the fact that here is an individual who is asking for a special privilege from an obligation imposed upon all citizens in the service, is not the same that's involved in this type of case where there is finding of guilt. 
    I would like to indicate just one other portion of argument on constitutionality dealing with the nature of the cause for deportation that that is covered in our brief, my time has expired.

speaker="j_f_bishop" startTime="3883.897" stopTime="4426.146">
    Mr. J. F. Bishop 
    No, I am stating that the examples that we did give and that is not only the administrative area, it is a terrific field and we thought that the thing had been very well decided more recently -- very well. 
    Now this case has so many issues as to which various states of facts are pertinent that I am afraid that it will be necessary to summarize first what the government says rather than leaving to its presentation before as to what we contend and secondly to give some run down on these facts and their order. 
    We think it's very important that when a certain interview happened, when a certain notice was served and I am going to try the rather difficult thing of at least presenting this whole picture so that we have the order because after all this is a very important request that this Court should go over a cold record and disbelieve the witnesses that the jury patently believed, get the impression that the instructions were not adequate without any view of the entirety of those instructions and without any view also on the facts that were in the case, so I am -- if I may I would like to give the chronology as quickly as possible with the, with two caveats to the court. 
    One I expect to support everyone one of those items on the evidence point by going directly to the record later after I finish this brief summary and secondly the Court should have in mind that since there are some other questions that is the attack on the deportation proceedings, the innuendo that the government is holding out things and is entrapping him and the complaint that the judge shouldn't have sentenced this man severely, that the facts -- that other certain facts that were before the judge and were not before the jury are going to have to be told in this chronology. 
    I want to warn the Court that when I get to discussing the evidence before the jury, then I will restrict myself to the evidence before the jury, but in this summary relating to these other questions at the outset, the facts up to the trial are in exhibits one and two that are lodged with this Court and did not go to the jury because this judge was scrupulously careful to keep from the jury, all the troublesome things that had been adduced to him in the assault on the deportation proceedings. 
    He kept even the Board of Immigration Appeals' opinion from the jury and only allowed to be read in the facts that they had decided against petitioner and not the reasons. 
    So in this chronology if the Court would bear with me, when I get to the evidence, I am going to be very careful of what was before the jury, that I don't want to misrepresent to the court within these earlier things. 
    There is -- all of this went to the judge. 
    Now petitioner was born in 1890. 
    He came to Canada in 1910 and he became a Canadian citizen. 
    He has been a Canadian citizen for anything that appears on the record all of the time, since that time and through the six months period that's critical in this criminal indictment and let me interrupt myself this is -- this evidence was before the jury as well as all the other cases. 
    He has been a Canadian citizen for over 40 years. 
    He came to the United States in 1916 and that entry was a legal entry, probably the last legal entry. 
    He joined the Communist Party in 1922 or '23. 
    There is a dispute about it, but there is no dispute that he was in it until 1930. 
    The Court of Appeals below found that he had been Communist Party member after that. 
    He went to Russia in 1932 without travel documents. 
    He stayed there for three years in the Soviet Union. 
    He came back in 1935 also got in without travel documents. 
    Then in 19 -- I should say also that for 15 years he was editor of a newspaper, a Finnish language newspaper. 
    Now, in 1949 the government began the process of trying to deport him. 
    At that time there were two grounds, one because when he came back from Russia he came out -- came in without the proper documents. 
    Two as a member of a subversive organization, and that was changed after the 1950 act, to the specific designation of the Communist Party membership. 
    Now the length of time in which these proceedings were delayed I don't want the court to get an impression of any improper delay there, because it was -- the petitioner was entitled of course to pursue every remedy, but all things do come to an end that he was properly ordered deported in April 9 of 1952, that is one of the Board of Immigration Appeals finally included these deportation proceedings, after many -- after appeals to that board and the matter was completed. 
    Then I would like to fix that date by repetition. 
    We are now in 1952 and we are beginning that six months period in which the statute required that he do something. 
    Now we will look at that statute, which was passed in 1950. 
    That statute provided a penalty if the alien did not depart, if the alien did not get travel documents and three, not indicted here, but of significant contrast, if he connived to hamper the getting of documents for it, and four the completely differentiated thing, if he failed to show up when the Attorney General ordered him to show up for deportation. 
    That's the statute and the statute of course is presented fully in our brief here and elsewhere. 
    Well -- and the Court of Appeals below summarize in its opinion those four aspects of it, so that there is no doubt and I don't know that the petitioner has blankly stated that there is any doubt. 
    I may explain about that statute, that it arose on legislative history, not concerning the separation of offences as has been stated to the Court, but to meet the single problem that there were hoards of aliens left in this country who just couldn't be deported and the legislative history that we have cited in our brief was the testimony before the Congress, before prior legislation which did become this legislation only with a more severe criminal penalty indeed. 
    There was testimony that aliens whom the government could not deport by itself applying for papers, could get out when they chose to do so, the then Attorney General, now of this Court testifies as to nine specific cases in which that had happened, that is also cited in our brief and that is what is the object of this statute. 
    So that in a sense the inquiry as to what the government did or did not do concurrently is not significant. 
    Now, as to that statute let me state something else, we do not state, nor has there been any confusion whatsoever that the government could go ahead concurrently and as an ordinary matter, it did do so. 
    It did not trust either the integrity or the competence of some of these aliens to get going. 
    While this statute was specifically designed as reported from the congressional record to give an incentive to these aliens to do something themselves, nevertheless the government was not required to wait for them to do something. 
    So that, I want to make it clear, we do not contend here that the government can't do anything or that the government doesn't do anything.

speaker="j_f_bishop" startTime="4472.836" stopTime="4624.230">
    Mr. J. F. Bishop 
    I will answer that in two ways, one on what was before the jury, in the record and then I will go further than that, if the Court wishes. 
    There was definite and uncontested evidence by the immigration inspector that the government ordinarily tries to get the man out even while he is making his concurrent efforts, but there was a definite denial that the government does it in all cases and for that purpose, let me explain something about this form without reaching it yet. 
    This data form Exhibit 9, I better refer to it that way, that the inspector goes out right after the deportation order and gets, is an information form on which the government tries to act, but on the back of that form, I'm sorry this is not reprinted, it is an exhibit, on the back of that form there is a paragraph in which it is asked that the alien disclose whether he has an expired passport, birth certificate and other certificates which has been used by the government. 
    If he disclosed that he had papers already and could get out by himself, in those cases and now I'm speaking off the record, the government does nothing, and I think that those are the cases referred to in the testimony before the jury, where this man vigorously denied, I mean the immigration testimony, vigorously denied that in all cases they do it. 
    Very diligent counsel for petitioner asked his man Maki over and over again, the immigration inspector, doesn't this mean that the government will do something, and he repeatedly said no they will consider it, that's what this form is for; this is not an application form. 
    It was filled out by the immigration inspector, it is not signed, it's a data form, and there is, and I'm quoting the record here, the office in charge stated that this form is sometimes taken by a hearing officer. 
    It is not a matter of application for documents at all, and of course it's differentiated from document because it refers to the documents right within the form asking whether he has it, that there be no confusion of this form, once it's examined.

    The officer in charge definitely testified that he presented a Canadian passport, to this man, and that was after the six months period, so that there is no question of expiry. 
    He was still a citizen through this whole six months as far as this record discloses, and he presented no evidence whatsoever that he had been -- had lost his Canadian citizenship until afterwards, and as the records says, a long time after.

    Mr. J. F. Bishop 
    He does, he does, but I am stating this as evidence of what this particular petitioner was about in the matter of competence and clever heel dragging. 
    The six months went by there is no slightest evidence that he did anything about Finland. 
    And his only excuse which the jury frankly did not buy was that he that he was waiting for the government to do something in spite of the statute, in spite of the notice which I'll get to and in spite of his clear duty. 
    He said that he got the impression from this man who was just set up to get information that now he can sit down and do nothing that's his picture.

    Mr. J. F. Bishop 
    I am tempted to deal with it rather emotionally I will just subside and say this, that I will request the Court in reading this form of notice by the government to read it as it's put in the footnote of the government's brief in its entirety and without italicizing. 
    The jury took this form of notice into the jury room with it. 
    And when it is read without prior emphasis, I think that the jury was well entitled not to rely on just one paragraph of it but recognize that form for what it was, a form that stated a variety of contingencies and what is more particularly, the last paragraph which could not have related to the government. 
    In other words the first paragraph advised him, the government was going to try to act. 
    He needed, he was properly warned of that. 
    Then it stated the statute which showed the four different activities, his own duty to depart, his own duty to get documents, his own duty not to connive to hamper and his own duty, and then his duty not to refuse the documents if the Attorney General should present to it. 
    And then comes the last paragraph of all which if we were italicizing, I would italicize, here is what it says. 
    “Therefore you will recognize the importance of making every effort in good faith.” 
    Let me stop there, if they have been talking about government efforts, they wouldn't have said in good faith, they were talking to him then. 
    “To obtain passport or other travel documents so that you may affect your departure pursuant to the said order of deportation within the time prescribed by the quotation above from the Internal Security Act.” 
    Now of course I know the argument on that and that is that he was a poor ignorant man that couldn't be expected to deduce all of those from this notice. 
    But the answer to it is that this man didn't do anything without checking with his attorney, he had long experience in picking everything possible available to his case. 
    What's that?

    Yes, yes that is, that is affirmative letter indeed and I am getting ahead of my story a little bit, but let me just say as to this formal notice. 
    When it was read without the italics that have been inserted by a jury which is perhaps better able, the judge what it means to a layman than I as a lawyer or then the trial judge did, that jury happily could have seen whether anyone would be confused by it and I want to add one more thing and then I will get on with the chronology of it.

    Well I mean that that I feel that that bringing a form of this kind with italicizing in the statement of facts is liable to get a person off on the wrong start in the argument or if it were treated as a summary and then reporting it, well then, then I would say the first time you read that, you can read it in its entirety. 
    But if it's the first time in the statement facts, it confronts you, you are bound to look more at that italicized portion than the exhibit which is reproduced.

    Mr. J. F. Bishop 
    It is, and I -- I have no intent to say that there was anything intentional because as it was stated in the brief of course that it was italicized, but this is was a statement of facts. 
    All I am arguing is that when the court looks at this, when it is asked to set aside this jury's finding on the whole record that it do so on the document that was before the jury and without prior warning, without prior standing out of this one thing out of a long list, that's all to that moment.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="5124.970" stopTime="5179.966">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Bishop may I just pursue one important step further, don't you believe that if you are deportee or this time that the form was presented to you in circumstance of this kind that you might emphasis a paragraph of this kind where it says arrangements to effect your deportation pursuant to such order, the one that they are talking about here, are being made and when completed you will be notified when and where to present yourself with the petition. 
    Don't you think that might strike a deportee as a rather foreseeable and rather expressing the intent of the government to do something?

    The second thing that I would do would be to at least enquire and the third thing I question whether my judgment on that is as good as the jury that have had that form before it and was told, and I have countered this in the record 17 times it appears in the record that was before, that was read to this jury that he thought that it meant something else.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="5222.277" stopTime="5223.310">

    Mr. J. F. Bishop 
    The jury --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="5224.405" stopTime="5241.542">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    -- might not -- that instruction that counsel was talking about have something to do with that where the court told him or whether he believed that the government was going to do anything or not that he was still guilty if he didn't, if he didn't take the steps?
speaker="j_f_bishop" startTime="5241.542" stopTime="5459.873">
    Mr. J. F. Bishop 
    I don't believe that in the whole context of the instructions anything of that kind was said. 
    I am going to review those instructions at great length at this time, but I can't pull one word on the instructions when the world ‘willfully' is hammered at the jury as often as it was here. 
    I think that there was no doubt possible for this jury that a number of times it was emphasized in the evidence in petitioners' own words that he had been confused that this jury couldn't size up the man they had before them, very well indeed and better than I could on the whole record, because I didn't see the witness that told about this man. 
    Now this notice of course comes in a chronology and I think I better get back to the order in which that notice appeared so that we'll have that as it appeared also before the jury in evidence. 
    In other words I had gotten to the point where the deportation proceedings had finally resulted in an order of deportation and then the next thing that happened was not being noticed. 
    The next thing that happened was the investigator came out to get data. 
    Now petitioner, enough has been said about what petitioner says he got as an impression, I can only recommend that the court go very carefully to the testimony of this man Maki and also to the testimony of the officer in charge at Duluth, both of whom stated very specifically what -- what this man was to do. 
    He was out there to get information. 
    He was not out there to instruct the deportee as to his duties. 
    He was not out there the least of all with any authority to waive what the Congress have enacted to, where the Congress had said it's your duty -- for him to go out and say well it's your duty until the -- after the government has done something. 
    That wasn't in the statute, that wasn't in the notice. 
    Now the testimony of Maki is very clear and I expect to get to that too if I can just get on to the dates. 
    April 9 was the date of deportation, April 21 this man Maki came to get the information for this sheet and went his way. 
    Petitioner didn't sign anything. 
    He according to Maki, according to the only live testimony before this jury, Maki said nothing of the kind, he got his information and left, he remembered the interview very well. 
    Then on the 30th of April this form notice came out and petitioner was advised of whatever that form meant, but the form as I've stated is in the exhibits left before the jury. 
    It's not something that was in the side proceedings at all. 
    Now, nothing was done by petitioner. 
    There was no inquiry made by petitioner as to what it could mean or as to why the government was so long about speaking to him again about it if he had truly thought the government was getting him some papers, I don't think he would have quite weighed it that happened here, at least that's an item that the jury could well evaluate, especially when all he had to do was pick up the phone and ask about the matter, and --

speaker="j_f_bishop" startTime="5471.342" stopTime="5558.655">
    Mr. J. F. Bishop 
    No, he would call up the office to find out what was happening. 
    In fact there is affirmative testimony after the six months were over, and the matter began to get a little bit hot and he was being investigated as to why he hadn't done anything then he admitted that he had wondered a little bit about it himself. 
    Well, so much for that six months period, and I think a great deal of light is cast upon what he was thinking about and what he was trying to do by the events immediately after that six months period. 
    Under the law, if he hasn't left in six months, has not been deported by the government in six months, it comes under supervision as this Court knows from other cases. 
    He was called in on October, in October and here we have the testimony of a man Bolton, who was an immigration inspector, who gave him his order of supervision and at that time it was affirmatively brought to his attention the matter of his own efforts to get travel documents and there was a specific clause put in to his supervision order to report his evidence.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="5558.655" stopTime="5559.905">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    When was that?
speaker="j_f_bishop" startTime="5559.905" stopTime="5695.300">
    Mr. J. F. Bishop 
    That was October 27th, right at the end of this period. 
    Now, if the jury was to believe his protestations of innocence, they could not have lasted beyond that time, and yet he did nothing, from that time on for another quarter of a year. 
    In February, Bolton went out to check up with him and that is when this statement came and then come these excuses, and among other things he was asked was, what he thought that clause was about, as to why he hadn't reported any efforts to get documents, and at that time, he didn't give the -- ask for that one, he didn't state that he had relied on that interview anymore, then he said he must have missed that, and that's in the record too, that went before the jury. 
    So that what the -- what you have is the picture of a man and this is the government's view of it and we submit the jury's view of it, that was dragging his heals as long as he could, and then when he couldn't succeed any longer still did nothing. 
    And here is the critical thing, after that six months period expired, the officer in charge was presented him with a Canadian -- presented a Canadian passport to him, and there is testimony before the jury of the additional documents that would have been required for getting into Canada and you may judge as the jury could judge from that testimony, whether there would have been a deal for him to get into Canada. 
    He did nothing then either. 
    As far as this record is concerned, he was planning to stay as long as he could and that was it. 
    Now I have given a chronology here and I had said that I was going to back it up and now I want to go to the record of what was before this jury, and I think that the proper place to start, I am now exclusively in what was before this jury.

    That question was posed to, it was asked and the immigration inspector was asked about the processes, while he didn't claim to know that this particular petitioner would have had to do, he would go to the consul or whoever or the lawyer with whom he was in touch in New York, go to the consulate, get the papers and fill them out and try to get in.

    If the fact is that Finland would not take him, he could explore that fact if you just sat tight and done nothing. 
    We're not quarreling here about how much he has to do, or what it would have disclosed, this is a case where he just did nothing at all, and his whole reliance is that he thought he didn't have to do anything at all now. 
    Now the government has shown that he was still here. 
    His -- there is the fact that was before the jury that he was able to get in and out of Russia on his own, that he was able to get in and out of Canada on his own. 
    Now wait a second let me retract that. 
    That business of the fact that he had gotten in and out of Canada on his own without difficulty is in Exhibit 1 here which was before the judge, not before the jury, but he had shown great facility in that respect and the fact and with those facts before the jury.

    The government cannot just prove that if he had gotten going, that he wouldn't have been as successful as thousands of other people are successful.

    Because if that was the issue before the jury then we can't tell whether they might have found it was sustainable as to Canada. 
    And if that wasn't the issue, but if the issue was at large namely did he take no step whatever during six months to get a travel document somewhere either his choice or the Attorney General's designation, which it was within his power to obtain not foreclosed either because Finland announced they wouldn't give any visas of some other country, then we've got a different problem. 
    Now can you answer that, what was the -- what was the issue with reference to which the court made the general charge to the jury? 
    It doesn't have – well this to me, a good abstract charge at large if in fact the only evidence before the jury was whether or not he could get a piece of paper that would take him to Finland.

    It must be whatever the tag, the Latin tag maybe, are there enough from which the jury could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that this person having a duty under the laws instructed by the court to get a piece of paper to get out, no matter what think of the whole business, to get a piece of paper to get out somewhere, there was no restriction upon him to get a piece of paper that would take him somewhere out of the confines of the United States.

    I think that was clearly before the jury. 
    That was clearly before the jury and the -- and he didn't even -- and that sort of thing was not raised at the trial. 
    What was before the jury was his excuse that he was an innocent man. 
    That was the – that was the only problem before that jury and they just didn't believe him. 
    They believed the testimony that was before them. 
    I have – I didn't get a chance to get to that record, I think that perhaps the best – the instructions I can only ask that the entirety of the instructions be read with a repetitious and careful separation of these two offenses in several readings and with the repeated emphasis on willfulness and in the light of the fact that this jury had a hammered into it, as I said, 17 times that the petitioner didn't say he tried to do anything but he just thought, he didn't have to and that was the issue and the instructions were very clearly as to that issue so forth, I do wanted to --

    Well it seem to me it was more than 4, 5 pages. 
    I want to say this that on willfulness in spite of the fact that there had been some discussion with the judge before the instructions were framed and there had been some, even some quarreling about that one might say the –

    That is right and there was no exception taken to that. 
    In fact very diligent counsel accepted to everything and you'll find this in the record right up to the word ‘willfulness,' so that we must presume that to the counsel who was present at that hearing that that instruction did the job and posed fairly enough before the jury the question as to whether this man actually believed he could do nothing or whether was just dragging his heels and figuring on crying about it later. 
    I think that this record as it is read will prove very definitely that the government proved that everything that it can prove and that it, that it made its case beyond a reasonable doubt. 
    These matters in defense, and these speculations that he couldn't have gotten into Finland or into other countries are speculations that he frankly didn't back up by himself going forward with the evidence and showing that he filed some papers in Finland and was turned down. 
    That didn't happen.

    Assuredly this statute is not a trap. 
    If he had gone in good faith anywhere and been turned down, he would not have been willful.

    Yes it was intended and he presented -- the only thing that he did present at the trial, an affirmative defense. 
    He did not present the affirmative defense that he couldn't have gotten them if he had tried, he said he didn't do anything at all because he had gotten the impression from this limited officer that came to get questions answered that he didn't have to do anything. 
    Well the statute said he did notice, we did and the jury had that notice too and the government cannot go and disprove all the defenses that might be contradictory. 
    The government proved its case, and the jury believed it. 
    Now we are supposed to go on a whole record and speculate that if he had gone, if he had really made energetic efforts to get into Finland, he couldn't have done it, well there is no proof of that. 
    And the government did prove that he did nothing and the government in a case of this kind cannot undertake to disapprove every possible defense. 
    The government has gone form over the evidence. 
    It has the ultimate burden --

    That is question of fact which was put before the jury and it would not rest alone on the letter but on all of the facts which disclosed that this man was a very cynical man, who relied on his attorney and who could have enquired about this letter and who did nothing even when he had a chance to do it.
