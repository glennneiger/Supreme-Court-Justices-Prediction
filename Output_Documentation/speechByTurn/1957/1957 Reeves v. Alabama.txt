Reeves v. Alabama
speaker="william_f_thetford" startTime="0.000" stopTime="101.732">
    Mr. William F. Thetford 
    -- getting into my argument as -- on the systematic exclusion of Negroes from the jury. 
    I would like to answer Mr. Justice Frankfurter's question as to the confession. 
    The State of Alabama introduced no confession in the case that we are now considering. 
    It might be helpful to the Court if I went a little into the background. 
    I think it will probably answer several questions. 
    Jeremiah Reeves was arrested on November 12, 1952.He was carried for safekeeping, took care of the penitentiary which is a short distance form the City of Montgomery. 
    He made a confession on -- the 12th was on Monday. 
    He made a confession on Tuesday, Tuesday afternoon. 
    He made the confession in my presence. 
    That confession was recorded and I believe later reduced to writing and signed. 
    On Wednesday morning, he was carried to the City Hall, the police headquarters of Montgomery as located in the City Hall. 
    And there, he was identified by (Inaudible), who at that time was a 19-year-old white woman who identified him as the person who had raped her on July the 28th. 
    He was subsequently -- now, according to -- we've got in kind of into both records in this case and I presume you'll let me maybe refer to the first record.

    Both he and his mother testified that they saw each other on the -- on the 12th. 
    Now, in the second trial which -- to where the trials go. 
    They both testified that it was the 13th, rather than the 12th. 
    He was arraigned on the -- I mean indicted on the 14th and arraigned on the 15th. 
    Now, in the first trial, we had -- well now, we don't admit all that he says in his -- in his pleading as the way that confession was taken. 
    We have never admitted that, but we had serious doubts as to whether it was taken in a manner that was legal. 
    We did not introduce the written confession or the recorded confession in the first trial. 
    We did introduce in the first trial certain remarks that he made to Mrs. Crowder at the police headquarters on the 12th. 
    We also introduced testimony from his psychiatrist who had examined him some time later. 
    And in the testimony of the psychiatrist, there was a confession involved. 
    That was the basis on which this Court reversed in the first case.

    Mr. William F. Thetford 
    At the trial. 
    Now, what I think he possibly is referring to was introduced by the defendant, not by the State. 
    Now, on cross-examination, you'll find this in page 237 of the record.On recross-examination of the -- of Ms. Crowder, Lawyer Hall, “Let me ask you a little something further with reference to your last identification of this defendant in November,” referring to November 1952. 
    “Were you told on that occasion he had confessed before you looked at him?” 
    “I was given a written statement, but it wasn't sanctioned.” 
    Now, that is the first reference to any confession whatsoever in this case and that is in this -- I believe it's the only reference to it and it was brought out by the defendant, not by the State. 
    “You are given a statement or a statement alleged made by this defendant”. 
    “I suppose so.It had his name on it, but it wasn't signed.” 
    “It did have his name on it?” 
    “Yes.” 
    “You were given that statement before you looked at him?” 
    “That is right.” 
    “You have read that statement before you looked at him?” 
    “Did any of the officers down there tell you he had confessed or did they make any statement at all to you with reference to that confession?” 
    “No.” 
    Now certainly, the State cannot be held accountable to anything that was injected into this case by the defendant.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    I would like to ask you a question that I would fairly understand if you would say if you prefer not to answer the question. 
    Needless to say, I think the question is -- is not irrelevant or it's not inclusive, otherwise I wouldn't put it but it bears on -- not on this case or not on the present aspect of the case, but prior to the fact that it came here once before and we got a prosecution here. 
    We've got a case here for a crime committed six -- merely six years ago. 
    And I regard it as not a happy circumstance to the administration of the criminal law. 
    I'm sure you don't either. 
    And so I want to go back to the source of the difficulty, namely the confession. 
    This is for my enlightenment and possibly for the future cases bearing on these confession cases that come here. 
    Some years ago, we had a case coming here from another State. 
    Unimportant but for all other state in which we reversed the conviction of a defendant who was probably guilty, but not tried according to what we found to be due process because of an illicit confession. 
    And thereupon, it interested me greatly that the city from the State in which this case came here made it a practice and I assume it continues that no statement of an accused person was taken by the police, except in the presence of some disinterested witnesses. 
    I don't mean picked by it, but -- but some people of -- of word in the community, ex officio people. 
    First, I'd like to put to you which -- which takes care of conflict as to what the circumstances on which a confession was made and what was promised and what wasn't promised and whether the -- there was psychological, physical et cetera, et cetera. 
    But I would like to ask an experienced prosecutor like yourself, if I may say so. 
    What -- what -- whether you care to say, whether that would embarrass the point of view of those who have the responsibility of prosecuting the trial, whether such a practice which would take care of a lot of this business. 
    If statements are made in the presence of this (Inaudible) as a regular thing, would you care to express their view whether that was hurtful or whether --
speaker="william_f_thetford" startTime="550.717" stopTime="559.057">
    Mr. William F. Thetford 
    No, it would not be hurtful. 
    We have done it in our -- our more important cases, whether there was a question involved. 
    We have called in ministers and other decent --

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    The felony in your state means what in terms of punishment?
speaker="william_f_thetford" startTime="600.216" stopTime="817.478">
    Mr. William F. Thetford 
    A year or more in the penitentiary. 
    It's -- we would entirely have responsible people in Montgomery coming in to listen to these things if we did. 
    I don't know whether that's going answer to your question or not, but it -- it would be very difficult to do it. 
    It might -- it might be a very wise thing to do, I would say that. 
    Now, I think I've answered the question as to the confession. 
    There is no confession in this case. 
    We're not dealing with a confession case. 
    They don't -- they don't really reached that in their brief except in a kind of backward way where they say, “Well, the woman had seen something,” a statement, unsigned statement and thereby she -- her -- her identification of the defendant might in some way be affected. 
    Of course, that really goes to the credibility of the witness and not to whether she can testify or not. 
    They can ask that before a jury, but I don't think that it would preclude her from testifying if she seen a state -- unsigned statement, no -- no law that says that. 
    I'd like now to get to the question of which I think is really the heart of this case. 
    I -- I maybe wrong, but I think that after the question, a systematic exclusion of Negroes in the grand -- in the juries of Montgomery County really is the heart of -- of this case. 
    The law I think is well-known to -- to us that we -- we have a board of jury supervisors composed of the two-circuit judges, the clerk of the Circuit Court, the sheriff and the probate judge who makeup the jury list in Montgomery County. 
    It's done by local act. 
    We're the only -- only County in the State that has that exact setup. 
    And I think the law is -- is clearly established. 
    They may not discriminate in any manner so far as race, all color is concerned. 
    Also, that proportional representation as such is -- is not required by this Court. 
    This Court simply requires that your juries, the names in the jury box be selected without discrimination. 
    Now, the cases as I understand them also hold that findings of fact by a state court will have great weight with this Court, but of course I'm not binding on it and that this Court will look at the facts to determine whether the state court found them correctly and applied them correctly. 
    The evidence on proportional -- I mean, on discrimination was set out at length in the opinion of the Alabama Supreme Court. 
    I would like to set out the evidence at length and came to this conclusion. 
    I'm reading from page 476 of the record. 
    A careful consideration of the evidence satisfies us that the great weight of the evidence shows that there was no systematic exclusion of Negroes from the juries in Montgomery County. 
    We consider that the Court reached a correct conclusion and acted properly in denying the motion to quash the binary. 
    Now --

    To the petty jury to the trial jury. 
    Now, the requirements for jurors in the State of Alabama is found in Section 21 of Title 30 of the 1940 Code of Alabama and I'll brief it just a little bit, but essentially all male citizens of the County who are generally reputed to be honest and intelligent men and are staying in the community for their integrity, good character and sound judgment. 
    That is the requirement for a juror. 
    Now, there are some exceptions to that such as they must be over 21. 
    They cannot be suffering from a permanent disease. 
    They're illiterate and even there on someone who cannot read, they say if they are a property holder that can -- maybe waived and there are a large number of exemptions from jury duty which is found in Section 3 of Tittle 30. 
    I don't think they're immaterial so far as this case is concerned.Now, the requirement of Alabama law is that the Board of Jury Supervisors plays or make up a jury list of all citizens of the County which have the requirement, which I have just read. 
    Then, they make -- found that jury list. 
    I might say that on the jury list, there is contained the man's name, his occupation, his business address and his residence address and nothing else. 
    From that jury role, the Clerk of the Board of Jury Supervisors prepares a small white card which contains the man's name, his business or profession, his residence address and his business address and nothing else. 
    All cards are uniform. 
    The only other thing on that would be a number which is keyed to the number in the jury role.

    All male jurors in the State of Alabama. 
    It's been a considerable agitation to have women, but it hadn't come about yet. 
    Those cards are placed in a jury box or a jury wheel, whichever you want to call it. 
    It's a large metal box. 
    The judge and the clerk each have keys to that box and it's kept in a vault at all times. 
    The juries in Montgomery County are all drawn from that box. 
    Your petty juries are drawn in open court from that box. 
    Your grand juries are drawn. 
    The names are drawn from that box and both civil and criminal petty juries are drawn from that box. 
    In other words, that's -- that's where we get our juries, the box is brought in open court and the judge will draw for an ordinary -- for a week, 50 names from that box.

    When that day arrives, the -- those jurors who avail and who have not been excused, and I believe the record shows they're ordinarily 35 to 40 who are actually there in Court. 
    Their names are placed on small white slips of paper, just the name. 
    They're placed in a hat and the judge then draws with the handkerchief over it and the judge then draws in open court blind folded, as you might say, 18 names and that constitutes the grand jury.

    Now, I've tried to -- to outline the -- the way we draw them because I think it will help -- helpful to you in -- when we get into the testimony as to whether there is -- I might mention this, too. 
    We're talking about grand juries. 
    Now, you're going to find if you read the testimony of all of the witnesses on -- we had a full hearing on systematic exclusion in this case and also in the first case. 
    And you'll find a -- a kind of -- of a hesitation in any of them saying just exactly how many Negroes they've seen on a jury here. 
    How many they've seen there? 
    Now, there's a reason for that. 
    We do not set out juries aside where you can look over here and see that's the jury. 
    Our juries are scattered all over the court room, scattered in with witnesses, spectators and actually, when they draw a grand jury until you actually see the names pulled out of the box and they come up and sit in the box, you wouldn't know who was a juror. 
    You would have no way of knowing it. 
    Absolutely, no way of knowing how many Negroes you had -- who were there as jurors or how many you had spectators or witnesses.

    By lot, by lot. 
    Yes, the judge has no idea and you'll find in his testimony, he said that he never knows who he is going to draw until he actually opens up the slip and reads the name. 
    Now, the three jury supervisors, three of them testified on the hearing on discrimination. 
    Judge Carter testified. 
    Let me -- let me explain one other thing possibly that might be confusing. 
    We have two-judge Carter's in this case. 
    We have a regular Circuit Judge, is Judge Eugene Carter. 
    When he was subpoenaed as a witness, as he was by the defendant on the hearing on motion to quash the binary, he refused himself and James J.Carter who was a practicing attorney in Montgomery acted as special judge during the trial of this case.

    He had -- he testified further that he had seen seven Negroes sitting on one case, trying a case. 
    He testified that he had seen two Negroes serving on a jury, trying a white man for a robbery. 
    He testified rather at length that he -- that there was no discrimination shown that they were trying to get jurors, not necessarily white jurors or Negro jurors.

    Mr. William F. Thetford 
    That is -- that is true, but we -- but we -- we find that the only way we can show because there's -- there's no designation as Negro or white and about the only way we can show this Court how many -- that -- the Negroes are regular serving on Montgomery County juries.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    I understand of course if no Negroes ever on the panel and you've got a sizeable Negro population, a potential body of jurors and if there never is a colored person on the panel, that's an awfully good piece of evidence that there's something that matter with the process. 
    But the mere fact that there is one or two as against some other proportion of white, doesn't prove that there is discrimination, is it there?

    Justice Charles E. Whittaker 
    Well, I don't think the observation that I had in mind quite clear is this (Inaudible) what you mean by panel. 
    To me, the panel is the final 12 sworn to try a lawsuit. 
    Now, the fact that there are no Negroes on that jury, doesn't mean that in the process of selection from the binary, there may not have been six restricken on each side for cause or peremptorily, isn't that true?

    Mr. William F. Thetford 
    That's -- that's very true. 
    But we feel that the -- a large measure -- the only way we can show you that they are on the binary which is the entire 50 men or 100 men group, is to show you that they're actually serving on juries which they are.

    That's what?

    Mr. William F. Thetford 
    That -- I say, we feel that the best way that we've got -- and as a matter of fact, the only way we've got because as I told you, your juries are so mixed-in with spectators and with witnesses that ordinarily no one knows who's the jury and who's not. 
    We -- and we've got no designation on anything that would show a man was white or a man was colored.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1612.635" stopTime="1620.850">

    Mr. William F. Thetford 
    Yes, sir. 
    I want to make one more observation then I'm -- I'm leaving this. 
    In 1954, when the first Jeremiah Reeves case came before this Court, this same proposition of systematic exclusion of Negroes from grand juries of Montgomery County was both briefed and argued before this Court. 
    The Court at that time seems satisfied with our method of selecting jurors and seems satisfied that there was no discrimination being shown, Negroes, in Montgomery County. 
    The case was not reversed on systematic exclusion. 
    It was reversed on the remarks and the nature of a confession. 
    And I submit to the Court that it -- just as you are pointing out, Mr. Justice Frankfurter, it -- cases should not be and they have the right to do it, and you have the right to do it, but cases -- criminal cases should not be reversed piecemeal. 
    We of course are bound by it and will follow the dictates of this Court, but when the case comes up here and it's reversed on a confession, obviously, we think the jury's proposition has been argued, briefed to, and no mention of it, is made in this Court's opinion.

speaker="william_f_thetford" startTime="2350.260" stopTime="2434.868">
    Mr. William F. Thetford 
    Well, I think it's directed from the State's standpoint. 
    It -- a great many more people testified. 
    We haven't in there a large number of lawyers testified that they had tried cases with Negro jurors. 
    Now, this is in the -- the present record. 
    In the first record, we have only the three witnesses testified and they testified simply that Negroes were serving on the juries, both grand jury and petty jury. 
    The next question that I would like to talk about is the reindictment and rearraignment of the defendant in -- the defendant was neither reindicted nor rearraigned after the first reversal. 
    That is standard -- that is Alabama procedure. 
    There is no requirement for a reindictment. 
    No requirement for a rearraignment. 
    The -- as a matter of fact, Alabama, I think follows a majority of the states in that. 
    There are number of various jurisdictions which are cited where Alabama has a limitation on that if your indictment is amended or the man is acquitted of a higher offense by being convicted of a law then better practices to reindict, but we don't require it. 
    And the --

    Are you saying -- are you saying that if cases go up from the trial court to your Supreme Court, and your Supreme Court reverses for error in the admission of evidence for erroneous charge or anyone of the grounds on which a state court can and your Supreme Court does reversed, you've got a good many reversals over the years unfortunately. 
    When it goes back, you -- you continue it as what -- as though -- as those what, still part of the original indictment and arraignment, is that right?

    It was simply reversed. 
    That of course is not correct. 
    The waiting of this Court's judgment reversed the case to the Supreme Court of Alabama for proceedings not inconsistent with the opinion of this Court.

    On the Alabama practice, there is no statute of limitation on any capital offense. 
    Now, the defendant in getting to the grand -- to the challenge to the grand jury in 1952, the defendant was arrested on November 10th. 
    He was arraigned on November 4th -- indicted on November the 14th. 
    He was arraigned on November the 15th. 
    At the time of he -- his arraignment, he was represented by counsel of his own choice, counsel that petitioner now freely admits was competent and capable and exerted every effort in his behalf. 
    On the 15th when he was arraigned, the -- Mr. (Inaudible) who then represented petitioner asked for a continuance of the arraignment. 
    He stated no grounds for that continuance. 
    He simply -- as we find in the practice of criminal law, a great many continuances are requested. 
    He subsequently requested a continuance of the trial. 
    It's -- when -- then on -- now, Alabama practice requires that a -- requires that an indictment be attacked by plea in abatement which must be filed before a plea to the merits.

    There is a record. 
    He simply made a motion for a continuance. 
    He stated no grounds for it. 
    On the 26th, when this case came for trial, he then filed a motion to quash the indictment alleging systematic exclusion of Negroes from the grand jury. 
    Now, that was 11 days after he was arraigned. 
    That motion was overruled and then he filed a motion to quash the binary which really gave him exactly the same thing because our -- our grand jury and trial binary are taken from the same box. 
    Now, he abandoned the motion to quash the indictment. 
    He did not argue that before the Supreme Court of Alabama on his subsequent appeal. 
    He -- it was neither briefed it and argued before this case in 1954. 
    We meet again in 1955 when we again go to trial with this defendant, and they then asked that they'd be allowed to withdraw their pleas to the merits filed on November the 15th, 1952. 
    The State asked grounds that they've got different lawyers and that they would like to test the constitutionality of the -- of constitutional questions in regard to grand jury which the -- actually, the motion that we are now considering was filed two and a half years after arraignment. 
    Now, the -- he had his opportunity. 
    I -- I will point this out to the Court that there is a relatively short time between the time Mr. (Inaudible) was hired. 
    I don't know when he was hired, but it was a day or so before the arraignment of Jeremiah Reeves. 
    Now, on the Alabama practice, a one paragraph pleading would have been sufficient on a motion to quash the indictment. 
    He could have. 
    There was no insuperable barrier to keep him as -- as in (Inaudible) case. 
    There was nothing to keep him if he had wanted to from filing that plea in abatement.

    Title 30 of Section 52 of our code provides that in all civil and criminal cases, either parties shall have the right to examine jurors as to their qualifications, interest or bias that would affect the trial of the case and shall have the right under the direction of the Court to examine said jurors as to any matter that might tend to affect their verdict. 
    Now, there seemed to be two -- there seemed to be two different rules and different jurisdiction. 
    Some courts limit questions to what may affect the qualification of a juror. 
    We do not. 
    Our cases say that we may examine on anything that will help determine a man's interest by his prejudice or whatsoever.

   Argument of Orzell Billingsley, Jr.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3403.333" stopTime="3404.826">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Billingsley.
speaker="orzell_billingsley_jr" startTime="3404.826" stopTime="3962.177">
    Mr. Orzell Billingsley, Jr. 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    The case of Jeremiah Reeves versus State of Alabama as reported at 340 U.S. 891, 75 Supreme Court 214 cites two cases in the season of this Court. 
    There was no direction given by this Court and the case was not remanded. 
    As a matter of fact, it's just a reversal and however we take the position that this reversal, unqualified reversal amounted to a plea of not guilty so far as defendant is -- was concerned and that the defendant should have been discharged. 
    We -- this case was decided upon by this Court in December 1954 and the defendant was held in jail until May of 1955 at which time he was again found guilty and sentenced to death. 
    We feel that any discussion of our motions relative to the indictment in the grand jury should have been considered by the Court. 
    On November the 14th as we've already said, the defendant was indicted and he was arraigned on November 15th which I'm sure was less than the indictment -- the arraignment followed the indictment less than 24 hours. 
    The -- the juries of the honorable court of Montgomery has this -- has this discretion to allow the defendant in such cases to withdraw his plea of not guilty and in this case, a plea of not guilty and not guilty by reason of insanity. 
    And it seems to me that where a man is being tried before a court and his life is in jeopardy that it would not have been any trap at all for the Court to allow counsel for the defendant or petitioner to go into the indictment in the grand jury. 
    An interesting thing about the jury commission of Montgomery County is that it is composed of the two Circuit Judges, the sheriff of the County, the judge of the probate court and the clerk of the court. 
    The record will show that the Honorable Judge Carter has been a judge of Montgomery County for 21 years. 
    The record will show that the Honorable Judge Walter B. Jones has been a judge of Montgomery County for 20 years. 
    The record will show that Mr. John R. Mathews who is clerk of the court had been clerk for 20 years. 
    And all during that time, these men have served as jury commissioners. 
    Mr. John R. Mathews is also the Clerk of the jury commission. 
    Montgomery is somewhat different from most of the counties in Alabama and that any qualified citizen might be appointed as a member of the jury commission. 
    But in Montgomery, under the local law, they have to be either judge, sheriff, probate judge, or clerk of the court to be a member of the jury commission. 
    Now, concerning the fact that these three men mentioned have been commissioners or jury supervisors, whatever you call, for 20 years in a county where the population is 60% white, 40% colored, that they could held during that time very easily to familiarize themselves of the people of that county. 
    It's different from other counties and that the commissioners might serve a year or two years or whatnot and then they have to come in and adjust themselves to the situation, but we find that even the Honorable Jurist Eugene Carter being asked about the grand juries in Montgomery County. 
    This question is put to him. 
    “Do you know of any occasions when two or more Negroes sit on a grand jury?" 
    He answers. 
    "I recall one said." 
    He further states on page 55 of the printed record and asked this. 
    Now, the question, “Do you recall the largest number of Negroes you saw serving on a jury at one time?" 
    Answer: "No, I wouldn't know." 
    Question: "Have you ever seen as many as four?" 
    Answer: "It is impossible for me to tell you as many as four or how many. 
    I don't know; "We hardly pick a jury now without -- now, listen to this. 
    "We would hardly pick a jury now about having over four." 
    Question:"Four Negro jurors?" 
    Answer: "I remember at one time there were very few. 
    In fact, we were not able to get them until the last year or two." 
    Now, this is in 1955 of making. 
    Jeremiah Reeves was indicted on November 14, 1952. 
    That is the mission on the part of the witness here that during that time, they had very few Negroes on the jury list. 
    Now, in 1955, when he's being tried and we asked the Court to let us withdraw the pleas of the defendant and file our motion to quash the indictment, the Court refused. 
    And certainly, it seems that the type of testimony which we have in the case of this kind that there is discrimination or there was in 1952, discrimination in Montgomery County, Alabama. 
    Now, we are not alleging before this Court the proposition as put to you in the respondent's brief on proportional representation. 
    We are not arguing that, but we are saying as your decision -- decisions hold that the selection of jurors should be done according to the Court of Alabama. 
    That is considering all the qualifications out there that they will include men, just men between the ages of 21 and 65. 
    That's all we asked, but the testimony will show that the witnesses in their anxiety to be fair to testify that they deliberately went out and got Negroes and put them on the list. 
    Well, I don't think that is the law either. 
    I don't think it should be a matter of inclusion or exclusion, just a fair system of operation. 
    That's all we asked and in order to try this defendant before their Court.

    Yes, sir, but that's -- that's my belief, as a matter of fact, a type of selection which will be a selective method, you might have a grand jury concerned of population in Montgomery County of all Negroes, all white. 
    You may have all Negroes of five or six. 
    But now, this is a pretty peculiar situation that even the Solicitor on cross-examination, I asked him about the grand jury which indicted Jeremiah Reeves. 
    I asked him, question: "Were there any Negroes on the grand jury that indicted Jeremiah Reeves, Jr.?" 
    He answers, “I do not know for sure. 
    My best judgment states, I wouldn't know. 
    My best judgment would be no. 
    It will be no.” 
    Now, it is -- it -- it could be peculiar for you have 18 men on the grand jury and all of them are white men. 
    Every one of them is white men.

    And of course, our -- our question that changed according to the evidence. 
    Our time is short and I would like to make just one statement concerning the demurrers made by the Solicitor in this case regarding the NAACP. 
    I think it -- it tended to prejudice the minds of the jurors or as far as the statement is concerned in which he mentioned that this case was being financed by the NAACP. 
    He could have easily asked me and I would have told him who spend for the case of Jeremiah Reeves, but I think we know very well the status of the NAACP in the State of Alabama, cases before you now of the case of NAACP, but we submit that this case should be reversed (Inaudible).
