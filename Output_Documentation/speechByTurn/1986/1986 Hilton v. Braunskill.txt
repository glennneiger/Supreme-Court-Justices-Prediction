    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Mr. Holl, you may proceed whenever you're ready.
speaker="john_g_holl" startTime="71.262" stopTime="173.045">
    Mr. John G. Holl 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court-- 
    This case is here on a writ of certiorari to the Third Circuit Court of Appeals, and it involves a purely legal issue of the interpretation of Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 23(c), specifically the permissible factors that federal courts can take into account in determining whether or not to release a successful habeas petitioner pending an appeal by the state. 
    Relying almost exclusively on the decision of the Third Circuit in Carter against Rafferty, the Third Circuit has held and the district court below have held that they will only take into account the possibility of flight in making this decision. 
    The state of New Jersey, Petitioner herein, is arguing that there are additional factors that are properly considered under 23(c), including the chances of success on appeal by the state as a factor that the court should take into account, as well as the dangerousness of the Petitioner. 
    Initially, I would note with respect to the factor of likelihood of success on appeal, that issue I don't think was considered by the Carter court. 
    The Carter court concentrated exclusively on dangerousness.

    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    You mean the Carter court did not explicitly reject--
speaker="john_g_holl" startTime="175.580" stopTime="176.314">
    Mr. John G. Holl 
    Yes.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="176.314" stopTime="178.366">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    --likelihood of success on appeal?
speaker="john_g_holl" startTime="178.366" stopTime="309.584">
    Mr. John G. Holl 
    That's correct. 
    And I think the rationale of the Carter decision, which is something that we take issue with but I'll get into later, even if you apply the rationale of the Carter decision, which is the federal courts can only take into account what it perceives as a federal interest, if you apply that rationale you would see that the chances of state success on appeal is also a federal interest. 
    We have the state as a party in a federal action. 
    The Respondent is a party in a federal action. 
    There is an appeal to a federal court. 
    So the outcome of that appeal is certainly an issue which the federal courts have an interest in, and should be an appropriate factor under 23(c) even if you accept the Carter analysis-- 
    However, we don't think that the Carter court interpreted 23(c) properly. 
    We think that there are a number of reasons to reject the narrow interpretation that the Carter court adopted here. 
    The first one is, the Carter court held that the only interest, the only factor, is a probability of flight. 
    We think that the language of the rule, which is extremely broad and which says that a petitioner is presumed to be released... it doesn't specifically use the word of presumption of release, but the state would concede that the rule does contain a presumption of release. 
    The presumption of release is there when a petitioner is successful in district court, but it can be overcome. 
    He shall be released unless a court shall order otherwise. 
    In those instances... that's kind of broad language right there. 
    It's extremely broad language, and we don't think there's any reason to believe that it narrowly confines the federal courts to the probability of flight.

 It seems to me if there's any interest in holding this prisoner, it's a state interest, not a federal interest, and that if the states would not... if the state would in fact let this individual out pending appeal from a state habeas corpus, I see no reason whatever why the federal court should do otherwise.

    I believe that's a very important interest here. 
    An important federal interest in comity is to maintain the status quo and to take into account all factors that are relevant to this decision as to whether or not to stay. 
    There's no good reason in law or justice, and the courts are required under Section 2243 of the habeas corpus law to dispose of these matters as law and justice require. 
    That's a broad standard.

    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    What you're saying, I take it, is in the case where perhaps the state... where the district court orders release on habeas, the state has a plausible case on appeal but not an overwhelming one, there a very dangerous habeas petitioner probably should not be released, one who is not found dangerous probably should be released?

    Mr. John G. Holl 
    That's correct. 
    That's basically what we're saying. 
    We're saying that dangerous is an appropriate factor, because in some cases the state's case on appeal will be more or less substantial, in that range where it should be considered and also would justify the weighing of the dangerousness of the prisoner.

    Mr. John G. Holl 
    The decision in Carter which estops a federal court from considering these factors does serious damage to comity. 
    The state, when it has a dangerous individual, is going to be forced, if the federal courts are not going to consider these factors, to retry a dangerous individual rather than risk being released pending appeal if a court won't take that into account in many cases. 
    And therefore, we won't be able to pursue our appeal. 
    If we have to... if we go back and retry an individual under the same kind of an order that was entered here by the district court, then we don't have a right to appeal. 
    Obviously we won't be permitted to pursue a retrial in the state court and a federal appeal at the same time. 
    This puts us in a very unpleasant situation.

    The Carter case eventually could get here. 
    I don't know whether it will. 
    There is a pending Carter case, and whether that issue remains a part of it I don't know. 
    I'm not familiar with the ongoing Carter case other than that issue.

    That's unclear. 
    I think pursuant... that brings up the practice of the issuance of conditional writs by the federal courts. 
    The federal courts have adopted a procedure in certain cases where they will tell a state, this petitioner has to be retried within a certain amount of time or else he's released, and we will have the order stayed.

    He's still incarcerated because a federal judge... this is a common practice, this issuance of conditional writs. 
    The federal courts will find that the petitioner was denied a fair trial and they will say to the state: This petitioner has to be retried within a certain amount of time; if you don't, he will be released. 
    But then they will stay that order for the state to appeal, and so there will not be in effect an order of the courts requiring the petitioner to be released.

    Mr. Mark H. Friedman 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    Although both parties in this case invoke federalism and comity to support their positions, their views of what those phrases mean in the context of Rule 23 could not contrast more starkly. 
    The Third Circuit's opinion in Carter versus Rafferty resolves the tension in federal-state relations that is a necessary by-product of habeas corpus litigation by construing Rule 23 in light of the basic interests that habeas serves, which is the vindication of constitutional rights, along with the unquestioned interest that any court has in seeing that parties, defendants or otherwise, will be available to answer to later court judgments, and by leaving other purely state interests to state courts themselves to resolve under state law, however it may be defined.

 Assuming the state didn't want to appeal and the district court entered one of these 30 day conditional orders that you've got to release him if you don't put him on trial within 30 days, and they do put him on trial within 25 days and they keep him in prison while they're doing this, do you agree that the federal court has power to do that?

    --After the 30 days expires, it depends on what the state has decided to do during that 30 days. 
    If it has decided to retry the defendant during the 30 days, in answer to an earlier question, then the jurisdiction of the district court lapses and he moves into the state system to be retried, at which point he could not be held. 
    So before the 30 days if the state moves to retry him, then it is state bail rules that would apply and federal jurisdiction would be divested. 
    If they decide to appeal, then when the 30 days expires without a retrial Carter would dictate he is released on a reasonable surety, unless--

    Mr. Mark H. Friedman 
    --The status quo that constantly is being referred to by the Petitioners is actually not the status quo, but the status quo ante, as though the judgment didn't exist. 
    Consideration has to be given to the equivalent federal interest that's shared by the federal courts and the defendant in having a writ issue that is effective. 
    Compare, if you will, the situation in a habeas case with the situation that is normally provided under Rule 8, a judgment for money or property, which is the standard Rule 8 situation. 
    If the appellant decides to take appeal after a judgment is given to him, then ordinarily what happens is the money or property is secured by a bond. 
    And the reason that that is done under Rule 8, under Rule 44 of this Court, under Rule 62 of the Civil Rules, is that both parties' interests are protected. 
    The appellant does not have to come up with the money or property immediately, to damage his interests; and the appellee, if he wins the case or she wins the case ultimately, is assured of payment. 
    Try to apply that to a habeas corpus situation involving a man's freedom and it simply does not work. 
    There is no bond, there is no supersedeas bond, there is no amount of money that can replace freedom that is lost.

    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    What about the standard for granting a stay by the appellate court, where you also have, you know, likelihood of success as a significant factor? 
    It's not the only one.
speaker="mark_h_friedman" startTime="2126.878" stopTime="2174.408">
    Mr. Mark H. Friedman 
    But as I was indicating, Mr. Chief Justice, the entry of a stay has to be tailored to protect the interests of both parties. 
    That cannot be done if the stay proceeding is applied to Rule 8 in a situation like this, where what will inevitably happen in this case if enlargement was stayed was he would have served his entire unconstitutionally obtained sentence even if he won the appeal. 
    The compromise to be adopted, I would submit, is the line taken by the Sixth Circuit in Jago versus District Court of Northern Ohio and in Hill versus Rose, where the Rule 8 procedure was used to stay the judgment ordering a retrial or holding a statute unconstitutional, but where deference was given to the fact that the defendant's interests were not damaged because he would be out.

    Mr. Mark H. Friedman 
    No, Your Honor, I don't think so, because when the period would end the defendant would still be out through a surety. 
    It is conditional... his freedom is conditional or his ability to be retried is conditional on his winning the appeal. 
    But I do not think it is the same doctrinal basis as the conditional writ.

    Mr. Mark H. Friedman 
    --What I'm trying to do to discharge that burden, Justice Stevens, is make a distinction between the release decision and the stay of the underlying order that held that the conviction was obtained unconstitutionally. 
    I think that the existence of the rule does mean that a stay of one in a habeas, in a unique habeas situation, does not necessarily apply to the other, because the defendant's interest in custody, particularly in a short sentence case like this, particularly in a case where the appeal would be going on long after he was released under regular parole rules in New Jersey, would mean that he would have, if the release decision was held to be stayed as opposed to simply the judgment, he would have no remedy at all.

    His burden, his position, is so different from a typical civil appellant that the distinction between the release order and the judgment, which as I say does have precedent in cases like Jaco and Hill versus Rose, is well suited to the habeas context, because without release from custody the chances are he would have no remedy whatsoever, even if the federal courts, even if this court or the circuit courts--

    Mr. Mark H. Friedman 
    Yes, Your Honor, where custody is no longer in issue, then this Court has ruled that habeas can reach other things. 
    But as a practical matter, in the real world, for a defendant being held in custody his remedy is what the habeas remedy has always been: release from custody, at least until his order or the basis for the order releasing him from custody is reversed by a higher court of competent jurisdiction. 
    It seems to me that the status quo that the state is arguing from represents nothing more than an absolutely resolute and relentless attempt to ignore the fact that he has received the judgment. 
    And I would ask Your Honor in considering the question of whether a stay that would stay his release and leave him to be paroled while the appeal was still pending is appropriate, given the nature of the habeas case. 
    There is a different track that you can go on that's fair to the interests of both sides.

    Your Honor has to separate the dangerousness component from the likelihood component because they implicate very different interests. 
    Even if Your Honors rule that the federal courts have and should have the power to stay an order of release based on likelihood of success, the dangerousness component has to be very strictly delineated from it, because the dangerousness to the community is a purely state function and it offends against federalism to allow federal courts to be used as means of defying... and that is all that they would be used for... as a means of defying the judgments made by the polity of the states, the constitution and legislatures and voters, that for defendants in a situation similar to this one, that he will be held even though no other state inmate in a comparable situation can be held.

    From the practical and legal sense, we contend that that is true, although we would say that if the Court decides to liken him instead to a defendant on bail pending appeal, the same underlying bottom line holds. 
    You still have to focus on the fact that he is pending appeal, but it is the state's appeal, because his conviction no longer exists. 
    It has been found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be fatally flawed, hence of no force and effect.

    Mr. Mark H. Friedman 
    It depends on whether or not you're talking about state habeas by a defendant who remains convicted, getting back to an earlier question that I believe Justice White asked, or a defendant who has been given, been granted a petition for post-conviction relief, which is what it is called in New Jersey, and the state wishes to appeal. 
    There is no case law on the subject as to what happens when a state district court judge grants a petition for post-conviction appeal... sorry... post-conviction relief. 
    But even there, the precise analogy--

    Mr. Mark H. Friedman 
    Until an appellate court decides that it is not. 
    At that point, we are, I admit, drifting on uncharted seas because we have no New Jersey appellate law that specifically says that. 
    I have the state's word for it in a footnote in their brief that there is no federal law. 
    There is certainly no analogue in the 1984 Bail Reform Act that covers that precise situation. 
    Apparently there is no case law. 
    But you have to look again at the state law. 
    Federalism requires that, and it seems to me that in the state like New Jersey, where unconvicted defendants are guaranteed bail until they are convicted, that a state post-conviction relief or a state appellate decision on direct appeal that would vitiate his conviction and set him free--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2837.151" stopTime="2841.722">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    But here the conviction has been upheld all through the New Jersey courts, hasn't it?
speaker="mark_h_friedman" startTime="2841.722" stopTime="2842.355">
    Mr. Mark H. Friedman 
    --It has.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2842.355" stopTime="2847.024">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    It's not as if they have thought there was reversible error in the case.
speaker="mark_h_friedman" startTime="2847.024" stopTime="2892.488">
    Mr. Mark H. Friedman 
    All that proves, it seems to me, with respect, Mr. Chief Justice, is that the state judgment has gotten all the deference it deserves up to the point at which a federal district court judge, a judge of competent jurisdiction, no matter how much the attorney general's representatives denigrate that judgment, that the state has been given all the deference it deserves by having the state be the first line of defense, if you will, for the vindication of constitutional rights. 
    Once the case is properly in the federal courts, than it is certainly within the power... as a matter of fact, it is the essence of the power... of the federal courts to disagree with the state judges and indicate that there have been constitutional violations that require his conviction be vitiated.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2892.488" stopTime="2906.164">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    But I don't think it follows from that that New Jersey would necessarily insist that he go free on his appeal from the federal district court habeas to the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.
speaker="mark_h_friedman" startTime="2906.164" stopTime="2919.138">
    Mr. Mark H. Friedman 
    Well, Your Honor, again the New Jersey Constitution says what it says. 
    The fact of the matter is the state has conceded, if I understand your question properly, that there is no preventive detention in New Jersey, except for a convicted offender.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2919.138" stopTime="2926.208">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    But the state is here speaking for New Jersey and saying: We think this fellow ought to be held.
speaker="mark_h_friedman" startTime="2926.208" stopTime="2939.016">
    Mr. Mark H. Friedman 
    I am not entirely certain, Your Honor, that you can say with absolute confidence that the state is speaking for the state of New Jersey on this issue. 
    The fact is that the New Jersey law in this issue--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2939.016" stopTime="2945.004">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    We've held in certainly other cases that the attorney general is presumed to speak for the state.
speaker="mark_h_friedman" startTime="2945.004" stopTime="2969.452">
    Mr. Mark H. Friedman 
    --Your Honor, the attorney general is speaking on behalf of the conviction. 
    He represents the state of New Jersey, I don't doubt that. 
    But the fact remains that the position they are taking in this Court is contrary, I would say, to the position of the law in New Jersey on the subject that we're discussing. 
    To that extent, they differ from the state law, and they are asking federal courts to override state law.

speaker="mark_h_friedman" startTime="3033.394" stopTime="3277.469">
    Mr. Mark H. Friedman 
    --The federal court should do precisely what it did in Carter anyway, because the fact is the federal court has its own rules to follow. 
    I do not think that what the state court does should affect what the federal court does, because all that proves is that under certain situations the state can handle the problem of its defendants any way it pleases. 
    And I think that that should certainly not affect whether or not a federal court should grant it in similar situations, since we are talking about concurrent jurisdictions here. 
    Your question raises the ultimate issue in this case, particularly as regards dangerousness. 
    The fact is that there is no roving commission in either the federal courts or the state courts to sweep dangerous people off the streets wherever they find them. 
    Dangerousness and the determination of who shall be held because they're dangerous follows the forms of the law. 
    The area of preventive pretrial detention or the area of detention of unconvicted defendants, whatever analogue you use, is a quintessentially state concern, and Carter pays deference to that state concern by allowing the states to act on this defendant, who is no longer subject to conviction, in any way they please as long as their decision is constitutional. 
    And after all, this Court has not determined whether preventive detention is unconstitutional in any case. 
    But the fact is that the Hobson's choice that their positing because they can't out a dangerous person away simply does not exist, or if it does exist it's because the polity, as I said, of the state of New Jersey, its Constitution and its voters, have determined that that's how they wish to run their affairs in the criminal justice system. 
    The Hobson's choice does not exist in any case. 
    There is nothing about what the federal court would do in the release decision that would prevent this appeal from going forward. 
    And what would simply happen is he would be released on a sufficient surety. 
    If the state instead, as I indicated earlier to Justice Scalia's question, decides that they wish to retry this person, then as Justice Scalia indicated earlier, by submitting the defendant once again to state processes on retrial, they cannot hold him. 
    What avenue is that out of their Hobson's choice? 
    The fact is that the state's right to appeal has ample protection in this Court, in the appellate court, regardless of what happens to this defendant in terms of his custody. 
    Their interests are protected in that sense. 
    Allowing the defendant to be held while the appeal goes on would do nothing more in a case like this one, where we've already passed the first anniversary of this appeal in the Third Circuit, than extinguish the defendant's rights to an effective remedy. 
    And the Court should pay some concern to that, because certainly the state's interests that Petitioners put forth as a party litigant are amply protected without any regard to Rule 23. 
    In closing, Your Honors, we do feel that the Carter decision as we have described it serves the interests of every party properly. 
    It serves the interests of this Court, that this Court has shown in federalism and comity, by allowing the states to act within their proper sphere. 
    It safeguards the rights of the defendant by allowing him to have an efficacious remedy while the appeal is pending. 
    And it would do substantial justice in a case of this kind. 
    If Your Honors intend to depart from Carter, I would submit it should do by finding an unmistakably federal interest or one that is related to the federal role in habeas cases. 
    Since the state has presented no such interest here, in our judgment, since no interest cognizable by the federal court could justify holding this defendant, whatever the test, we think that the decision of the Third Circuit en banc in refusing to grant a stay or to reconsider the Carter opinion should be affirmed. 
    If Your Honors have no further questions.
