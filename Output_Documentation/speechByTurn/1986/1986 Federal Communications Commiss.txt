    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    In this case which comes to us on appeal from the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. 
    The Court of Appeals in that case held that the Pole Attachments ACT of the state to be unconstitutional. 
    That Act provides that the Federal Communications Commission may regulate the rates which elected power utilities charge, cable television operators wishing to connect transmission cable to the utility poles. 
    We reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals. 
    Justice Powell has filed a concurring opinion in which Justices O'Connor joins.
