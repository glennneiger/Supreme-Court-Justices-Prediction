South Dakota v. Dole

    Mr. Roger A. Tellinghuisen 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the issue in this case is whether or not Congress may condition the receipt of highway funds upon a state having in effect the 21-year-old drinking age. 
    In 1984 Congress enacted 23 USC Section 158. 
    Section 158 of that Act conditions a receipt of highway funds upon a state having in effect a 21-year-old drinking age for all alcoholic beverages. 
    The Act prohibits or mandates that the Secretary of Transportation shall not distribute 5 percent of a state's highway funds if it is not in compliance for Fiscal Year 1987, and it further mandates that the Secretary will withhold 10 percent of those funds for each and every year thereafter that the state has failed to comply. 
    South Dakota, like every other state in the nation, is a recipient of Federal highway funds under the programs referred to in Section 158.

    General Tellinghuisen, would you explain whether you think this case might be moot now? 
    South Dakota has changed the law, as I understand it.

    Mr. Roger A. Tellinghuisen 
    That's correct, Your Honor. 
    What I would point out to the Court is that in the last legislative session, recognizing that South Dakota, not unlike any other state in the Union, is dependent upon these funds, adopted a 21-year-old drinking age that will not go into effect until April 1st of 1988.

speaker="roger_a_tellinghuisen" startTime="190.773" stopTime="214.205">
    Mr. Roger A. Tellinghuisen 
    That's correct. 
    The legislature in enacting the law that it passed this legislative session specifically provided within the statute itself that the legislation would repeal itself upon either a favorable decision from this Court or upon Congressional action repealing the mandatory withholding provisions of Section 158.
speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="214.205" stopTime="216.674">
    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    We know how to do things out in the upper midwest.
speaker="roger_a_tellinghuisen" startTime="216.674" stopTime="483.080">
    Mr. Roger A. Tellinghuisen 
    That's correct. 
    For the past 48 years South Dakota has allowed persons younger than age 21 to consume low point beer, ever since South Dakota has adopted an approach that not only recognizes the social concerns over alcohol but has gradually introduced its young people to alcoholic beverages. 
    Twice since 1939 we have raised our minimum drinking age for low point beer from 18 to 19, and since the repeal of state prohibition in 1934 we have required all persons to be at least 21 years old before they would be allowed to consume alcoholic beverages other than low point beer. 
    South Dakota has likewise enacted and strictly enforced drinking driver statutes, and over the course of the last few years through the strict enforcement of those statutes we have effectuated a 30 percent reduction in the number of drinking-related fatalities on our highways. 
    In September of 1984 we filed a complaint in District Court, seeking a declaration that Section 158 was unconstitutional and further requesting an injunction prohibiting the Secretary of Transportation from enforcing the provisions of that statute. 
    The District Court dismissed and the Court of Appeals affirmed on the basis that South Dakota's complaint failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. 
    Just by procedural... or just by a little bit of history, as this Court is aware, in 1933 this nation adopted the Twenty-First Amendment, thereby repealing 16 years of national prohibition and reserving to the states the power of choice as to whether or not to allow the importation of alcoholic beverages within their own states. 
    This Court has also recognized that a state has the absolute power to prohibit totally the sale of alcohol within its own borders pursuant to the Twenty-First Amendment, and this Court has equally recognized that a state has broad power under the Twenty-First Amendment to regulate the times, places, and circumstances under which alcohol may be sold. 
    As this Court stated in New York State Liquor Authority versus Balianca, 
    "It is equally well recognized that a state has broad power under the Twenty-First Amendment to regulate the times, places, and circumstances under which liquor may be sold. " 
    Put another way, this Court stated in California Liquor Dealers v. Midcal that the Twenty-First Amendment grants the states virtually complete control over whether to permit importation or sale of liquor and how to structure the liquor distribution system. 
    In resolving conflicts between state alcohol regulations and Federal policies, the Court has first sought to determine whether the state regulation that was involved implicates what this Court has generally characterized as a Section 2 core power. 
    The Court has suggested that when a state has attempted to directly regulate a Section 2 core power under the Twenty-First Amendment that it will prevail irrespective of its conflict with a contrary Federal policy. 
    The state would submit to the Court, recognizing that this Court has never formally offered a clear delineation of what constitutes a Section 2 core power, that the ability of a state to determine for its own inhabitants or for its own... the people found within its borders, the age at which a person will be allowed to consume an alcoholic beverage is central to the power reserved to the states under the Twenty-First Amendment. 
    This Court, as I indicated earlier, recognized that a state has the absolute power of prohibition--
speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="483.080" stopTime="486.049">
    Justice Harry A. Blackmun

    Mr. Roger A. Tellinghuisen 
    --That's correct, Your Honor. 
    However, the Constitutionally impermissible part of Congress's plan is that it forces South Dakota to make a choice of whether or not it will freely exercise the powers given to it under the Twenty-First Amendment or whether it will suffer--

speaker="roger_a_tellinghuisen" startTime="538.334" stopTime="622.957">
    Mr. Roger A. Tellinghuisen 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, in direct response to Justice Blackmun's question concerning the ability of the states to still have a choice even in the face of Section 158, I would submit to the Court that that is erroneous or that assumption is in error for two reasons. 
    One, it presupposes that the Federal Government has the ability to regulate in the face of the Twenty-First Amendment the age at which a state such as South Dakota sets its minimum drinking age, and secondly, it is in direct contradiction to the legislative history that surrounds the original amendment in its debate over what was then contained as a Section 3 to the amendment, which would have given Congress concurrent power to regulate or prohibit the sale of intoxicating liquors where those liquors were to be drunk on the premises sold. 
    At that time, unlike the inconsistencies that were present in the debate over Section 2, there was no inconsistency in that regard. 
    It was the intent of Congress by deletion of Section 3 to remove the Federal Government from the area of alcohol regulation within a state from which it had in the opinion of Congress and in the opinion of this Court had trespassed.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="622.957" stopTime="633.045">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well, Mr. Tellinghuisen, you think the Twenty-First Amendment went further than just to deal with the commerce power of Congress then?
speaker="roger_a_tellinghuisen" startTime="633.045" stopTime="665.850">
    Mr. Roger A. Tellinghuisen 
    Yes, I do, Your Honor, and I rely on this Court's decisions in addressing the Twenty-First Amendment when this Court has said that the Twenty-First Amendment, while it is transparently clear that it operated as a limitation upon the commerce clause, it equally recognized that the Twenty-First Amendment gave to the states broad powers to regulate in the area of the times or places or even the sale of liquor, in other words, the liquor distribution system within that state.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="665.850" stopTime="673.289">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well, don't you think they would have had that just under traditional reserve power of states?
speaker="roger_a_tellinghuisen" startTime="673.289" stopTime="713.831">
    Mr. Roger A. Tellinghuisen 
    Well, I would certainly maintain that, Your Honor. 
    I recognize, however, this Court's decisions in regards to the commerce clause in the face of the Tenth Amendment, and that the Tenth Amendment does not in and of itself operate as a limitation on Congress's power. 
    I think the distinction here is that in the face of the Twenty-First Amendment Congress intended and the states upon ratification of the Amendment assumed that they were going to be given the power to first off determine whether they would permit the sale of alcohol at all, and if they chose to, to enforce the regulations surrounding the sale of that alcohol.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="713.831" stopTime="724.738">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    And here you say that because Congress is cutting off 5 percent of South Dakota's highway fund money, South Dakota is not able to do what it wants?
speaker="roger_a_tellinghuisen" startTime="724.738" stopTime="743.886">
    Mr. Roger A. Tellinghuisen 
    That's correct, and I am suggesting... what I am suggesting to the Court is that the presentation of the choice irrespective of the amount of money involved is what... is the impermissible derogation of the state's powers under the Twenty-First Amendment.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="743.886" stopTime="751.890">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    There are a lot of cases that have sustained the Congress's spending power, Steward Machine Company, a long line of cases.
speaker="roger_a_tellinghuisen" startTime="751.890" stopTime="773.921">
    Mr. Roger A. Tellinghuisen 
    That is correct, Your Honor. 
    We are certainly not unmindful of those cases, and for the Court to rule in the state's favor on this case would not require this Court to overrule any of those prior cases concerning limitations or claimed limitations on Congress's power under the spending clause. 
    In the Steward Machine case, for instance--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="773.921" stopTime="796.334">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    You mean provided we gave the Twenty-First Amendment the broader preemption that you would argue should be given. 
    What if we think that the Twenty-First Amendment only took away Congress's power under the commerce clause?
speaker="roger_a_tellinghuisen" startTime="796.334" stopTime="899.219">
    Mr. Roger A. Tellinghuisen 
    --I would say, Your Honor, that if the Court were to find that the operation of the Twenty-First Amendment only prevented Congress from interfering with a state's right to allow into the state the importation of alcohol, that certainly would put us in a more difficult position, but that is not what this Court has recognized in, for instance, Capital Cities Cable versus Crisp. 
    The Court in that case, if I may just briefly recite from that opinion, the Court stated, 
    "In contrast to state regulation governing the conditions under which liquor may be imported or sold within the state, the application of Oklahoma's advertising ban to the importation to distant signals by cable television operators engages only indirectly the central power reserved by the Twenty-First Amendment, that of exercising control over whether to permit importation or sale of liquor and how to structure the liquor distribution system. " 
    Following that line of reasoning that this Court has adopted not only in Capital Cities Cable v. Crisp but in Midcal and again referred to in this Court's most recent decision dealing with the Twenty-First Amendment, 324 Liquor versus Duffy. 
    The states are given this broad power in areas not only related exclusively to the decision of whether or not to permit importation but they are given the power to regulate the very liquor that it allows under its ability to allow importation.

    It is very easy to say that the structure of the distribution system has a very close tie to the importation, which is what the Twenty-First Amendment specifically addresses.

    Mr. Roger A. Tellinghuisen 
    --Well, in effect it does, Your Honor. 
    I guess I would argue that point in that the distribution system of alcohol is certainly directly related to or is one and the same of determining how it can be sold or distributed within the state, and the setting of a minimum drinking age is basic to that consideration.

    You are going to be arguing later when you address the scope of the Federal Government's commerce power that one can't stretch things to infinity, and it seems to me you are arguing a very broad notion of what importation includes and distribution includes.

   Argument of Louis R. Cohen
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1470.476" stopTime="1479.999">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Thank you, Mr. Tellinghuisen. 
    We will hear now from you Mr. Cohen.
speaker="deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen" startTime="1479.999" stopTime="1592.755">
    Mr. Louis R. Cohen 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, I propose to argue two points. 
    First, that Section 2 of the Twenty-First Amendment does not reach this case at all because it does not say that Congress may not in the valid exercise of its own powers bar or encourage states to bar sales of alcoholic beverages that a state might prefer to permit, and second, that Section 158 is a judicious and proper use of the Federal spending power that does not violate either the Tenth Amendment or, if it is applicable at all, the Twenty-First Amendment. 
    Section 2 of the Twenty-First Amendment prohibits transportation or importation of alcoholic beverages for delivery or use in violation of state law. 
    It thus broadly confirms state power to restrict those activities, notwithstanding obstacles to state regulation that would otherwise be imposed by the commerce clause and sometimes other provisions of the Constitution. 
    Section 2 may also in some situations prevent Congress from legislating to require or permit activities that violate state law although in every actual case... I think of Crisp and Midcal and 324 Liquor... the Federal statute prevailed. 
    But Section 2 speaks only of activities in violation of state law. 
    I suggest that the words simply cannot be read to prohibit Congress from imposing restrictions of its own or encouraging states to impose additional restrictions on alcohol transactions.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="1592.755" stopTime="1599.176">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Do you think that Congress could bring back prohibition under your view, under the spending power?
speaker="deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen" startTime="1599.176" stopTime="1641.855">
    Mr. Louis R. Cohen 
    I don't think that Section 2 answers that question. 
    The Court gave a partial answer to that question back in 1917 in the Clark Distilling case... this is before Prohibition... when the Court said... this is 242 U.S. at 325... 
    "It is not in the slightest degree disputed that if Congress had prohibited the shipment of all intoxicants in the channels of interstate commerce and therefore had prevented all movement between the several states, such action would have been lawful because within the power to regulate which the Constitution conferred. "
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1641.855" stopTime="1643.438">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    That was before the Twenty-First Amendment.
speaker="deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen" startTime="1643.438" stopTime="1689.335">
    Mr. Louis R. Cohen 
    Yes, it was, but it seems to me that if you take the Twenty-First Amendment in its two parts, the passage and later repeal of Prohibition didn't change that, and it seems to me that the plain words of Section 2 don't change that either, because if the Congress were today... I don't suggest that it is politically likely... to adopt the statute that was envisioned in Clark Distilling, that statute would not involve any transportation, importation, delivery, or use of alcoholic beverages in violation of state law and therefore would not be prohibited by Section 2 of the Twenty-First Amendment.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1689.335" stopTime="1709.416">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    What if you take the converse of that situation? 
    Congress decides it has been a bad year for the distilleries and therefore it requires that any state accept shipments even though the state may be dry by choice. 
    It says it is the policy of the Federal Government to require freedom of movement in interstate commerce of hard liquor.
speaker="deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen" startTime="1709.416" stopTime="1748.041">
    Mr. Louis R. Cohen 
    I am drawing a distinction between a prohibition and a protection at transactions in alcoholic beverages that it seems to me Section 2 draws. 
    Congress may well be, although the Court has never actually said so, may well be prohibited from legislating in a way that requires the state to accept or allow alcoholic beverages or alcoholic beverage transactions that the state chooses to prohibit because Section 2--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="1748.041" stopTime="1756.647">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    You are using the word "may" and it sounds as though that sort of requires a little construction of the amendment, too, doesn't it? 
    It is not quite a plain language.
speaker="deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen" startTime="1756.647" stopTime="1802.859">
    Mr. Louis R. Cohen 
    --Well, I am not trying to make just a wooden plain language argument. 
    What I am suggesting is that the text of the amendment demonstrates an intention to protect the right of the states to restrict or prohibit or tax or burden the delivery or use of alcoholic beverages. 
    It does not by its text, and I think it should not be interpreted to, bar Congress from imposing additional restrictions that don't require transactions the state is trying to prohibit. 
    The text--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="1802.859" stopTime="1809.781">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    How does that tie in with this case?
speaker="deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen" startTime="1809.781" stopTime="1898.972">
    Mr. Louis R. Cohen 
    --In this case what Congress has done is to pass a statute which encourages the state to prohibit alcoholic beverage transactions that the state chooses not to prohibit, sales to 19 and 20-year-olds. 
    The objection is that the state has some sort of right under the Twenty-First Amendment to allow those transactions to take place. 
    I am suggesting that if you read Section 2 it doesn't say that. 
    I further suggest that the source from which that text was drawn, the pre-Prohibition Webb Kenyon Act, which... whose... further illustrates the point. 
    The purpose of that Act, which was clear from its text and its legislative history and this Court's explanation of that Act in the Clark Distilling case, was to withdraw the protection of the commerce clause so that states could regulate alcoholic beverages in ways that might be... might otherwise be objectionable obstructions of commerce. 
    As this Court explained in Craig against Boren, the purpose of Section 2 was to constitutionalize that framework. 
    It was not--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="1898.972" stopTime="1903.724">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Is 324 Liquor Corporation consistent with that view?
speaker="deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen" startTime="1903.724" stopTime="1960.663">
    Mr. Louis R. Cohen 
    --I think so. 
    I think that what 324 Liquor suggests is that there are occasions when Federal law may conflict with state efforts to restrict or impose rules on transactions in alcoholic beverages where Federal law nevertheless prevails. 
    But the Twenty-First Amendment was properly involved in the 325 Liquor case because you had a state activity, namely state pricing regulations restricting transactions that is protected by the amendment. 
    In this case we have no transportation, importation, delivery, or use in violation of state law. 
    Let me illustrate with an example.

speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="1996.019" stopTime="1999.971">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Do you think that might come as a little bit of a surprise to the drafters of the Twenty-First Amendment?
speaker="deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen" startTime="1999.971" stopTime="2155.507">
    Mr. Louis R. Cohen 
    --No, because Congress and this Court promptly demonstrated their understanding that the Twenty-First Amendment was not intended to restrict the otherwise valid exercise of Congressional power to impose burdens on or additional restrictions on alcoholic beverage transactions in ways that do not require a violation of state law. 
    Congress enacted the Federal Alcohol Administration Act in 1935 which extensively regulates importation and manufacture and wholesaling and labeling of alcoholic beverages. 
    That statue was challenged in this Court in the William Jameson case in 1939 on the ground that the Twenty-First Amendment turned the whole subject over to the states, and the Court said per curiam, summarily, we see no substance in that contention. 
    I suggest that what would have startled the 1935 Congress and the 1939 Court would have been a suggestion that states cannot only require, say, wholesalers to get state permits and apply state-approved labels, but can also insist on permitting wholesalers to operate without Federal permits, and on permitting beverages to be sold locally without Federal labels. 
    That, it seems to me, is the parallel here. 
    Maybe I make it clearer if I say that I think that if Congress were attempting to encourage the states to lower their drinking ages, there would be a Twenty-First Amendment problem, and the argument that I am now making would not be applicable, because Congress would be... I am not necessarily suggesting that a use of the spending clause would be invalid for that reason, but Congress would be encouraging a transaction that violates the state law as it now stands. 
    What we have here is something--

    Mr. Louis R. Cohen 
    Congress gets the power, I think, under the spending clause, and our only claim is that they have the power under the spending clause.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="2180.355" stopTime="2202.738">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    What is the the spending clause case that you think is closest to this one in the relationship between the purpose of the expenditure and the condition that is imposed upon receipt of the funds? 
    The purpose of the expenditure here is what, improve highways?
speaker="deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen" startTime="2202.738" stopTime="2321.965">
    Mr. Louis R. Cohen 
    Let me interject, because I want to, that I think that the... I think that that question is not before the Court, and I want at least to note that, although I am going to respond, I am going to respond to the question. 
    The... it was discussed below, but the state didn't raise this question in the Court of Appeals, and it is not, I think, comprehended within either of the questions presented, and I note that the state says in its brief that it has never contended that the Congressional action was unreasonable or unrelated to an national concern in the absence of the Twenty-First Amendment. 
    If the question is before the Court, it seems to me that the answer is first that the expenditure is plainly within Congress's power under the general welfare clause and second, that the condition attached to that expenditure is within Congress's power under the necessary and proper clause because it is sufficiently germane to the purpose of the expenditure. 
    One of the express purposes of Federal highway assistance is to promote safe travel. 
    Nevertheless, one of the consequences of this expenditure and the resulting improvement in our highway system is to exacerbate the problem of what President Reagan called blood borders between states. 
    Section 158 is a measure to help achieve the safety purpose and combat the blood borders problem. 
    It seems to me that it is open to Congress to decide that it doesn't want to provide full Federal funding for highways in states where those highways may be used by young persons in lawful quest of alcohol.

    Is there some limit then on Congress spending power of a requirement of germaneness or relatedness?

    Mr. Louis R. Cohen 
    The answer is that the Court has frequently said there is some kind of a limit attached to the spending power, and to my knowledge has never said what that limit is. 
    I think there is and I think there should be such a limit. 
    I would hope Congress would recognize such a limit on its own. 
    I think it is a very hard line to draw. 
    But I think it is appropriate for the Court to draw a germaneness line.

    Germane to what? 
    Mr. Cohen, could you answer my question? 
    You still haven't given me the case that you think is... I don't find that a terribly proximate relationship. 
    We are building highways in order... I guess partly to increase safety of travel, and one of the things that impairs the safety of travel is kids driving somewhere else to buy liquor. 
    I mean, what about heart attacks?

    I don't know whether it would have had and it certainly wasn't justified in that case on the basis of its having an independent power to impose those particular requirements other than as a condition of the grant of funds, but I will give you Oklahoma against Civil Service Commission, the classic case in this area. 
    Congress provides that any state officer or employee whose employment is primarily in connection with any project that is funded in whole or in part by Federal funds must satisfy the Hatch Act's requirements with respect to political activity. 
    This Court--

    In the case that you suppose it seems to me that the position that the state is in is not dissimilar from the position the state is in exercising a Tenth Amendment power which it has in which the Federal Government presumably cannot directly constitutionally take away from it but which the Federal Government can urge it to exercise in a particular way by conditioning a Federal grant.

    You could even condition the grant on every state that adopts a unicameral legislature.

    I think that there is in the germaneness test the possibility of saying, look, a very large and very central state interest can't be germane to a very small Federal interest, but in the Lead-Deadwood case, the Court did at least observe that it appeared to be constitutional for Congress to grant money on the condition that a state let the county that was the recipient of that money decide how to spend it for any governmental purpose. 
    In Oklahoma Civil Service Commission the Court did say we are entitled to decide about... say that Congress was entitled to require Hatch Act observance by state officials. 
    Those are, I think, Federal statutes that use the spending power in a way that is at least as intrusive upon core state governmental interests as the interest that the State of South Dakota has in permitting 19-year-olds from its own state and from neighboring states to drink beer.

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Thank you, Mr. Cohen. 
    Mr. Tellinghuisen, you have seven minutes remaining.
speaker="roger_a_tellinghuisen" startTime="3291.111" stopTime="3357.089">
    Mr. Roger A. Tellinghuisen 
    I would like to take up where Mr. Cohen has just left off, and that is the Federal interest that has been in essence the cornerstone of this regulation or this condition that the Congress has imposed under Section 158. 
    The problem with standing up and suggesting that this is an inherently Federal interest ignores the very basic realities that each and every state is just as concerned about its kids as the Federal Government, but we in South Dakota have chose a different way of addressing and preserving and attempting to reduce the incident of teenage alcohol and driving-related fatalities, and that is through the enforcement of stricter drinking and driving laws, additionally through education. 
    There is a wide variety--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="3357.089" stopTime="3365.743">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    How can you say that allowing drinking up to the age of 21 is stricter than allowing it up to the age... I mean up to the age of 19 is stricter than allowing it up to 21?

    That is true.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="3373.249" stopTime="3376.701">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    It allows drinking by people under 21. 
    That is less strict than--
speaker="roger_a_tellinghuisen" startTime="3376.701" stopTime="3402.618">
    Mr. Roger A. Tellinghuisen 
    That is absolutely true. 
    Two things I would like to point out very quickly, and that is, in South Dakota, with our 19-year-old age at which people can consume 3.2 beer, these establishments, the 3.2 beer licensed establishments are separate and distinct from a regular alcohol establishment. 
    The other thing is, though, it underscores--

    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    --What do you make out of that?

speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="3414.009" stopTime="3420.846">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    It is still less strict to allow you to drink 3.2 beer at age 20 than to allow you to drink no alcohol at age 20.
speaker="roger_a_tellinghuisen" startTime="3420.846" stopTime="3453.401">
    Mr. Roger A. Tellinghuisen 
    --That's correct, and the point I was going to make is that that underscores, however, South Dakota's attempt, or a recognition of not only a problem but making a sincere attempt at addressing that problem in a way that is different from the other states. 
    We are suggesting that the gradual introduction of alcohol in a person's life is better than when they reach 21 just shoving them through the door. 
    And that is the philosophy that is underscored by the--

    Mr. Roger A. Tellinghuisen 
    Yes, but what I would like to point out, Your Honor, is that if we impose a 21 drinking age in South Dakota, we could equally find that we are driving 18, 19, and 20-year-olds out into the countryside to consume alcoholic beverages, not only restricted to 3.2 beer, and that in and of itself puts them behind the wheel of a car.

    Supposing as a condition of a grant to build interstate limited access highways they require you to set up so many gas stations at intervals where the people can stop without getting off the highway, and they further provide that no liquor may be sold in any of those.

    --Yes, sir. 
    I would. 
    I just would like to conclude by saying that the history behind the Twenty-First Amendment in some respects, as this Court has acknowledged in its prior holdings, is at best inconsistent, but there is one consistency that prevails throughout, and that is that it was Congress's intent upon adopting the resolution which ultimately became the Twenty-First Amendment to remove Congress from the local regulation of what was considered to be a local problem, and that is alcohol.
