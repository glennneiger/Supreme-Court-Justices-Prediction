    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    The Asahi case comes to us on writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of California. 
    It began as a product liability suit in California State Court by an injured person against the Taiwanese manufacturer of tires. 
    The defendant, tire manufacturer, filed a cross complaint against the petitioner Asahi Metal Industry, a Japanese supplier of tire valves. 
    Some of which were incorporated in the tires manufactured and sold California. 
    Asahi challenged the jurisdiction of the California States Court asserting its contacts with California were insufficient to provide the minimum context with forum state, which the Due Process Clause of the Federal Constitution requires. 
    The Supreme Court of California upheld the jurisdiction of the State Court over Asahi. 
    In an opinion filed today, we reverse that judgment. 
    All members of the Court agree that the exercise of jurisdiction over the petitioner in the circumstances of this case, fails to comport with fair play and substantial justice. 
    The court is divided however with regard to other aspects of the analysis. 
    Justice Brennan has filed an opinion concurring in part in which Justices White, Marshall and Blackmun have joined; Justice Stevens has filed an opinion concurring in part in which Justices White and Blackmun have joined.
