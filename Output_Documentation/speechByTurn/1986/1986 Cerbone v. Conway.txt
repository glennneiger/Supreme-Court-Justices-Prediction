    Mr. Michael F. Close 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    Good morning. 
    This is a dispute about a $400 check; actually, a $430 check. 
    Underlying it is a dispute about a car repair that was apparently not authorized, or at least allegedly not authorized. 
    It's been going on now for almost ten years. 
    It's been in seven or eight courts before it got to this Court. 
    Now, the plaintiff and respondent admits in the record that this case reached the Federal courts because it was not timely under State law. 
    They'd blown the State statute of limitations against the target defendant.

    Mr. Michael F. Close 
    Well, Justice Oakes' opinion below did take umbrage at I think some of my own actions in this case, and certainly my client's actions. 
    Yes, my client is also substantively appalled that we are still litigating a $400 check. 
    It's our contention, both literally and colloquially, that you can't make a Federal case out of it. 
    It just never belonged in Federal court. 
    It was something that should have been resolved in small claims court or the justice court.

    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    How can people of this type afford the litigation to come up here on it?
speaker="michael_f_close" startTime="171.465" stopTime="399.732">
    Mr. Michael F. Close 
    Well, the problem with that... the answer to that is not in the record. 
    The dispute begins in April of 1977 when the respondent's car blew up on an interstate highway. 
    "Blew up" is their phrase. 
    It was taken under tow to Bano Buick, which is the co-petitioner here. 
    And although the parties disagree on what, they do agree that the car needed a totally new engine. 
    Now, the Conways' version of the facts... and we have to accept that for purpose of today's argument... is that they would go out and look in the local junkyards for a replacement engine, and that Bano Buick was not supposed to do anything until the Conways had found the engine that they wanted put back into the 1973 Opel, which was the faulty car. 
    Now, Mr. Conway, Jeff Conway, went out and found engines, looked... scoured the area. 
    And apparently, when he found the engine that he said should be put into the car, he called up Bano Buick and said, hey, I've got the engine. 
    Well, Bano Buick then said, oh, glad you called. 
    We're just about to start your car. 
    And we'd like you to come down and pick it up. 
    Apparently, he says, what are you talking about? 
    I haven't authorized it. 
    Well, anyway, he and Mrs. Conway come down. 
    They get to the... they get to the car dealership, and they see in the car what they say... and we have to accept this as true also for purposes of today... they saw a junk engine that he had seen in another Croton Falls junkyard, and he had turned that engine down because he didn't think it was a good enough engine to put in the car. 
    So whatever argument they had, their version of the dispute is that... which they swear to... is that they were bullied and intimidated by Bano Buick. 
    Bano Buick was going to... if they wanted to put in a different engine, was going to charge them more money, and whatever. 
    Their phrase is that, in fear they wrote out the check for the amount and initiated their escape and left. 
    The next day the usual practice of Bano is to deposit their checks. 
    They deposited the disputed check, which is No. 154. 
    It's dated the 10th of May, 1977. 
    Bano deposits the check. 
    It comes back: Insufficient funds. 
    They say they hold the check a couple of days, and they call in to see if there's sufficient funds. 
    They redeposit the check. 
    This time it comes back: stop payment. 
    Now, at this point the parties disagree as to who exactly said what. 
    The Banos claim they made a reasonable offer to settle with the Conways, to say, we'll give you credit for the old engine, but we'll charge you for the work. 
    The Conways dispute that. 
    Whatever it was, they couldn't reach a settlement then of this dispute, as to whether the check would be honored, or what Banos would do on it. 
    And with negotiations at an apparent impasse, apparently the Banos went to my client, who is the village justice and also a local lawyer, and they brought the check to him. 
    And such advice which is third-hand in the record, as he said to us, look, the first... the bounced check is a criminal whatever, and the subsequent stop payment has got nothing to do with it, because it's after the check. 
    I would have thought that advice was correct under State law at the time that he gave it anyway.

    So she had the--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="467.785" stopTime="485.545">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Well, if you'd answer my question, apparently what the respondents tell us is that New York law would give a cause of action for malicious prosecution for the making of an arrest without a warrant and lacking in probable cause.
speaker="michael_f_close" startTime="485.545" stopTime="507.864">
    Mr. Michael F. Close 
    --No, she's wrong to the extent that she's suggesting that she can recover damages for the false arrest as part of her malicious prosecution claim. 
    We... we... I cite in my reply brief all the cases she cites. 
    There is dicta to that effect. 
    None of the cases she's relying on in fact deal with this problem of what happens if you can correct for malicious prosecution but not false arrest.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="507.864" stopTime="524.622">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Well, let's suppose that they're right, and that under New York law a false arrest claim is part of malicious prosecution. 
    Do the... are you suggesting that we then have to redefine what is malicious prosecution as a matter of Federal law, or what?
speaker="michael_f_close" startTime="524.622" stopTime="580.412">
    Mr. Michael F. Close 
    Well, if she were correct that it's not... that it's not... then that leads to the result that the court below was wrong in dismissing the claims of arrest and imprisonment as time barred. 
    The cases she cites for that proposition don't say that. 
    The reason is... it's dicta, and the reason is, in almost every case, you have a false arrest and a malicious prosecution together. 
    You always sue for both. 
    In the cases where you have to distinguish recovery from one theory than the other, we have cited in our reply briefs, the courts have uniformly held what you can recover for under New York law... and we don't concede New York law actually governs this... what you can recover for under New York law for false arrest is everything up to the arraignment. 
    And from the arraignment onwards is malicious prosecution. 
    Therefore, if New York law is controlling, New York law clearly is that she can only recover from the arraignment forward.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="580.412" stopTime="582.709">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Is New York law controlling?
speaker="michael_f_close" startTime="582.709" stopTime="617.384">
    Mr. Michael F. Close 
    No, or the court below did not hold that. 
    They relied on Federal law under Singleton. 
    And they... they... the court below held that these questions of accrual and so forth were governed by Federal law. 
    They looked at Singleton, although Singleton then incorporates a State law anyway. 
    And the court below held that Singleton was controlling and dismissed it. 
    We've always regarded the false arrest and imprisonment claims as out of the case because the court below dismissed them as time barred. 
    And we don't... they're not here because she didn't cross petition. 
    With those claims out of the case, it's much simpler to analyze. 
    The question is--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="617.384" stopTime="622.336">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Well, may I just interrupt? 
    How can you say they're out of the case when the Second Circuit said they were in the case?
speaker="michael_f_close" startTime="622.336" stopTime="625.288">
    Mr. Michael F. Close 
    --Well, but the Second Circuit said they were out of the case, also.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="625.288" stopTime="645.016">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Well, but only on the State law cause of action. 
    Under the 1983 cause, they... as I understand it... they say the complaint alleges seven hours of detention, great humiliation, ridicule and mental anguish and so forth. 
    And these allegations are quite sufficient to constitute a Constitutional deprivation of liberty action under 1983. 
    So they held for 1983 purposes they were part of the case.
speaker="michael_f_close" startTime="645.016" stopTime="651.670">
    Mr. Michael F. Close 
    No, because... for statute of limitations purposes, if you look at the statute of limitations ruling, which is at 822, I believe--

    On State law, she has a one-year statute. 
    If we're talking about State law, that's governed by Section 215.3 of the CPLR, and both malicious prosecution and false arrest are one-year statute and she's out.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="674.210" stopTime="676.629">

    Mr. Michael F. Close 
    Yes, Your Honor.

    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    --when the Second Circuit, as I read their opinion on page A4, says this is part of their... the basis for their determination that her liberty was affected by what happened.

    Mr. Michael F. Close 
    And I... that's dictum, because it... that's just dictum because it ignores what he just did at A22. 
    The only imaginable theory of recovery that is even possibly in the case is Section 1933... 83. 
    And under A22, they've dismissed, very plainly, Mrs. Conway's civil rights claims based on arrest or false imprisonment are barred by the statute.

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    But false arrest and malicious prosecution are not themselves Constitutional claims. 
    You could have a Constitutional claim, I would think, simply for wrongful deprivation of liberty, which is protected by the Fourteenth Amendment.

    Mr. Michael F. Close 
    Yes.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="739.091" stopTime="743.152">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    And these people were detained for a certain period of time, weren't they?
speaker="michael_f_close" startTime="743.152" stopTime="780.528">
    Mr. Michael F. Close 
    But the detention is... he just held that to the extent that this is a 1983 claim based on detention, and that's the argument in Singleton, that is time barred as a matter of 1983 law. 
    And that is exactly what the holding is at A22; that that part is... and he relies back on Singleton, which had, again, addressed this as a matter of 1983 law, what statute to apply it and when to apply it. 
    I can't explain A4 except to say that they forgot what they did at A22, and the point about the seven hours of detention is dictum. 
    What he's talking about is the great humiliation and ridicule and mental anguish.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="780.528" stopTime="787.775">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well, I mean, the Second Circuit obviously ruled in favor of the respondents on some point, because it's you who are here and not they.
speaker="michael_f_close" startTime="787.775" stopTime="788.337">
    Mr. Michael F. Close

speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="788.337" stopTime="793.803">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    What was the basis upon which you think the Second Circuit ruled in favor of the respondent?
speaker="michael_f_close" startTime="793.803" stopTime="804.458">
    Mr. Michael F. Close 
    Because she alleged malicious prosecution. 
    That was timely under 1983. 
    And malicious prosecution, as such, I read them saying, is actionable under Section 1983.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="804.458" stopTime="806.189">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Do you agree with that?

    Mr. Michael F. Close 
    No, I don't agree with that. 
    But I think that is the question that's here.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="808.907" stopTime="810.110">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    You think that was their reason?
speaker="michael_f_close" startTime="810.110" stopTime="835.258">
    Mr. Michael F. Close 
    And actually, there's a fair amount of circuit court authority which would support the idea that if you have malicious prosecution under common law, and you can satisfy 1983, that you therefore have a Section 1983 claim. 
    I read them as deciding that point in favor of the respondent. 
    I think that they are wrong, but that's what they... that's what they hold. 
    And they would hardly be the only circuit on that point.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="835.258" stopTime="842.427">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    But here, of course, you don't have merely what might be normal elements of malicious prosecution. 
    You have a substantial period of detention.
speaker="michael_f_close" startTime="842.427" stopTime="868.073">
    Mr. Michael F. Close 
    Well, before... she was... they took her to the village court. 
    Village court is only at night. 
    And it starts at 6:30, so that people can do their jobs during the day, and then they go at night. 
    The judge was on trial. 
    And she was... until she was arraigned, she was at court. 
    But that's all pre-arraignment. 
    And for the cases we cite in our reply brief if, if... you know, if New York law... assuming New York law governs on that point, it's all... that point is time barred.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="868.073" stopTime="923.552">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Mr. Close, part and parcel of the conduct that underlies the malicious prosecution claim in this case is that a phony criminal charge was filed, and that the individual charged was required to appear and sit around the court for a long time waiting to enter a plea, and was required to go back I don't know how many times... eight, nine, whatever it was... many times, in addition to the reputational injury. 
    So the sum total of what underlies the malicious prosecution here is a great many appearances that were alleged to be unlawfully imposed on this person, and improperly, because it was a false charge to begin with. 
    Do you think there's any deprivation of liberty involved in that kind of a process?
speaker="michael_f_close" startTime="923.552" stopTime="941.749">
    Mr. Michael F. Close 
    Well, assuming now we're talking about everything post-arraignment, the answer is no, that is not the... that's just another way of saying that I was a defendant in a frivolous suit, and I had to go to court eight or nine times, which is a 45 minute drive from where she lives.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="941.749" stopTime="962.945">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Well, this Court has held for example that being suspended from public school as a student for ten days or so is a deprivation of liberty. 
    And yet you say that being hauled in to the criminal court on a false charge and made to wait and appear and reappear is not; is that right?

    And what is that makes you so sure that the only evidence that would be admissible in support of that claim is what happened after some intermediate point in the prosecution. 
    I don't understand that.

    That's Miller v. City of New York. 
    And Miller v. City of New York answers that damage question.

    As such.

    That's true.

    Mr. Michael F. Close 
    Well, Singleton went a little beyond that. 
    Singleton also held you look to State rules of accrual as well.

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Yes, well I... it seems to me... you're confusing me, anyway, and it doesn't seem to me your helping your case by choosing to analyze this on the grounds on New York tort law.

    I'm not.

    Which is not what this suit is about at all. 
    It's about 1983.
speaker="michael_f_close" startTime="1350.943" stopTime="1380.713">
    Mr. Michael F. Close 
    I agree. 
    And Singleton... I mean, our response on statute of limitations is that Singleton v. City of New York is a Federal law case, and the Second Circuit held that this was barred as a matter of Federal law. 
    So it's not in the case. 
    And as to the malicious prosecution claim, we say it's not a species of liberty protected by the due process clause at all. 
    So that's timely under 1983, or the court below held it was timely. 
    That claim is just not a claim of Constitutional dimension. 
    And even if--

    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, what if there had never been... what if there had never been an allegation in this case of a false arrest?

    Mr. Michael F. Close 
    Well, Justice White, when you use the word "evidence" as opposed to "damages", evidence may come in because it may be relevant to something. 
    She has to prove conspiracy. 
    The arrest might be proof of the conspiracy. 
    It's not part of... she's not recovering damages--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="1422.666" stopTime="1455.764">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Suppose the allegation is that some person convinced a policeman or a judge to get out a warrant for somebody; we just want to get this person. 
    Let's get him arrested and put him in jail, and these may be trumped up charges, but meanwhile... but we'll get back at them. 
    Let's just suppose it's something as nasty as that, a malicious prosecution case. 
    Couldn't a malicious prosecution case include a plan to keep somebody in jail?
speaker="michael_f_close" startTime="1455.764" stopTime="1466.042">
    Mr. Michael F. Close 
    --Could it? 
    I mean, yes, in some sense, if she were kept in jail. 
    It doesn't answer the statute of limitations problem.

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    What do you mean by malicious... again, you're answering a question as to what a malicious prosecution case would consist of. 
    What malicious prosecution case?

    Under New Jersey law?

    Mr. Michael F. Close 
    But the court below held the two claims are virtually identical. 
    And in fact we quote that language in a subsequent case, where they say that the elements of the tort are identical. 
    We say, that's wrong, because you have to show a Federal right. 
    And we don't see any Federal, Constitutional claim at stake here. 
    And the mere claim that you were subjected to a baseless suit, which is the gravamen of malicious prosecution, is not Constitution. 
    And if--

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Your position is that some of the elements which may go to making a malicious prosecution claim under New York law may constitute a violation of 1983; and others may not.

    Mr. Michael F. Close 
    --If she had said, lock, they prosecuted me because of my race, she would have a 1983 claim, not because there's a generalized guarantee against frivolous lawsuits, but because there is a guarantee against different treatment because of your race. 
    If she said, they prosecuted me maliciously because I was a Democrat or a Republican, or whatever, then there'd be a First Amendment claim. 
    If she said, you know, they prosecuted me because I'm protesting the war, or anything like that, there could be... I made that concession below, and the court thought it was dispositive. 
    I'm not asking you to hold that malicious prosecution could never be actionable as a matter of 1983; I am asking you to hold that the bare bones allegation that the suit is frivolous, okay, meritless, is not as such a species of liberty under the Fourteenth Amendment, because the Constitution does not extent to you a guarantee against frivolous suits as such. 
    And that's all I see in this case for this plaintiff. 
    Alternatively, relying on Hudson and Parratt, we say you have an adequate State law remedy anyway, and her only problem is that it's time barred. 
    And because you have an adequate remedy at State law, even if it is a due process violation, relying on say, Ponner v. Coughlin, Hudson, and Parratt, that... so what?

   Argument of George Russel Miller
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1631.370" stopTime="1634.775">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Thank you, Mr. Close. 
    We'll hear now from you, Mr. Miller.
speaker="george_russel_miller" startTime="1634.775" stopTime="1705.997">
    Mr. George Russel Miller 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    This is a classic 1983 case. 
    This is not a case about a $400 check. 
    This is a case about Lynn Conway's right not to be abused, and to be persecuted by the State criminal justice system. 
    Here the petitioners intentionally misused the State's coercive powers to destroy Lynn Conway's Constitutional rights. 
    They conspired to use that system for their own self-serving ends in their attempt to extort money from her to pay for work that had been shoddily done, and as to which she probably did not owe a penny. 
    In this conspiracy they ran roughshod over her Constitutional rights. 
    They had her arrested, knowing that she had committed no crime. 
    They hauled her into Justice Cerbone's courtroom, where he dispensed his own brand of home town justice, to the benefit of his family and his clients. 
    She was stripped of her Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="1705.997" stopTime="1724.084">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Let's assume that the only thing I think that your client suffered which I would accent as a deprivation of life, liberty or property, without due process, was the detention in the jail facility.
speaker="george_russel_miller" startTime="1724.084" stopTime="1724.725">
    Mr. George Russel Miller 
    Yes, Your Honor.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="1724.725" stopTime="1728.458">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Why isn't that time barred?
speaker="george_russel_miller" startTime="1728.458" stopTime="1734.989">
    Mr. George Russel Miller 
    Your Honor, we have two separate causes of action under New York law. 
    And really we're talking--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="1734.989" stopTime="1736.443">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    I don't care about New York law. 
    I'm talking about 1983.
speaker="george_russel_miller" startTime="1736.443" stopTime="1747.095">
    Mr. George Russel Miller 
    --We're talking 1983, but we're using... as 1983 has done in the past, picking up the tort law as a model on which to model itself. 
    The--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="1747.095" stopTime="1760.981">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    But there's quite a difference. 
    New York tort law does not require, for recover, a deprivation of life, liberty or property, as the Federal Constitution does. 
    So you can't take every element of whatever tort chooses to define to be an element of a 1983 action.
speaker="george_russel_miller" startTime="1760.981" stopTime="1782.378">
    Mr. George Russel Miller 
    --No, you cannot, you're correct on that, Your Honor. 
    And the malicious prosecution tort, and the notion behind a malicious prosecution, focuses on the bringing of an unfounded claim for a malicious purpose. 
    It does not focus on the arrest itself, although it would sweep up the arrest.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="1782.378" stopTime="1806.745">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    But I'm not talking about a malicious prosecution tort. 
    I'm talking under 1983 about the deprivation of life, liberty or property without due process of law. 
    I'm not talking about a malicious prosecution tort. 
    Now, just make believe that that's the way I'm going to approach this case. 
    So I want to look and find some deprivation of liberty. 
    And the clear one that I find is keeping your client in custody before the arraignment.
speaker="george_russel_miller" startTime="1806.745" stopTime="1809.182">
    Mr. George Russel Miller 
    Yes, Your Honor. 
    This is part--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="1809.182" stopTime="1813.179">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    All right. 
    But that occurred a long time ago. 
    Now why isn't that time barred--
speaker="george_russel_miller" startTime="1813.179" stopTime="1828.642">
    Mr. George Russel Miller 
    --That would not be time barred, because this was a continuing conspiracy, Your Honor. 
    You can look at the conduct that was initiated when they decided to commence the prosecution to have her arrested, up until the moment that the charges were finally dismissed.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="1828.642" stopTime="1843.622">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    --1983 does not give a cause of action for a conspiracy. 
    Read the text of 1983. 
    It does not give a cause of action for a conspiracy. 
    It gives a cause of action for the deprivation of the life, liberty or property. 
    1985 gives a cause of action for conspiracy.
speaker="george_russel_miller" startTime="1843.622" stopTime="1851.057">
    Mr. George Russel Miller 
    However, this court has recognized in, say, Adickes v. Kress, the notion of a conspiratorial element as stating a cause of action.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="1851.057" stopTime="1880.344">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    You can use the existence of a conspiracy to attribute State action to private actors; for that purpose, we've used conspiracy. 
    But have we ever used a conspiracy under 1983... has there ever been a cause of action given for conspiring under 1983? 
    1983 doesn't speak of conspiring as a cause of action. 
    You know, there are Federal crimes of conspiracy. 
    It's a separate crime in itself. 
    But it's not an offense in itself under 1983, is it?
speaker="george_russel_miller" startTime="1880.344" stopTime="1909.490">
    Mr. George Russel Miller 
    I had not seen this Court hold specifically that it is. 
    I would not say that it would be barred. 
    I would say that the issue has not come before this Court. 
    This Court has not held that it is not... that a conspiracy is not a violation of 1983. 
    Indeed, when you look at the 
    "subjects or causes to be subjected. " 
    language of the statute itself, that would seem to imply that conspiratorial conduct would be incorporated in that. 
    However, I can think of no specific holding.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="1909.490" stopTime="1913.627">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Is there a State tort of conspiracy, do you know, as a separate tort?
speaker="george_russel_miller" startTime="1913.627" stopTime="1972.308">
    Mr. George Russel Miller 
    I believe there is, Your Honor, but I'm not altogether certain. 
    Also, there are other substantive rights that were violated here, Your Honor. 
    There was the Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial. 
    Two years and 82 days elapsed from the date of her arraignment... or... until the date when the charges were finally dismissed. 
    Now, that... part of that time is attributable to her own conduct in bringing the appeal. 
    However, that is not... that still does not change the fact that there were 180 days that had elapsed; and that 180 days is three times the period that is allowed by 3030 of the New York Criminal Procedure law. 
    Now, while that is not binding on this Court for the notion of speedy trial, it does suggest... give some sort of guideline as to what would be the speedy trial idea under New York law.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1972.308" stopTime="1984.866">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well, Mr. Miller, do you think that where a person is not convicted, that speedy trial analysis really adds much to the basic concept of deprivation of liberty?
speaker="george_russel_miller" startTime="1984.866" stopTime="2007.062">
    Mr. George Russel Miller 
    I believe it does, Your Honor. 
    Because the person who is sitting there with charges pending against them does go through great mental anguish. 
    They do not know what is happening. 
    If they are confronted with a court such as Justice Cerbone's court, where they may... they have no idea what is going to happen. 
    They know that the judge is biased against them. 
    That becomes an awfully long time, Your Honor.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2007.062" stopTime="2017.558">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well, but surely you could recover for however long or however short it is if you can show simply a deprivation of liberty without due process of law.
speaker="george_russel_miller" startTime="2017.558" stopTime="2028.539">
    Mr. George Russel Miller 
    That is correct, Your Honor. 
    There is... there was the deprivation of liberty. 
    Technically, she was under arrest during this entire period. 
    While she had been released on her own recognizance, she was within... under the custody of the State.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2028.539" stopTime="2040.689">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Your opponent relies heavily on the Hudson v. Palmer and Parratt v. Taylor for the proposition that New York law provided adequate remedies for this detention.

    Mr. George Russel Miller 
    Yes, Your Honor, they do rely on that.

I would direct your attention to Your Honors' opinion in Parratt at page 535, where you wrote that in any 1983 action, initial inquiry must focus on whether the two essential elements of a 1983 cause of action are present, one, whether the conduct complained of was committed by a person acting under color of state law; clearly we have that here. 
    And two, whether this conduct deprived a person of rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitutional laws of the United States. 
    And here we have the substantive due process right of the unbiased form, plus we have the specific Constitutional guarantees against the illegal search and seizure, and against the right to a speedy trial.

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    But Parratt went on to say, I think... and I think Hudson v. Palmer reiterated it... that in some situations you had to look at the State remedy that was provided for the petitioner's claim to decide whether there had been any deprivation.
speaker="george_russel_miller" startTime="2107.646" stopTime="2148.756">
    Mr. George Russel Miller 
    Yes, you did, Your Honor. 
    But you were also, in those two cases, dealing with specific property interests. 
    These were State-created rights; not Federally-created rights. 
    And as Justice Stevens in his concurring opinion in Daniels set forth the procedural due process claim, it is not the deprivation of property that is actionable; it is the fact that the property is deprived without due process of law. 
    Without adequate redress, it becomes actionable under 1983. 
    So that in the Hudson and Parratt, you were dealing with property... State-created property interests. 
    And the State did provide redress, albeit it was post-deprivation rather than pre-deprivation.

    Mr. George Russel Miller 
    Other than the speedy trial and the unbiased forum and the false... the bad arrest.

    In addressing the reply brief that the petitioners have served, they make much of the fact that Lynn Conway had violated Section 190.05 of the New York Penal law. 
    In fact, at the time she wrote the check, she had sufficient money in the bank, in her account, to cover that check. 
    At page 28 of the Joint Appendix, you will see her bank statement, which shows that on the 10th and 11th of May, she had $441.37 in her account, or $10 more than this check was for. 
    If Bano Buick had gone down to the bank the following morning after she had picked up her car and cashed the check, they would have been paid in full. 
    The petitioners make much--

    Mr. George Russel Miller 
    --Your Honor, we are locking here at a 1983 claim. 
    Now, the Second Circuit had adopted, under the adoption rule of Section 1988, had picked up the New York law of malicious prosecution as being... that the same elements that would state a claim for malicious prosecution would state a claim for 1983 violation. 
    I think that, in short, what it is doing is what this Court has done, is to model a 1983 claim on existing State law. 
    But this Court obviously is not bound by the State law. 
    The question that I was raising was whether, under the malicious prosecution notion, there was probable cause, or whether there had in fact been a criminal violation. 
    And in fact, she had not violated Section 190.05 of the New York law. 
    The petitioners make much of the adjournments and delays in this case. 
    However, it appears that Justice Cerbone's clients, the Martabanos, who were conducting this private prosecution, did not show up on four of the occasions. 
    It's very hard to object to that in those situations. 
    And it does not change the fact that there 180 days that elapsed from the date... she entered her plea on August 4th, 1977, to the time her attorney brought a motion to dismiss for failure to prosecute within a speedy time. 
    That was on February 1st, 1978.

    Mr. George Russel Miller 
    I think under the Court... as I see it being framed under 1983, I think they all go into the same hopper, Your Honor. 
    I think there is, perhaps, harder damage, when you have the arrest. 
    And it's very hard to quantify the damage for injury to reputation.

    It was an intentional act. 
    If, let's say, in Paul, Davis had been... they had known that Davis was a communist sympathizer or whatever, and in order to get back at him, they'd included him... his mug shot in the list of active shoplifters, I think that would have been a very different case, Your Honor.

    Parratt and Hudson, Your Honor, limit themselves by their own terms to procedural due process claims. 
    And that is where the right that is being vindicated is a State-created right. 
    The inquiry then becomes whether the right is a... whether there's a deprivation of that State created property interest without due process of law. 
    It's only when you have the absence of due process of law that the Federal interest becomes implicated.

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Oh, no, that's--
speaker="george_russel_miller" startTime="2821.917" stopTime="3137.450">
    Mr. George Russel Miller 
    The speedy trial would not have matured until such time as the cause of action... the criminal complaint was dismissed. 
    Because there would be no indication as to how long it had been before the case would have been dismissed until that... September 20th, 1979. 
    The interference with the malicious prosecution cause of action, that occurred on September 20th, 1979, at the end of the period. 
    It was the arrest that occurred at the beginning. 
    The petitioners make the argument that the substantive due process is not properly before this Court, and it was never considered by the Second Circuit. 
    It fact, it had been considered. 
    The Second Circuit did not feel that it had to rely upon that. 
    Now, I suspect there may have been some... that Judge Oakes' treatment of the case was that he felt that seven hours of detention was sufficiently enough to remand the case for trial that he need not go exploring for other Constitutional rights. 
    But as long as there is one Constitutional right, we submit that this case has to go to trial in the District Court. 
    The petitioners have tried to make an argument that there is a cutoff point at the moment of arraignment under New York law between the false arrest claim, which ceases from the moment of arraignment. 
    From this they seek to infer that there is the beginning of a malicious prosecution cause of action that starts at the moment of arraignment. 
    That is squarely belied under New York law. 
    Sheldon v. Carpenter, for example... and I quote from 4 New York 580... states that in an action for malicious prosecution, the plaintiff is entitled to recover damages, not only for his unlawful arrest and imprisonment and for the expense of his defense, but for the injury to his name and character by reason of the false accusation. 
    Now, this is at least a clear indication of New York's intent on the malicious prosecution cause of action. 
    We submit that this Court is clearly not bound by New York State law in formulating the causes of action under 1983. 
    But 1983 should form a model. 
    It should indicate the conduct that is wrongful, for example, the conduct of conspiring, as it were, to do a number on Lynn Conway, to get money from her, to make her pay on a check for work that was not done. 
    Here, Lynn Conway suffered from the petitioner's abuses of the criminal justice system. 
    They conspired to violate her Federal rights in a scheme to extort money. 
    They had her arrested. 
    She was handcuffed, forced into the police car, hauled to the village court of Mt. 
    Kisco some 45 minutes away. 
    She was held under confinement for seven hours. 
    She was arraigned at 1:30 in the morning, and released on her own recognizance. 
    Then she was hauled before Justice Cerbone's courtroom, where, under the Mt. 
    Kisco quaint custom, the Martabanos, who were the complaining witnesses, also handled the private criminal prosecution. 
    Nor surprisingly, the Martabanos, who were Justice Cerbone's cousins and clients, managed to prevail, under the Assistant District Attorney stepped in and said that they would not go forward with the case. 
    And that point, Justice Cerbone screamed out through the courtroom, you will continue to try this case... or prosecute this case. 
    You will try it, and you will get a conviction. 
    Lynn Conway was stripped of her right to a speedy trial. 
    Two years and 82 days elapsed from the date of her arrest, until the date that she was finally released. 
    Her cause of action for malicious prosecution had been stripped. 
    In short, the respondent submits that the petitioners, Alfred Martabano, Alfred v. Martabano, Bano Buick, and Vincent Cerbone, engaged in a classic violation of Section 1983. 
    They conspired to deprive Lynn Conway of rights, privileges, and immunities secured by the Constitution and laws of the United States.

   Rebuttal of Michael F. Close
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="3137.450" stopTime="3143.776">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Thank you, Mr. Miller. 
    Mr. Close, do you have anything further? 
    You have four minutes remaining.
speaker="michael_f_close" startTime="3143.776" stopTime="3225.652">
    Mr. Michael F. Close 
    Answering Mr. Justice Scalia's question, there is no tort of conspiracy recognized by New York law. 
    They contend that Mrs. Conway had sufficient funds, and that if the check... if he had rushed down to deposit the check, it would have cleared. 
    The record doesn't sustain that contention. 
    She had already drawn against the funds that the account shows as of 5/10/77. 
    So it would be true that the check would clear only if the check No. 154, which is at stake, was presented under the bank's rules, before 153, 152. 
    As soon as any of the earlier written checks had cleared, she would be insufficient. 
    That, under the New York statute, is insufficient funds when she wrote it, because the statute requires that you have sufficient funds that you haven't already drawn upon. 
    As far as the other theories of liability... Sixth Amendment and docket notation... they're just not properly here, because they would lead to a very different judgment than the judgment we are appealing. 
    The holding below is that whatever is common law, malicious prosecution, under New York law, is necessarily a 1983 case.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="3225.652" stopTime="3231.056">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Isn't it correct that the judgment you're appealing is an order that has the effect of denying a motion to dismiss?

    Mr. Michael F. Close 
    Yes.

    Yes.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="3235.180" stopTime="3239.366">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    So that's all that's at stake, is whether there's enough here to go to trial.
speaker="michael_f_close" startTime="3239.366" stopTime="3312.839">
    Mr. Michael F. Close 
    Yes, but the rationale of the decision below, in response to my argument that Paul v. Davis, Baker v. McCollan, and Gerstein v. Pugh, which said malicious prosecution is not a claim under 1983, the court below said, no, look, this is New York law. 
    It's valid under New York law. 
    His theory of Sixth Amendment would lead to a very different kind of judgment, and so would his docket notation theory. 
    So they're not arguments that would sustain the ruling below, and therefore, I don't think that they're properly presented. 
    And for the reasons we state in our brief, we don't think substantive due process has anything to do with the case. 
    We don't think that Mrs. Conway has anything in common with Mrs. Roe. 
    You know, she's just not within... she's not within the realm of privacy interests, which are protected by that doctrine. 
    And she is invoking the doctrine because she wants an additional Federal remedy to what's already adequate under State law. 
    She's not like Mrs. Roe who comes here because she has no remedy under State law at all. 
    So Mrs. Conway's complaint can't be considered under the substantive process doctrine. 
    Unless the Court has any other questions about the record, the petitioner will rest.
