    Mr. Joseph A. Connors, III 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, with this Federal criminal case petitioner requests that the Court acknowledge the demise of the concurrent sentencing doctrine that has been utilized by this Court since at least 1891 in the Clawson case. 
    In our argument we plan to discuss the relevant trial evidence, the sentencing hearing, and the opinion in the Court of Appeals, the question presented, look at the government's special assessment contention, and then look through the arguments we make why the doctrine should be abolished, in particular calling this Court's attention to the Ninth Circuit case of United States versus DeBright where that circuit has abolished it in a well-reasoned opinion.

    Mr. Joseph A. Connors, III 
    Certainly, Your Honor. 
    First, we need to look at the procedural background. 
    There's... defendant's indicted on three-count indictment, jury conviction. 
    The first count of the indictment deals with the conspiracy. 
    It says that the conspiracy lasted from May 25, 1985, until June 3 of 1985. 
    The defendant and Pablo Sandoval and others unknown to the grand jury unlawfully possessed with intent to distribute a quantity of cocaine, and it is unspecified how much. 
    Count 2 charges the substantive offense of possession of one gram on May 29. 
    Count 3, which is in contention here, alleged the second substantive offense of possession with intent to distribute of approximately six ounces of cocaine on the following day, May 30. 
    At the sentencing hearing on May... excuse me, on October 2, 1985, the District Court committed petitioner to the custody of the attorney general for seven years on Count 1, seven years on Count 2 and 3, and a special parole term of five years on Counts 2 and 3. 
    Those sentences are to run concurrent. 
    These sentences were pursuant to 18 USC 4205(b)(2), and that provision of our law allows parole at the time the Parole Commission may deem appropriate. 
    Both parties in their briefs have treated this as a 4205(a) sentence, which is a little different. 
    The prisoner has to serve a third of his time before he ever becomes eligible. 
    We don't have this in this case officially from the District Court, but the Parole Board at their option, they have treated this as a sentence requiring the man to at least serve a third. 
    The actual trial evidence, we don't contest that were was a conspiracy.

    Mr. Joseph A. Connors, III 
    There as a $50 special assessment, Your Honor, I am sorry, on each of the three counts, for a total of $150, and that is pursuant to what we are going to reach in a minute, 18 USC 3013, the new Special Assessment Act. 
    We don't contest the evidence on the conspiracy in the sense that the conspiracy existed on May 29 for sure. 
    The government wanted to get into detail that the conspiracy continued through May 30th and I am... petitioner is not sure that there is sufficient evidence for that, and that is what Count 3 gets... it becomes very important about Count 3. 
    Count 3 is the crime of six ounces on May 30th, and I don't think there was enough evidence to convict my client of that crime. 
    I took that issue to the Fifth Circuit. 
    They refused to review that issue, invoking the concurrent sentencing doctrine, and vacated the man's conviction on the third count. 
    That count has had some collateral consequences at the Parole Commission, and we are going to get to deal into that in just a minute, but back to the evidentiary facts. 
    There is a drug deal. 
    Informer is working with DEA Agent Herber. 
    Mr. Sandoval wants to sell cocaine to somebody. 
    He approaches the informer and says, do you know anybody I can sell cocaine to, and Molina sets him up with Ms. Herber, the agent. 
    He sells her the sample to show that he has got good quality stuff. 
    It tested out to be 92 percent. 
    That involves Count 2. 
    He did that delivery on May 29. 
    My client from the evidence is involved in that. 
    He is the supplier of that gram of cocaine.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="368.805" stopTime="391.484">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    --Mr. Connors, I would think that if we were to agree with you on your view of the concurrent sentence doctrine, that is, that the Fifth Circuit should have considered your claim on that count here, we would not decide it ourselves, but would probably send it back to the Fifth Circuit. 
    I think it is unlikely that we would get into the merits of whether the evidence supported the verdict on that.
speaker="joseph_a_connors_iii" startTime="391.484" stopTime="466.568">
    Mr. Joseph A. Connors, III 
    I recognize that, Your Honor, but it becomes important because one of the contentions made by the government is that there was sufficient evidence to find my client guilty of the six-ounce... or let me word it this way, that the six-ounce delivery is involved in the conspiracy of Count 1. 
    He has been convicted of the Count 1 conspiracy. 
    That has been affirmed. 
    And therefore the Parole Commission can use conspiracy in Count 1 against my client and leave him in this extra time, so the government in reaching the merits of the concurrent sentencing doctrine says Count 3 has no effect on my client. 
    When I get back to the Fifth Circuit I am going to lose on Count... no, when I get to the Parole Commission I am going to lose on the sufficiency issue because they are going to use it against my client anyway, so that is why, if you follow me, that is why the sufficiency on Count 3 becomes important. 
    We counter that... let me follow up on that right now. 
    We counter that with the Parole Commission's own rules that say if a count conviction is... a man is acquitted on a conviction after trial, then the Parole Commission won't use that under normal circumstances, so if I can get a not guilty on Count 3 down in the Fifth Circuit, the Parole Commission is not supposed to use that, it seems to me.

    Your Honor, there has been a bunch of debate and at least three appellate decisions so far.

    --Right. 
    From our viewpoint, the Solicitor General wanted to narrow this case down to the special assessment law, and we would prefer that we talk about the concurrent sentencing doctrine and that it was unconstitutionally applied to this client. 
    If the Court recalls the opinion by Justice White in Benton versus Maryland, he mentions that there may come a case where a defendant is denied equal protection because most defendants can appeal their cases and see if there is sufficient evidence or whatever, and when an appellate court refuses to address that under the the doctrine, defendant may be denied equal protection if he is hurt, and our man... my client is definitely hurt because the Parole Commission is using this against him.

    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    Well, you are saying there is a violation of equal protection if your client can't appeal and somebody else can appeal and get review. 
    What is irrational about... for equal protection purposes about distinguishing between concurrent sentences and nonconcurrent sentences so far as deciding which sentences to review?
speaker="joseph_a_connors_iii" startTime="875.785" stopTime="898.031">
    Mr. Joseph A. Connors, III 
    Let me try to answer it this way. 
    In the sense that our client... the reason for seeking review is sufficiency of the evidence, that beyond a reasonable doubt he is not guilty of this case, and that seems to go to the heart of our system, and I thought you could get review on that, and if an appellate court finds the man not guilty, Burks versus United States, 1978, talks how he can't be retried.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="898.031" stopTime="931.002">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    Well, to make out a violation of the equal protection clause you have to show not just that your client is in a class treated differently from another class but that the distinction between the two is irrational. 
    Now, as I understand the distinction here is the concurrent sentence doctrine says if it doesn't make any difference to the punishment you are going to get an appellate court doesn't have to review a particular count, and that doesn't seem irrational to me. 
    It may be a violation of the statute, and it seems to me you have got a much stronger argument on violation of the statute than you do on the Constitution.
speaker="joseph_a_connors_iii" startTime="931.002" stopTime="958.972">
    Mr. Joseph A. Connors, III 
    To address your question, that gets us to the Parole Commission's guidelines of what they have already said they are going to do in this client's case. 
    The guidelines, if Count 3 was struck on a sufficiency ground, petitioner feels that the guidelines would be maximum of 16 months, but instead the Parole Commission has told us it is going to be a maximum of 60 months. 
    That is a whole lot of extra months between there, and it seems to me to be irrational when you are attacking the sufficiency of the evidence. 
    They are using that against us.

    I think it is at 710 Fed 2nd. 
    That was a panel. 
    And we will just vacate it. 
    Then it went en banc and the entire court with no dissents held that that is an improper way to handle these things, the mere vacation, that is an improper way to handle it, and then they proceeded to address, I believe, six or seven reasons why they needed to abolish the doctrine under their supervisory power because it was just improper to invoke it at all.

    Mr. William C. Bryson 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, our position in this case is that first, the sentences that were imposed were not concurrent, and therefore the question of the validity of the concurrent sentence doctrine is not properly before the Court in this case, but second, if the Court feels that the concurrent sentence doctrine, the validity of the concurrent sentence doctrine should be addressed in this case, we submit that the doctrine should be upheld in its traditional form, which is to say that when concurrent sentences are present, that an appellate court can in an appropriate case affirm the concurrent sentence count without having to review the merits of that count or any challenge under that count.

    Mr. William C. Bryson 
    Well, no, Your Honor, we are not asking that... in other words, if we had wanted to get the extra $50, let's say, that it appears that one could... one could argue that the Court of Appeals overlooked the fact that there was $150 as opposed to $50. 
    If we had wanted the extra $100, we presumably would have had to cross-petition, but we think that the Court of Appeals erred in the way that it approached the special assessments, its interpretation of the sentence.

    --from asking for the judgment that would be as favorable as we would be entitled to, but nonetheless we agree, which is all that we can do by virtue of not having cross-petitioned, we agree that at least so much of that judgment as would require the Court of Appeals' current disposition to be reversed, we agree that it should be reversed to that extent. 
    In other words, we are not asking for the extra $50. 
    We are simply asking that petitioners' position be upheld, albeit for a different reason.

    Mr. William C. Bryson 
    There are only two settings, I think, in which one could arise in the Federal system, assuming that Congress doesn't repeal the statute any time soon. 
    One is if the District Court simply omits to impose the assessment or omits to impose it consecutively. 
    We think it is quite clear that the statute requires that they be consecutive.

    There is a case out of the Tenth Circuit which we cite in our brief, the Mayberry case, in which the Tenth Circuit held, erroneously, we think, but nonetheless held that the special assessments do not apply to sentences imposed under the Assimilative Crimes Act because the Assimilative Crimes Act, of course, picks up the state sentences. 
    We think that the special assessment was intended to apply to all Federal crimes, including Assimilative Crimes Act--

    Mr. William C. Bryson 
    As the statute... it was devised in order to try to create a fund for witness compensation. 
    It is mandatory on every count. 
    It applies to both felonies and misdemeanors. 
    It is a little hard to believe that $50 a throw could even pay for the clerical expenses that would be involved in collecting the money, but that is what Congress decided, and they made it mandatory for the purpose of not going into the Treasury of the United States as a fine would, but rather to create a fund for witness protection. 
    Now, in our view that means that it has to be imposed in every case. 
    The view we would take if the Court determines to reach the question of the concurrent sentence doctrine is that, as I say, the traditional rule should be preserved and that is that if the concurrent count, the sentence on which a concurrent sentence has been imposed, foreseeably will have no significant adverse consequences, then the proper disposition is for the Court, if it believes that the situation is appropriate for the exercise of its discretion to do so, to affirm that count. 
    There are two other options, one of which, of course, is to, as in the Ninth Circuit, to review every count regardless of the absence of any adverse collateral consequences, and the other is the disposition that was used in this case and that is used in the District of Columbia Circuit, and that is to vacate any count on which a concurrent sentence was imposed.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1656.093" stopTime="1659.311">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    The latter seems to me the most extraordinary of all--
speaker="william_c_bryson" startTime="1659.311" stopTime="1673.638">
    Mr. William C. Bryson 
    Well, it is extraordinary. 
    It was certainly inventive. 
    It solves... it isn't as odd, I think, as it may sound at first blush. 
    It would be--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1673.638" stopTime="1685.363">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    --I think it is odd because a court is undertaking to vacate a sentence without any finding that there is anything wrong with it, and not on the request of the government.
speaker="william_c_bryson" startTime="1685.363" stopTime="1729.392">
    Mr. William C. Bryson 
    --That is our principal objection to it, of course, in that courts should be very slow to be vacating presumptively valid convictions on grounds of convenience, but on the other hand what the Court in the Hooper case, which is the D.C. Circuit case that began this... invented this device really, what the Court said was that this count will essentially be put in the deep freeze, and we will hold onto it, and if it turns out later that the government needs the count for some purpose, then we may go back and review it. 
    So it isn't as if it is being vacated forever. 
    It is not as if it is being thrown away. 
    It is simply being put in some kind of suspended animation. 
    Now, we think that is a very messy kind of status which has no--

    --Well, it just depends on what the Court of Appeals calls it. 
    If the D.C. Circuit, for example, says that this conviction is hereby vacated, what it presumably means is that that conviction cannot be used for any purpose until we declare it can, so that they are simply saying the judgment of conviction is vacated and presumably also any collateral consequences that may flow from the fact or the verdict of conviction or the judgment of conviction are simply foreclosed by virtue of our order. 
    It is in effect an injunction, as I understand the Hooper case, against any District Court from over making use of that conviction until the Court of Appeals says that it may.

    Mr. William C. Bryson 
    Well, it certainly has the effect of preventing any further review because the judgment has been vacated. 
    You can't review just the verdict of conviction, but the verdict of conviction, as long as it stands, may have collateral consequences even though those collateral consequences were not intended by the Court of Appeals that went through the Hooper procedure, so it is a messy kind of procedure that creates, I think, more problems than it solves. 
    It is much easier, I think, more straightforward, and more conventional to simply say if there is no reasonable likelihood of any adverse collateral consequences we should simply affirm.

    Mr. William C. Bryson 
    The only case in which I know that has happened is a case not out of the Fifth or Eleventh Circuits, but out of the D.C. Circuit, a case called Miller, which was decided... I think it is in 449 F 2nd, in which the government said after the Court of Appeals had applied the Hooper doctrine and vacated this concurrent count had said, wait, this was a separate offense, it was a serious offense, we think the public interest requires that you review this separate offense even though there was a concurrent sentence, and the Court of Appeals acquiesced and did review it and did affirm it. 
    So that is the only case in which I know that has happened. 
    Typically in these cases, and I think it underscores the fact that in these cases there are very few instances in which there are any collateral consequences--

    Mr. William C. Bryson 
    --No. 
    No, this has just, I think, because the statute is fairly new, and because these cases are just getting to the Courts of Appeals, I think this is one of the first times that this point has come up. 
    It obviously was not Congresses's intent to toss out the concurrent sentence doctrine with this statute, but it just may have been and in fact we think was.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2132.889" stopTime="2151.433">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    You speak of concurrent sentences, Mr. Bryson, and anticipating collateral consequences. 
    What about the consequences that Mr. Connors says he must anticipate for his client here, the Parole Commission guidelines? 
    Is that sufficient to avoid the application of the concurrent sentence doctrine?
speaker="william_c_bryson" startTime="2151.433" stopTime="2308.019">
    Mr. William C. Bryson 
    It would be if he were right in his analysis of his case. 
    Let's suppose that his case involved just two counts, the two substantive counts, and did not involve the conspiracy count. 
    If that were the case, his first count on which his conviction was affirmed involved one gram of cocaine. 
    The second count, which the Court of Appeals vacated, involved the six ounces, the substantive count. 
    That would have made a big difference in his parole disposition and under the Rubin case and other authorities that would have been enough to require that the Court of Appeals review that second count. 
    However, in this case the conspiracy count, as the Court of Appeals analyzed it itself, involved precisely the same conduct that was at issue in the substantive counts, and in fact Mr. Ray agreed specifically in an admission that was part of the record to obtain the cocaine that was on order, said that he had three ounces himself and would go find some more. 
    That is plenty of evidence to support the conspiracy count, conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute ten ounces of cocaine or at least six ounces of cocaine, and under the parole guidelines a conspiracy is rated the same as the substantive offense even if there is an acquittal on the substantive offense, so that he is in the same boat if he is convicted on the conspiracy as if he is convicted on the substantive offense. 
    He is... if it weren't for the conspiracy count he would be in a different position. 
    But our position is that he is stuck on that. 
    The one which point he made in his argument which is correct is that the Parole Board did not acknowledge that the Court of Appeals had thrown out, vacated, or whatever it had done, the one count, the Count 3, and the Parole Board went ahead and reviewed this case as if there had been a sustained conviction on the third count. 
    Now that, I think, was a mistake, but our position is, he would be in exactly the same position by virtue of the conspiracy count, so that mistake is immaterial to his position, and of course in any event our position is that they are not concurrent sentences in this case and therefore all of that becomes immaterial. 
    If there are no further questions, I have nothing to add. 
    Thank you. 
   
   
   
   Rebuttal of Joseph A. Connors, III
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2308.019" stopTime="2311.854">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Thank you, Mr. Bryson. 
    Mr. Connors, you have eleven minutes remaining.
speaker="joseph_a_connors_iii" startTime="2311.854" stopTime="2507.064">
    Mr. Joseph A. Connors, III 
    Thank you, Your Honor. 
    I just want to address two things. 
    Justice Stevens, you asked about other cases in the Fifth Circuit. 
    I have got a couple of them on my brief on Page 89 and 90. 
    Montemayor was a big drug case. 
    I think the man got about 50 years. 
    And Cardona was the first time the Fifth Circuit used the vacation of convictions. 
    In the Fifth Circuit's own opinion they cite another one or two cases. 
    ABI is the name of one defendant, but they have been doing it since at least 1981, and now the Eleventh Circuit has picked it up from its sister circuit. 
    The other thing I would like to address is the last point that counsel was making. 
    At the Parole Commission Mr. Ray will be responsible for the six-ounce delivery because that is part of the conspiracy, and therefore when it is all over the Parole Commission has done the right thing. 
    That is the contention of the government. 
    I think that is wrong, and let me call the Court's attention to... one CFR we didn't bring to you, but it is 28 CFR 2.20, which is the normal one on parole, and then under Chapter 13 there is one called Number 4, and it talks about the vicarious liability. 
    And it reminds one of the Pinkerton case that this Court decided in 1946 about vicarious liability, and I will get to that in a second. 
    But that particular CFR reads, 
    "The prisoner is held accountable for his own actions and actions done in concert with others. " 
    "However, the prisoner is not to be held accountable for activities committed by associates over which the prisoner has no control and could not have been reasonably expected to foresee. " 
    So the only evidence in the record that Mr. Ray is responsible... from which that inference or speculation could be drawn is set out on my brief at Page 20, and may I read that to you, because I don't think it is enough to get there even at the Parole Commission, and so Mr. Ray... that is where we differ with the government. 
    Mr. Ray will not be held accountable because he could not reasonably expect to foresee that Sandoval would find six ounces and make the delivery the following day, it being our contention Ray is not the supplier of those six ounces. 
    The quote from the record, and this is Mr. Molina talking... he is the informer. 
    He is on the stand, and he's telling the jury the following. 
    Sandoval advised Ray about this person that was willing to buy ten ounces of cocaine, and then quote, 
    "and that this person was requesting ten ounces, and they weren't sure if they could come up with the ten ounces but they had three ounces is what I heard John say. " 
    my client, 
    "and that they would have to go back and see if they could get the rest. " 
    And that is the extent of Mr. Ray's involvement. 
    I got three ounces, I'll see if I can get any more. 
    Now, we don't know whether we got any more. 
    We don't know if Sandoval got the rest... got all six ounces from a third supplier or he got half from Mr. Ray, half from somebody else, and yet the government... that little statement there is enough for the government to say my client is involved in a six-ounce conspiracy when the actual conspiracy pled in this case is... it doesn't say how many ounces. 
    It just says a quantity of cocaine. 
    And so they want that to cover both Counts 1 and 2.

    Mr. Joseph A. Connors, III 
    Yes, sir, six ounces were delivered, and based on the snitch's overheard conversation, petitioner said that he had three and that they would have to go back and see if they could get the rest. 
    So we feel once the Parole Commission has this before it at least it is a good issue of which side of us, the government or Mr. Ray, will be responsible for Sandoval's act of delivering it the following day, since there is no evidence that Ray actually handed over the six ounces. 
    So I would ask you to reach the doctrine that we brought to you. 
    Thank you.
