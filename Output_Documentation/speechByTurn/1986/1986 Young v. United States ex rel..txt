    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    We will hear argument now in No. 85-1329, Young versus United States, consolidated with 85-6207, Klayminc against the United States, et cetera. 
    Mr. Cohen, you may proceed whenever you're ready.
speaker="james_a_cohen" startTime="17.926" stopTime="114.320">
    Mr. James A. Cohen 
    Thank you, Your Honor. 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    The issue in this case is whether a person charged with a serious criminal contempt has a right to be investigated and prosecuted by a disinterested prosecutor; more specifically, a prosecutor who is not concurrently representing the interests of the United States and the interests of a private party. 
    In 1978 Vuitton sued the claimants, who are among the petitioners here, for trademark infringement. 
    In July of 1970... excuse me, in July of 1982, that matter was settled with a promise on the part of the defendants in the action to pay $100,000, and the issuance of an injunction which was designed to protect Vuitton's trademark rights. 
    That injunction prohibited, among other things, the manufacture or sale, offering to sell, and aiding and abetting such an offer. 
    The issue... the injunction was issued in July of 1982. 
    And in December of 1982, Sol Klayminc sued Mr. Bainton, Joseph Bainton, who was the lawyer for Vuitton in the underlying trademark infringement injunction, for defamation. 
    The source of the alleged defamation was an article which was published in the Wall Street Journal in December of 1982, and at the same time that the suit began, or approximately the same time, payment on the $100,000 settlement was stopped.

    Mr. James A. Cohen 
    The defamation action was discontinued subsequent to the convictions in this case. 
    In February of 1983, the sting in this matter began. 
    The sting covered a wide number of topics, and by the end of March, Mr. Bainton felt, apparently, that he had sufficient information to apply to the court to be appointed as special prosecutor pursuant to Rule 42(b), as well as applied to the court for some extraordinary authority to conduct the sting.

    I mean--
speaker="james_a_cohen" startTime="161.434" stopTime="163.151">
    Mr. James A. Cohen 
    Well, I think the answer--

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    --You can have a freelance private stinger if he wants to go out and set it up.
speaker="james_a_cohen" startTime="167.638" stopTime="178.061">
    Mr. James A. Cohen 
    --Well, except that it was apparently Mr. Bainton's intention to supervise that. 
    And ethical prohibitions would prohibit him from taping meetings without the consent of all the parties.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="178.061" stopTime="186.517">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    All right, except for the... well, but all of this was done before any appointment by the court; is that right?
speaker="james_a_cohen" startTime="186.517" stopTime="187.451">
    Mr. James A. Cohen 
    All of which was done?

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    What you've just referred to, the beginning of the sting operation.
speaker="james_a_cohen" startTime="191.820" stopTime="195.022">
    Mr. James A. Cohen 
    Yes, the sting had begun, and there was no taping prior to the application--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="195.022" stopTime="195.389">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    That's right.
speaker="james_a_cohen" startTime="195.389" stopTime="196.641">
    Mr. James A. Cohen 
    --to be appointed as special prosecutor.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="196.641" stopTime="202.211">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    So all of that could have been done whether... whether or not he was later appointed by the court, right?
speaker="james_a_cohen" startTime="202.211" stopTime="203.028">
    Mr. James A. Cohen 
    Without taping, yes.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="203.028" stopTime="207.597">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Okay. 
    And he could have taken all that information and brought it to the court--
speaker="james_a_cohen" startTime="207.597" stopTime="208.082">
    Mr. James A. Cohen 
    Yes.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="208.082" stopTime="209.265">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    --or brought it to the U.S. Attorney?
speaker="james_a_cohen" startTime="209.265" stopTime="225.325">
    Mr. James A. Cohen 
    That's correct, he could have. 
    Absolutely. 
    However, no effort was made to take this matter to the United States Attorney when the information first came into the special prosecutor's, or Bainton's... Mr. Bainton's possession at that time. 
    The only time that any contact was--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="225.325" stopTime="230.026">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Mr. Cohen, help me out on one other... Mr. Cohen, the thing on the sting. 
    There was taping with a videotape, is that what it was?
speaker="james_a_cohen" startTime="230.026" stopTime="238.482">
    Mr. James A. Cohen 
    --There were videotapes and audio tapes. 
    None... as far as we know, I have no reason to believe that any taping occurred prior to the time that Mr. Bainton was appointed.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="238.482" stopTime="245.988">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Right. 
    But could those tapes... forget for a moment ethical obligation... did that taping violate any State law or Federal law?
speaker="james_a_cohen" startTime="245.988" stopTime="269.168">
    Mr. James A. Cohen 
    Not in New York, where most of them took place. 
    They would have violated California law. 
    And the only way that it was permitted in California was by virtue of Mr. Bainton's status as a special prosecutor. 
    Indeed, he contacted a member of the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office in effect to notify them and to receive, I suppose, advance... advance approval.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="269.168" stopTime="273.638">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Why does his status as a special prosecutor exempt him from California State law?
speaker="james_a_cohen" startTime="273.638" stopTime="290.850">
    Mr. James A. Cohen 
    Because... I don't... I don't know that it... I think that the answer is that the California authorities treated Mr. Bainton as an Assistant United States Attorney. 
    The State law of California prohibiting taping things would not apply to a Federal prosecutor.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="290.850" stopTime="294.785">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    I see. 
    Regardless of whether he had the court approval? 
    Just flatly--
speaker="james_a_cohen" startTime="294.785" stopTime="295.952">
    Mr. James A. Cohen 
    I think that's correct, yes.

    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    But apart from the California incident, you don't claim there's any violation of law? 
    Just a violation of ethical responsibilities for a lawyer to supervise this kind of an operation?

    Mr. James A. Cohen 
    No, it's surveillance-type taping. 
    In a hotel room, they were done. 
    And audio taping on telephones.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="320.966" stopTime="324.502">
    Justice John Paul Stevens

    Mr. James A. Cohen 
    That's among the ethical concerns, yes.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="326.370" stopTime="337.594">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    What other... because they often, I know in these trademark infringement situations, they often employ private investigators who take on a role of someone whom they really aren't, and tell a lot of falsehoods.
speaker="james_a_cohen" startTime="337.594" stopTime="338.777">
    Mr. James A. Cohen 
    Well, that happened in this case too.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="338.777" stopTime="346.015">
    Justice John Paul Stevens

speaker="james_a_cohen" startTime="346.015" stopTime="358.508">
    Mr. James A. Cohen 
    For a lawyer who's representing the two clients, yes. 
    For a lawyer who simultaneously represents, or purports to represent the... represent the interests of the United States and at the same time represents a private party; I think that's improper.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="358.508" stopTime="372.685">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Oh, that... I understand your conflict of interest argument. 
    But apart from that, you think that it's wrong for a lawyer in a trademark infringement, or one of these cases, to employ private investigators who use a cover story and a lot of falsehoods?

    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Right. 
    Really, my bottom line is, I'm just not quite clear on why the sting has much to do with your basic argument?
speaker="james_a_cohen" startTime="387.944" stopTime="399.835">
    Mr. James A. Cohen 
    --Well, I think that it has to do this with it. 
    In a sting, the government, in effect, participates in the crime itself. 
    And it's been--

    Mr. James A. Cohen 
    No, I understand that, Justice Rehnquist. 
    And I'm not suggesting that this Court should... should in anyway eliminate it from the repertoire of tools that law enforcement personnel use. 
    It is a much different thing, though, when it's used by a private attorney who's simply been given a label, who has no training and no accountability to anyone. 
    So I think that's the difference. 
    And I think that there are also intrinsic problems within it.

    Mr. James A. Cohen 
    --who had the conflicting obligations? 
    Because you can't tell how those conflicting interests influence the investigation and prosecution. 
    There's no way that we can sort through this record and say, well, at this point in time, Mr. Bainton was acting properly in the interests of the United States.

    Mr. James A. Cohen 
    I'm sorry, Justice Stevens. 
    I thought you were positing an example where someone goes out and pretends to be someone else. 
    That's not the taping. 
    There are ethical prohibitions against misrepresentation and deceit. 
    That would arguably cover that kind of conduct. 
    But commonly, these things are done not by the lawyers but by the investigative agencies.

    Mr. James A. Cohen 
    Well, you have a little more than that here, Your Honor. 
    You have Mr. Bainton and his associate, Mr. Devlin, playing a very active role at every point in the proceedings here. 
    This isn't simply, give us a monthly report and a monthly bill. 
    This is an active role in every single step of these proceedings.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="539.556" stopTime="548.345">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Is there some reason why misrepresentation and deceit by a lawyer is okay so long as he's a United States Attorney? 
    How does that--

    Mr. James A. Cohen 
    Well, yes, there is, I think.

    Mr. James A. Cohen 
    Well, there's not a distinction in the canons. 
    But when it's done by the government, we believe, at least, that the government is doing it for one reason and one reason only, in the interest of the public to ferret out crime. 
    When it's done by someone who has two interests, we can't be sure why it's being done. 
    We can't be sure, in effect, how it's being done. 
    The decisions of this Court and other courts which permit stings and other investigative techniques, which have at times been said to create problems or concerns about defendants' rights, and the integrity of the system, have all been involved with a public prosecutor, who was trained, who was accountable, to higher ups in the U.S. Attorney's Office and in the Justice Department.

    Well, you might. 
    Except that we are not concerned, I think, rightfully, that as a general matter public prosecutors will misuse their office in defense of some other client; because there is no other client. 
    In this case, when you have the attorney purporting to represent the interests of the United States, and at the same time, representing that second client who has a very serious interest in the United States' case, we just can't tell.

    Well, I have problems with that.
speaker="james_a_cohen" startTime="722.392" stopTime="1007.610">
    Mr. James A. Cohen 
    Well, I meant that I understand that's a fact. 
    I have some problems with it as well. 
    Speaking of the U.S. Attorney, Judge Brieant, who I think was initially sensitive to the possibility that some problems would exist, and also to the alleged magnitude of the case, as it was explained to him, directed Mr. Brieant... Mr. Brieant; Mr. Bainton, on April 6th to... which is about five days into the... into the taped portion of the sting, and about five days after he was appointed special prosecutor... to, quote, fully debrief the United States Attorney. 
    Well, he... he... I think, Your Honor, and I have to go back to the transcript to be sure, he directed Mr. Bainton to fully debrief the U.S. Attorney, and said that he wasn't requiring the United States Attorney to come in; that it was simply a suggestion. 
    In any event, I don't think it's important to quarrel over whether he was directed or whether it was suggested. 
    The full debriefing never occurred. 
    Mr. Bainton sent a short, two paragraph letter, which is in the appendix, to Mr. Pedowitz, who was at that point, was chief of the criminal division. 
    And apparently never receiving a reply, contacted him sometime later, and the reply was apparently "good luck". 
    The U.S. Attorney was never fully offered this case. 
    The matter was never referred to the United States Attorney by the District Court. 
    In short, the procedure suggested by the government, that is, the Solicitor General's Office, in their brief, were never complied with in this case. 
    The tapes and the conversations that occurred during the investigation covered a wide variety of topics. 
    They first discussed the defamation action. 
    And there was an apparent attempt on the tapes by Mr. Weinberg to elicit an admission from Sol Klayminc that in fact the defamation action was frivolous. 
    There was an attempt to discover the financial assets of Sol Klayminc. 
    It also discussed, in fact... discussed mostly plans to manufacture counterfeit bags in Haiti. 
    Also discussed in the tapes, or stated on the tapes, were suggestions by Weinberg in response to inquiries from one or more of the defendants in this case that in fact the proposed plan to manufacture bags in Haiti and distribute them elsewhere was not illegal. 
    And I just would wish to emphasize that those kinds of lulling statements occur, not in the context of a heroin conspiracy or a cocaine conspiracy, something that it is beyond any doubt at all is wrong, and you don't need to be told that it is not, this occurs in the context of an injunction which had very specific, proper business purposes, to protect Vuitton's trademark rights. 
    In that context, suggesting to someone, as Weinberg did time and time again, that the plan that they were discussing, and the scheme, if you will, that was afoot, would not violate the injunction is particularly offensive. 
    The interests that the special prosecutor labored under here were not only the duty to Vuitton. 
    In fact, there was another client, Fendi, who was also apparently a very expensive trademark, because Mr.... Mr. Bainton also represented Fendi. 
    And in fact, in discharging Mr. Rochman, who was originally a defendant in this case, from his civil obligations for Vuitton as attorney for Fendi, Mr. Bainton discharged Mr. Rochman as well. 
    And that's contained in a letter that is also in the appendix. 
    There's the $100,000 judgment against Sol Klayminc and the family companies, including Barry Klayminc. 
    That was... as I say, payment was stopped on that with about $81,000 left to pay. 
    There's a $750,000 judgment against petitioner Young. 
    Petitioner Young was involved in a case in California in 1981, in which he agreed to an injunction prohibiting him from manufacturing, selling, offering to sell, counterfeit Louis Vuitton bags. 
    As a part of that agreement, there was a liquidated damages provision of $750,000 that would only become due and owing if Young violated that injunction. 
    In addition to that, there's a personal interest the special prosecutor had, because he was a defendant in a defamation action which was begun before the sting.

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Mr. Cohen, let me read you, if I may, a sentence from the Second Circuit opinion, and ask you if that describes... Judge Lombard's opinion says: The fact that Sol Klayminc had brought suit against Bainton and the New York Courts alleging harassment and other acts is entitled to no weight as the suit was clearly frivolous. 
    It was never pressed, and was finally dismissed by consent. 
    Is that the suit you're referring to?
speaker="james_a_cohen" startTime="1031.741" stopTime="1077.854">
    Mr. James A. Cohen 
    That is the suit, Your Honor. 
    And the fact that it was frivolous... and I'm not qualified to say whether it was frivolous, and with all due respect to Judge Lombard, I don't think that he is either... there is... there is nothing... there is nothing that prevents or has been explored, Mr. Bainton from being concerned about that. 
    The suit was for two a quarter million dollars. 
    Somebody hired a lawyer to represent him. 
    The matter was discontinued after a claim of prosecutorial immunity. 
    Now, whether or not it was frivolous is really not the point. 
    What we're really talking about here is an appearance of a conflict of interest. 
    And I think it clearly existed when the prosecutor is a defendant in a suit such as that brought before any prosecution. 
    His law firm was also defendant in that action.

    There's the lodging that Mr. Bainton put in, a letter that he sent to the administrative office of the courts; and there are conversations that the Solicitor General office... Solicitor General's office has had with the general counsel of that unit. 
    And apparently, there is a fund from which to pay. 
    Now, the fund is not overwhelming in amount. 
    And it hasn't been tapped that frequently. 
    But it has been tapped in at least three occasions that we know of.

    --I think that's true, Justice Scalia. 
    But to the extent that the courts will always have to depend on another branch's muscle, if you will, they're always at that mercy. 
    The U.S. Attorney's manual, for example, and the Justice Department, by their very presence here, I think, demonstrates the proper respect due to courts. 
    And I think that those kinds of concerns, whereas I don't say that they're completely frivolous, I just think they're not very real. 
    The interesting part of this case is that if Mr. Bainton had been a real Assistant United States Attorney he would be subject to prosecution under 18 U.S.C. 208(a), which is the conflict of interest statute that Congress has passed in order to prevent just this sort of thing. 
    If I may, I'd like to reserve the rest of my time for rebuttal. 
   
   
   
   Argument of William C. Bryson
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1270.623" stopTime="1273.925">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Thank you, Mr. Cohen. 
    We'll hear now from you, Mr. Bryson.
speaker="william_c_bryson" startTime="1273.925" stopTime="1367.103">
    Mr. William C. Bryson 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    I am representing one of the two parties which is calling itself the government in this case. 
    For clarification, of course, Mr. Bainton is the special prosecutor. 
    I'll refer to him as the special prosecutor, and I'll refer to the positions that the Department of Justice is arguing before the Court as the government's position. 
    Now, the government's position in this case is a little different from the position taken by either of the other two parties. 
    Basically, it can be summarized in four propositions. 
    First, that ordinarily it is the United States Attorney who should prosecute serious contempts. 
    Second, that in some special cases... and we think that for practical reasons, this is going to be a very limited class... but in some special cases, it is appropriate for the court to appoint a private attorney to prosecute a criminal contempt. 
    Third, that that should be done, if at all, only after the United States Attorney has been given the case for consideration and has declined the prosecution. 
    And fourth... excuse me... that the attorney for the opposing party in a civil case should never be the party who is appointed to prosecute a criminal... a serious criminal contempt.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="1367.103" stopTime="1376.725">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Mr. Bryson, could I ask about number two? 
    Where does the court get authority to appoint a special prosecutor?
speaker="william_c_bryson" startTime="1376.725" stopTime="1403.109">
    Mr. William C. Bryson 
    Well, I think there are two answers to that, Your Honor. 
    First, Rule 42(b) does contain a reference... it's a very cryptic reference, to be sure. 
    But it is a reference to the notion that either the U.S. Attorney or an attorney appointed by the court can handle criminal contempts. 
    It does not specify what that attorney is to do, other than to take part in the notice-taking process.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="1403.109" stopTime="1403.375">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Well, let's--
speaker="william_c_bryson" startTime="1403.375" stopTime="1408.561">
    Mr. William C. Bryson 
    But in any event, contemplates the participation of a private attorney in some respect.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="1408.561" stopTime="1409.144">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    --But doesn't that--
speaker="william_c_bryson" startTime="1409.144" stopTime="1410.544">
    Mr. William C. Bryson 
    Our second answer... I'm sorry.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="1410.544" stopTime="1415.131">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    --Go ahead. 
    Doesn't that contravene the Constitution, which requires that--
speaker="william_c_bryson" startTime="1415.131" stopTime="1441.698">
    Mr. William C. Bryson 
    Well, I don't think so, because my second answer is that I think criminal contempt is a different animal in some important respects from the typical criminal offense. 
    And we believe that it is inherent, even if there were no Rule 42(b), it is inherent in the power of the courts to enforce their judgments that they are not wholly dependent on the executive branch to enforce those judgments. 
    They have--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="1441.698" stopTime="1444.150">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    --Isn't this person an officer? 
    An officer?

    Mr. William C. Bryson 
    --We don't believe he is an officer.

speaker="william_c_bryson" startTime="1472.217" stopTime="1500.534">
    Mr. William C. Bryson 
    Well, he does, Your Honor, I think do the same thing, because he is limited in several very important respects. 
    First of all, he doesn't have the breadth of responsibility for deciding who is to be prosecuted. 
    He has been given an assignment to pursue a particular case. 
    In this sense, he's more like an Assistant United States Attorney. 
    And second, he is only given one case. 
    He is not given the task of deciding throughout the world of potential criminal offenses, which ones to pursue.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="1500.534" stopTime="1520.614">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Well, I'm glad you haven't made the argument that your brief made. 
    I have real troubles if he is an officer, because you handled that... the government handled that quite readily in the brief by simply saying that the Constitution authorizes the appointment of officers by the courts.
speaker="william_c_bryson" startTime="1520.614" stopTime="1530.755">
    Mr. William C. Bryson 
    Well, that, I think, Your Honor, would only be so if we accept that Rule 42(b) is a legislative delegation to the courts of the authority to--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="1530.755" stopTime="1535.707">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Well, Rule 43(b) I don't think helps you, because Rules 43(b) was never passed by the Congress.
speaker="william_c_bryson" startTime="1535.707" stopTime="1536.823">
    Mr. William C. Bryson 
    --Well, that's right. 
    And that's one of the--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="1536.823" stopTime="1542.644">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    The Constitution requires that the Congress may by law vest appointment in the court.
speaker="william_c_bryson" startTime="1542.644" stopTime="1543.811">
    Mr. William C. Bryson 
    --That's correct, and that's one of the problems.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="1543.811" stopTime="1545.811">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    And Rules 43(b) has never been enacted by the Congress.

    That's correct.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="1546.244" stopTime="1547.929">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    So that argument's wrong?
speaker="william_c_bryson" startTime="1547.929" stopTime="1548.729">
    Mr. William C. Bryson 
    Pardon?
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="1548.729" stopTime="1550.231">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    So that argument's wrong?
speaker="william_c_bryson" startTime="1550.231" stopTime="1692.574">
    Mr. William C. Bryson 
    Well, I think, Your Honor, the... there is some force to the argument. 
    And I think... I recognize your point. 
    I think there is some force to the argument that the appointments clause does not get in the way of... show a constitutional disposition against... this kind of appointment. 
    Because if Congress had, for example, more specifically designated the special prosecutor as being someone who could be appointed, then we would be beyond appointments clause problem. 
    So... excuse me... it's not a constitutional problem. 
    At most, it's a question of the degree of the specificity of the authorizing statute. 
    But beyond that, I think it's important to point out some of the practical problems that this kind of conflict of interest creates. 
    We point out in the brief that the statutes and regulations which Congress has imposed on regular Department of Justice employees establish a Federal policy against just this kind of conflict of interest. 
    We think it's a general policy. 
    We think it's a policy that this Court ought to apply to this kind of conflicting representation where the United States and a private party are both being represented by the same attorney. 
    Section 208(a) was pointed out. 
    Section 528 of Title XXVIII states that conflicts of interest will not be permitted in cases in which the United States... an Assistant United States Attorney is carrying forward a prosecution. 
    And that statute directs the government to pass particular regulations dealing with conflicts of interest. 
    And among those regulations is one that would apply directly in this case, Section 735-4, stating that if an organization has a substantial interest in the outcome of a case, and that organization is one with which the attorney is allied in the personal... in some personal sense, that the attorney is disqualified from proceeding with the prosecution or investigation. 
    Now, the practical problems here are very real.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1692.574" stopTime="1695.543">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    xxx addressed to this situation, Mr. Bryson?
speaker="william_c_bryson" startTime="1695.543" stopTime="1698.978">
    Mr. William C. Bryson 
    Well, I think it would be addressed, Your Honor, to a situation where, for example--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1698.978" stopTime="1703.763">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    He's in the ABA, or the ABA has an interest in the outcome; that's what that sounds like.
speaker="william_c_bryson" startTime="1703.763" stopTime="1801.139">
    Mr. William C. Bryson 
    --Well, I think it would clearly apply, Your Honor, to a case where, for example, if I continued to represent a private party, and that private party had an interest in the outcome of a lawsuit in which I was the prosecutor, that would clearly be covered. 
    Now, there might be closer questions dealing with organizations such as the ABA, but clearly, in a case like this, that regulation would cover a prosecutor, and the prosecutor would be disqualified from proceeding with the investigation or prosecution. 
    Now, as a practical matter, there are special problems in this kind of case, one of which is, for example, mention was made of Mr. Young. 
    Mr. Young is one of the defendants who apparently had some assets, and he had a $750,000 judgment which was subject to execution if he were convicted. 
    Well, that is an enormous incentive to choose Mr. Young as one of the defendants to prosecute, as opposed to, for example, using Mr. Young as a witness against some of the other defendants. 
    Similarly, in current times, when there is a specific Federal statute prohibiting trademark infringement, the Section 402 of the contempt statutes comes into play, and that statute provides that a fine can either go to the... the victim or to the United States. 
    Obviously, the attorney for the victim is going to have an interest to see to it, to urge the court, to have the fine paid to the victim as opposed to the United States.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1801.139" stopTime="1825.504">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well, Mr. Bryson, what you say I don't doubt makes a good deal of sense in the abstract. 
    But if we adopt your position that people with a conflict of interest can't be appointed special prosecutors, that it first have to go to the United States Attorney, the court is left without any realistic way of enforcing an injunction or prosecuting a contemner, unless the U.S. Attorney approves.
speaker="william_c_bryson" startTime="1825.504" stopTime="1874.101">
    Mr. William C. Bryson 
    Well, Your Honor, I have a couple of answers. 
    First of all, I think almost invariably the United States Attorney will prosecute such cases. 
    That's the policy of the Justice Department as set out in the section of the U.S. Attorney's manual that we have... we have quoted in the brief. 
    Second, there is a fallback in the availability of administrative office funds. 
    And third... and I think this is not an insignificant factor... there are law firms that are willing to offer services on a pro bono basis, which happens on a regular... regular... from time to time, in cases in which, for example, a mandamus action is brought against a judge, and none of the parties is prepared to defend the judge. 
    The judge can be defended on a pro bono basis by a law firm that the judge selects. 
    So--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="1874.101" stopTime="1907.389">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Mr. Bryson, what's the oldest case you have that gives the courts authorities to cite for criminal contempt without a statute and on... with their own appointment of a prosecutor for violation of one of their orders, as opposed to for, you know, contempt that occurs in front of them, an insult to their dignity, an obstruction of their processes, but just disobeying one of their judgments? 
    What's the oldest case you have that allows the court some inherent power to punish for this?
speaker="william_c_bryson" startTime="1907.389" stopTime="1944.632">
    Mr. William C. Bryson 
    --Well, the McCann case would fall into that category. 
    Most of the cases... the problem is, most of these cases have involved very small contempts. 
    And the degree to which somebody is participating as a special prosecutor is on a very limited basis. 
    In McCann, it may not have gone much beyond simply the notice stage, which was authorized... was subsequently authorized by Rule 42(b). 
    But certainly McCann and some of the other cases of about that age that are cited in Mr. Bainton's brief would fall generally into that category. 
    And that's from the middle thirties. 
    Thank you.

    Mr. J. Joseph Bainton 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    The Chief Justice's last question indicates to me that the Court is focussing on the real issue presented by this case, and that is, how are the Federal courts going to enforce their orders? 
    This Court, in its decision, among others, in Gompers and Debs has long recognized... we agree, petitioners agree, and the Solicitor General agrees... that if the judiciary is to maintain its status as a coequal branch of government, it has to have the ability to enforce its orders.

    Older than the thirties?
speaker="j_joseph_bainton" startTime="2020.827" stopTime="2254.874">
    Mr. J. Joseph Bainton 
    1911 is the oldest I have, which is Gompers, Your Honor. 
    The first appointment is In re Debs, which was decided by this Court in 1895. 
    The Rule 42(b) was enacted in 1946. 
    Now, in Professor Orfields... who was the reporter to the advisory committee on the Federal Rules treatise... he indicated that the advisory committee and therefore presumptively this Court, in enacting Rule 42(b), meant to codify prior existing practice. 
    And the prior existing practice was described in the Second Circuit's decision in McCann v. New York Stock Exchange. 
    In that case, the Second Circuit held that it was not only allowable, but the preferred practice, in cases such as this one, for the Court to specially appoint the attorney for the civil litigant aggrieved by the disobedience of the Federal court order. 
    Now Rule 57 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure also comes into play to the extent that it says, in substance, any... that... excuse me, as it says in substance that all prior practice is not excluded. 
    To the extent that the Court does not find adequate authority to do what it did within Rule 42(b), which is what the District Court found in both opinions and the Second Circuit, we suggest that the power question can be resolved ultimately by reference to the All Writs Act. 
    So I don't think that there is a serious question as to whether the court has the power to do what it did in this and other cases. 
    Of course, it can't exercise this power in a way that deprives a defendant of his due process rights. 
    And that is the question that is really presented by this case. 
    What has... what this Court I think has to do is balance the interests of an independent judiciary against the risk that this process might somehow compromise the rights of a defendant. 
    In that balancing process, I think the most important factor for the Court to take into account is the very special role that the District Court judge plays in these cases. 
    As Mr. Bryson pointed out, the decision to prosecute, to continue the prosecution, is not reposed with the District... excuse me, with the civil litigant's lawyer. 
    The decision in this case, and Musidor and McCann and the others, confers no right on a civil litigant. 
    As a result of the Second Circuit's opinion, no civil litigant can go to a District Court judge and say, I have a trademark, I have an injunction, and I have what I think is evidence of probable cause of a violation of that injunction. 
    I want a criminal prosecution. 
    That decision rests completely within the discretion of the District Court judge. 
    And that's important. 
    And I think that answers most, if not all, of the arguments raised both by the petitioners and the Solicitor General. 
    There exists within our system of justice a series of systemic safeguards that we think adequately protect any possible compromise of the defendant's right to a fair trial; not a perfect trial, a fair trial. 
    As this Court held in Marshall v. Jerrico, there is not a constitutional right to a completely unbiased prosecutor. 
    In that case, the Court used the phrase, too remote and insubstantial. 
    And that's what I most respectfully suggest the complaint's about this practice are, too remote and insubstantial. 
    There has been no claim that anything that occurred in this case, or any other case to my knowledge, was improper, was different than the U.S. Attorney under different circumstances might have done.

    Mr. J. Joseph Bainton 
    --That's correct, Your Honor. 
    It is your job to decide what your judgment means. 
    And if you... and having done that, you have to enforce that. 
    Let me give you an example, if I may, going to the old law school example of Blackacre. 
    The Federal District Court Judge says, Mr. Bainton, you can have possession of Blackacre. 
    I go to Blackacre, and the person there is standing there with a shotgun and says, if you step across that border, I'm going to blow your brains out. 
    I go back to the District Court judge. 
    He sends me to the U.S. Attorney. 
    The U.S. Attorney says, you know, that's terrible. 
    The judge said you're entitled to have possession of Blackacre. 
    But I'm very busy. 
    We have a big cocaine trial in this district. 
    I don't have anybody to help you. 
    I go back to the District Court Judge and say, judge, I haven't got possession of Blackacre. 
    What are you going to do about it? 
    The judge says, well, can't help you. 
    The U.S. Attorney can't... the U.S. Attorney has to act as a check and balance. 
    And although my order is plain and clear and in no way ambiguous, it won't be enforced. 
    Your Honor, I think that the courts have to enforce their orders. 
    They have to have the ability to enforce their orders.

    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Mr. Bainton, with your very good example of Blackacre, wasn't the remedy one of ejectment, which was enforceable by an executive officer?

    Mr. J. Joseph Bainton 
    No, sir. 
    That's true in every case, and there's no practical conflict.

    In a civil case, it's--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="2599.404" stopTime="2614.163">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    No, but in that case, if you represented both the court's interest in enforcement and your client's interest in obtaining money, would it be proper for you to agree to dismiss the criminal charges if there were full payment of all damage claims?

    Mr. J. Joseph Bainton

    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Well, agreed, maybe... enter into an agreement by which you, in exchange for the payment of whatever the amount the damages were or alleged to be, you agreed to recommend to the court that they would be... the criminal charges would be dismissed.

    Yes. 
    It would potentially create a conflict of interest. 
    I suppose. 
    I think I can't say that it doesn't. 
    But I think that what you've got to do in deciding this case is, again, to determine whether there is a risk that the entitlement to the defendant of a fair trial will be compromised. 
    And whether or not this case is going to be... whether my recommendation would be accepted or rejected by the District Court rests in its discretion. 
    And I think it's fair to say that in these cases the District Courts generally look at recommendations of special prosecutors with respect to the disposition of a criminal matter, including its commencement. 
    Some look differently--

    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Well, let me change the example a little bit.

    I could not abandon my ethical obligation to my client because I was no longer getting paid. 
    I could asked to be relieved. 
    If I was relieved, then I suppose one of these other solutions, if they were possible, would come into play. 
    But I don't think I could throw the case, if you will.

    Mr. J. Joseph Bainton 
    --Yes, sir. 
    But contrary to what the Solicitor General said, I know of my own personal knowledge of four cases, three in the Central District of California and one in the Southern District of New York, within the last eight to ten months, when the U.S. Attorney has, on each occasion, been offered this opportunity, and has declined, and I have been appointed. 
    So the statement by the Solicitor General that this Court can assume that the Justice Department will regularly prosecute this case is at least inconsistent with my personal experience.

    A Federal court. 
    It gives the... on the contempt citation, it gives the defendant six years, or whatever. 
    And nobody arrests him. 
    The U.S. Attorney just says, you know, it's too much. 
    Or I'm too busy. 
    My people are out doing other things. 
    Nothing happens. 
    Now, do we have authority to appoint somebody to arrest and incarcerate him as well? 
    I mean, wouldn't that follow from your notion that somehow we have to be self-contained; otherwise we're not real judges? 
    Aren't we ultimately dependent on the executive anyway?

    Mr. J. Joseph Bainton 
    In that example, I think as a practical matter, you're absolutely correct. 
    But I think there is a qualitative, Justice Scalia, between setting up a court order... an entirely court-maintained prison system and enforcing a court's order. 
    Federal courts, certainly in the desegregation cases, have run school districts.

    Mr. J. Joseph Bainton 
    --But your example, sir, I most respectfully suggest, is largely speculative. 
    The likelihood of the marshall service declining to incarcerate someone, I most respectfully submit, is slim or none. 
    The likelihood of an already overburdened U.S. Attorney's office to say, I haven't got the personnel to prosecute this case is a real problem. 
    That is a problem that has prompted this rule of law. 
    And, while conceptually you're right, Justice Scalia,--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="3124.487" stopTime="3125.522">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Well, maybe that's because--
speaker="j_joseph_bainton" startTime="3125.522" stopTime="3132.260">
    Mr. J. Joseph Bainton 
    --I think the real problem you've got to deal with is the one that was dealt with by the Second Circuit.

speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="3132.260" stopTime="3163.112">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    --Maybe that's because the United States Attorney thinks that of all the violations of law out there, the flouting of this particular court order is not the most serious that should engage the time of either his people or the courts. 
    Now, why do our matters have to go to the top of the prosecutorial agenda necessarily? 
    What isn't that violation of law one that ought to be put on the list for the United States Attorney like all the other ones? 
    It's a violation of law.
speaker="j_joseph_bainton" startTime="3163.112" stopTime="3238.195">
    Mr. J. Joseph Bainton 
    Because the interests of the judiciary, and the enforcement of its orders, are different, Justice Scalia, than the legitimate and proper interests of the justice... of the executive branch. 
    This Court cannot compel the executive branch to prosecute any criminal regardless of how heinous his conduct. 
    That's implicit in the notion of separation of powers. 
    But if this is going to be a coequal branch, it has to support its orders. 
    And to answer the question I posed, why is the agenda different, as the District Court found in this case, orders of this type are routinely ignored. 
    As a result, the case load of the District Court, which it has to deal with... there is no way that the District Court can prevent trademark owners from filing lawsuits such as the civil lawsuit from which this case arises... they want to stop the flood of cases. 
    They want their orders respected. 
    Because when Federal court orders are obeyed, then unnecessary civil contempt proceedings won't occur. 
    The interest of the District Court is in people obeying the order. 
    And the order is no magic. 
    The order says, defendant, thou shalt do what Congress has already told you to do under the Trademark Act.

    I think you'd suggest that's a good idea.
speaker="j_joseph_bainton" startTime="3360.337" stopTime="3392.392">
    Mr. J. Joseph Bainton 
    The... the... there are two parts to the answer to that question, sir. 
    The first part is, the only person who could make such an appointment is the Attorney General of the United States. 
    Secondly, the conflict of interest statute cited by the Solicitor General would make such an appointment as a proposition of statutory law by the Attorney General unlawful and therefore improper. 
    Now, the next question, I suppose, is, suppose that statute didn't exist, that statute was not a bar to such action by the Attorney General, would there be an ethical problem? 
    I don't think so.

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    There weren't a lot of U.S. Attorneys around. 
    The typical prosecution was by the victim's attorney.
speaker="j_joseph_bainton" startTime="3404.382" stopTime="3599.975">
    Mr. J. Joseph Bainton 
    That's correct. 
    I'm running out of time. 
    I would like to talk briefly about the request that this Court exercise its supervisory powers to change the practice under Rule 42(b). 
    We think that that is very ill-advised, because this Court writes the criminal rules of procedure. 
    This... an advisory committee exists, and neither the petitioner nor the Solicitor General has offered any reason to depart from the usual practice under 18 U.S.C. Section 3771. 
    In other words, if you conclude that this practice doesn't violate the due process rights of defendants, generally, or more particularly, the defendants in this case, but you nonetheless say, maybe this... maybe there's a better way. 
    And I'm an optimist. 
    I'd always like to think there's a better way. 
    I most respectfully suggest that neither petitioners nor the Solicitor General have offered you one, and I personally don't know of one. 
    But perhaps it exists. 
    Then there's a procedure so this Court can draw upon the collective wisdom of scholars, of practicing lawyers, of U.S. Attorneys and of lower Federal judges. 
    And I think that practice should be followed by this Court, if it's so inclined, and it would be a mistake to exercise its supervisory powers in the context of this case. 
    I believe two other points and I'm done. 
    I believe Justice Blackmun asked Mr. Cohen about the State law of California with respect to the taping. 
    In the District Court's opinion at 592-748, it discusses a line of Ninth Circuit cases which say that it would be unconstitutional for the State of California to proscribe the manner in which Federal law enforcement officers can conduct an investigation. 
    And therefore, it would be improper for California to tell the FBI or any other Federal law enforcement officer that it cannot engage in one-way electronic eavesdropping. 
    In its opinion the Ninth Circuit said that that construction of the statute was ridiculous, and therefore rejected it. 
    And finally, I'd like to emphasize that Justice Scalia's point about the investigation, the remarks about... the remarks by petitioners about the... about the impropriety of the investigation, I think, are the largest red herring in this case. 
    Justice Scalia, I believe you're absolutely right when you say that this is what happens in investigations of trademark counterfeiting everyday of the week. 
    The only thing that Judge Lasker's order changed from what would occur on a garden variety case is, we have videotapes and audio tapes of what was said. 
    We have, I most respectfully submit, the best evidence of what occurred on those occasions. 
    And that can do nothing but to protect the legitimate interests of the defendants in this case. 
    Thank you. 
   
   
   
   Rebuttal of James A. Cohen
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="3599.975" stopTime="3606.029">

speaker="james_a_cohen" startTime="3606.029" stopTime="3683.529">
    Mr. James A. Cohen 
    Thank you. 
    I'll speak quickly. 
    First of all, with all due respect, Justice Rehnquist, the system in this country at the time of the Constitution was a system of public prosecution. 
    Not only that, for the past 100, 150 years, the system in England has been a system of public prosecution at least as it would apply to this kind of case. 
    In England, the police, not the victim, hire the private attorney to manage... to prosecute the case. 
    Second of all, it is simply not true that Mr. Bainton went to the U.S. Attorney a few hours after the appointment. 
    He was appointed on March 31st, and the tapes began to run. 
    And they ran from March 31st until April 6th. 
    That's when the letter went out to the United States Attorney. 
    Thirdly, if you examine the appendix at pages 103 to 106, you'll see letters in which the hats, as you said, Justice Marshall, kept changing between the special prosecutor hat and Vuitton's hat, in terms of making deals with Rochman, and then the lodging, which we filed with the clerk of the court, at pages L36 and L39, the same hat sort of switched... I should say; well, it doesn't matter... with respect to Mr. Pariseault, who was also bargained with, depending on whose interests were at stake at that particular time.
