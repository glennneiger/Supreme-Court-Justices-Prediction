Town of Newton v. Rumery

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    You may proceed whenever you are ready, Mr. Gardner.
speaker="donald_e_gardner" startTime="14.174" stopTime="136.586">
    Mr. Donald E. Gardner 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    On behalf of the town of Newton, New Hampshire, I appear before you today because a gentleman by the name of Bernard Rumery reached an agreement in conjunction with the dismissal of a valid criminal prosecution against him. 
    Mr. Rumery agreed that he would not pursue a civil action against the town, the arresting officer, or any of the town's public servants. 
    Subsequently, Mr. Rumery breached that agreement. 
    The Federal District Court, Justice Martin Laughlin, ruled that Mr. Rumery's agreement should be enforced. 
    The Court specifically found that Mr. Rumery voluntarily, knowingly and deliberately waived his right to bring a subsequent action and that when he did so, he did so thinking and knowing that it was in his best interest. 
    Mr. Rumery now seeks to escape the consequences of his agreement by asking this Court to apply a per se prohibition against the type of agreement that he entered on that day in 1983. 
    If the Court accepts the arguments offered by Mr. Rumery and allows him to revoke his agreement, then this Court not only will be providing Mr. Rumery with a benefit but will also be denying all present and future defendants in a situation like Mr. Rumery, they will in effect be prevented from taking upon themselves an opportunity like that which was presented by Mr. Rumery. 
    I therefore suggest to the Court that application of a per se rule in this case offends common sense, basic justice, and fair play.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="136.586" stopTime="161.570">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    The argument that you are preventing future people from engaging in it is not terribly persuasive. 
    You could say the same thing about, if you... if we didn't enforce promises made to blackmailers we would be denying people in the future the opportunity to prevent blackmailers from doing the terrible things they are threatening to do by making a promise to them.
speaker="donald_e_gardner" startTime="161.570" stopTime="165.105">
    Mr. Donald E. Gardner 
    I would agree, Your Honor, the difference being--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="165.105" stopTime="179.496">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    So if, indeed, there is some overreaching here, and it is a bad thing to have cities or anybody doing this sort of thing... it's hardly something to be worried about, that we're preventing it from happening in the future.
speaker="donald_e_gardner" startTime="179.496" stopTime="249.675">
    Mr. Donald E. Gardner 
    --If in fact it were overreaching, I would agree, Your Honor. 
    The suggestion that a blackmailer in the town might be engaging in a similar type of conduct as regards this type of a situation, I would suggest, is not appropriate. 
    This is a case where the County Attorney, as opposed to a town... an actual town representative... entered in to an agreement when he was concerned about a prosecution, concerned about the principal witness, the complaining witness, and the fact that she was also the victim of a rape and that she may not be willing to testify in this subsequent action, he entered into an agreement at that point in time to dismiss the prosecution, conditioned upon the police officer, the public servants, and the town being somewhat protected, or being protected against a civil action. 
    This is a case where a man made a voluntary, knowing and deliberate choice. 
    This is a case where a man gave up a right to a civil remedy, and it's a case that I would suggest, also--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="249.675" stopTime="259.197">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    He also gave up the right to defend himself in court, too, I suppose. 
    The thing that really is on the table is whether he wanted to stand trial on a criminal charge.
speaker="donald_e_gardner" startTime="259.197" stopTime="271.707">
    Mr. Donald E. Gardner 
    --He had a choice. 
    He chose not to stand trial on a criminal charge, but in a sense chose to have his day in court when he had nothing to lose, apparently, be reneging on his agreement and thereafter--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="271.707" stopTime="282.646">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Do you think there are very many cases in which the defendant would say, I'd much rather go to trial on the criminal charge, than just have you dismiss the charges?
speaker="donald_e_gardner" startTime="282.646" stopTime="292.621">
    Mr. Donald E. Gardner 
    --Commonly, I would expect that a defendant who is assured of his innocence will do that. 
    I expect in a plea bargain situation--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="292.621" stopTime="298.775">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Assured of his innocence, he'd still want to go to trial, even though you know nothing is all that certain in trials?
speaker="donald_e_gardner" startTime="298.775" stopTime="310.665">
    Mr. Donald E. Gardner 
    --Well, I would expect, Justice Stevens, that that's very similar to the plea bargaining situation and we see people who stand trial despite plea bargain offers on a daily basis. 
    I would suggest in that situation--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="310.665" stopTime="320.271">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Those are a choice between one of two different criminal trials. 
    The plea bargain is never one where you get total exoneration in exchange for a bargain.
speaker="donald_e_gardner" startTime="320.271" stopTime="338.067">
    Mr. Donald E. Gardner 
    --Well, there are plea bargains which are very near total exoneration, situations in New Hampshire, for instance, where an individual can plead to a lesser included misdemeanor and suffer a conditional discharge which allows him an automatic annulment of his record in one year. 
    If in this particular case--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="338.067" stopTime="340.185">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    It's still fairly serious.
speaker="donald_e_gardner" startTime="340.185" stopTime="383.096">
    Mr. Donald E. Gardner 
    --It is certainly not going to jail, for instance, and it's something that if it were done in this case, we would not be here today over. 
    I'm not suggesting particularly that Mr. Rumery would or would not have entered into an agreement like that. 
    But I am suggesting that the distinction between that and what happened in this case is not all that great and that in effect all that's happened here is, the state has given up a criminal prosecution but in doing so, in a case involving arrest, a question of the propriety of the arrest, not a question of abuse of force, a question of arrest, and in this case all that was at issue was whether the arrest was proper.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="383.096" stopTime="390.600">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Do you suppose a bargain would be enforceable if the prosecutor said, we'll dismiss the charges if you give $1,000 to the police benefit fund?
speaker="donald_e_gardner" startTime="390.600" stopTime="398.955">
    Mr. Donald E. Gardner 
    If you give $1,000 to the police benefit fund... I would liken that to the blackmail that Justice Scalia--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="398.955" stopTime="401.140">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Well, why is that any different from this?
speaker="donald_e_gardner" startTime="401.140" stopTime="406.692">
    Mr. Donald E. Gardner 
    --Well, because in that case the prosecutor is doing something that's wholly outside his ambit.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="406.692" stopTime="410.496">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    You mean he has a duty to prosecute if he thinks there's prima facie evidence?
speaker="donald_e_gardner" startTime="410.496" stopTime="422.303">
    Mr. Donald E. Gardner 
    He has a duty to prosecute, but his duty is not solely to convict. 
    His duty is to serve society and the best interests of society, and there are many cases that--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="422.303" stopTime="426.105">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Don't you think the police benefit fund serves society?
speaker="donald_e_gardner" startTime="426.105" stopTime="432.742">
    Mr. Donald E. Gardner 
    --Not as directly as the prosecutor's activities on behalf of society in judging whether or not in a particular case--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="432.742" stopTime="440.515">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Well, here you can settle a loss to it for less than $1,000, if it's a frivolous case. 
    What's the difference? 
    I don't understand.
speaker="donald_e_gardner" startTime="440.515" stopTime="465.463">
    Mr. Donald E. Gardner 
    --Well, the distinction, I would suggest, Your Honor, is that again the prosecutor in the situation where he garnered $1,000 for the police benefit society would in fact be outside the ambit of proper prosecutorial discretion, whereas in this situation, I would suggest, he was well within the proper area of prosecutorial discretion.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="465.463" stopTime="471.717">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    --garnered the release for two or three police officers who otherwise might be subjected to personal liability.
speaker="donald_e_gardner" startTime="471.717" stopTime="514.979">
    Mr. Donald E. Gardner 
    The prosecutor in this case, Your Honor, did not... the is no evidence that the prosecutor in this case demanded a release. 
    The evidence is in this case that the defending attorney, Attorney Woods, called the prosecuting attorney and said, you'd better dismiss the case against my client and if you don't, we're going to sue afterwards and we're going to win. 
    He then knew, having thrown down the gauntlet, as he testified to in his deposition, that the only way this case could be resolved is if a release were executed. 
    It's important to realize that never did the defendant speak with the police--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="514.979" stopTime="520.799">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    In other words, it was settled on the assumption that there was a meritorious 1983 claim that would otherwise be filed, is that it?
speaker="donald_e_gardner" startTime="520.799" stopTime="547.334">
    Mr. Donald E. Gardner 
    --It was not... I would not suggest that it was settled on the assumption that there was a meritorious claim. 
    I would suggest that it was settled on the assumption that any claim brought, a 1983 claim or other, a false arrest state claim, has a settlement value in that it causes the person who is sued a considerable inconvenience. 
    It causes the person against whom suit is brought to have to defend that action. 
    The cost--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="547.334" stopTime="553.021">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Why is that inconvenience to the individual police officer any different from the benefit to my police fund?
speaker="donald_e_gardner" startTime="553.021" stopTime="579.939">
    Mr. Donald E. Gardner 
    --Because the police officer in the criminal justice system is a public servant. 
    The prosecutor is acting on behalf of the state. 
    The police officer, when he arrested Mr. Rumery, was not making... he was not taking action on his own behalf. 
    He was acting for the state. 
    He was, in effect, an agent of the state. 
    As a matter of fact, in bringing the 1983 action, the plaintiff must so plead, that he was a state actor.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="579.939" stopTime="598.919">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Mr. Gardner, if the 1983 suit has a dollar settlement value, how is the case different from just having the police say, if the respondent will pay the city $1,000 it will dismiss the charges?
speaker="donald_e_gardner" startTime="598.919" stopTime="606.406">
    Mr. Donald E. Gardner 
    I would suggest, Your Honor, that not all cases have a dollar settlement value on account of their inherent value.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="606.406" stopTime="609.291">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    You said this one probably did.
speaker="donald_e_gardner" startTime="609.291" stopTime="622.951">
    Mr. Donald E. Gardner 
    I was suggesting that I have a file cabinet full of releases in cases which I don't believe are meritorious, that have been settled because the settlement value... the nuisance value of the case--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="622.951" stopTime="632.656">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Well, let's suppose there is a dollar settlement value. 
    How is it different from just saying, you pay us "X" number of dollars and we'll drop the charges?
speaker="donald_e_gardner" startTime="632.656" stopTime="646.900">
    Mr. Donald E. Gardner 
    --Well, a dollar settlement value, as I understand it, if this were a case that were being pursued, would run to Mr. Rumery rather than vice versa. 
    I think your example suggests that Mr. Rumery is going to pay money to the state.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="646.900" stopTime="652.720">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Well, he is giving up his suit, something of value.
speaker="donald_e_gardner" startTime="652.720" stopTime="676.585">
    Mr. Donald E. Gardner 
    And he is also... he is voluntarily waiving something which he knows, because he has been advised by counsel, he's thought about it. 
    In fact, in Mr. Rumery's case his counsel testified that he spent a half hour to an hour with him. 
    They discussed it. 
    He went home. 
    He thought about it over the weekend. 
    He was gaining something in return. 
    He was gaining the dismissal of the criminal prosecution against him.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="676.585" stopTime="707.772">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Well, isn't that very fact something that makes it different from plea bargaining because here the city has something else it's concerned about other than just the operation of the process of the enforcement of the criminal law in reaching this agreement? 
    There's another element at stake, to wit, the city's or the officer's own liability.
speaker="donald_e_gardner" startTime="707.772" stopTime="725.066">
    Mr. Donald E. Gardner 
    In the plea bargaining context, he's obviously pleading to a reduced offense, even to the point of a reduced offense that is perhaps not going to cause him any disability for any great period of time into the future.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="725.066" stopTime="730.804">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    And what was the motive of the prosecutor, or the reason--
speaker="donald_e_gardner" startTime="730.804" stopTime="747.599">
    Mr. Donald E. Gardner 
    In our case there were several motives, I think. 
    I think it's appropriate prosecutorial discretion to look at the situation, and I would suggest to the Court that you have to look at the totality of the circumstances and determine whether it was voluntary, just, deliberate.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="747.599" stopTime="759.406">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    --Do you think determining whether... should a factor in determining whether to dismiss the case be that this will protect some public official?
speaker="donald_e_gardner" startTime="759.406" stopTime="774.583">
    Mr. Donald E. Gardner 
    The factor in determining whether to... well, that should be a factor. 
    I think it's appropriate and it's within... it should be within his discretion that that be a factor, yes, Your Honor. 
    I would suggest that when he... because what he's effectively doing, in an arrest case--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="774.583" stopTime="783.939">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, what that means to me is that you would otherwise pursue the criminal case if it weren't for this factor?
speaker="donald_e_gardner" startTime="783.939" stopTime="785.574">
    Mr. Donald E. Gardner 
    --If that were the only factor.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="785.574" stopTime="794.329">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, no, but if you say it's a factor, there are bound to be some cases where that's the factor that determines whether you will try the case or not.
speaker="donald_e_gardner" startTime="794.329" stopTime="796.829">
    Mr. Donald E. Gardner 
    I would suggest that if that were the factor--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="796.829" stopTime="806.387">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    So you think that you're justified in trading off the public interest in having this criminal case tried, against releasing the public official?
speaker="donald_e_gardner" startTime="806.387" stopTime="817.242">
    Mr. Donald E. Gardner 
    --I would suggest that if that were the only factor, Justice White, what we would be talking about is a coercive situation, inherently coercive, and I would trust the trial court to find that it wasn't a voluntary waiver.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="817.242" stopTime="819.694">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    But you say it can always be a factor.
speaker="donald_e_gardner" startTime="819.694" stopTime="829.150">
    Mr. Donald E. Gardner 
    If it's the only factor, I would suggest that in that particular case, it was clearly a coercive situation.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="829.150" stopTime="844.945">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, here's a case where you had otherwise tried... there has to be some situations like this that you would otherwise try, but you did not because there is this factor of possibly gaining the release of a public official?
speaker="donald_e_gardner" startTime="844.945" stopTime="862.806">
    Mr. Donald E. Gardner 
    I would suggest, Your Honor, that there is absolutely no evidence in this case that it would otherwise have been tried. 
    I don't know... in fact, the prosecutor said, if there had not been a release, I don't know what I would have done. 
    There hadn't even been a probable cause hearing in this case. 
    This man had been arrested and bailed, and that was it.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="862.806" stopTime="882.887">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Mr. Gardner, I think the issue in this case is whether a per se rule is appropriate. 
    In other words, what's at issue in this case is the whole file cabinet full of releases you've obtained in all those other cases, because that's... we have a general rule. 
    We have to presume that all of those other cases would have been dismissed, or would not have been dismissed, without this release?
speaker="donald_e_gardner" startTime="882.887" stopTime="896.278">
    Mr. Donald E. Gardner 
    Well, if there's going to be a per se rule, then obviously that's what we have to do. 
    The Court is either going to have to presume that all of the cases would have been dismissed or not dismissed, and that's the difficult--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="896.278" stopTime="905.883">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Which do you think is the correct presumption? 
    If you've got, say 150 releases in your drawer and dismiss cases, do we assume there was merit to all those cases or no merit to all those cases?
speaker="donald_e_gardner" startTime="905.883" stopTime="920.993">
    Mr. Donald E. Gardner 
    --I would suggest, Your Honor, that this Court have faith in the prosecutors of America and assume that those cases, if they were not meritorious, would have been dismissed despite the release, or the obtaining of a release. 
    I would suggest also, Your Honor, that in an arrest--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="920.993" stopTime="934.884">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Then really, there's no consideration for the release except that the defendant got out of a meritless criminal trial, and I suppose there's a lot of pressure on a defendant to give a release in that situation if he's faced with a trial, even if he thinks he's going to win.
speaker="donald_e_gardner" startTime="934.884" stopTime="960.784">
    Mr. Donald E. Gardner 
    --Well, I wouldn't say that he was getting out of a meritless criminal trial, just because the prosecutor determines that he's not going to prosecute the case. 
    Prosecutors have compassion. 
    Mr. Rumery was a middle aged man. 
    He was a businessman. 
    He had a reputation. 
    He had had no contacts with the law. 
    The prosecutor was concerned that in this case the complaining witness might not be willing to testify.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="960.784" stopTime="971.759">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    --We can't really assume, in other words, that all the cases that are dismissed are necessarily meritless cases. 
    You often dismiss cases that have merit, I take it.
speaker="donald_e_gardner" startTime="971.759" stopTime="975.461">
    Mr. Donald E. Gardner 
    I'm not a prosecutor, Your Honor, but I would suggest that there are--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="975.461" stopTime="977.746">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    And many cases that have merit are never brought.
speaker="donald_e_gardner" startTime="977.746" stopTime="984.316">
    Mr. Donald E. Gardner 
    --Many cases, that have merit are never brought. 
    Many cases that are merited cases are dismissed.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="984.316" stopTime="1019.590">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    But what you're saying is that a case that has merit but nonetheless, despite its merit, might otherwise be dismissed because a witness would have to, as in this case, a woman in a rape case who didn't want to testify would have to be called, that otherwise the prosecutor might dismiss the case; nonetheless would have to go forward to it despite the inconvenience to this raped witness, unless the prosecutor could be sure that by dismissing it, he was not letting the city in for an enormous suit for false prosecution.
speaker="donald_e_gardner" startTime="1019.590" stopTime="1020.540">
    Mr. Donald E. Gardner 
    I'm saying that in each--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="1020.540" stopTime="1021.441">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    You're not saying that?
speaker="donald_e_gardner" startTime="1021.441" stopTime="1037.701">
    Mr. Donald E. Gardner 
    --What I'm saying is that in each case you have to look at the case when the decision has to be made, and determine whether at that time the situation resulted from a voluntary, knowing, deliberate waiver of the right to bring the action by the individual.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="1037.701" stopTime="1067.320">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Can the motive of saving the city from a suit, or individual policemen from a suit, also exist when a prosecutor accepts a plea bargain to a lesser offense, so that in some cases where the prosecutor might otherwise consider dismissing the charge entirely, he insists upon accepting a plea to a lesser charge in order to be sure that the city wouldn't be subject to suit for false prosecution subsequently?
speaker="donald_e_gardner" startTime="1067.320" stopTime="1070.939">
    Mr. Donald E. Gardner 
    Well, that certainly could happen, and it's obvious that--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="1070.939" stopTime="1079.361">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Does pleading guilty to a lesser included offense eliminate the possibility of bringing a false arrest or false prosecution action later?

    Mr. Donald E. Gardner

speaker="donald_e_gardner" startTime="1090.603" stopTime="1095.490">
    Mr. Donald E. Gardner 
    To my understanding, Your Honor, the First Circuit applied federal law--

    Mr. Donald E. Gardner 
    --In that I'm very pleased because they decided the case against me, Your Honor. 
    What I would suggest is that the law here is a question of public policy, as was suggested below, and what the Court has to--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1115.718" stopTime="1122.724">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well, but public policy is ordinarily a matter for state courts to decide in New Hampshire.

    There is a suggestion, or I would suggest, Your Honor, that the First Amendment, the right to petition for redress of grievances, might arguably be applied and the suggestion might be that an individual who waives his right to seek redress or through the civil rights remedy for a deprivation of his constitutional rights has in effect waived his right to petition the Court for redress of grievances. 
    It is my understanding that that was the interpretation of the First Circuit. 
    There is also a due process argument to the effect that if he didn't waive it voluntarily, he was deprived of due process. 
    The fact in this case, and the fact that is vital to this case, is that the question of the voluntariness of the release has been found in this case.

    Mr. Donald E. Gardner 
    I think, in order to determine what test to apply, I think the Court should look to what test it has applied in interpreting waivers of constitutional rights. 
    And if you look to the constitutional rights cases, the Miranda cases, the plea bargaining cases, you see that in each of those cases the Court has looked to the question of whether the release or... excuse me, the waiver was signed or agreed to after informed and voluntary consideration. 
    So, I would suggest that, given the totality of the circumstances, a trial court be trusted to examine the... I know what you are going to say, Justice Scalia.

    We have to recall that Mr. Rumery in this case deliberated over the weekend, that Mr. Rumery had the advice of a very competent attorney, as found by the trial court.

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well, why is that a concern of federal law, to encourage the prosecutor that way? 
    It seems to me the concerns of federal law here would be exhausted when you're sure that the putative defendant is treated fairly. 
    Just like in an FELA release case, where there are federal standards, you don't worry about how it's going to help the railroad, basically, so long as the defendant is treated fairly.

    It doesn't seem to me that's the concern of the federal law. 
    The federal concern here is that in 1983, plaintiff not be unfairly euchered cut of his right to sue.

    I would agree with that. 
    There is a clash here between the systems, and the clash is the use of the criminal justice system in order... against the individual by the arm of the state, against the individual to extract a waiver of rights for the benefit of not the public--

    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Mr. Bauer, I think there is some difference between your position and the position of the Court of Appeals, if I'm not mistaken. 
    I read their opinion as merely holding that the waiver was unenforceable as to the 1983 federal claim, but it said nothing that persuaded me they intended to hold unenforceable the waiver of state law claims such as... you had about five or six state law claims. 
    But the argument you're making now, that there is a constitutional compulsion to hold it void would also invalidate the entire covenant not to sue.

    But, yes, I agree with you, Justice Stevens, that the First Circuit identified the covenant not to sue as void as against public policy, and stopped right there.

    Your position is a much broader one and says that the whole covenant is unconstitutional, as I understand your argument, because it was obtained... I don't know, I'm not quite clear on your theory of unconstitutionality.

    Mr. Charles P. Bauer 
    The significant difference, Your Honor, between plea bargaining and this context is that in plea bargaining there is not a confusion of the two systems. 
    You have plea bargaining solely within the criminal context and there is a mutuality of advantage to the state and to the criminal defendant. 
    Moreover, the public interest in the plea bargaining situation, the public interest is being served. 
    That is, there is... the state is obtaining a plea to a guilty charge and there is a conviction on that guilty charge.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="2680.013" stopTime="2718.088">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Well, the state would argue that here there's a public interest being served as well, that the prosecutor, given his other business, has decided that this case, on reflection, is not worth his resources. 
    So, he wants to get rid of it but at the same time he doesn't want to leave the municipality open to a 1983 suit. 
    That's perfectly reasonable. 
    Or, as also is alleged to have happened in this case, the prosecutor has decided in light of the reluctance of the rape victim to testify, justice would be disserved by putting her through all that and going ahead with this proceeding. 
    Why aren't those valid interest of the state?
speaker="charles_p_bauer" startTime="2718.088" stopTime="2771.322">
    Mr. Charles P. Bauer 
    Most of what you've just articulated, Justice, are valid. 
    However, using the proper discretion that you just described, of the prosecutor, he or she may nolle pros that charge. 
    But to go one step further, and to say to the individual, now, in addition to my public interest duty which has been served in weighing whether to go through with this criminal prosecution, I want to extract from you your right to sue and to exercise your federal rights. 
    My position is, Your Honor, that for the prosecutor to protect individual police officers, to protect individual witnesses, to protect the municipality, is not within the ambit--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="2771.322" stopTime="2777.243">
    Justice Antonin Scalia

    Mr. Charles P. Bauer 
    --That's correct, Your Honor.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="2778.261" stopTime="2806.078">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    He can't have in mind that, 
    "If I don't go ahead... I think it's a valid prosecution but I think... you know, other things being equal I would think it's not worth doing for a number of reasons, one of which is I have better things to do. " 
    "Nonetheless, since I'm aware that if I dismiss it the city will be subjected to an enormous amount of suits. " 
    Do you expect the prosecutor nonetheless to dismiss?

    Mr. Charles P. Bauer 
    To dismiss, yes.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="2807.780" stopTime="2813.768">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Without bearing in mind that although it's a meritorious case he's going to have to litigate this thing in civil matters?

    Mr. Charles P. Bauer 
    The civil case, Your Honor... let me back up if I may. 
    The public, the public interest is, if there has been a misuse of public official action, the public interest has an interest in exposing that misconduct to the air of light and to correct it if necessary. 
    Furthermore--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="2857.378" stopTime="2876.842">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    I understand, but he denies that there has been any. 
    He thinks this has been a good arrest, a good prosecution, and, 
    "If I went ahead with it I'd win it, but it's not worth it. " 
    "I have other things, and there is a rape victim that has expressed her reluctance and I don't want to put her through the wringer. " 
    Now, he can't take those things into account, you say?
speaker="charles_p_bauer" startTime="2876.842" stopTime="2887.732">
    Mr. Charles P. Bauer 
    --No. 
    What I'm saying is that he can take those things into consideration but he cannot take into consideration whether I should get a civil release in order to protect my--

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    But the only way to take them into account, and the only way to protect them is to get the release. 
    Because the rape victim doesn't care whether she's put on the stand in a criminal prosecution or in a subsequent civil suit. 
    It's going to be just as bad for her. 
    And his time is going to be as much wasted in the civil suit as it would be in the criminal prosecution. 
    So, you're just telling him there's really no way that he can do anything about this?

    Mr. Charles P. Bauer 
    --Your Honor, I would respond by saying that there are already safeguards for police, prosecutors, towns.

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    I'm worried about his waste of time. 
    You tell me how his waste of time is preserved, unless he gets the release. 
    He has just decided, 
    "I have too much business. " 
    "I have other criminal prosecutions that are more important. " 
    "I'd rather dismiss this one. "

    Now, things like that happen all the time. 
    Isn't that person under the same kind of compulsion, shall we set aside those... is that prosecutorial misconduct as well?

    The prosecutor can protect the grossest false arrest by going ahead and trying the case and winning it.
speaker="charles_p_bauer" startTime="3391.255" stopTime="3415.573">
    Mr. Charles P. Bauer 
    --And winning it, yes, and we submit that the prosecutor... if this Court does not declare such covenants void, that the prosecutors and police will incorporate this type of covenant into their standard operating procedure and thereby prevent... virtually prevent any 1983 action--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3415.573" stopTime="3427.714">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Not so, not so. 
    That statement must rest on the idea that it's impossible to sort out the good ones from the bad ones.
speaker="charles_p_bauer" startTime="3427.714" stopTime="3461.785">
    Mr. Charles P. Bauer 
    --Your Honor, with regard to the District Court, I think that you're referring to the sorting out, to the trial level. 
    We submit that when you have the clash of the criminal justice system being used against an individual to extract a civil benefit, there cannot be a voluntary waiver. 
    So, therefore, there is no need to even go through the ad hoc, case by case balancing. 
    I would also, by analogy, suggest that a private attorney--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3461.785" stopTime="3476.195">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    I understand your position. 
    I know that's your argument, but can't you really identify those cases where there might be prosecutorial overreaching?
speaker="charles_p_bauer" startTime="3476.195" stopTime="3533.816">
    Mr. Charles P. Bauer 
    --No, because the voluntary, deliberate and informed standard, Your Honor, only looks to the individual. 
    Did he have time to think about it? 
    Did he deliberate? 
    Was he informed? 
    Did he have a criminal defense attorney? 
    Was it voluntary? 
    Our position is that once you have the threat of the criminal justice system being used to extract the civil benefit, it cannot be voluntary. 
    The voluntary, deliberate standard does not look to the motives of the prosecutor. 
    It does not look to the conduct of the police department. 
    It only looks to the individual. 
    It's only one side of the equation. 
    And our position is that with that imbalance, with that unequal bargaining position, such a covenant cannot as a matter of law be voluntary.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="3533.816" stopTime="3557.431">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Mr. Bauer, suppose instead of a covenant the prosecutor said he wanted the defendant to stipulate there was probable cause for the arrest, even though he wasn't prepared to prove that the man was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, and presumably in this case there's probable cause if the woman told the police officers what the record suggests. 
    Would that kind of a stipulation as to the facts be invalid, in your view?
speaker="charles_p_bauer" startTime="3557.431" stopTime="3591.836">
    Mr. Charles P. Bauer 
    Yes, Your Honor, yes, and there is a case on point on that type of matter where a trial court participated in that request for a stipulation as to probable cause. 
    And I believe the case is Dixon versus D.C., 1968, when Chief Justice Bazelon indicated that the problem with these covenants, or these kind of tacit agreements, is not necessarily... I see that my time is up. 
    I thank you very much for your time. 
   
   
   
   Rebuttal of Donald E. Gardner
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="3591.836" stopTime="3597.490">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Thank you, Mr. Bauer. 
    Mr. Gardner, do you have anything else? 
    You've got three minutes.
speaker="donald_e_gardner" startTime="3597.490" stopTime="3605.393">
    Mr. Donald E. Gardner 
    Thank you. 
    Just briefly, Your Honor. 
    Since Justice Frankfurter in his absence is getting a lot of air time today, I thought I'd--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="3605.393" stopTime="3606.511">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Not this case.
speaker="donald_e_gardner" startTime="3606.511" stopTime="3610.830">
    Mr. Donald E. Gardner 
    --Impart a bit of his wisdom in this case also.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="3610.830" stopTime="3614.867">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    He may be here, Mr. Gardner. 
    [Laughter]
speaker="donald_e_gardner" startTime="3614.867" stopTime="3650.457">
    Mr. Donald E. Gardner 
    He said in Adams, a case that was decided in 1942, Adams versus the United States, that to imprison a man and his privileges... or to say that a man cannot voluntarily waive his constitutional rights is to imprison a man and his privileges and call it the Constitution. 
    Obviously, a man has to be able to choose to waive his constitutional rights. 
    Otherwise his rights are, in a sense, not really good to him. 
    And I would suggest, Your Honor, that it's quite clear in this case that's what happened. 
    The Court so found, he voluntarily waived his right. 
    The Court also found that at the time--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="3650.457" stopTime="3672.720">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    I don't really believe... that is an exorbitant argument. 
    What about, for instance, his right not to be sold into slavery? 
    I mean, slavery's been outlawed. 
    Are you saying that right is no good unless he can sell it, right? 
    That means we have to allow slavery in this country because otherwise the right to be free from slavery isn't worth anything.
speaker="donald_e_gardner" startTime="3672.720" stopTime="3687.797">
    Mr. Donald E. Gardner 
    --It certainly suggests, Your Honor, that in the best exercise of your rights you ought to be able to, on occasion, waive them. 
    Obviously there are public interest limitations at the very extremes to that kind of an application.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="3687.797" stopTime="3689.582">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    And that's what your opponent's arguing.
speaker="donald_e_gardner" startTime="3689.582" stopTime="3711.578">
    Mr. Donald E. Gardner 
    And obviously that is, but in this case we don't have a man who sold himself into slavery. 
    We have a man who gave up money, as the Court aptly pointed out. 
    You know, my opponent suggests to the Court that what has happened in this case is that this man has been deprived of his constitutional rights. 
    But what we all realize is that if instead of signing a release he got a check, we wouldn't be here today.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3711.578" stopTime="3720.101">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    You would solve all these cases by the voluntary and intelligent formula, wouldn't you?
speaker="donald_e_gardner" startTime="3720.101" stopTime="3720.534">
    Mr. Donald E. Gardner 
    That's correct.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3720.534" stopTime="3724.755">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    And without any regard at all to the prosecutor's conduct?
speaker="donald_e_gardner" startTime="3724.755" stopTime="3730.242">
    Mr. Donald E. Gardner 
    Well, if the prosecutor's conduct was coercive, then the release wouldn't be voluntary.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3730.242" stopTime="3732.542">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, when is that?
speaker="donald_e_gardner" startTime="3732.542" stopTime="3734.378">
    Mr. Donald E. Gardner 
    In this particular case--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3734.378" stopTime="3738.932">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Whenever the prosecutor's got a lousy case, that he'd never try in a hundred years?
speaker="donald_e_gardner" startTime="3738.932" stopTime="3751.322">
    Mr. Donald E. Gardner 
    --No. 
    If he threatened to go on with the prosecution solely in order to coerce the release, I would suggest that that's clearly coercive. 
    In this case the prosecutor never spoke to Mr. Rumery at all.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="3751.322" stopTime="3761.028">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Does that mean that your rule would cover every case, you'd say, 
    "Well, we've got everything agreed and we're going to dismiss; the one last thing, you've got to sign this release before we do it. " 
    That would be bad?
speaker="donald_e_gardner" startTime="3761.028" stopTime="3770.867">
    Mr. Donald E. Gardner 
    No. 
    What I'm suggesting is that when we're talking about a prosecutor who has good cause within his discretion for other reasons to dismiss a case--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3770.867" stopTime="3773.585">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, like he hasn't got any evidence?
speaker="donald_e_gardner" startTime="3773.585" stopTime="3777.020">
    Mr. Donald E. Gardner 
    --Well, I wouldn't suggest that's good cause, but for reasons other--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3777.020" stopTime="3780.055">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    That's one of the best reasons known to man.
speaker="donald_e_gardner" startTime="3780.055" stopTime="3791.594">
    Mr. Donald E. Gardner 
    --Reasons other than guilt or innocence, I would suggest, Your Honor, reasons other than guilt or innocence. 
    Prosecutorial discretion, as this Court knows, is very, very broad. 
    And the reason it's very, very broad--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3791.594" stopTime="3796.865">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, what if... well, my time is up.
