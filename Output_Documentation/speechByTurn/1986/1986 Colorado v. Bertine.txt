    Mr. John M. Haried 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court: 
    In South Dakota versus Opperman and in Illinois versus Lafayette, this Court held that inventory searches are lawful if they are routinely done, if they are done pursuant to standard police procedures, and if they are done in furtherance of legitimate governmental interests, and if they are not a pretext for an investigative search. 
    This case is here on a writ of certiorari to the Colorado Supreme Court to decide the narrow question of whether during an otherwise lawful inventory search of an automobile it is permissible for a police officer to open and inventory closed containers.

    Mr. John M. Haried 
    It was basically a decision of the facts of this case, that the intent and the whole thrust of the search was an inventory, and that's the grounds on which we sought to justify it. 
    The facts in this case are that the defendant was stopped because of his erratic driving, and he was eventually arrested for drunken driving. 
    He was taken to the Boulder police department for the booking procedure and for a blood alcohol test. 
    The police impounded his vehicle because where it was left when he was arrested it was blocking traffic on a busy street in the city of Boulder. 
    The Boulder police department regulations provide for routine inventory searches of impounded automobiles and their contents. 
    And during the search in this case, the police officer found Mr. Bertine's backpack on the floor, picked it up and could tell that it contained personal items, and he opened it to look for valuable or dangerous items for inventory purposes. 
    And inside he found a hair brush, a heavy metal flashlight, clothing, and he also found cocaine, cocaine paraphernalia, Quaaludes, and $700 in cash in one container and $200 in cash in a separate container on a pouch on the outside of the backpack. 
    The trial court in this case made several factual findings that are particularly important because they help focus the issue on appeal. 
    The trial court found as a matter of fact that the decision to impound this vehicle was made in good faith, and that it was made for the purposes of protecting Mr. Bertine's property, protecting the police from false claims of theft, and protecting the police from dangerous items that might have been inside of the backpack. 
    And the trial court found that the officer followed the standard inventory procedures and, importantly, the trial court found that this search was not a pretext for an investigative search.

    Mr. John M. Haried 
    I don't believe that it does. 
    It wasn't an issue in this case. 
    The trial court considered the search here under the Fourth Amendment and found that it was a lawful search under this Court's ruling in Illinois versus Lafayette. 
    But nonetheless, it suppressed the search on the basis of the Colorado constitution. 
    On an interlocutory appeal to the Colorado Supreme Court, that court affirmed the trial court's suppression of the evidence, but did not base its decision on the Colorado constitution. 
    Instead, it based it solely and squarely on the Fourth Amendment. 
    The Colorado Supreme Court specifically said that it did not reach or decide the state constitutional issue. 
    In Illinois versus Lafayette, this Court held that in the course of an otherwise lawful... that during an otherwise lawful inventory search at the booking desk, it was permissible for police officers to open and inventory closed containers. 
    And our position is that the same reasons that supported the inventory of closed containers at the booking desk in Lafayette apply with equal force here. 
    In both contexts, both at the booking desk and on the street when a vehicle is impounded, the same basic thing is happening. 
    The police in the exercise of their caretaking function are taking physical custody of a citizen's property. 
    And as a result, they are charged with responsibility for that property, responsibility to safeguard it, to keep it from being stolen or destroyed, and the responsibility to protect against the risk of harm from dangerous things that may be inside the property.

    Mr. John M. Haried 
    I'm going to start from the premise that locked briefcases... not all locked briefcases are totally secure. 
    In other words, many types of locks and briefcases can be picked or combinations can be opened, so that no container is secure.

    Mr. John M. Haried 
    --But he could still be unjustly accused of being the person who picked it, and he'd have no way of protecting against that. 
    But there's still in that situation the important governmental interest in not bringing into the... police station containers that may hold valuable... I'm sorry... that may hold particularly dangerous items, and have to store them there, because then the police would have no way of knowing what it is they're storing. 
    If we get into an analysis that draws... tries to draw a line between locked and unlocked containers, we really are getting into a worthy versus unworthy container analysis. 
    And I think that it's important in this type of search to have a bright line that the police officers can follow in each case, so that they don't have to make that kind of a judgment and they're not subject to later accusation or being second guessed about that.

    Mr. John M. Haried 
    --Only the valuable things or particularly dangerous things. 
    For example, an old shirt that's lying of the floor they don't bring that in. 
    A backpack that they weren't able to open and know whether it contained something valuable or dangerous, they would then as a practical matter and probably so that they aren't negligent have to take that in. 
    The Respondent has argued, as the Colorado Supreme Court did, that in the booking inventory context there's a greater governmental interest in opening closed containers simply because of the need to prevent weapons or contraband from getting into the jail population. 
    And the Respondent seems to say that the only way that the police can prevent that from happening is to open closed containers. 
    His argument ignores the fact that the governmental interest in the security of the jail could be adequately served simply by taking the container away from the arrested person, sealing it in some fashion, and storing it in a safe place outside of the jail population.

    Mr. John M. Haried 
    Thank you. 
    Before lunch I was saying that the defendant's argument about the security of the jailhouse could... I was saying that that interest in a secure jailhouse could adequately be served simply by taking closed containers from an arrested person and sealing them and putting them in a safe place outside of the jail. 
    However, in Illinois versus Lafayette this Court refused to impose such a less intrusive means requirement on jail personnel. 
    And there is no reason to impose such a requirement in this case. 
    It's significant to note also, as was raised in Justice Scalia's question, the fact that when containers are found in impounded and inventoried automobiles that that if they're going to be kept for safekeeping they have to be taken to the police department, and as a result there is a situation that is substantially the same as that in Illinois versus Lafayette. 
    In both the booking inventory context and the automobile inventory context, closed containers are coming into the jail. 
    And in both situations, it's just as important, it's imperative that the police know what it is that they are taking custody of so that they can take proper measures to safely store it. 
    The Respondent has also argued that closed container inventory searches during inventories of automobiles will lead to a parade of horrible results. 
    This is not true because there is already criteria in the case law that would limit the application of the inventory exception to particular facts and situations. 
    And lower courts have been in the past and will continue to be fully able to apply those criteria to separate the lawful inventory search from the unlawful pretext search.

   Argument of Richard J. Lazarus
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1036.393" stopTime="1044.083">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Very well, Mr. Haried. 
    We'll hear now from you, Mr. Lazarus.
speaker="richard_j_lazarus" startTime="1044.083" stopTime="1171.516">
    Mr. Richard J. Lazarus 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court: 
    It is our position that this case is controlled by this Court's decisions in Lafayette and Opperman. 
    Respondent's claim that the search of his backpack violates the Fourth Amendment rests at bottom on the proposition that a routine inventory search cannot validly extend to the contents of containers located inside a lawfully impounded motor vehicle. 
    According to Respondent, the score of such an inventory search is per se unreasonable even if performed pursuant to standard police department procedures, as the district court found was the case here, and not a mere pretext for an investigatory motive, as the district court found was not the case here. 
    We believe that Respondent's proposed limitation on the scope of valid, routine, inventory searches is not supported by the Fourth Amendment. 
    Indeed, we believe that Respondent's view has in principle, if not in fact, already been squarely rejected by this court in Lafayette and in Opperman. 
    No doubt for this reason, since this Court's decision in Lafayette the Colorado Supreme Court stands virtually alone in upholding the limitation on routine inventory searches urged by Respondent here. 
    Most importantly, as Petitioner has already emphasized, justifications for the administrative practice of inventory searches apply with full force to the inventorying of containers taken into police custody, including those located in motor vehicles. 
    Such searches may on a categorical basis be needed; first, to protect the owner's property; second, to protect the police from false claims of theft; and third and finally, to protect the police and their employees from the dangers associated with taking into custody containers the contents of which are unknown... virtual Trojan horses. 
    In Opperman, this Court recognized that these needs--

    --Right, but the basic point is that the category of locked containers itself would involve such a wide variety of containers, many of which, like suitcases and briefcases, are so easily susceptible to being opened that it's reasonable for the police to have a procedure which takes away that discretion to try to decide which ones are easily openable and which ones are not and just say all locked containers should be open.

    Mr. Richard J. Lazarus 
    That's right. 
    And it would be... the continuing needs of the inventory searches apply even when the container is locked.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1285.103" stopTime="1296.477">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    Now, here I understood there were packages of $700 and $200 found. 
    So that quite apart from whether a metal detector would have detected that, there is a need to inventory in order to safeguard it.
speaker="richard_j_lazarus" startTime="1296.477" stopTime="1535.000">
    Mr. Richard J. Lazarus 
    The facts of this case illustrate that quite well, how a container that was giving no outward indication that it might contain a valuable in fact did. 
    In Opperman this Court recognized that the legitimate needs of the inventory search justified the routine inventory search of a motor vehicle in police custody. 
    In Lafayette, this Court recognized that these same needs justified the routine inventory search of a backpack taken into police custody at the station house. 
    We see no reason to suppose that these same needs don't justify an inventory search of basically the equivalent of the Lafayette shoulder bag in the Opperman vehicle. 
    The legitimate and fully reasonable need for the police to learn what is in the contents of a container taken into custody does not magically end once a container is found within a motor vehicle, nor begin only when the container is itself physically located at the station house. 
    The facts of this case we believe illustrate both principles. 
    In this case the police were in lawful custody of Respondent's motor vehicle and its contents in the field, and had to determine there what to do with its contents. 
    They faced a purely administrative function. 
    It was plainly reasonable, we believe, for the police in deciding what property in the car to take for safekeeping in the property room in the station house to inventory the contents of containers they found, as long as the search was performed, as it was here, in a manner that was reasonably confined and subject in scope to those limited ends. 
    The contrary view, which is what Respondents propose here, we believe, would inevitably lead to undesirable judicial management of routine administrative procedures and, even more fundamentally, it would likely lead to procedural rules that would be incompatible with efficient and prompt police administration of their caretaking, non-investigative function. 
    For example, Respondents propose that the validity of a routine inventory search should turn on a case by case inquiry into the availability of less intrusive means. 
    Such a requirement would be fundamentally incompatible with the notion of a routine administrative procedure. 
    Inquiry into the needs of the police in a particular case, such as that undertaken by the Colorado Supreme Court here, into the subject of suspicions about the contents of specific containers, the availability of certain towing companies, the relative records of various towing companies, the privacy expectations that owners might have with respect to an infinite variety of containers, would inevitably convert a routine administrative procedure into an ad hoc process. 
    Both the purposes of the inventory search and, ironically, the rationale of this Court's acceptance of such searches would both be defeated. 
    Respondent also proposes that consent should be a prerequisite to a valid inventory search. 
    Of course, requiring consent would be tantamount to saving that inventory searches are not entitled to any special Fourth Amendment analysis, because consent is already an exception to the Fourth Amendment probably cause and warrant requirements. 
    In any event, as this Court has recognized already in Opperman, consent does not recognize or address the legitimate needs of the police to protect themselves. 
    No doubt for these reasons, both in Opperman and in Lafayette this Court has already squarely rejected the constitutional requirement of consent. 
    In our view, the sole inquiry in each case should be threefold: 
    First, whether the property is lawfully in police custody for non-investigative reasons;-- 
    Second, whether there exist routine inventory procedures that are reasonable in scope and subject;-- 
    And finally, whether the police have followed these routine procedures in the case at hand. 
    In this case, all three inquiries support the reasonableness of the search and were supported by findings of the district court. 
    Accordingly, we believe that the decision of the Colorado Supreme Court should be reversed. 
    If there are no further questions. 
   
   
   
   Argument of Cary C. Lacklen
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1535.000" stopTime="1540.737">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Thank you, Mr. Lazarus. 
    We'll hear now from you, Mr. Lacklen.
speaker="cary_c_lacklen" startTime="1540.737" stopTime="1655.696">
    Mr. Cary C. Lacklen 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court: 
    I think it's important for the Court to understand the facts of this case before it rules on the law that it will apply. 
    When Mr. Bertine was arrested for driving under the influence, he was handcuffed and placed into the police car and removed from the scene. 
    A backup officer, a trained narcotics officer, had been called to the scene by the arresting officer. 
    Officer Reichenbach, who was put in control of Mr. Bertine's car, waited for a dog impound officer to remove Mr. Bertine's animal from the car and, long after Mr. Bertine had left the scene, he started what he called an inventory search. 
    He testified at the hearing that that inventory consisted of him going into the truck to see if anything of interest was there. 
    He checked the glove compartment, as in Opperman, and then he immediately went to the backpack that he found behind the front seat. 
    He had no inventory sheet with him. 
    He didn't begin an inventory of that backpack, and the trial court found that the inventory of the backpack was done some time later, after the search of the backpack. 
    He removed the backpack from the truck, took it back to his patrol vehicle, and opened the backpack. 
    But that wasn't the end of his search. 
    He opened a nylon opaque pouch inside the backpack, and inside that found four containers. 
    Those containers were metal, opaque, lock-sealed tin cannisters, four by one by three inches. 
    He opened each of these locked containers, clip-locked containers, individually and found the contraband in question.

 Never mind just the prosecutor's point of view. 
 It seems to me if there is any sense in the exception that we've made for an inventory search, it's rationale is that the police are entitled to know what's there. 
 Now, you could say that they aren't. 
 If you want us to strike down the inventory rule entirely, that may be sensible. 
 But if you have an inventory rule, surely it doesn't make any sense unless you can find out what is there, and "what" does not consist of a nylon bag or of a tin can. 
 You want to know what is in it.

    Mr. Cary C. Lacklen 
    Clearly, the exigencies of the search of the cigarette pack in Lafayette were greater than in this case. 
    We're arguing that the Court has to balance the privacy interests that have been upheld in Chadwick and Arkansas versus Sanders against the governmental interest to learn what's inside these containers.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1858.919" stopTime="1875.531">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    The balance should be struck at a point where the government may have opened one container, but learned absolutely nothing? 
    When they opened the backpack, as Justice Scalia says, it seems to me they're no further ahead than before they opened the backpack.
speaker="cary_c_lacklen" startTime="1875.531" stopTime="1885.802">

    Mr. Cary C. Lacklen

    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    Well, but since when have we applied the less intrusive alternative to this particular kind of search?
speaker="cary_c_lacklen" startTime="1916.738" stopTime="1938.835">
    Mr. Cary C. Lacklen 
    Clearly there's language in Lafayette that says that the Court in the abstract is not going to be governed by a less intrusive alternative. 
    But I think an analysis of the cases, of the less intrusive cases cited in Opperman and in Lafayette, make it clear that that's one of the factors the Court should consider. 
    And clearly the state court in this case considered that there were less intrusive alternatives.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1938.835" stopTime="1944.489">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    Yes, but that's a correct inquiry only if the authorities support it.
speaker="cary_c_lacklen" startTime="1944.489" stopTime="1956.447">
    Mr. Cary C. Lacklen 
    I would agree, and on the facts of this case the Colorado Supreme Court found that there were less intrusive alternatives balanced against this governmental interest to find out what was in the cannister.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1956.447" stopTime="1974.610">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    Well, does that mean that every single inventory search then has this kind of ad hoc analysis? 
    I mean, that was part of the reason, I thought, for the Opperman decision and part for the Lafayette decision, was to get away from this case by case inquiry and set up some... have bright line rules that the police could follow.
speaker="cary_c_lacklen" startTime="1974.610" stopTime="2000.076">
    Mr. Cary C. Lacklen 
    We would agree, and I think our argument is that the bright line rule here should be that closed containers should not be inventoried in a situation where the police have no reason to believe or no reasonable suspicion to believe that the container contains anything dangerous. 
    The mere possibility of something dangerous or something valuable being inside a container shouldn't vitiate the Fourth Amendment interest in the sealed container.

    You can leave them in the truck and take them to a secure facility.

    I would think that there's less reason to worry about what's in the backpack when it's deposited in the station and is going to be put in a secure safe in the station than there is to worry about what's in the backpack if you're going to leave it cut on the public streets or in some lot that is easily accessible to thieves.

    Mr. Cary C. Lacklen 
    I think the problem in Lafayette, the way would analyze that case, is that the purse was in the police station and the police had an obligation to deal with it. 
    Part of our argument here is that there is no need for an inventory if... unless the defendant consents to it. 
    If the defendant says, I'll waive the inventory and waive whatever liability there may be, then the governmental interest in finding out what's in that container is minimal.

    Mr. Cary C. Lacklen 
    --Clearly, the waiver of the liability, if he would be doing that, could be done even in an intoxicated state. 
    There may be situations where the defendant is comatose or not available, as in Opperman, and clearly the police have an obligation at that point to perform their caretaking function and secure the property. 
    In this case, because of the secure nature of the storage facility, the police clearly would have been acting reasonably to store the car with the backpack in the storage facility. 
    It's clear that the interests in this case are different than the interests in Opperman and in Lafayette. 
    The balancing of those interests must be weighed in the context of what this case represents, a field inventory. 
    In this case, as was not present in Opperman, the defendant was present to make other arrangements for his truck and for the contents of the backpack. 
    Then the Court is drawing up a doctrine in this case, I think it's important, as Professor LaFave has pointed out, to be cognizant of the pretext danger of developing a doctrine where the police can avoid a Chadwick or Sanders or even a Belton and Ross analysis by delaying the search until the car or the backpack is in the hands of the impound officer. 
    This invites the police to delay their searches to bring it under the rubric of the inventory, and I think the Court has to be cognizant of the threat of abuse in this type of setting.

    Mr. Cary C. Lacklen 
    Clearly, the police can protect the defendant's Fourth Amendment privacy interests and protect their own interests against false claims or property by either storing the backpack or the container at the police station for the short period of time that someone arrested for a minor traffic offense, such as in this case, would be in custody. 
    The argument that the prosecution makes has no limits. 
    Locked containers, locked suitcases, double locked footlockers in Chadwick and Sanders, would not be taken away from the scene without being searched. 
    In order for the Court to adopt the prosecution's rationale, we wipe away the doctrine that's been carefully constructed under Lafayette, under Chadwick, Belton, Ross, Sanders. 
    This search may very well have been permissible under a Belton analysis. 
    The arresting officer said he wasn't searching incident to an arrest. 
    The trial court found he wasn't searching incident to an arrest. 
    And the prosecution has abandoned that argument both in the Colorado court and in its briefs in this court.

    Mr. Cary C. Lacklen 
    --Well, not overpark. 
    I think it's important for the Court to understand the procedural context that this case came up to this Court. 
    The trial court found that the search was unlawful under state constitutional grounds. 
    That was the only issue appealable in the interlocutory nature of this case when it reached the Colorado Supreme Court. 
    The defense was not able to argue that the trial court was wrong in its findings of law regarding pretext, and there's clearly at least the suggestion of pretext in this case. 
    Officer Reichenbach searched the backpack in this case and then took his inventory form back to the vehicle and inventoried the vehicle.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2752.401" stopTime="2761.073">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    But that's not open to us here, is it? 
    The trial court did make the finding and we're ordinarily bound by the trial court's findings of that sort.
speaker="cary_c_lacklen" startTime="2761.073" stopTime="2770.548">
    Mr. Cary C. Lacklen 
    I agree, but this Court is operating in a vacuum because that finding has never been reviewed by the Colorado Supreme Court. 
    I think that if this Court finds that this case is--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2770.548" stopTime="2779.904">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    Did you make this argument to the Colorado Supreme Court that you're making here, that they should disregard the trial court's finding that it was good faith?
speaker="cary_c_lacklen" startTime="2779.904" stopTime="2921.346">
    Mr. Cary C. Lacklen 
    --The interlocutory nature of that appeal prevented the defense from raising any findings that went against us. 
    The only findings that we can argue on interlocutory appeal in Colorado are findings that go against the DA that he certifies to the court. 
    So we were left without a remedy in the Colorado court for the findings that went against us in the state court. 
    So the pretext comes to this Court... the pretext nature of this search comes to this Court in a vacuum. 
    There has been no review of those findings of fact and law by the trial court in the Colorado Supreme Court. 
    And clearly there's evidence, at least the suggestion, of a pretextual search in this case. 
    The officer didn't start his inventory until after the search of the backpack in his police car. 
    In fact, the contents of the backpack were not even listed on the impound form. 
    They were listed on an evidence form that was filed in the case itself for the criminal case for possession of cocaine. 
    We submit to the Court that on the facts of this case the doctrine that this Court should apply is that a consent to inventory is a prerequisite for a valid inventory search. 
    That alleviates the need to balance the container issue. 
    If the Court decides to reach the container issue, we would ask the Court to fashion a doctrine that properly balances in the field inventory context, not in the automobile exception context and not in the incarceration jailhouse context, properly balances the defendant's Fourth Amendment interests that have been upheld in luggage in Chadwick and Sanders against the governmental interests... protect themselves against false claims, loss of property, or the possibility of dangerous instrumentalities. 
    The mere possibility of dangerous instrumentalities in these kind of containers clearly argues too much. 
    If you adopt the prosecution's argument, then the police can search containers in any situation, even in investigative situations such as Chadwick, because you don't know if the double-locked footlocker contains a dangerous instrumentality when you take it into your possession to store it at the police station.

    Mr. Cary C. Lacklen 
    Well, the case clearly has to be remanded to the state court, because the state court didn't rule on the state constitutional grounds on which the evidence was originally suppressed. 
    If the DA were to go back to trial today, after a reversal of the Colorado Supreme Court, he still wouldn't have any evidence, because the trial court suppressed the evidence on state constitutional grounds. 
    And we would disagree with the district attorney on the clearness of the Colorado state ruling. 
    It would be our submission that the Colorado court, although citing the Fourth Amendment, said that the Colorado constitution may exclude this evidence also. 
    And so it's not clear that the prosecution wins even if this Court issues what may be an advisory opinion on this issue to the Colorado Supreme Court.

    Yes, and we would submit that the wording of his ruling is ambiguous. 
    It's clearly not the kind of clear and adequate state around statement that we would have liked under Michigan v. Long. 
    But we think that what he says is we need not decide the issue of whether the Colorado constitution provides greater protection than the Fourth Amendment, because we find that the Fourth Amendment provides sufficient protection to hold this search unreasonable.

    It would be. 
    And all I'm suggesting is that because of the search incident to an arrest possibilities in this case, because of the pretextual vacuum of the facts regarding the regulations themselves, and because of the state, possible separate state constitutional grounds, that certiorari may have been improvidently granted in this case.

    Mr. John M. Haried 
    Several reasons. 
    One, because to prevent against the risk that the police may be falsely accused of having taken something out of the container. 
    In other words, if there were say two pieces of jewelry in the container and someone coming back later and saying, well, there was only one, or there were three when I originally gave it to the police, something like that. 
    And also for the purposes of having a line, a clear line for the police to follow, so they don't have to get into those worthy and unworthy container types of decisions.
