United States v. Stanley

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    We will hear argument next in No. 86-393, the United States versus James B. Stanley. 
    Mr. Wright, you may proceed whenever you are ready.

    Mr. Christopher J. Wright 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, in the 1950s the Army conducted tests regarding the effects of LSD, and respondent was one of the servicemen who participated in those tests. 
    He alleges that he was secretly administered LSD on four occasions in February, 1958, at the Army's chemical warfare laboratories while he was supposedly testing gas masks, and that he did not know he had been given LSD until 1975, when the Army asked him to participate in a follow-up study. 
    He alleges that he sustained mental injuries as a result of taking the drug. 
    The procedural history of this case is noteworthy because it shows that respondent gave up on both of his claims during the course of this litigation. 
    Respondent's original complaint, which alleged a claim under the Federal Tort Claims Act, was dismissed by the District Court on the basis that respondent had been injured incident to military service and the Fifth Circuit in 1981 held that that claim was barred by this Court's decision in Feres. 
    Respondent filed an amended complaint that contained an FTCA claim and a Bivens claim as well, but the District Court dismissed the FTCA claim and granted final judgment in favor of the United States. 
    Respondent did not appeal the dismissal of the FTCA.

    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    Well, Mr. Weight, when you say granted final judgment, was there ever a judgment ordered in compliance with the separate document required? 
    What is that, Rule 58?
speaker="christopher_j_wright" startTime="152.962" stopTime="200.257">
    Mr. Christopher J. Wright 
    Yes, Your Honor. 
    It is printed at Pages 54 to 55 of the appendix to our petition. 
    The judge entered... wrote an opinion which is printed at Pages 56 to 66, and then he entered this two-page order which says that 
    "there is no just reason for delay in expressly directing the entry of judgment in favor of the United States and that such relief is hereby granted. " 
    And I would like to note that "hereby granted" is printed in all capital letters. 
    That is about as plain a final judgment under Rule 54B as there can be.

    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    Well, but how about the separate instrument requirement of Rule 58?
speaker="christopher_j_wright" startTime="204.478" stopTime="208.680">
    Mr. Christopher J. Wright 
    We contend that this order is a separate document.

    You say it satisfies both those rules?

    Mr. Christopher J. Wright 
    Yes. 
    The purpose of the rule is that there should not merely be some apparently dispository language in the opinion, as there is in the opinion that is printed on Pages 56 to 66, but that there should be a separate order that complies with the rule. 
    We asked, the government asked the District Court to enter this final order pursuant to Rule 54B dismissing the United States, and the District Court did. 
    Respondent didn't appeal that dismissal as he was required to do, but instead filed a second amended complaint which is the live complaint in this case and which is printed in the--

    What does that mean? 
    Doesn't it mean there is something more to be done?
speaker="christopher_j_wright" startTime="324.084" stopTime="562.817">
    Mr. Christopher J. Wright 
    Well, we do not think that there is anything more to be done. 
    That is tracking the language of the order that the judge entered. 
    The judge said 
    "Final judgment is hereby granted. " 
    "The clerk shall enter the order. " 
    The clerk then said, 
    "Final judgment is granted, and repeated that. " 
    the clerk to enter final judgment. 
    "There was never any dispute that final judgment was entered. " 
    "In the letter that counsel for respondent wrote to the District Court after this Court's decision in Chappell v. Wallace counsel said. " 
    You entered judgment in favor of the United States in this case a few months ago. 
    "The Eleventh Circuit in this case acknowledged at the beginning of its opinion that final judgment was entered in favor of the United States. " 
    "There has simply never been any real doubt about that. " 
    "And in the face of a statement in the order saying final judgment in favor of the United States is hereby granted, we just do not think there can be any real dispute on that. " 
    "And it is further shown that respondent understood that by the fact that he filed a second amended complaint that contained Bivens claims but no FTCA claim. " 
    Then this Court issued its decision in Chappell v. Wallace and respondent wrote the letter to the District Court that we reprinted in our reply brief at the petition stage that says that counsel was 
    "ethically compelled to cite to the Court a recent Supreme Court decision which we regret to say is apparently dispositive of this case. " 
    The District Court refused to accept that concession, although it did certify its order to that effect for interlocutory appeal. 
    The Court of Appeals affirmed that decision and then, ignoring the fact that respondent had abandoned his FTCA claim, resurrected that claim as well. 
    We contend that the Court of Appeals should have dismissed respondent's Bivens claims and should not have resurrected the FTCA claim because this Court's decisions in Feres and Chappell compelled the conclusion that servicemen injured incident to military service may not pursue those sorts of claims. 
    We realize that under the result that we contend is mandated by this Court's decisions respondent is barred from challenging an Army program that was poorly conducted and that may have harmed him, but respondent is not without a remedy. 
    As we have explained in our briefs, if he was injured as a result of this program he may obtain veterans' benefits, and the Army is not vindicated by a decision holding that he may not pursue damage actions. 
    The Senate has studied the Army's LSD testing program and issued a critical report concerning that program that included instructions to the Army as to how to conduct future chemical weapons tests. 
    Concerning the final judgment entered in favor of the FTCA claim I would like to note only that the whole point of Rule 54B is to resolve a case as to certain issues or as to certain parties, and that this case was resolved in favor of the United States when respondent decided not to appeal that final judgment. 
    In addition I would like to note that the Eleventh Circuit's jurisdiction in this case was based on its acceptance for interlocutory appeal of the question certified, which was the Bivens question, and the FTCA question was clearly beyond the scope of that certified question.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="562.817" stopTime="577.961">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    Are there decisions in the Courts of Appeals as to whether or not the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals on a certified question extends only to the certified question or whether its jurisdiction extends to the whole case?
speaker="christopher_j_wright" startTime="577.961" stopTime="1041.444">
    Mr. Christopher J. Wright 
    There are such decisions. 
    We have cited a number of them. 
    It is sometimes difficult to draw precisely the line as to where the certified question ends and other matters begin, but I know of no case that would even come close to the situation here where it is an order as to another party on another claim. 
    We do not know of any case that would allow a court to extend its jurisdiction on a certified question under these facts. 
    Finally on that point I would just like to note that the Eleventh Circuit did not even appear to be aware that there was a jurisdictional problem, although we did raise that in our rehearing petition that they denied. 
    In any event, as to the FTCA claim, it is clear that that claim is barred by Feres because respondent was administered LSD incident to his military service. 
    In its 1981 decision in this case, the Fifth Circuit noted that in 1958 respondent was a master sergeant in the Army who had volunteered to participate in an official Army chemical warfare program, that the program was conducted on an Army base by and for the benefit of the Army, that respondent received military pay during the month that he participated in the program, and that he was promised a letter of commendation for his participation. 
    I might add as well that in the second amended complaint, Paragraph 11, respondent says that he was on active duty during that month. 
    No court disagreed with the conclusion that respondent was participating in this program incident to his military service, not even the Eleventh Circuit. 
    It instead held that an FTCA claim is not necessarily barred because the injury on which the claim is based occurred incident to military service. 
    We argued in Johnson, the FTCA case involving a helicopter crash that was argued in this Court in February, that this Court held in Feres shortly after the FTCA was enacted that Congress did not intend to waive sovereign immunity for torts occurring incident to military service, and that there is no reason to revisit that construction of the statute which Congress has not seen fit to alter in 37 years. 
    I will not repeat that argument today but do want to note that this case represents a significant extension of the Eleventh Circuit's erroneous decision in Johnson which distinguished Feres on the basis that the tort feasor there was a civilian air traffic controller who is not in the military chain of command but was instead employed by the Department of Transportation. 
    There is no question that the program under which respondent was administered LSD was an Army program. 
    It was developed and conducted by the Army Intelligence Board and the Army's chemical warfare laboratories where the tests were conducted. 
    While respondent has named some civilian doctors in his second amended complaint they were obviously working for the Army in this case. 
    The courts below also erred in refusing to dismiss respondent's Bivens claim. 
    The letter that counsel for respondent sent to the District Court after this Court issued its decision in Chappell v. Wallace explained that this Court 
    "held that the same principles which underlie the Feres doctrine and which require absolute immunity from an FTCA action also require immunity from a Bivens constitutional action against Federal officers. " 
    That is an accurate description of this Court's holding. 
    Except for the courts below, all of the other courts of Appeals that have considered the question have understood that this Court barred servicemen from bringing Bivens suits against their superiors and did not authorize any case by case inquiry of the sort mandated by the court below. 
    That is absolutely clear from this Court's opinion in Chappell which reversed the Ninth Circuit opinion that did not authorize the plaintiff to bring their Bivens action but instead remanded the case for application of certain tests similar to those set out in the Fifth Circuit's Mindes v. Seaman case to determine whether the plaintiffs there could proceed. 
    This Court rejected that balancing approach, holding instead that enlisted military personnel may not maintain a suit to recover damages from a superior officer for alleged constitutional violations, a holding that the District Court here described as an overbroad statement. 
    The courts below relied on this Court's statement in Chappell that military personnel are not barred from all redress in civilian courts for constitutional wrongs. 
    The courts obviously misread that statement, which was followed by citations to three cases that did not involve claims for damages. 
    As at least three other Courts of Appeals have concluded, this Court in Chappell clearly held that servicemen may not pursue Bivens actions while indicating by the statement relied on by the courts below that in some cases they may grant other sorts of relief. 
    We do not think that courts should frequently grant other sorts of relief to military personnel, but we acknowledge that this Court has left open that possibility in extreme cases. 
    Proceeding to their case by case inquiry, the courts below concluded that the concerns underlying Feres and Chappell are not relevant here because respondent was not ordered to take LSD. 
    While we do not think that any case by case inquiry is warranted, it is nevertheless clear that the courts below erred in reaching their conclusion. 
    The concerns underlying Feres are not limited to cases involving direct orders, and it is not clear where the District Court got its contrary idea. 
    This Court's decision in Feres nor this Court's decision in Shearer nor most of the Feres cases in between involved any sort of direct order. 
    This Court's made clear that the rule of Feres is based on the principle that the military is under the control of the political branches and that the judiciary should generally not review military decisions since such litigation would undermine military discipline and effectiveness. 
    This Court's decision in Shearer is particularly instructive. 
    The Court there concluded that a claim against the Army based on its alleged failure to discharge or supervise a serviceman who had previously been convicted of manslaughter would require the courts to review a decision of command and would call into question basic choices about the supervision and control of servicemen. 
    It could not be more clear that this case involves such questions. 
    The heart of respondent's claim is that the Army should not have been using servicemen to study the effects of LSD and that it made a number of mistakes in the way it conducted those tests. 
    Respondent is therefore challenging decisions of command and calling into question basic decisions made by the Army in the 1950s concerning the use of military personnel. 
    His claims are therefore barred. 
    If there are no further questions, I would like to reserve the remainder of my time. 
   
   
   
   Argument of Richard A. Kupfer
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1041.444" stopTime="1047.266">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Thank you, Mr. Wright. 
    We will hear now from you, Mr. Kupfer.
speaker="richard_a_kupfer" startTime="1047.266" stopTime="1093.295">
    Mr. Richard A. Kupfer 
    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, if the plaintiff in this case had volunteered for LSD drug testing on behalf of the Army, the government would have a much stronger argument that this was something that was incident to his military service, but that is not what happened in this case. 
    The plaintiff did not volunteer for LSD drug testing nor was he under orders to arrive at Edgewood Arsenal for LSD drug testing, nor was he even on his regular duty status for that one-month period of time that he was up at Edgewood Arsenal. 
    With the Courts indulgence, what I would like to do if I could is spend the first few minutes just discussing some of the unique facts of this particular case which I think make this case unlike any other Feres type of case which has been before this Court previously.

    Mr. Richard A. Kupfer 
    He did not volunteer for LSD drug testing. 
    He did not. 
    The plaintiff volunteered in this case for a program that was ostensibly supposed to test and develop gas masks and protective clothing. 
    That was the purpose of the program. 
    That was the lure to attract Mr. Stanley up to Edgewood Arsenal. 
    There was no compulsion for him to go up there. 
    When he did go up there they went through the charade of having him test gas masks and protective clothing, but the real purpose of this program was to unwittingly subject the plaintiff to LSD which was secretly added to his drinking water while he was up at Edgewood Arsenal.

    But he was still in the Army?
speaker="richard_a_kupfer" startTime="1287.805" stopTime="1451.597">
    Mr. Richard A. Kupfer 
    He was still in the Army, yes. 
    Now, Mr. Wright has pointed out in his brief that while he was still receiving military pay while he was up there for that one month, but a soldier who is on furlough receives military pay for one month also. 
    This Court has held in the Brooks case that a soldier on furlough is allowed to sue the government under the Federal Tort Claims Act for negligence. 
    The plaintiff in this case was given false information as to the program. 
    The dosage of LSD that he received is unknown at this point. 
    It was apparently substantial, judging from his reactions to it. 
    He experienced the usual hallucinations that a person experiences, but he had no idea what was happening to him. 
    For that one month period of time nobody told him what was happening to him. 
    When he left the Army base nobody debriefed him. 
    He went back to his active duty services. 
    He continued to have flashback recurrences on his active duty services. 
    He went for months and years doubting his own sanity but he was afraid to say anything to anybody for fear that he would be discharged from the military service. 
    The complaint alleges that... and I think the damages are important in this case because of the alternative remedy that the government alleges, which is why I am getting into the damages. 
    The complaint alleges that on one occasion in fact he even awoke late at night in a rage without any provocation, beat up his wife, and beat up his children, and threw the TV through the wall and went back to sleep and woke up again the next morning and had no recall of that event. 
    The complaint also alleges that as a result of the LSD testing he was unable to officially perform his duties in the military. 
    He would be absent without leave for period of time and would suddenly show up, and when he was questioned as to his whereabouts he couldn't, explain his whereabouts, and he was eventually reduced in rank in the military because of inefficiency. 
    I should mention that up until the drug testing he was in the Army for about seven years and had an unblemished record in the Army, and he had intended to make the military his career. 
    It was not until seven years after he retired from military service, which is 18 years after the drug testing, that he finally got a letter from Walter Reed Medical Center telling him for the first time that he had been an unwitting LSD subject back in the late 1950s, and the purpose of that letter was to solicit him to go back up to Walter Reed now to do follow-up studies of the long-range effects of LSD. 
    When he learned that he filed an administrative claims with the United States Army Claims Service. 
    Those administrative claims were denied by the Claims Service with the statement that there is no appropriation available to the Army to pay this kind of a claim, and the Army told him, if you are dissatisfied with this determination you have six months to file a lawsuit in Federal District Court, which is what he did. 
    They did not tell him go seek veterans' benefits. 
    They told him to file a lawsuit in Federal Court. 
    Now, we have alleged, to answer the question asked earlier--

    Mr. Richard A. Kupfer 
    --Everything I am telling you is either in materials that were filed with the District Court when there was an earlier summary judgment motion years ago, there were some documentary materials filed with this Court, and what I am telling you also comes out of the allegations in the complaint, so it is in the record. 
    I have indicated who we are suing in this case. 
    We are not... the complaint itself does not purport to sue superior military officers within the disciplinary context that this Court was speaking about in the Chappell versus Wallace case and on the government's motion to dismiss the complaint as the allegations of the complaint should be deemed to be true. 
    The CIA's own records about their involvement in drug testing programs in general back in the fifties were unfortunately destroyed back in 1973 pursuant to orders of the director of the CIA who is also a defendant in this lawsuit, and we have not been able to engage in discovery to any great extent in this case because the District Judge entered several orders protecting the government from discovery until we disposed of the Feres issue. 
    What we are asking at this point is the opportunity to go back to District Court and to prove the allegations that we are making in our complaint. 
    It is our position that this case falls outside of the typical Feres factual paradigm is the phrase that was used by the Eleventh Circuit in this case, and that this is not the type of claim that would require the judicial involvement into a sensitive military issues at the expense of military discipline. 
    The very worst fact that we have to deal with in this case is that this program, whoever implemented the program, occurred on an Army base, and there is no dispute about that. 
    Edgewood Arsenal is an Army base. 
    But this Court held in the Shearer case that the site of the incident is not nearly as important as whether the case, taking the case in a complete perspective, whether that case requires a civilian court to second guess the wisdom of military decisions, and this Court said that Feres today is best explained by the military discipline rationale, and that can't be reduced to just a few bright lines rules as to whether an incident occurred on an Army base or off of an Army case. 
    Now, the lower courts in this case, both the District Court and the Circuit Court of Appeals, have held that this is clearly not just your garden variety Feres type of case. 
    The facts of this case read like they have been lifted out of a novel by George Orwell where even a person's own creative thought process is tinkered with by the government, and altered, and controlled by the government, and we believe that the Constitution of the United States if it guarantees anything surely guarantees the right of all Americans to control their own mind and to control their own intellectual thought process and the content of their own bloodstream. 
    That is where these constitutional claims come from.

    That would have made a substantial amount of difference because then you wouldn't have a violation of the Nuremberg Code, because you wouldn't have an unwitting test subject. 
    You would have a soldier who was then volunteering for what he understands to be a program to test LSD drugs.

    --I say this is it. 
    I say this is it, and I think that by finding an estoppel in this case, Number One, you would not be undermining the viability of the Feres doctrine in general because this is a very limited case. 
    You would not be opening up a floodgate for other litigants, only those litigants that are similarly situation to Mr. Stanley, and if this program had been what it was described to be, if it had been really a program to test gas masks and protective clothing, and if Mr. Stanley had been injured inhaling fumes from a gas mask, then again the government would have a much better argument that this was incident to his military service, this is what he volunteered for, but when we say that when the government intentionally misleads its own servicemen to volunteer for one kind of a program and that is not the program that he is really volunteering for, that the government should be estopped to argue that this is something that is incident to his military service. 
    At any rate, we think the circumstances of this case do not involve the type of close military judgment calls that the Feres doctrine was really designed to insulate from review, and we don't believe that the prosecution of this claim would undermine the disciplinary structure of the military to allow it to proceed. 
    As far as the Bivens action, even if the Feres doctrine does preclude our claim against the government it would not necessarily preclude the Constitutional claim against the individual defendants. 
    The government relies upon Chappell versus Wallace.

    Mr. Richard A. Kupfer 
    Yes, this is the... I am getting to the Bivens argument now, Your Honor. 
    This case is much different than the Chappell or Chappell case. 
    The Chappell case involved soldiers who were clearly superior military officers who were on board a Navy combat vessel along with the plaintiffs, and they were being sued specifically for making certain command decisions and taking certain disciplinary actions that were alleged to be racially motivated. 
    Now, those facts are radically different from the facts that we have involved in this case, and this Court in Chappell specifically cautioned that the opinion should not be read to mean that military personnel are barred from seeking all redress in the civil courts for all kinds of constitutional violations that they may suffer in the course of military service. 
    I think a fair reading of the Chappell case would lead the Court to believe that was really intended to be limited to the facts that were before this Court in that case. 
    Now, the government here says that this case could involve an inquiry somehow into military decisionmaking somewhere along the line, maybe there was some military decisionmaking involved here, but if you accept that, if that alone precludes a Bivens action, then what you are saying is that no matter what kind of a wrongful act is perpetrated on an active duty serviceman, the individual defendants can always remain immune simply by asserting that their act was the result of military decisionmaking. 
    Boom, they are immune.

    Mr. Richard A. Kupfer 
    I think if it involves a potential estoppel situation it should. 
    I think that is where you should draw the line. 
    There has to be... unless you draw the line no place then surely... then the situation that you are left with is that there is no, absolutely no limit to the immunity doctrine without an arbitrary line some place, and a line doesn't have to be so arbitrary, I think, when you have facts like this. 
    I think when Federal officers willfully and knowingly violate the constitutional rights of active duty servicemen, to say that there is absolute immunity in that type of a situation, Number One, that is not going to promote discipline in the military. 
    The whole purpose of the Feres doctrine is to promote discipline.

    --I don't know that there has been a case of intentional beating up of an inferior officer to test that, but I do think this. 
    I think that when you consider the purpose of the Feres doctrine, which is to maintain discipline, okay, and you say that superior officers can do anything they want to active duty servicemen, and they need never fear of being held accountable for damages in the civil justice system, that is not going to promote discipline in the military.

    Mr. Richard A. Kupfer 
    --I think if you allow those kind of claims to go forward I don't think it will disrupt discipline. 
    In fact, I think it will promote discipline because then inferior servicemen, enlisted men can then obey military orders without any fear that there is going to be some kind of undetected harm that is going to befall them, like swallowing LSD. 
    I think you have got to look at the facts of the case. 
    I think you have to consider discipline not only at the level of the enlisted man, but I think you need to consider discipline at the higher echelon levels of the government as well. 
    The government's interpretation, strict interpretation of the Chappell doctrine would also mean that an American servicemen like Mr. Stanley, a sergeant in the Army, would be actually reduced to a position inferior, even to a convicted and incarcerated Federal prisoner who is allowed to bring an FTCA action and a Bivens action against prison officials.

    Mr. Richard A. Kupfer 
    --Well, this is not just a matter of artful pleading in a case like this. 
    We... this obviously he was given LSD. 
    Nobody accidentally dropped LSD in his drinking water. 
    He was intentionally given LSD. 
    And according to the... and he was intentionally denied the knowledge that he was given LSD. 
    I guess artful pleading cases would have to be separated from the true intentional tort cases or intentional constitutional violation cases. 
    But I think that when you have a situation like this where there also is no adequate remedy by veterans' benefits... if I could just one spend one moment on that, the government has indicated that they think that veterans' benefits in this case would be an adequate alternative remedy, and therefore that is another reason why he shouldn't be able to sue. 
    You need... it is necessary to consider the type of injury that has been done here. 
    Mr. Stanley alleges that he has been deprived of some of his most basic constitutional rights, including the right to control his own mind and his own behavior and the right to control his own intellectual thought process. 
    He suffered mental anguish for all the years that he thought he was going crazy. 
    He suffered the disruption of his Army career. 
    His family and marriage has been dissolved and broken down. 
    There are no veterans' benefits that can compensate for these kinds of injuries. 
    Veterans' benefits will also not serve a deterrent purpose, which is one of the most important purposes behind the Bivens action, is to discourage this type of shocking abuse of power by Federal officials. 
    Veterans' benefits do not do that. 
    At this stage it is almost 30 years after those 1958 drug experiments. 
    About the only thing that veterans' benefits could do for Mr. Stanley now maybe is pay for any future psychiatric care that he might need, but he is not having flashbacks any more. 
    That will be nil. 
    Veterans' benefits will not do anything for him. 
    In the Chappell case this Court found that the administrative remedies would be adequate again. 
    In that case those plaintiffs were saying that they were discriminated against and this Court found that they could administratively receive pay increases and retroactive pay increase and promotions and they could receive everything administratively that they were asking for in the civil lawsuit. 
    You also said on the same day that Chappell was decided in Bush versus Lucas that before an alternative remedy is considered to be a special factor militating against allowing a Bivens action, it should at least provide meaningful remedies for a plaintiff, meaningful remedies. 
    We have no meaningful remedies provided in this case. 
    The VA, the Veterans Benefits Act is not... was never meant by Congress to be an exclusive remedy. 
    There is no exclusive remedy provision. 
    In fact, that Act expressly recognizes the possibility of double recovery because there is a provision in the Veterans' Act which provides a method for offsetting cumulative recoveries, and this Court held in the Brooks case and the Brown case that a veteran who receives VA benefits is still not necessarily precluded from suing. 
    One important point in conclusion also is that in a Bivens action defendants are always entitled to raise a qualified immunity. 
    If they say they acted in good faith and if they reasonably believed their conduct to be lawful, just like in a civil rights case, then they are immune, but if this Court gives these defendants under these kind of facts an absolute immunity for the act that they have done, no matter... the message will be that no matter what a serviceman does to a lower echelon servicemen, they need never fear of being brought into the civil justice system, and I think that after all the progress that has been made since Bivens in the last 15 years with Bivens and Carlson versus Green and United States versus Muniz and so on, to recognize an absolute immunity from liability in an egregious case like this would be a step in the wrong direction, and we ask this Court to affirm the Eleventh Circuit's decision. 
    Thank you.

    We have been faced with something of a moving target on the facts here, and I would just like to quote from the second amended complaint which is reprinted in the joint appendix that in Paragraph 11 on Page 6 says that respondent was 14 says that the defendants were acting under color of a covert Federal Army program, and that it was the official policy that is responsible for the deprivation of his rights. 
    We take that to mean that this was an Army program. 
    We do not think that there is any real question that it was an Army program, and respondent has--

    Yes. 
    There is no question about that. 
    Concerning the volunteer point, I would like to mention only that we have returned to a prior stage. 
    The Fifth Circuit discussed respondent's volunteer point in its 1981 opinion in the portion reprinted at Pages 72 to 74 of the appendix to the petition, and we think that makes it perfectly clear that the fact that he was or wasn't a volunteer, I am not sure exactly what respondent's point is, doesn't matter in this case. 
    As a final point, an estoppel argument was raised in respondent's argument. 
    That has never been raised in this case at any point before, including the briefs in this Court.

    I am not sure that an intentional tort of the sort somebody hit somebody has actually come up. 
    Chappell v. Wallace, I suppose race discrimination is a form of intentional tort although it is not your run of the mill form of intentional tort.
