Board of Airport Commissioners of the City of Los Angeles v. Jews for Jesus, Inc.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="0.000" stopTime="14.605">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    We will hear arguments first this morning in No. 86-104, Board of Airport Commissioners of the City of Los Angeles versus Jews for Jesus and others. 
    Mr. Kapel, you may proceed whenever you're ready.
speaker="james_r_kapel" startTime="14.605" stopTime="61.617">
    Mr. James R. Kapel 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    This case involves whether the Board of Airport Commissioners legally have restricted the uses of their terminal facilities to their intended airport related purposes only, or whether they must allow the Jews for Jesus and others to use those facilities for their own particular non-airport-related activities. 
    The determinative issues in this case is whether the interiors of the terminal facilities at the Los Angeles International Airport are public forums or nonpublic forums. 
    That issue is determinative because it defines the standard that should be applied when reviewing the Board's policy limiting the uses of the terminal facilities.

    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Mr. Kapel, may I ask a preliminary question or two? 
    There was a resolution passed by the airport board, whatever it's called.
speaker="james_r_kapel" startTime="72.909" stopTime="75.032">
    Mr. James R. Kapel 
    Yes, the Board of Airport Commissioners.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="75.032" stopTime="80.561">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Was that resolution binding without city council approval?
speaker="james_r_kapel" startTime="80.561" stopTime="90.089">
    Mr. James R. Kapel 
    It is binding without city council approval. 
    It does not have a criminal penalty associated with it without the city council approval. 
    So it is a rule--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="90.089" stopTime="92.401">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Has the city council ever approved it in fact?
speaker="james_r_kapel" startTime="92.401" stopTime="106.456">
    Mr. James R. Kapel 
    --No, it has not been presented to the city council. 
    The Board of Airport Commissioners has the power and ability to adopt rules and regulations regarding the use of the airport. 
    They cannot adopt criminal penalties.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="106.456" stopTime="118.452">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    And in another preliminary inquiry, would the airport be a public forum under California constitutional law?
speaker="james_r_kapel" startTime="118.452" stopTime="128.728">
    Mr. James R. Kapel 
    No, I don't believe so. 
    Under California constitutional law, I believe it tracks very closely the federal law in this case. 
    There are some distinctions.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="128.728" stopTime="133.930">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    How about the Hoffman case making a railroad terminal a public forum?
speaker="james_r_kapel" startTime="133.930" stopTime="144.441">
    Mr. James R. Kapel 
    In that case there was no indication that the owner of the property ever attempted to restrict the uses of the terminal facilities. 
    In addition, as a--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="144.441" stopTime="148.299">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Was the state law point argued in the courts below?
speaker="james_r_kapel" startTime="148.299" stopTime="151.266">
    Mr. James R. Kapel 
    --Yes, it was argued. 
    Neither court addressed those issues.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="151.266" stopTime="152.594">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Thank you.
speaker="lewis_f_powell_jr" startTime="152.594" stopTime="161.809">
    Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. 
    May I ask a question before you proceed, Mr. Kapel? 
    Has this ordinance ever been enforced against anyone?
speaker="james_r_kapel" startTime="161.809" stopTime="162.699">
    Mr. James R. Kapel 
    Yes.
speaker="lewis_f_powell_jr" startTime="162.699" stopTime="163.731">
    Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. 
    Specifically?
speaker="james_r_kapel" startTime="163.731" stopTime="181.582">
    Mr. James R. Kapel 
    Yes. 
    It has been enforced from the standpoint that police officers have informed people and requested people to leave, and people have left. 
    The police officers have escorted people out of the buildings and onto the sidewalks.
speaker="lewis_f_powell_jr" startTime="181.582" stopTime="183.909">
    Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. 
    When people have not left, have they been prosecuted?
speaker="james_r_kapel" startTime="183.909" stopTime="206.182">
    Mr. James R. Kapel 
    They have not been prosecuted. 
    The challenge to this case, and the district court hearing, because of that, the Board continued enforcing its policy; however until the constitutionality was decided, the city attorney's office has not taken injunctive action against the people that violated the policy.
speaker="lewis_f_powell_jr" startTime="206.182" stopTime="208.041">
    Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. 
    So this is a facial challenge?
speaker="james_r_kapel" startTime="208.041" stopTime="209.119">
    Mr. James R. Kapel 
    Yes, it is.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="209.119" stopTime="230.687">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    That means, I take it, that if we disagree with you that it is a public... if we disagree with you that it's a public forum, what result should accrue?
speaker="james_r_kapel" startTime="230.687" stopTime="236.716">
    Mr. James R. Kapel 
    I believe that the determinative issue is the public forum issue.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="236.716" stopTime="242.338">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Suppose we're worried about the allegations of unequal enforcement of it?
speaker="james_r_kapel" startTime="242.338" stopTime="243.682">
    Mr. James R. Kapel 
    Excuse me, I'm sorry?
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="243.682" stopTime="259.504">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Suppose we're worried about the allegations of unequal enforcement, the Christian Science reading room, for example, and the advertisement about environmental matters that are alleged to have been in the airport. 
    That issue is not before us?
speaker="james_r_kapel" startTime="259.504" stopTime="309.875">
    Mr. James R. Kapel 
    I don't believe that issue is before you, because I believe both of those matters are airport-related matters, or matters the Board could determine were airport related. 
    The Christian Science reading room sounds very bad. 
    However, the issue with regard to our resolution is not the name of the tenant, but the purpose or the activity they're conducting within the terminal buildings. 
    If the Christian Science reading room were merely a religious activity and did not provide an airport related activity, it would not be permitted. 
    If United Airlines wished to conduct a non-airport-related activity, it would not be permitted.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="309.875" stopTime="331.224">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    What I'm asking is, do we have to reach that? 
    Suppose we find, as you want us to find, that this is not... that this is not a public forum, but suppose we're also concerned that the rules against First Amendment activity have not been applied even-handedly. 
    What should our disposition be?
speaker="james_r_kapel" startTime="331.224" stopTime="352.716">
    Mr. James R. Kapel 
    If you find that there has been viewpoint discrimination, where the Board has picked improperly and decided that an activity is airport related when it fact it isn't, then I believe our resolution should not be enforced until we remedied that situation.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="352.716" stopTime="354.543">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    And we can make that determination here.
speaker="james_r_kapel" startTime="354.543" stopTime="356.700">
    Mr. James R. Kapel 
    Yes, I believe you can.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="356.700" stopTime="359.901">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Did the lower court base its decision in part on that?
speaker="james_r_kapel" startTime="359.901" stopTime="370.600">
    Mr. James R. Kapel 
    No. 
    The lower district court found that the airport terminal facilities were public forums. 
    They did not specifically indicate traditional or otherwise. 
    The Ninth Circuit--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="370.600" stopTime="373.363">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    So we wouldn't have to... and the Ninth Circuit did the same?
speaker="james_r_kapel" startTime="373.363" stopTime="376.737">
    Mr. James R. Kapel 
    --That's correct. 
    They found that it was a traditional public forum.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="376.737" stopTime="383.141">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    So if we're worried about these other matters, we could remand and let them decide whether there's been unequal enforcement, couldn't we?
speaker="james_r_kapel" startTime="383.141" stopTime="384.516">
    Mr. James R. Kapel 
    Yes, you could.
speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="384.516" stopTime="403.805">
    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    Counsel, is your position one of all or nothing, that it either is a traditional public forum or it is not? 
    Do you have any room at all for what the Court has recognized in some cases, a limited public forum status?
speaker="james_r_kapel" startTime="403.805" stopTime="452.973">
    Mr. James R. Kapel 
    There is room for that in this case. 
    However, I believe that it is not necessary to reach that. 
    I believe the non-public-forum issue is determinative. 
    There is no question that speech occurs within the terminal. 
    And there is no question that there are information boards and things like that. 
    Again, those activities, whether they be speech or nonspeech, are airport related and necessary for the operation of the airport. 
    To allow information, so long as the Board limits it to that information that is needed by the travelling public in their travels, I believe it's airport related and permissible in a nonpublic forum.
speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="452.973" stopTime="472.106">
    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    Of course, you have presented nothing by way of evidence to counter-balance the thing. 
    It seems to me you're taking an all or nothing position here. 
    And if you lose, maybe we can't take an intermediate way out, as we have done in some cases.
speaker="james_r_kapel" startTime="472.106" stopTime="474.182">
    Mr. James R. Kapel 
    That's true.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="474.182" stopTime="492.223">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    May I ask, you said airport related, and you said, things needed by the traveller. 
    You don't define airport related in terms of necessity, that everything there is absolutely necessary for the traveller. 
    You don't need a Christian Science reading room. 
    Maybe it helps, but... is that your test?
speaker="james_r_kapel" startTime="492.223" stopTime="502.642">
    Mr. James R. Kapel 
    The test is airport related, and it is what the Board has determined aids the travelling public in their travels. 
    The Board has--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="502.642" stopTime="503.970">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    But not necessary for the traveller?
speaker="james_r_kapel" startTime="503.970" stopTime="512.779">
    Mr. James R. Kapel 
    --Not absolutely necessary. 
    Clearly it would be possible to operate an airline terminal without food.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="512.779" stopTime="515.042">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    And without a Christian Science reading room.
speaker="james_r_kapel" startTime="515.042" stopTime="516.337">
    Mr. James R. Kapel 
    It is not necessary to board an airplane.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="516.337" stopTime="534.644">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    However, if it's something like the reading room that provides a place to sit while you're waiting for planes, and maybe to obtain peace of mind before you get up in the storm, or something like that, why wouldn't the literature that is passed out by these people perhaps serve some airport related function?
speaker="james_r_kapel" startTime="534.644" stopTime="552.605">
    Mr. James R. Kapel 
    The reading room provides a waiting area that is the same as any other waiting area in the terminal facilities. 
    It's in a little different location, and someone other than the airport is paying for it. 
    People read magazines in that reading room just as they do in any of the waiting rooms.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="552.605" stopTime="558.196">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Well, but they read newspapers, which is something to pass the time and occupy the traveller and perhaps give him peace of mind.
speaker="james_r_kapel" startTime="558.196" stopTime="558.728">
    Mr. James R. Kapel 
    Absolutely.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="558.728" stopTime="564.287">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Why wouldn't reading the literature that these people pass out be airport related in the same sense as reading a newspaper is?
speaker="james_r_kapel" startTime="564.287" stopTime="569.224">
    Mr. James R. Kapel 
    I believe reading the literature would be. 
    However, the activity of passing it out--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="569.224" stopTime="573.159">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Well, why is that any different than passing... than offering it for sale by the news vendor?
speaker="james_r_kapel" startTime="573.159" stopTime="586.029">
    Mr. James R. Kapel 
    --I think it is different, because the Board of Airport Commissioners has determined that a certain amount of space within the terminal should be devoted to loading gates; a certain amount to newstands; a certain amount to--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="586.029" stopTime="607.224">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Well, but could they then, just as they have... and consistently with the general policy decide, this is good health literature that will help the passenger be comfortable if there's a thunderstorm or something; we ought to set aside an area of 10 square feet and let them have a booth to pass it out, just like the Christian Science people can pass out Mary Baker Eddy's writings?
speaker="james_r_kapel" startTime="607.224" stopTime="621.014">
    Mr. James R. Kapel 
    --Well, the Board of Airport Commissioners does not decide what literature is made available within the terminals. 
    That is up to the concessionaire, or to any lessee that is in the terminal who has leased space for that purpose.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="621.014" stopTime="635.321">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    No, I understand. 
    But wouldn't it be consistent with the policy, couldn't they have come... I'm not suggesting they must... but could they consistently with the policy have said, we think this is good literature that would be helpful for the passengers to read instead of Time Magazine or Science and Health or whatever else it might be?
speaker="james_r_kapel" startTime="635.321" stopTime="659.624">
    Mr. James R. Kapel 
    Clearly they could come to us and do that. 
    And clearly they could lease space just like the Christian Science reading room has, if they were willing to provide a waiting area, and were not just there to hand out their pamphlets. 
    If they were providing an airport related service, a waiting area, they could have leased space like anyone else; they could easily--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="659.624" stopTime="670.213">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Yes, but you keep going to the waiting area. 
    But isn't the reading activity that the newspaper offered, isn't that also airport related in the same sense, that it's something the traveller wants to do.
speaker="james_r_kapel" startTime="670.213" stopTime="671.197">
    Mr. James R. Kapel 
    --That's correct.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="671.197" stopTime="676.601">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Why isn't it equally conceivable that travellers might want to read the literature of the Jews for Jesus?
speaker="james_r_kapel" startTime="676.601" stopTime="684.443">
    Mr. James R. Kapel 
    They may well wish to read it, and they're welcome to bring that in the terminals and read it in the terminals or anywhere in the airport.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="684.443" stopTime="691.721">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Are the news people allowed to hawk their newspapers by walking around in the terminal selling them?
speaker="james_r_kapel" startTime="691.721" stopTime="699.515">
    Mr. James R. Kapel 
    Absolutely not. 
    The news and gift concession is from fixed locations which the Board has decided were appropriate.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="699.515" stopTime="709.322">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    But that isn't how your ordinance reads. 
    I mean, that isn't the limitation. 
    The limitation isn't for the conduct of First Amendment activities by walking around the terminal, is it?
speaker="james_r_kapel" startTime="709.322" stopTime="710.494">
    Mr. James R. Kapel 
    No, it is not.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="710.494" stopTime="712.258">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    What specifically is prohibited?
speaker="james_r_kapel" startTime="712.258" stopTime="714.898">
    Mr. James R. Kapel 
    Non-airport-related activities.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="714.898" stopTime="734.766">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    So I'm a Congressman flying from Washington to Hawaii, and I have to transfer planes in Los Angeles. 
    I make an appointment with an aide to talk over some national issues, and I say, let's meet inside the airport, and we want to talk over the pros and cons of some national issues. 
    That's in violation of the ordinance?
speaker="james_r_kapel" startTime="734.766" stopTime="749.932">
    Mr. James R. Kapel 
    Absolutely not. 
    Conversation is not prohibited. 
    The activities conducted within the terminal facilities is what the Board is trying to prohibit. 
    The Board does not have a limitation on a person's speech saying that the only speech--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="749.932" stopTime="765.738">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Speech is not an activity? 
    What is an activity? 
    Suppose that the representatives of Jews for Jesus just stand there and they do nothing but speak, they don't even pass out anything; they just speak, just the way I would be speaking to the Congressman?
speaker="james_r_kapel" startTime="765.738" stopTime="768.361">
    Mr. James R. Kapel 
    --I don't believe there would be any problem with that.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="768.361" stopTime="774.046">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Oh really? 
    It's only the passing out of the literature that's the problem?
speaker="james_r_kapel" startTime="774.046" stopTime="787.619">
    Mr. James R. Kapel 
    I believe conversations are not a problem. 
    If someone were to hold a rally in there with 200 people, I believe that would be an activity that would not be airport related, and would be in violation.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="787.619" stopTime="790.821">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    I couldn't give the Congressman a piece of paper.

speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="795.209" stopTime="804.784">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well, isn't the ordinance designed in part to prevent obstruction of the passage of people along the concourses on the way to the planes, and coming out from the planes?
speaker="james_r_kapel" startTime="804.784" stopTime="854.232">
    Mr. James R. Kapel 
    Of course. 
    The ordinance here was adopted because the Board of Airport Commissioners had a choice as to how they operate their facility, assuming it's not a traditional public forum. 
    They could limit it to the official business of the airport, or they could open the facility for all types of activities, and adopt a time, place and manner restriction. 
    They chose the former option, to limit it to the official business of the airport. 
    Granted, activities occur within the facility between individuals which are not directly airport related. 
    But those activities occur in every building. 
    And if the mere fact that those activities did it, every building would be a public forum; every government building.

    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Is there anything in the record to show exactly what they do?

    Is that in the record?
speaker="james_r_kapel" startTime="865.742" stopTime="900.746">
    Mr. James R. Kapel 
    It is in the record from the standpoint that the city has stipulated that the Jews for Jesus, the individual who brought this lawsuit, was not interfering with the travelling public, and was not grabbing onto anybody. 
    However, the offensiveness of his activity I don't believe is the issue here. 
    The real issue here is, can the Board exercise its option to reserve the facility to only those activities that directly aid the travelling public in their travel.

    Mr. James R. Kapel 
    Because we are trying to control the uses of the interiors of the terminal facilities. 
    The mere fact that it is not wrong does not mean that it is airport related and is the best use of the terminal facilities.

    The resolution.

    Mr. James R. Kapel 
    However, the resolution is not something new. 
    The resolution came about in order to address the interaction between protected activities and the Board's longstanding policies of limiting the airport to its intended purposes. 
    The airport had a number of requests from a wide variety of people. 
    The people that ignored the Board's policy were claiming the right to ignore that policy because of the First Amendment. 
    Therefore the resolution was directly to address that. 
    And it reaffirmed the policy.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1121.671" stopTime="1141.086">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Correct. 
    But the conduct that is prohibited by the resolution is, quote, First Amendment activities, unquote, as I read it. 
    Of any individual or any... engages in First Amendment activities and so forth, he's directed... the city attorney to institute appropriate litigation. 
    But does the ordinance define the term... or the resolution define the term, First Amendment activities?
speaker="james_r_kapel" startTime="1141.086" stopTime="1143.428">
    Mr. James R. Kapel 
    No, it does not.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1143.428" stopTime="1158.343">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Does that mean that if, for example, one of these people wore... carried a sign, say they were a sandwich, you know, one of these wooden signs, that said, Jews for Jesus, whatever their message might be. 
    Would that... that would violate it, I suppose?
speaker="james_r_kapel" startTime="1158.343" stopTime="1159.562">
    Mr. James R. Kapel 
    I believe it would violate it.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1159.562" stopTime="1167.309">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    And I take it if a political candidate came in and said, vote for Joe Smith, carried a banner or something like that, that would violate it?
speaker="james_r_kapel" startTime="1167.309" stopTime="1169.776">
    Mr. James R. Kapel 
    The Board has denied that before, yes.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1169.776" stopTime="1177.539">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    So that would... and what if he just spoke out loud and went around shaking hands with people? 
    That would be against the resolution... a candidate?
speaker="james_r_kapel" startTime="1177.539" stopTime="1186.817">
    Mr. James R. Kapel 
    I believe that's a closer question.

speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1186.817" stopTime="1196.828">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    So basically, whatever the First Amendment protects, the resolution prohibits? 
    It's how it reads.

speaker="james_r_kapel" startTime="1205.950" stopTime="1244.466">
    Mr. James R. Kapel 
    --You do have a First Amendment right. 
    The resolution doesn't focus on First Amendment as prohibiting it. 
    The resolution allows First Amendment activities on the sidewalk area. 
    Non-airport-related commercial activities would not be permitted on the sidewalk areas, the exteriors. 
    The Board addressed the interaction of the First Amendment protected activities with its policy by allowing those activities to occur on the sidewalks. 
    Other non-airport-related activities are not permitted to occur on the sidewalk.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1244.466" stopTime="1251.385">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Now let me just be sure I understand. 
    The sidewalk you refer to is the external sidewalk. 
    If you want from United to American outside, where you take the bus, that's okay.
speaker="james_r_kapel" startTime="1251.385" stopTime="1251.979">
    Mr. James R. Kapel 
    Outside of the terminal facilities.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1251.979" stopTime="1257.775">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    But if you walk on your internal, where you walk about half a mile down these alleys, that's prohibited in there, isn't it?

    Mr. James R. Kapel 
    Yes, it is.

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    You know I guess what we're talking about is overbreadth problems. 
    That's not the basis on which the court below went. 
    But don't you see some problems of overbreadth here, just banning all First Amendment activity?
speaker="james_r_kapel" startTime="1274.627" stopTime="1298.570">
    Mr. James R. Kapel 
    If there are any problems with overbreadth, the problems would come up in terms of determining what First Amendment activities would be allowed on the sidewalk areas, or would not... would be permitted on the sidewalk areas. 
    I don't believe there are any overbreadth problems with regard to airport-related activities.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="1298.570" stopTime="1326.261">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Well, clearly there are. 
    I mean, the language of the resolution is very simple. 
    It says that the central terminal area is not open for First Amendment activities by any individual or entity. 
    And that covers the good morning to the person next to you, under the literal terms of it. 
    There is absolutely no attempt to define it in this resolution, is there?
speaker="james_r_kapel" startTime="1326.261" stopTime="1349.580">
    Mr. James R. Kapel 
    There is not an attempt to define First Amendment activities within the resolution. 
    There is an attempt to define airport-related activities. 
    The Board of Airport Commissioners has not prohibited speech within the terminals. 
    I think it's impractical to think they could.

    Mr. James R. Kapel 
    --That's correct. 
    Speech is a protected activity. 
    Speech happens, occurs, in every public building there is. 
    I don't believe the fact that speech occurs or that people read newspapers within a building requires the government to open that building to all types of expressive activities.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="1408.805" stopTime="1432.517">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    But you haven't banned... you haven't banned just some types. 
    I mean, that's the problem. 
    If you read it, you've banned all types. 
    But again, maybe your point is that that's not what's before us. 
    That that's an overbreadth problem, and all we have before us is a decision below that says that this is a public forum, and you have to allow all types. 
    And that even if it weren't overbroad it would be no good. 
    Is that--
speaker="james_r_kapel" startTime="1432.517" stopTime="1433.267">
    Mr. James R. Kapel 
    That is correct.

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    --That's what I thought.
speaker="james_r_kapel" startTime="1434.155" stopTime="1531.804">
    Mr. James R. Kapel 
    I think the public forum, nonpublic forum, issue is definitely the issue before you. 
    The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals and the respondents have claimed that the interiors are traditional public forums, and therefore, all types of speech can only be restricted by a time, place and manner restriction. 
    They've cited among other things there's unrestricted public access into the terminals, and the fact that people read or converse in the terminals. 
    They also claim that there is some sort of preferential treatment for commercial activities because commercial speech, in a limited context, has been permitted in the terminals. 
    These arguments, I believe, fail to recognize the nature and purpose of LAX, that is, its airport-related purposes; and also fails to recognize that the government has the right to reserve their facilities under their control to their official business. 
    The commercial activities and the commercial speech that occurs within the terminals are all airport related.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1531.804" stopTime="1563.510">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    May I ask you one other question? 
    Some airports, out in front of the airport, they do have a covered area, so you're sheltered from the rain, and there may even be kind of like a tunnel where you drive in. 
    Supposing the airport decided to make its sidewalks outside part of the airport by appropriate constructive devices, and decided to extend the ban to the outside sidewalks... what are now outside sidewalks as well? 
    I suppose your theory would be the same, that they could do that, couldn't they?
speaker="james_r_kapel" startTime="1563.510" stopTime="1574.614">
    Mr. James R. Kapel 
    Although that's not the issue here, I think there are... I think the Board would have a right to do so. 
    I think there is precedent for that.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1574.614" stopTime="1588.531">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    And they could probably include the parking lot, too. 
    It's a big area. 
    It's all devoted to airport function, and the driveways up to it. 
    Everything inside the sign that says, you are now entering Los Angeles Airport or whatever it is.
speaker="james_r_kapel" startTime="1588.531" stopTime="1600.808">
    Mr. James R. Kapel 
    I believe certain cases like Greef v. Spock and so forth would support that. 
    The Board has not done that. 
    I believe they've attempted to show a sensitivity to First Amendment activities by permitting them within the airport.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1600.808" stopTime="1604.541">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    You mean outside the airport. 
    By permitting it outside the airport?

    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Well, I still don't understand how you keep saying that the airport permitted you to do it outside. 
    They haven't a blame thing to do with outside. 
    They're not doing any great favor by letting you do it someplace else. 
    Am I right or wrong?
speaker="james_r_kapel" startTime="1630.342" stopTime="1656.096">
    Mr. James R. Kapel 
    I believe there's an argument that could be made that the airport is not integrated into the open streets and parks of a municipality; that the sidewalk areas inside the terminal areas, even though they are exterior sidewalks, are not identical to those that were involved in U.S. v. Grace. 
    So therefore I believe the Board would have the power--

    Mr. Jay Alan Sekulow 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    Local governments have important responsibilities concerning their efficient operation of airports under their control. 
    However, the record in this case is clear. 
    There is no justification for a sweeping ban on First Amendment activities which would subordinate cherished First Amendment freedoms. 
    In fact, four circuit courts and numerous district courts have determined that airport terminals are public fora. 
    The petitioners, throughout their argument--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="1737.408" stopTime="1744.093">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    You mean just generally that any airport... any airport that's open to the public is a public forum?

    Mr. Jay Alan Sekulow 
    --Your Honor, we have couched our argument that... a major airport terminal. 
    The designation "major" is not really regarding the amount of people that would seek access.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="1752.199" stopTime="1763.288">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    And you would say that nothing that the city could do could... could close it, or to... or to put it in a category other than a public forum?

    Mr. Jay Alan Sekulow

    Jews for Jesus has been distributing religious literature for over 12 years now.

    Mr. Jay Alan Sekulow 
    --Considering the length of the history of the airport itself, that period of time is substantial. 
    We would further argue for a history in this case one looking at transportation centers generally. 
    City gates... we've argued this in our brief... the city gates, from the period of scripture, have been places where people have come to hear ideas. 
    It later moved to railroads, the waterfront, and now airport terminals. 
    Our position is that--

    And they'd all assemble there and sit down in the dining room and eat a piece of mutton or something.

    Assume for the moment that the airport adopted a resolution that permitted that type of literature, or any type of literature, for example, to be disseminated from the equivalent of a newsstand.

    There may be situations where limiting it to a booth... I'm not talking about a rental space, for instance, but a booth, storefront type of situation... might be appropriate in a given forum. 
    In this particular case, however, the record is totally devoid of any evidence of harrassment. 
    Missionaries with Jews for Jesus had been distributing gospel literature at the airport for over 12 years.

    Mr. Jay Alan Sekulow 
    --Well, the airport has taken... of course, have taken the position that they have said that. 
    However, it is that the accommodating purpose, the contemplation of being able to hand out or distribute religious literature in this case, where it does not at all interfere with the efficient operation of that facility.

    Mr. Jay Alan Sekulow 
    Your Honor, our position is that it's really not. 
    In the line of cases that this Court has determined, that compatibility has been the threshold. 
    Without the compatibility, there is obvious problems. 
    Our position is that LAX is both a traditional public forum and one that has been open.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="2278.424" stopTime="2293.356">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    I thought the rule was that when it is a public forum, you must allow those activities to the extent they're compatible with the other things occurring in that public forum. 
    But you're converting that to a rule that if there is a compatible activity, it's a public forum?
speaker="jay_alan_sekulow" startTime="2293.356" stopTime="2306.070">
    Mr. Jay Alan Sekulow 
    Your Honor, our position is that the compatibility is, does the First Amendment activity substantially interfere with the primary purpose of the public forum. 
    Streets' primary purposes are not the distribution--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="2306.070" stopTime="2316.877">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    You have to establish that it's a public forum first. 
    I agree with the proposition you just stated. 
    Does the activity interfere with the primary purpose of the public forum? 
    But you have to establish first that it is a public forum, and that's what I thought we were discussing here.
speaker="jay_alan_sekulow" startTime="2316.877" stopTime="2360.581">
    Mr. Jay Alan Sekulow 
    --And the public forum, to look at the public forum, we have to look at it as a multitude of factors. 
    Important factors would be that open access, general access to the public, which is clear here. 
    Anyone, as the record shows, can enter into LAX for purposes other than travel-relatedness. 
    So you could go to the airport for any reason. 
    Not only that, the city has made much of limitations contained in their charter. 
    However, a careful reading of that charter shows that the facility is not limited just to airport related activities, whatever that means, which there's no definition for. 
    Leases can be entered into for reasons other than airport related activities. 
    In fact, revocable permits can be issued for any and all purposes that, again, do not interfere with the efficient operation of the facility.

    Your Honor, that is something obviously I pondered as I walked up. 
    That brings up an interesting point. 
    Our position would be, or certainly my position would be, that there is a line where the public forum analogy stops. 
    However, I'm not convinced that the plaza level is that appropriate place. 
    Clearly, the sidewalks, as this Court has held, are public forum. 
    I say there are arguments once you enter into this facility that negate towards a public forum concept. 
    However, the plaza, I think arguments could be made that is an area of public access, and certainly one that could constitute a public forum.

    Let me ask one other question, too. 
    Did you argue overbreadth of the statute below?
speaker="jay_alan_sekulow" startTime="2649.605" stopTime="2701.895">
    Mr. Jay Alan Sekulow 
    --Yes, Your Honor. 
    Our argument was not just on the public forum issue. 
    We argued overbreadth; vagueness. 
    We also got into the content-based, viewpoint-based discrimination analysis, as well as a prior restraint. 
    The prior restraint analysis that we utilize is, as the petitioners have again stated today and they've said throughout their brief, there is this airport related exception, if you will. 
    The resolution on its face bans all First Amendment activities. 
    That's what it does on its face. 
    However, there is this airport related exception that they determine, as they've stated, they determine whether something's airport related or not. 
    There's no standards. 
    There's no guidelines. 
    It's merely something the Board in its discretion decides. 
    I think the argument certainly could be made that... we could go so far as to say that it is absolutely and capricious, the determination made by the Board here. 
    They have no guidelines. 
    They've also pointed out--

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    So we should decide this case as though the question is, could LAX like the Capitol promulgate a nicely, narrowly crafted rule that says, no religious proselytizing on these grounds, right, and that's the issue? 
    Could LAX do that? 
    If it's a public forum, it couldn't.

    Mr. Jay Alan Sekulow 
    The question then would be, would that activity substantially interfere with the flow of traffic? 
    That's a legitimate concern. 
    Our position would be that if in fact there is a situation where traffic is impeded, that a reasonable regulation of time, place and manner could handle that. 
    Our position would be, if the newspaper stand officer... operator said yes, that we could do it, that we could distribute the literature; that it's a protected activity under the First Amendment. 
    And this resolution is unconstitutional on its face. 
    When you get into weighing whether something is... affects its usage overall, that's a different... a different situation. 
    The important... another important aspect of this case is the existence of other First Amendment activities in the central terminal area of LAX. 
    There is a Christian Science reading room. 
    We do not accept the position that the Christian Science reading room is just there for a waiting room. 
    The record doesn't say how many seats are there, or how many seats could be put in that amount of space. 
    The record does say, however, that the material available at the Christian Science reading room regards the Christian Science faith.

    Mr. Jay Alan Sekulow

    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    I understand that. 
    But it does not avail you to argue about the Christian Science reading room because they have leased space.

    I don't see how it does.
speaker="jay_alan_sekulow" startTime="2915.246" stopTime="2946.436">
    Mr. Jay Alan Sekulow 
    Your Honor, in this context. 
    The material that is being disseminated at the Christian Science reading room is regarding the Christian Science faith only. 
    Effectively, if we took... looking at an establishment clause analysis, that activity is allowed to exist... I'm not saying that that's not... and you know, that there's not a technical establishment problem there. 
    We're not saying that the existence of the reading room causes an establishment problem. 
    Our position is that the existence of that reading room, and denying Jews for Jesus its right to distribute literature, would be a violation of our First Amendment rights.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2946.436" stopTime="2959.479">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well, that's like saying that the Methodist Church, which owns the property on which the church is located, because they preach religious doctrine in there, somebody else who doesn't own a church should be able on the street outside to hold their church service. 
    No case his ever held that.
speaker="jay_alan_sekulow" startTime="2959.479" stopTime="2980.454">
    Mr. Jay Alan Sekulow 
    Well, the courts have dealt with that. 
    When you're dealing with an assemblage of people, again, the reasonable time, place and manner restrictions would come in, Your Honor. 
    However, if Jews for Jesus was outside of a Methodist Church distributing literatures to passersby, certainly that would be constitutionally protected, even though the Methodist Church owns the facility. 
    If we're on the sidewalk, public property, distributing literature... I'm not talking about a church service--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2980.454" stopTime="2990.231">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Yes, but what you're saying is if... anything the Christian Science people can do by leasing, you want to be able to do without leasing. 
    And no case has ever held that.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2990.231" stopTime="2991.325">

    --Your Honor, we're not taking it that far.

    Unknown Speaker 
    Well, I hope not.
speaker="jay_alan_sekulow" startTime="2992.231" stopTime="3102.701">
    Mr. Jay Alan Sekulow 
    We're saying that the distribution of literature by the Christian Science... in the Christian Science reading room, allowing that activity to take place, and denying Jews for Jesus the right to disseminate its religious literature inside the central terminal area, those messages for First Amendment purposes are the same. 
    The fact that one leases the space and one does not, it would be our position that that would be basically irrelevant in a publicly owned facility. 
    What we have here is, in our opinion, a viewpoint discrimination. 
    The other issue that exists in this thing is, one that walks into the airport terminal and is made aware of this resolution, doesn't even know what the resolution says. 
    It says, all First Amendment activity is banned. 
    There's an exception somewhere in the recitals, as Mr. Kapel pointed out. 
    That exception creates a whole list of problems. 
    Who decides if something's airport related or not? 
    The Board. 
    How do they decide it? 
    They decide it. 
    There's no standards, again, no guidelines set forth wherein they can make this determination. 
    Another position that we've taken in this situation is the existence of a limited or open public forum. 
    The activities of Jews for Jesus and other religious, political, social organizations have taken place at the central terminal area of LAX. 
    They've taken place for at least 12 years. 
    The petitioners have made much of the fact that some groups have been denied access. 
    First off, we would say, some groups may have been denied access, but other groups have done First Activities there. 
    Furthermore, there is nothing in the record showing why these groups were denied access. 
    For all we know, the reason they were denied could be one of legitimate concerns. 
    The activities that were going to take place would be inappropriate in an airport facility. 
    So that is not a dispositive... in our opinion, that is not a dispositive issue.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="3102.701" stopTime="3108.620">
    Justice Antonin Scalia

speaker="jay_alan_sekulow" startTime="3108.620" stopTime="3120.647">
    Mr. Jay Alan Sekulow 
    That was the point I was making Your Honor, is, there's nothing in the record which shows why they were denied it, so saying some people have been denied it, when effectively people have exercised First Amendment activities inside the central terminal area, in our opinion shows that they are, again, compatible.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="3120.647" stopTime="3168.440">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Mr. Sekulow, would you explain to me, because I really don't understand this from your argument, what is it that makes a public forum special as opposed to any public building? 
    Because as I understand your argument, I think what it boils down to saying is, that any public building must be allowed to be used for free speech activities to the extent that such activities are not incompatible with the other uses of the building. 
    Now, if you adopt that as a principle, why do you need a public forum doctrine? 
    You don't need it. 
    Doesn't it totally gobble up the concept that there are some buildings where you cannot... you don't even have to have reasonable time, place and manner restrictions?
speaker="jay_alan_sekulow" startTime="3168.440" stopTime="3195.758">
    Mr. Jay Alan Sekulow 
    Your Honor, one important element of our analysis on this compatibility issue is that there's general access open to the public. 
    And if... let's take an office building as a good example... you have an office building, narrow quarters. 
    There is an... an argument can be made that the activities taking place inside an office building may not be compatible... may not be compatible... with the efficient operation of that particular facility. 
    But it's that general public access, coupled with the compatibility.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="3195.758" stopTime="3205.895">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    But even in a public forum, you are allowed to place such restrictions as are necessary to make the speech compatible with whatever else is going on.
speaker="jay_alan_sekulow" startTime="3205.895" stopTime="3206.535">
    Mr. Jay Alan Sekulow 
    That's correct.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="3206.535" stopTime="3214.392">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    In a park, and so forth. 
    So then what difference is there between a public forum and a nonpublic forum, in your view of the world?
speaker="jay_alan_sekulow" startTime="3214.392" stopTime="3274.679">
    Mr. Jay Alan Sekulow 
    A nonpublic forum... and arguments have been made regarding a nonpublic forum concerning the internal mail school systems. 
    It's that public access was lacking, Your Honor, in that particular situation, and many others. 
    There are also cases like Greer v. Spock. 
    There are special functions of facilities, military bases, where that special constitutional function is what this Court determined that special constitutional function justifies... the concern for national security... justifies... and national defense... the regulation or elimination in some cases of First Amendment activities from taking place. 
    We're not saying that all facilities are public forums open to everyone. 
    What we are saying is, when you have that compatibility and general public access, that is what we're saying is part of the key. 
    That compatibility and access. 
    That's a balancing. 
    The public forum issue is on a spectrum. 
    Our position is that LAX on the spectrum of public forum is closer to a street, a sidewalk or a park than it is to a military base or a prison.

    --I think there are legitimate reasons to restrict access to ticketing areas, baggage pickup areas, where that high concentration... these... utilizing, rather than a broad, sweeping, no First Amendment activities, a reasonable time, place and manner regulation. 
    We're not taking the proposition that all buildings are public forums. 
    We are weighing that. 
    And we are weighing that compatibility. 
    And part of that compatibility would be a security issue, and part of that compatibility certainly could be ticketing and baggage and things such as this.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="3396.990" stopTime="3412.327">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    You are taking the position that they're all public forums if there is general public access. 
    The only inquiry you would make, once you've determined that there is general public access to the building, is whether free speech activities are compatible.
speaker="jay_alan_sekulow" startTime="3412.327" stopTime="3432.897">
    Mr. Jay Alan Sekulow 
    If there is general public access and compatibility, our position would be that a public forum should exist, subject to special concerns, such as a military base or a prison if there was an area that was general access. 
    The Court's decisions regarding... in Greer v. Spock, although the military base was open, there are special constitutional functions there. 
    And we would... we would--

    And the question of whether it's appropriate isn't necessarily the same as the question whether it's compatible. 
    I mean, take my hypothetical about the Capitol.

    They could run their business anyway. 
    But it's just never been done. 
    This is not the place for it. 
    They have just said, it's not the place for it.

    Mr. Jay Alan Sekulow

    I don't take the position that the grace of government is the determining factor of what constitutes a public forum. 
    Nor do I take the position that a mere chance of history, if you will, would create the public forum; or increased mobility of society; or for that matter, new architectural designs. 
    An excellent point was raised with, what if the airport extended its central terminal area out to the sidewalks and covered it? 
    Well, is that now banned? 
    And that's the position we're taking. 
    The compatibility is an important factor. 
    The public access is an important factor. 
    The accommodation of it, we would take the position that it's an analysis that has to draw a balancing.
