New York v. Burger

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    We will hear argument first this afternoon in Number 86-80, New York against Joseph Burger. 
    Ms. Holtzman, you may proceed whenever you are ready.
speaker="elizabeth_holtzman" startTime="11.372" stopTime="164.840">
    Ms. Elizabeth Holtzman 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court: 
    The question here is whether the Constitution allows states, as it has allowed the federal government, to regulate a specific industry in order to meet a compelling public need and to enforce that regulatory scheme with warrantless inspections. 
    New York State's effort to regulate the vehicle dismantlers industry for the purpose of curbing the serious problem of auto theft with its attendant economic burdens and physical safety burdens falls squarely under the well settled criteria of Biswell, Colonnade and Donovan versus Dewey. 
    The New York regulatory scheme under 415-a of the Vehicle Traffic law is aimed at vehicle dismantlers and has three interrelated components: registration and re-registration on a periodic basis, comprehensive record keeping requirements, and warrantless inspections. 
    The administrative purposes of the regulatory scheme are as follows: the protection of legitimate vehicle dismantlers; to return more stolen cars to owners, which is an important purpose in and of itself and also to reduce insurance costs; by the record keeping requirement to deter would-be auto thieves; to trace cars back to the auto thieves; and to prevent the vehicle dismantling industry from being used as a mechanism for fencing stolen cars. 
    The statute at issue here has been criticized as being designed to allow police officers to conduct warrantless searches of inventory, and that the statute serves no real administrative purpose. 
    That reasoning is wrong. 
    It is wrong for a number of reasons. 
    It is wrong, first, because of the legislative history of the statute which establishes clearly that New York State first set up a regulatory scheme that included no inspection of inventory. 
    The inspection of inventory was added only six years... was added six years after the statute went into effect. 
    And the purpose of doing that was to make sure that the other components of the regulatory scheme worked; namely, the registration and the record keeping components.

    Ms. Elizabeth Holtzman 
    Exactly. 
    And it's also, under the case of Biswell, clear that under a routine administrative search, that with clearly delimited criteria on the basis of which a search can be conducted; in other words, in terms of reasonable time and the place and the scope of the search, that administrative warrant is not necessary under the prior holdings of this Court. 
    The complaint about the inventory inspection is that it was not really done for administrative purposes because there were no records there. 
    Our answer to this is that it is clear that inspections of inventory are crucial to enforce both the registration requirement and the record keeping requirement, first to make sure that the records are accurate, but in this case since there were no records there, the purpose of the administrative examination of the inventory was to make sure that vehicle dismantlers didn't develop this huge loophole. 
    If vehicle dismantlers knew that they could not produce records and thereby forestall a search, inspection of inventory, then clearly unscrupulous vehicle dismantlers would decide not to produce their records at the scene.

    Ms. Elizabeth Holtzman 
    Let me address the state statute first. 
    Under the state statute, there are clear limits as to time. 
    The only times at which the administrative search can take place are during regular and usual business hours. 
    Secondly, with respect to the place, the only place that the administrative inspection can take place is on the premises; with respect to records and inventory or materials covered by the record keeping requirement that are on the premises; with regard to the scope, only with respect to the records and with regard to inventory covered by or required to be kept by the records. 
    There is no suggestion whatsoever in the record, and in fact it doesn't exist, that this search was anything other than a normal, routine administrative search for books and records to ensure compliance with the statute.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="373.319" stopTime="381.080">
    Justice Jr. 
    Well, Ms. Holtzman, doesn't the statute limit to six in six months the number of warrantless searches that may be made?
speaker="elizabeth_holtzman" startTime="381.080" stopTime="422.672">
    Ms. Elizabeth Holtzman 
    No. 
    There is no maximum limit on the number of searches permissible under the statute. 
    But to answer Justice O' Connor's second question about the New York City ordinance, the city ordinance has been construed by a trial court, not by a higher court, as requiring reasonable... inspections during reasonable business hours. 
    While that statute might need more creative construction to bring it into line with some of the Court's prior precedents, we believe that it could and would be so construed by the New York State courts.

    Well, there is nothing in the record, Your Honor, with respect to why New York State used police officers, but they do use Department of Motor Vehicles officers to conduct administrative searches under the statute as well. 
    But in the Biswell case, the statute was the government's licensing scheme with respect to gun owners, was enforced by U.S. Treasury agents who are, in effect, the equivalent of New York City police officers. 
    They were carrying... they have the authority to carry guns and they have the authority to make arrests of all federal crimes, just as a New York City police officer has the authority to make arrests within the limited jurisdiction of crimes under the New York City statute. 
    In addition, under the prior rulings of the Court, the reasonableness of the administrative scheme has to be weighed against the expectations of privacy on the part of the defendant, and the expectations of privacy with respect to the industry or people involved in the industry here.

    Ms. Elizabeth Holtzman 
    There is really nothing in the record that completely explains the administrative scheme, to respond to your question, except to say that the scheme is enforced both by Department of Motor Vehicles personnel. 
    It is my understanding that in the past, from time to time Department of Consumer Affairs personnel also enforce the regulatory scheme and then police officers, as part of a special auto crimes unit, would engage in routine inspections under the administrative statute. 
    And indeed the routine... the administrative quality of this inspection is shown by the questions that were asked when the police originally arrived. 
    As the record shows, the police had no hint, suspicion, hunch or anything, or tip that there was any criminal activity going on, on these premises. 
    When they arrived the first questions that they asked were, are you registered as a vehicle dismantler under the registration requirement, and do you have the police book, the records required to be kept. 
    Then when they answered no to that, they went ahead and inspected the inventory which is, as the record shows, the normal procedure whether the records are there or not. 
    With respect to the privacy interests involved here, they are marginal and negligible at best. 
    In the first place you have, in this case, the business of the vehicle dismantler being conducted in an open field, if you can imagine an open field in Brooklyn. 
    There were no structures on the field. 
    Indeed, there was no demarcation of what was public and what was private. 
    This is typical of junk yards. 
    Indeed, the word "junk yards" suggests that much of the business is going to be conducted out in the open as is typical with regard to large vehicles which are dismantled, and the scrap business. 
    In addition, there was a very wide entrance way to this vehicle dismantler's premises, of 20 to 25 feet in width. 
    Moreover, people were admitted to these premises. 
    The public came on to sell the dealer refrigerators, scrap, automobiles, and this is typical of the vehicle dismantlers business. 
    Vehicle dismantlers must do commerce with people coming in for the purpose of buying the vehicles to begin with, and of selling the results of their dismantling. 
    Third, what was the nature of the inspection of inventory that took place? 
    It was simply the inspection of vehicle identification numbers or VINs which, as this Court has recognized in the past, for which the Court has recognized in the past, there is no expectation of privacy. 
    It was at most an extremely unintrusive search of the inventory. 
    And in addition, this is an industry that has been pervasively regulated, so the expectations of a person entering into the vehicle dismantler business, with regard to privacy, are low. 
    With regard to junkyards, a lower court in New York has found that secondhand dealers, junkyard dealers, have been regulated for more than 140 years.

    Do you think the length of time makes a difference, Ms. Holtzman? 
    I mean, does it have to have gone on for a given period of time before the service scheme will be upheld?
speaker="elizabeth_holtzman" startTime="753.181" stopTime="789.243">
    Ms. Elizabeth Holtzman 
    Not necessarily, Your Honor. 
    I think, however, in this case where you do have a very lengthy scheme of regulation, both with regard to the secondhand... people who deal in secondhand goods, with regard to people who sell motor vehicles, that you do have a reduced expectation of privacy. 
    In addition, Your Honor, as this Court has mentioned in the past, you have a registration requirement under this administrative scheme, so that the person engaged in the vehicle dismantlers business has, it seems to me for these reasons, a lower expectation of privacy than someone who wasn't in this business.

    Ms. Elizabeth Holtzman 
    Perhaps I didn't make myself clear. 
    I am not sure that... I didn't say that these factors applied only to the defendant. 
    I think it is typical of the vehicle dismantlers industry in general that much of the activity is conducted in the open, that in addition to that there is commerce back and forth of people who come to do business. 
    The final reason that we would urge that the defendant's interest in privacy is low is because of the... is because he cannot create an expectation of privacy by committing an illegal act. 
    A legitimate vehicle dismantler, under New York State, who is obeying the regulatory scheme would have had books and records there and therefore the inventory could have been inspected both for the purpose of checking against the books and records to determine the books and records were accurate, and for the other administrative purposes I have mentioned. 
    This vehicle dismantler would have this Court believe that by violating the law, by removing his books and records or by never keeping them in the first place, he can create a new special privacy interest in an inventory that a law-abiding vehicle dismantler would not have. 
    And I think that position is untenable, as this Court has held in Class, New York versus Class, the artificial creation... the creation of an artificial encumbrance doesn't undo lack of privacy that existed in the inventory to begin with. 
    So, in conclusion, I would say that this--

   Argument of Stephen R. Mahler

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Thank you, Ms. Holtzman.

speaker="stephen_r_mahler" startTime="1135.587" stopTime="1202.109">
    Mr. Stephen R. Mahler 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    The facts of this case and the collection of New York State appellate cases that we cite in our brief amply demonstrate the infirmities of the statute under consideration. 
    We submit this was an ordinary type warrantless search by regular New York City police officers without any discernible administrative function, who did not even consult with any administrative agency either before or after they took their action. 
    And petitioner conceded in a New York State Court of Appeals brief that the immediate purpose of the action was to uncover evidence of crime, and that led the New York Court of Appeals, which quoted that concession in their opinion and led them to construe the statutes... it's really convenient devices to enforce the penal law without a warrant.

    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    Well, don't you think in Colonnade and Biswell, one of the purposes of the law enforcement officers was to discover some evidence of crime?

    Mr. Stephen R. Mahler 
    Yes, and Mr. Chief Justice, the petitioner falls back to try to dilute that concession in this Court, falls back on the argument that there may be some secondary administrative value to these so-called inspections. 
    Well, that's true in any case. 
    Any time you have a criminal... a search for criminal evidence where the target is a licensee, it could be a law office and if you go in without probable cause and you search a law office for criminal evidence and you find criminal evidence and you report it to the bar association, conceivably it's going to have some administrative effect secondarily. 
    But this Court in none of the line of cases has ever held that where the immediate purpose, the very immediate purpose--

    Well, if we can go back to Biswell which is so heavily relied upon by the petitioner, petitioner ignores the evolution of the law in the most recent cases of the Court, by the way, but I'll get back to that. 
    In Biswell and in Colonnade, I believe, the alcohol and tobacco and firearms officers in those cases, they were actually administrative enforcement officers without general police duties, and the--

    --Well, what difference does that make?
speaker="stephen_r_mahler" startTime="1430.610" stopTime="1435.748">
    Mr. Stephen R. Mahler 
    Because it comes from an administrative agency. 
    It's supposed to be an administrative statute.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1435.748" stopTime="1444.433">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    Well, what is an administrative statute? 
    I mean, I think you're just using a lot of terms that may not have a great deal of meaning.
speaker="stephen_r_mahler" startTime="1444.433" stopTime="1457.068">
    Mr. Stephen R. Mahler 
    Well, Mr. Chief Justice, we're trying to bring out that an administrative statute serves a strictly administrative purpose. 
    It's not to recover evidence of crime. 
    It's perhaps to--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1457.068" stopTime="1468.781">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    Well, when these people walk in... when the inspectors walk into the yard here and they say, do you have your police book, the guy answers no. 
    Now, that's evidence of crime right there, isn't it?
speaker="stephen_r_mahler" startTime="1468.781" stopTime="1480.480">
    Mr. Stephen R. Mahler 
    --Yes. 
    In fact, the person who says that he doesn't have a police book and who is taken to be a dismantler is guilty of a misdemeanor under New York State law.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1480.480" stopTime="1496.756">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    So, any time you have an administrative statute or, as you call it, an administrative scheme, the requirement requires the keeping of records and someone is going to come around to see if you have records and they ask you the question, do you have any records, you answer no. 
    There is evidence of crime right there.
speaker="stephen_r_mahler" startTime="1496.756" stopTime="1517.606">
    Mr. Stephen R. Mahler 
    Yes, but the difference between that and the actual search for evidence of the crime is that the New York Court of Appeals saw fit to draw the line at that point and to say that it would be quite all right for the police to ask to inspect the records, but not to go further to try to seek out criminal evidence.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1517.606" stopTime="1525.900">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    In other words, if a man complies with the law and keeps records, they can be inspected but if he doesn't keep records the police are stopped stone cold?
speaker="stephen_r_mahler" startTime="1525.900" stopTime="1546.922">
    Mr. Stephen R. Mahler 
    Well, they are not. 
    In this particular instance, under these statutes, if the man doesn't keep records he's guilty of a misdemeanor. 
    And conceivably the police at that point can go and seek a search warrant based on the fact that he obviously has a junkyard filled with automobile parts and hasn't catalogued them and hasn't kept the police book.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1546.922" stopTime="1557.933">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    Well, they could perhaps get a search warrant. 
    I guess the question here is, does the Constitution require them to. 
    Well, in Biswell it was a Treasury agent, wasn't it?

    Mr. Stephen R. Mahler 
    Yes. 
    Well, that gets to part two of the argument, actually. 
    If I just may delineate between the two statutes, clearly there are two statutes at hand here. 
    Clearly the city statute cannot be conceived as being constitutional in any way, shape or form. 
    The city statute merely is authority for the Police Commissioner to conduct his police duties. 
    It really authorizes nobody else but the Police Commissioner. 
    It doesn't speak of anybody in an administrative capacity. 
    And, 415-a of the state law, the Vehicle Dismantler Law, that authorizes any police officer to search. 
    That doesn't really try to even separate out a regular police officer with general police duties from anyone else that wants to use this particular statute to make warrantless searches. 
    The Auto Crime Division in New York State have a wonderful gift in this statute. 
    It certainly separates them from any other police officer. 
    It certainly could be said in that same vein that a drug enforcement officer could... or the Drug Enforcement Administration in New York State could petition the legislature to pass a similar statute and call it administrative and declare that there's a great health problem as far as possessing and using drugs are concerned, and to search any premises administratively to recover evidence of drug trafficking. 
    We think there are two issues in the case, the first being whether the subject matter of the statutes is one to be granted exemption from the warrant requirement of the Fourth Amendment, and two, whether the statutes themselves in this instance are sufficiently tailored to the state's proper objectives to adequately minimize the dangers inherent in the unbridled exercise of administrative discretion. 
    These statutes have really no requirements. 
    There's no strictures at all. 
    They speak not of any target selection. 
    They don't speak of the frequency of the inspection or the scope of the inspection, the duration of the inspection or the prohibition against forcible entry. 
    There is no standard for the industry to guide the licensee. 
    The statutes contain nothing. 
    And under your... the most recent cases by this Court, in Donovan against Dewey and Marshall against Barlows, certainly these statutes in 415-a wouldn't be an adequate substitute for a search warrant.

    Well, Mr. Mahler, for many years, I don't know if they're still doing it but I think it was the Harrison Act, required all pharmacies to keep a poison register where you had to sign if you took out any of a number of scheduled substances, and I daresay there were inspections provided to see if the poison registers were kept. 
    Now, would that fall afoul of these strictures that you find in the Constitution? 
    I mean, I'm sure the poison register was just to see whether the pharmacists were complying with the law.

    Mr. Stephen R. Mahler 
    Well, the New York State Court of Appeals actually drew that line. 
    They said that there was nothing wrong with merely inspecting the records, but the Judge Friendly case that is cited, Turashiano against Montaigne, dealt with a problem in that field. 
    Judge Friendly emphasized that the New York statute authorizing inspections of druggists, narcotic records, had been amended to restrict the right of inspection to representatives of the Health Department rather than all peace officers within the state. 
    He emphasized that distinction, but I think the New York Court of Appeals was willing to let police officers have the right to come in and actually inspect the books. 
    But what the objection was, was to step two where you try to compare the book with the products in the art.

    He didn't call any administrative agency, and he was stuck with the fact that when cross examined, as you can see from the record, he was stuck by the fact that all he was in there for was to write down VIN numbers and to call them in to see if the parts that were found in the yard were stolen.

   Rebuttal of Elizabeth Holtzman

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Thank you, Mr. Mahler. 
    Ms. Holtzman, you have 12 minutes left should you choose to use them.

    Ms. Elizabeth Holtzman 
    Mr. Chief Justice, I'll just take one or two minutes simply to point out that the purpose of the statute and the purpose of the administrative scheme is not to uncover evidence of crime in a particular case. 
    The purpose of the scheme is to, in the end, deter auto theft, to make sure that the vehicle dismantlers industry is not a tool for fencing, to trace cars, and to return stolen cars. 
    There is no purpose in the administrative scheme to uncover evidence of crime in a particular case. 
    Indeed, the administrative scheme in Biswell, and as the Chief Justice pointed out, it's hard to envision an administrative scheme that's not enforced in some way with criminal penalties. 
    I would also like to point out that the administrative search here involved no home and involved the inspection of the kind that I noted before.
