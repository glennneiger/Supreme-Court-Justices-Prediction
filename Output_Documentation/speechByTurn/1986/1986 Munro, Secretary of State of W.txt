Munro, Secretary of State of Washington v. Socialist Workers Party

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    We will hear arguments next in No. 85-656, Ralph Munro, Secretary of State of Washington, versus Socialist Workers Party. 
    Mr. Johnson, you may proceed whenever you are ready.
speaker="james_m_johnson" startTime="63.990" stopTime="204.516">
    Mr. James M. Johnson 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the State of Washington has a uniquely open election system, a system unusually hospitable to new and minor parties and independents and their candidates. 
    Washington voters wishing to exercise their right to politically associate through these vehicles easily organize and choose their candidates. 
    Those candidates have long been automatically placed on the Washington elections ballot. 
    After a 1976 election, with the most crowded ballot in Washington's history, the Washington legislature decided to exercise what this Court has called a state's undoubted right to require candidates to make a showing of substantial support in order to qualify for a place on the ballot. 
    The Washington legislature, by statute, placed all candidates on the primary ballot and added a requirement that any candidate not able to attract the votes of 1 percent of the voters would not remain on the ballot a second time. 
    It is that 1 percent requirement to remain on the ballot a second time that is challenged here by a candidate placed on the Washington primary ballot who got fewer than 600 votes, less than one-tenth of the 1 percent, and thus was not remained on the... did not remain on the Washington ballot a second time in the general election. 
    I shall explain first the Washington experience and the election with its crowded ballot in 1976 leading to this change, then telling you why the 1 percent is consistent with this Court's numerical definitions of substantial support and argue under this Court's decision the Washington requirement is neither unconstitutional per se and is less than the numerical test that this Court has approved, such as the Jenness v. Fortson, a 5 percent of voters test, arguing that it is less burdensome on minor parties and serves to improve the political debate which is the constitutional issue before the Court; finally... and also that the Washington statute by cutting off some few candidates avoids subsidizing hopeless candidates, as this Court recognized in the different case of Buckley v. Valeo was appropriate. 
    Finally, I can show--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="204.516" stopTime="208.401">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Subsidizing meaning printing, including their name on the ballot?
speaker="james_m_johnson" startTime="208.401" stopTime="235.052">
    Mr. James M. Johnson 
    --There's more than that in the State of Washington, Chief Justice Rehnquist. 
    The printing on the ballot and the counting of votes is one issue. 
    Washington is also unique in the states that we print and distribute to every residence in Washington a voter's pamphlet and candidates' pamphlet for publicizing the election and the candidates, at considerable expense. 
    In that additional regard, I think, we are subsidizing hopeless candidates by placing on the ballot those candidates that have not and will not receive any substantial support.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="235.052" stopTime="238.904">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Is that kind of information disseminated in connection with the primary as well as the general election?
speaker="james_m_johnson" startTime="238.904" stopTime="401.771">
    Mr. James M. Johnson 
    It is not, Justice Stevens. 
    It is only disseminated in conjunction with the general, and may have been one factor in the legislature determination to move this substantial support determination to the primary. 
    I referred to Washington's uniquely open system. 
    I shortly explain, and explain the relevance of this system. 
    In Washington there is no party registration. 
    There is no identification of voters by party in the State of Washington at all. 
    The voting is a blanket primary, we have referred to it, and the general is the same. 
    Under a blanket voting system each Washington voter may vote for any candidate for any position irregardless of party affiliation. 
    One vote per race, of course. 
    In a case tomorrow arising from Connecticut you will hear debated the merits of open versus closed primaries and restrictions on voters, how they vote by party. 
    In Washington we have no such system. 
    The Washington system is more open than the open primary. 
    This has direct relevance, of course, to using a primary vote requirement for determining substantial support, since any Washington voter attracted to the votes can vote for any and all candidates. 
    For example, a Washington voter may choose to vote for a Socialist Worker candidate for governor, a Republican candidate for U.S. Senate, a Democrat candidate for their local legislatures, et cetera, down the ballot. 
    Thus again the primary test is much easier than it would be in most states with either a closed or open primary in which party affiliation is somehow tested first before the voters can exercise their option. 
    Finally, in Washington if any candidate is not on the ballot a Washington voter can write in any candidate with the sole exception of a sore loser of a major party primary. 
    The Court of Appeals decision in this regard is just confused. 
    The District Court finding of fact and conclusion of law at JSC 5 is accurate. 
    The Washington statute allows write-ins with the sole exception I have mentioned. 
    If not on the ballot, of course, in the Washington system the voters have made that decision. 
    In 1976 the voters had lots of options to choose from, culminating the preceding four elections' increase in the number of independent and minor candidates. 
    The 1976 election had 12 parties, one of which, the OWL, Out with Logic, On with Lunacy, Party, was avowedly frivolous and ran a statewide slate. 
    There were numerous candidates, however, as noted in our brief, 65 of them on that ballot. 
    Important to note, though, is that of these--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="401.771" stopTime="404.390">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Sixty-five candidates for what, Mr. Johnson?
speaker="james_m_johnson" startTime="404.390" stopTime="409.461">
    Mr. James M. Johnson 
    --Sixty-five candidates for statewide and Congressional races, Your Honor, Mr. Chief Justice.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="409.461" stopTime="411.344">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    So those were not just local races.
speaker="james_m_johnson" startTime="411.344" stopTime="436.694">
    Mr. James M. Johnson 
    That does not include local races, no. 
    That is summarized in the appendix. 
    It is a confusing number, confusing in this particular regard. 
    It includes all the Congressional candidates, and every Washington voter did not have access to those, so each voter would have faced probably 12 fewer, and then added to the... at the end of the ballot would have been the local races together with such issues as constitutional and levy elections. 
    It was a long--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="436.694" stopTime="439.396">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    How many candidates were there for Governor?
speaker="james_m_johnson" startTime="439.396" stopTime="499.185">
    Mr. James M. Johnson 
    --There were eight candidates for Governor, Your Honor, Mr. Chief Justice, and a good example of showing that the candidates, the non... the minor party independents did not attract any substantial support. 
    Of those six independent and minor party candidates, none of them got 1 percent in the general election. 
    Four of them, including the Socialist Workers Party candidate, got less than.3 percent of the ballot. 
    This, by the way, was also consistent with the preceding history in Washington of minor parties and independents. 
    As noted in our reply brief, since the Depression, only two such candidates for statewide office had ever received even 1 percent of the vote. 
    The Washington legislature reasonably then saw this unduly lengthy ballot, and as we have discussed, Mr. Chief Justice, with regards to the voters' pamphlet, I think reasonably concluded that in some regard the ballot placement and the voters' pamphlet were subsidizing hopeless candidates, and the "subsidizing hopeless candidates" is your language--
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="499.185" stopTime="501.887">

    Well, of course, that could be remedied by not printing them.

    Mr. James M. Johnson 
    --Yes, but much to the detriment of the voting system, at least in the judgment of the legislature and the citizens of Washington, Justice Marshall. 
    The voters' pamphlet serves to publicize all the election as well as helping--

    Mr. James M. Johnson 
    --Justice Marshall, as in Buckley v. Valeo, I think the public is not obligated to undertake public financing of elections. 
    That quote was extracted because I think the concepts are similar in that one regard. 
    The encumbering of the ballot, however, remains irregardless of whether a voters' pamphlet is chosen.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="537.143" stopTime="545.999">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Mr. Johnson, I feel bound to inform you that there is no word in the English language "irregardless". 
    The word is "regardless".
speaker="james_m_johnson" startTime="545.999" stopTime="619.428">
    Mr. James M. Johnson 
    Thank you, Chief Justice. 
    Thank you. 
    And regardless, the problem of an encumbered ballot as existed in 1976 remains. 
    The Washington legislative solution to that problem and to this Court's then recent decisions in Jenness and American Party of Texas, recognizing that the state had the authority to remove frivolous candidates or remove those that had no public support, the legislature reacted in these ways. 
    All candidates were placed on the primary with an essentially concurrent filing for minor party and independents and the major parties. 
    That is, the convention for minors and independents is a Saturday, Monday the filing begins, and on the Friday of the same week the convention certificate together with the major party are closed. 
    One percent requirement was imposed. 
    Any candidate not getting 1 percent would not remain on the ballot. 
    Important to note, this was down from the preceding 5 percent requirement. 
    The preceding 5 percent, of course, applied only to major parties who in the earlier system were the only ones on the primary ballot.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="619.428" stopTime="621.980">

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Could you tell me why it is that in running in this primary the independent and small party candidates are not really running in the primary? 
    The system is set up so that they have to be nominated by some sort of a convention system previously. 
    And that is one of the complaints here, that it is a primary that... for them it's a primary that really isn't a primary.
speaker="james_m_johnson" startTime="711.455" stopTime="739.588">
    Mr. James M. Johnson 
    Justice Scalia, I do not understand... first, the nominating convention requirement was not challenged below, nor do I understand the party here to object or to prefer primary nomination for its candidates. 
    In this regard, the minor parties have an advantage over major parties, and it makes some sense for minor or new parties. 
    They can control their own candidate rather than going through the blanket primary system to allow all Washington voters to choose their candidates.

    Mr. James M. Johnson 
    Printed as A1 in our reply brief, in that appendix the legislative memorandum mentions the question of minor parties being allowed to not control their own candidates and convention, which suggests to me the argument I have just advanced, that what was intended was to let them at the smaller stage not have the general election... the major parties in Washington sometimes object to the primary system we have, which allows all voters to determine a party's nominees. 
    And I think the analysis is more likely to be applied in a small and growing party that would like to control its own candidates.

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    --But you understand that one of the arguments being made here is that since there are not two candidates competing, why would you expect voters to come out to vote for their--
speaker="james_m_johnson" startTime="799.411" stopTime="860.131">
    Mr. James M. Johnson 
    I do understand that, and I think, Justice Scalia, the answer in part is the Washington system. 
    The primary serves... on the primary ballot in Washington are not just candidate nominations but local races, nonpartisan races, together with local issues such as levies and those kinds of things. 
    The burden imposed on a minor party candidate is exactly the same as any candidate. 
    They have to bring out voters and get them to vote for them. 
    In the Washington system the beauty for a minor party is that every voter that comes to the polls can vote for the minor party candidate, as I mentioned. 
    In a blanket primary they don't have to just attract... any voter that walks into that poll can vote for one of the candidates. 
    Typically, by the way, the minor party doesn't run a whole slate of candidates. 
    In this regard it also has two advantages over the prior system. 
    First, the old system had the convention the same day as the primary, and so you had... a minor party adherent had to give up their primary right to go to the convention. 
    In this regard it is a direct benefit. 
    Secondly--

    Under the old system--

    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    It occurs to me that the 1 percent requirement could be quite different in an election which had, say there was no contest for the Democratic nomination and no contest for the Republican nomination. 
    It might be rather easy to get a 1 percent then, but if you have a big party fight going on and a lot of other issues, the 1 percent would then be ten or fifteen times as hard to get.
speaker="james_m_johnson" startTime="923.537" stopTime="926.922">
    Mr. James M. Johnson 
    --Justice Stevens, it depends on the position. 
    In our most recent race--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="926.922" stopTime="928.322">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    It depends on what the issues are at the primary election.
speaker="james_m_johnson" startTime="928.322" stopTime="1112.377">
    Mr. James M. Johnson 
    --And the position. 
    In our most recent primary, the hotly contested race for U.S. Senator, but if the Socialist Workers had a candidate for a legislative race any place down the ballot, all the voters that are attracted to that hot race, as you called it, could vote for that position also. 
    It has... the system has another advantage over either the petition or the prior system in that it added the minor parties and independents into the political debate. 
    That is what we are talking about here, is broadening the political debate, and under the prior system or any other system the minor parties and independents have no role in the period of debate in Washington leading up to the primary because they are not on the ballot. 
    In that regard the primary is actually monopolized by the major parties if they are the only ones on the ballot. 
    By adding them into the ballot there is at least this advantage, if not to the party, and I think it is to the party, there is the advantage to the voters in the political debate that they are allowed in. 
    The primary system that it is not per se unconstitutional, we can say at least from this Court's summary affirmance in Allen v. Austin in 1977 of such a system. 
    Indeed, since that was summary affirmance, I suppose that is the most I can say, that it is not unconstitutional per se. 
    That it is numerically consistent with the then recent cases of Jenness v. Fortson and American Party of Texas we have pointed out in the table in the brief, the example being the Jenness system, in which this Court approved a petition requirement of 5 percent of the registered voters in Georgia. 
    Such a requirement imposed in the State of Washington would mean 122,000 signatures to get the statewide gubernatorial candidate of a minor party on the ballot in Washington, as contrasted with the 9,100 required as 1 percent of the primary vote in 1984. 
    Now, it may be more difficult to get one voter out to vote in a primary, but I submit it is not 13 times more difficult to get a voter than it is to get a petition. 
    I further argue that the political debate benefits by the choice. 
    In this regard the primary system is better than a petition. 
    After all, the petition, once filled in, the petitions are discarded. 
    The buttonholing of candidates, which one of the amicus... excuse me, the buttonholing of voters, which one of the amicus briefs suggest is a real easy way to get petitions that is probably true, but it adds little to the political debate, as contrasted with the Washington system, as I have noted, which encourages the same time and money and effort to be expended instead in attracting voters to the primary and getting them there to vote for their candidates. 
    The limited resources of a minor party, I suggest, are better expended in getting voters out and getting them to the primary than they are through this, to us, to Washington, basically meaningless petition-gathering proposition, meaningless in the sense it doesn't really add to the political debate, which is the issue, the interest that we are trying to protect.

    Put another way, again, do the major parties monopolize debate in Washington? 
    The answer is clear from the record. 
    The wide-ranging debate is alive and well in Washington.

    I think they have conceded in their brief this party has its major... if there is a base of adherence, is in Seattle-Takoma metropolitan area. 
    I am sorry about the name error. 
    To answer you first question, why they don't qualify, I think there are three reasons. 
    The Court has said we are entitled, the state is, to ask for reasonably diligent candidates. 
    Two, they may have a message the voters just do not like. 
    Or, three, they may have unattractive candidates, and on this record we don't know exactly why Mr. Peoples didn't qualify, but the record does show they expended $1,900 on a statewide Senate race in the State of Washington, an insignificant amount, and if it reflects the support that they could draw, a financial support, the effort, I say, was insignificant. 
    As you have noted, their support is concededly in the Seattle-Takoma area, where all that effort was expended, instead of broadening their base to the whole of the state. 
    Finally, the record also shows the affidavit at C13 was their affidavit setting forth all the electoral efforts. 
    Four out of five news releases they put out, four out of five were about this case.

    Primarily what this state, this Court has conceded the state's interest in requiring a showing of substantial support before a candidate appears on the ballot. 
    However, Justice O'Connor, we allow the candidate on the ballot the first time, the primary, without such a requirement.

    And what underlies that?
speaker="james_m_johnson" startTime="1404.474" stopTime="1417.782">
    Mr. James M. Johnson 
    --That purpose serves two interests. 
    First, avoiding the unduly lengthy laundry list ballot that this Court has referred to with the possible effect of confusing voters and allowing frivolous candidates--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="1417.782" stopTime="1426.070">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Well, under your system the ballot is so long and complicated already that that might not be a very persuasive argument. 
    What else--
speaker="james_m_johnson" startTime="1426.070" stopTime="1562.442">
    Mr. James M. Johnson 
    --It was a persuasive argument to the Washington legislature, Justice O'Connor, and I think they have a right under this Court's decision to respond to that. 
    Secondly, as I have discussed with Justice Marshall, in some regard placing candidates that history shows have never attracted substantial support, works to be subsidizing hopeless candidates, nor is the state or the government obligated to subsidize these hopeless candidates. 
    We can require them to exercise some reasonable diligence and expend some effort. 
    Ultimately, then, to the extent that a few of these candidates do not remain on the ballot, and as we note in our reply brief, the summary numbers are that of 48 candidates, independent and minor party, since the '76 election, since the '76 changes, I believe the number was 37 of them have remained on the general election ballot, and again, they are already on the ballot in the primary and thus afforded the opportunity to participate in political debate through that part, and most of them, albeit usually for the U.S. Representative and local races, including Washington State legislative, most of those candidates have remained on the ballot. 
    The voters determine who stays on the ballot, and that is an important part of the democratic system. 
    The constitutional objective or test was differently stated by the majority and the dissent in this Court in your 1983 Anderson v. Celebrezze case, the majority saying the primary values protected by the First Amendment here are a commitment to debate on public issues, uninhibited, robust, and wide open, not monopolized by the existing political parties. 
    The dissent differently stated that a court's job is to ensure that the state in no way freezes the status quo but implicitly recognizes the potential fluidity of American political life. 
    Under either formulation of the constitutional issues here, the Washington statute and Washington election system meets the test and protects the constitutional rights of its voters. 
    The decision below should be reversed. 
   
   
   
   Argument of Daniel Hoyt Smith
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1562.442" stopTime="1568.013">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Thank you, Mr. Johnson. 
    Mr. Smith, we will hear from you now.
speaker="daniel_hoyt_smith" startTime="1568.013" stopTime="1720.830">
    Mr. Daniel Hoyt Smith 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, when we analyzed state restrictions on political expression and association relating to minor parties with dissident views, we are operating in the core of the First Amendment. 
    Since there is no litmus test for ballot access restrictions, the numbers game is not useful. 
    The cases do not say 1 percent is constitutional or an early deadline is unconstitutional, so to decide this case it is necessary to look at three questions. 
    First, did the 1977 additional restrictions have a substantial impact on expression and association of minor parties and voters? 
    Two, is there a governmental interest in these additional restrictions so compelling that it outweighs the burden on fundamental First Amendment rights? 
    And three, are the new restrictions precisely drawn so that First Amendment rights are not necessarily... unnecessarily burdened, or could the legitimate state interest be achieved by less drastic means? 
    I would like to address these in order, but first I must touch on the most crucial aspect of Washington's ballot access amendments of 1977. 
    This was the conversion of the traditional one-step barrier as it applies in every other state in which qualifying candidates participate in the general election whether they are a minor party or major party nominees to a two-step exclusionary process. 
    Now, as to the first step, as Mr. Johnson has discussed, Washington's nomination process, by convention, is different from a door-to-door petition signature requirement, so it is not automatic qualification. 
    Far from it. 
    The mounting of convention does require substantial effort, and in 1977 the legislature doubled the number of participants required with the result that the nominees that have been able to... the minor parties that have been able to qualify as shown by the table on Page 5 and 6 of our brief has been extremely limited--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1720.830" stopTime="1725.615">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    You are referring now, Mr. Smith, to the statutory requirements for the convention?
speaker="daniel_hoyt_smith" startTime="1725.615" stopTime="1726.484">
    Mr. Daniel Hoyt Smith 
    --Correct.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1726.484" stopTime="1728.100">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    What are those?
speaker="daniel_hoyt_smith" startTime="1728.100" stopTime="1761.823">
    Mr. Daniel Hoyt Smith 
    The convention requires that on the Saturday before the major parties even have to declare their candidacy, the minor party has to gather supporters on one day in one places nominate its candidates, and have a nominating petition signed by a number, which is now on a sliding scaler according to population, approximately 200 at this time, registered voters who give their names and voting addresses attesting to the nomination of that candidate.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1761.823" stopTime="1765.109">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    That means that 200 registered voters would have to attend the convention?
speaker="daniel_hoyt_smith" startTime="1765.109" stopTime="1821.341">
    Mr. Daniel Hoyt Smith 
    That's correct. 
    And that restriction had been somewhat, I guess, degenerating by the increase of population, and the legislature remedied that problem. 
    Previously it had been 25. 
    It had been raised to 100. 
    In 1977 the legislature about doubled it, and now it is tied to population. 
    Since that change, the number of nominees has been one, two, or in one case three, and so we are talking about a very small and identifiable group of dissident parties who like the Socialist Workers Party and the Libertarian Party who filed the amicus brief here, who consistently over the years have put forth substantial effort into the electoral system to introduce their new ideas to the voters and have continued to be able to qualify candidates in very small numbers by convention.

    Mr. Daniel Hoyt Smith 
    As an independent it is the same requirement for a similar convention. 
    You have to organize a convention to support your independent candidacy and get the signatures of the same number of voters.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1847.789" stopTime="1853.157">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well, now, if this were the only requirement to get on the general election ballot you wouldn't be challenging it, would you?
speaker="daniel_hoyt_smith" startTime="1853.157" stopTime="1975.138">
    Mr. Daniel Hoyt Smith 
    That's correct, and we believe that the record shows that historically a reasonable but small number of serious minor parties have been able to qualify, and since this has been adopted have still been able to nominate candidates. 
    Our objection is that these nominees who have qualified are then universally eliminated by the primary requirement, and as Mr. Johnson... or as Mr. Justice Stevens brought out, it is a different situation for the minor parties than for the major parties, and it depends not primarily on the level of support, which is admittedly small because by definition these minor parties are small parties, and their contribution to our electoral politics does not depend on mass support, but the single example of any minor party candidate that has been able to meet the requirement since 1977 has been one race where there was only a single Democrat and a single Republican on the primary ballot, and so there was no contest, and it resembled a party versus party choice, and in that situation the Libertarian Party candidate for treasurer, a relatively low profile race, but was able to get the 1 percent. 
    With that exception, when there was no contest, every time there has been a contest for the Republican or Democratic nomination, no minor party candidate has ever been able to qualify for statewide office. 
    It has been a blanket exclusion, as the Ninth Circuit correctly found the record indicates. 
    So that is the first question that the Court needs to address: Has there been a substantial impact on the participation of minor parties and the Interest that that affects of both the minor parties and the voters in injecting their ideas into the electoral system.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="1975.138" stopTime="2015.597">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Mr. Smith, is that relevant? 
    I mean, all that it would prove... it would prove either, either that the new law is excessively restrictive or that the old law was excessively latitudinarian. 
    It could prove either one. 
    It depends entirely on whether there were too many parties before, whether the parties beforehand did not have a significant amount of popular support, significant enough under our laws to justify putting them on the ballot. 
    Now, how do we know that the preexisting situation was a good situation? 
    I tend to think that the OWL Party is not something that we needed on the ballot in Washington.
speaker="daniel_hoyt_smith" startTime="2015.597" stopTime="2083.407">
    Mr. Daniel Hoyt Smith 
    Well, with regard to the first question you ask, Justice Scalla, whether it is too latitudinarian, this Court has said that one of the first things we can look at is whether in practice as applied minor parties are able to qualify, and the Court has said it is one thing if minor parties are regularly able to qualify for the ballot, and it is quite another thing if only rarely can any minor party get on. 
    And this case definitely presents the situation of that other thing where minor parties are systematically barred. 
    With regard to the OWL Party, the record indicates that the legislature was reacting to a situation where they were offended by the insufficient reverence that the OWL Party paid to the major parties, and particularly and ironically to the level of public support that the OWL Party was able to get, and--

    Mr. Daniel Hoyt Smith 
    --Yes, we believe that the fact that serious minor parties have been regularly able to meet the nominating convention requirement would be adequate support for that requirement to withstand any attack by somebody else who was not able to meet it to say the fact that these small but serious minor parties are able to meet this requirement indicates it is fair.

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well, Mr. Smith, in your definition of serious minor party when you were replying to Justice Marshall's question, I gather there is a numerical component to seriousness. 
    The party which can muster only ten votes at its convention, it may have ten of the best debaters and the best philosophers in the State of Washington but the state can say that just isn't enough. 
    Is that correct?
speaker="daniel_hoyt_smith" startTime="2244.378" stopTime="2270.446">
    Mr. Daniel Hoyt Smith 
    Well, the hypothetical question is not posed in this case because we have a real situation in which there is a real and substantial requirement to qualify. 
    If we didn't have this historical experience and we had to hypothesize in the dark, the state could test out a requirement and see if serious parties could qualify.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2270.446" stopTime="2278.301">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    But it seems to me part of your argument is that our cases have said that there must be a way for serious minor parties to get on the ballot.

    Mr. Daniel Hoyt Smith 
    That's correct.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2278.951" stopTime="2298.715">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    And I am curious to know whether the way you use that term the term "serious" can at least be construed by the state to have a numerical component. 
    That is, serious minor parties who can muster one-half percent of the turnout at the last election for that office at some stage in the campaign, just take hypothetically.
speaker="daniel_hoyt_smith" startTime="2298.715" stopTime="2457.500">
    Mr. Daniel Hoyt Smith 
    Well, it depends on what the requirement is, because the numerical requirements for petition signatures, which are the only requirements that have been upheld by this Court, do represent some level of organizational ability and diligence that the party itself can control and go out and get signatures on the petitions, in Jenness, for example. 
    We are not saying we will vote for this candidate, but we think that this candidate should be allowed on the ballot, and because of the traditional American openness to hearing different points of view, it is very easy to get people to go out and say, yes, we believe you should be allowed to be heard, and in American Party versus Texas, the Socialist Workers Party went out and got 22,000 plus signatures on their petition to get on the ballot without a serious problem but by their diligence and by their effort. 
    And the vote, on the other hand, as the record indicates, reflects the primary contest by the major parties and not the diligence or the efforts put out by the minor party within their limited capabilities, but that is more related to the contribution a party can make to the debate that they are capable of organizing and organizational effort like that to gather petition signatures than to make it rely on having some certain level of support in the primary election for a number of reasons. 
    Number One is that the primary is not an adequate forum as a substitute for the general election. 
    First of all, the timing is prior to the identification of the candidates by the nominating process of the major parties. 
    Second, as in this race, there are numerous, often dozens of major party candidates that still have to be selected by the party for who is going to represent them, and so that if there is any confusion, which Mr. Johnson identified as the interest the state is concerned about, it takes place at the primary, as in this case with 32 Democrats and Republicans on the ballot along with a single Socialist Workers Party candidate. 
    The voting machine has no instruction on that of what even the purpose of the minor party candidate is on the ballot, and if the minor parties are going to make a contribution to the election process, it is not because they are likely to win, but because in the debate between the representatives of the parties they have some new ideas and they have a differing point of view. 
    That is really not relevant.

speaker="daniel_hoyt_smith" startTime="2515.623" stopTime="2545.808">
    Mr. Daniel Hoyt Smith 
    That is because of the experience that with no requirement whatsoever substantial... some modicum of support is a fair requirement to avoid the problems of ballot crowding and voter confusion, and in this case we have such a legitimate interest being taken care of by one mechanism. 
    The question is whether... how far beyond that, to get the OWL Party, whether you can employ your shotgun that wipes out every other party totally off the ballot.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="2545.808" stopTime="2580.963">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    That can't be the explanation of our cases because a much more... much less restrictive means of preventing confusion is to have a sliding scale of the degree of support you need. 
    That is, there will be 15 slots on the ballot. 
    We will let every party get on the ballot up to 15. 
    Past 15 it is confusing, but up to 15 it is not confusing. 
    So I don't care if you get 30 votes. 
    We will still put you on so long as there is a 15th slot available. 
    Now, we have never required anything like that, so there must be something underlying this beyond merely confusing the voters. 
    We do require substantial support.

    Mr. Daniel Hoyt Smith 
    Substantial support is not required as an end in itself, Number One, but Number Two, if it is of a reasonably low level that it allows, consistently allows serious minor party candidates to qualify, then the cases say you haven't met the threshold of showing... the first step is showing a substantial impact on diversity.

    I'd say if another small party could meet a, for example, a petition signature requirement which could be met through reasonable diligence, then it would be constitutional to say your failure to exercise that diligence to gather the relatively reasonable number of signatures that other small parties are able to gathers then you are responsible for your own fate.

    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    May I ask you another question? 
    You have placed quite a bit of emphasis on the fact there are two stages that have to be met by your party, one, a convention, which is rather modest, and then the I percent primary requirement. 
    Supposing the state said, as they do with Democrats and Republicans, anyone may get on the primary ballot, just eliminate the first stage, and then your candidate could run simply on that and have to meet a I percent. 
    Would that be permissible, do you think?

    If I understand you correctly, the constitutional outcome depends on the empirical results.

    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    Mr. Smith, what is the Washington system as to write-in votes? 
    Suppose your candidate doesn't make it to the general ballot. 
    I get some confusion in the briefs as to whether write-in votes are permissible.
speaker="daniel_hoyt_smith" startTime="3029.833" stopTime="3140.055">
    Mr. Daniel Hoyt Smith 
    The Court of Appeals decision interpreted the Washington statute, which says that an unsuccessful minor party... or an unsuccessful primary participant cannot be a write-in candidate to say that the write-in was not available and the Court of Appeals also followed the decisions of this case saying that a write-in vote is not a constitutionally accepted alternative to general election ballot placement. 
    The state has argued that this only applies to major parties, even though there is no specific limitation in the statutory language, and also the record indicates that the election results reported by the Secretary of State show no write-in votes for any of the offices that they have ever reported the election results in on the record, and so the inference that can be drawn from that is either that nobody ever exercises a write-in vote or the Secretary of State doesn't keep track of them, but in either case they are not a sufficient substitute for the participation in the campaign, the debate, and the presentation of their ideas, in the same way this voters' pamphlet that was brought up by Mr. Johnson for the first time, there is no showing of any financial burden on the record here that to add an extra paragraph to a 30-page pamphlet would put some burden on the state or would unfairly or unreasonably subsidize the minor parties by broadening the choices available to the voters. 
    We suggest that that is exactly the kind of contribution that minor parties should be playing in this election campaign.

    Mr. Daniel Hoyt Smith 
    Well, historically the record as pointed out by Mr. Johnson indicates that choosing the 1 percent level, the state has chosen a level that is higher than 90 percent of the minor parties have ever been able to get, even in the general election, so they have chosen a level that is up at the 90th percentile instead of choosing a level from the record that was down at the 50th or--

    Mr. Daniel Hoyt Smith 
    --Well, first of all, only one-third of the voters even are interested in enough in the primary to participate, and those are typically partisans of one of the major party candidates who care about what the primary is about, namely, which major party candidate will get the nomination.

   Rebuttal of James M. Johnson
speaker="james_m_johnson" startTime="3396.869" stopTime="3430.757">
    Mr. James M. Johnson 
    Just a moment, please, to correct an answer I gave Justice Stevens, that consideration of the number of candidates printed in the voters' pamphlet was discussed in the Washington legislature, Justice Stevens, and is reprinted at Page A2 of our reply brief, the note that this effect retroactively analyzed would have been to cut down the number of candidates from 65 to 50 in that printing. 
    The argument here appears to want to escalate the Washington convent ion requirement to another "barrier"--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="3430.757" stopTime="3434.578">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    May I just ask, 65 to 50, are these all statewide candidates?
speaker="james_m_johnson" startTime="3434.578" stopTime="3436.944">
    Mr. James M. Johnson 
    --No, they are not, as I responded to the first question.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="3436.944" stopTime="3439.363">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    So there is a different pamphlet for each election district?

    Mr. James M. Johnson 
    There is a different pamphlet by each Congressional District.

    By each Congressional District.
speaker="james_m_johnson" startTime="3442.782" stopTime="3443.517">
    Mr. James M. Johnson 
    Yes, Justice Stevens.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="3443.517" stopTime="3444.183">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    I see.
speaker="james_m_johnson" startTime="3444.183" stopTime="3548.267">
    Mr. James M. Johnson 
    In fact, the convention requirement in Washington is the equivalent of a petition. 
    First, the convention requirement was not challenged below at all, as you can see from the complaint. 
    Secondly, the District Court found that this party's convention was a "street corner convention". 
    The attachments to C13, an affidavit of the party, show the candidates standing on a street corner in Seattle conducting their convention, and the point is, that is all right with Washington. 
    We do not have any separate barrier through convention at the de minimis 200 voter requirement. 
    Finally, I think we should consider the alternatives that are clearly and constitutionally available to Washington. 
    The Jenness versus 5 percent requirement would work an obligation to get 122,000 signatures to qualify for the Washington ballot as contrasted with the 9,000 for a Governor' race in Washington and a sliding scale actually which we impose. 
    The 1 percent is applied to each office, working your way down the ballot, and is much less, of course, for local offices, and this is why Washington legislative positions and local offices, the minor parties have always been successful in qualifying for the general election. 
    One percent is not a large requirement to dictate substantial support. 
    Any other kind of method, Mr. Smith suggests we use a scalpel, but any content control requirement to discern frivolous parties would, I submit, be unconstitutional, so a numerical requirement is required constitutionally, The 1 percent imposed by the Washington statute is reasonable and easily reached by a diligent party. 
    Therefore we conclude the Washington statute is constitutional and ought to be upheld.
