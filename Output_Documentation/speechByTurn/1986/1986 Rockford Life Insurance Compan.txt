    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    We will hear arguments next in No. 86-251, Rockford Life Insurance Company against Illinois Department of Revenue, et al.-- 
    Mr. Griswold, you may proceed when you are ready.
speaker="erwin_n_griswold" startTime="55.468" stopTime="585.998">
    Mr. Erwin N. Griswold 
    May it please the Court, this case is here on appeal from the Supreme Court of Illinois. 
    The question, summarily stated, is whether certificates of the Government National Mortgage Association, popularly known as Ginnie Mae and I shall refer to it as Ginnie Mae in the argument, guaranteed as to interest and principal by the full faith and credit of the United States, pursuant to an Act of Congress, are subject to an ad valorem property tax of the State of Illinois. 
    I will seek to show that the bonds are exempt from taxation. 
    First, under general constitutional principles, including the Supremacy Clause, since the unqualified Government guarantee which they contain is the key and essential element in carrying out an important policy deliberately adopted by the Government of the United States under the Commerce Clause and in providing for the general welfare. 
    And, second, pursuant to the express terms of Section 742 of Title 31 of the United States Code, in which the Congress has long provided, since the Civil War, that, and I quote: 
    "All stocks, bonds and other obligations of the United States shall be exempt from State taxation. " 
    Rockford Life Insurance Company bought the bonds involved here in 1977 at a time when Illinois did not impose its property tax on Ginnie Mae bonds. 
    However, on December 31, 1978, the Illinois Department of Local Government changed its rule and imposed the tax for 1978. 
    That led to administrative and Court proceedings, as a result of which the tax was sustained by the Supreme Court of Illinois. 
    Rockford then brought the case here and this Court noted probable jurisdiction on November 10th. 
    In considering both the constitutional and the statutory questions, it is important to have a clear picture of the history of the Government National Mortgage Association and the role which it plays in the housing policy of the United States. 
    The origins go back more than 50 years, to 1934. 
    Some of us remember and others have learned that real estate markets then were moribund. 
    Housing starts had dropped from 937,000 units in 1925 to 93,000 in 1933. 
    Foreclosures were at epidemic levels, as this Court's decision in Home Building and Loan Association against Blaisdell clearly records. 
    Before that time, many efforts had been made by insurance companies and others to insure mortgage debt but the experience was disastrous. 
    It was in this situation that President Roosevelt established a Commission to explore housing finance and out of its report came the First National Housing Act, enacted in 1934. 
    One of the proposals embodied in that Act was the grant of authority for the creation of Federally chartered, privately owned national mortgage associations with power to buy and sell mortgages and issue bonds against them to the general public. 
    Several national policy objectives were expressed. 
    One, to provide new sources of mortgage funds. 
    Two, to provide liquidity for mortgage lenders. 
    That is, marketability and I suggest that is a very key element here. 
    Three, to lower the cost of mortgage funds by increasing the supply of funds. 
    And four... and this is another important one... to move mortgage funds from localities where funds were available to areas where credit was in shorter supply. 
    Despite the authorization and the hopes that lay behind it, the program under the 1934 Act was a complete failure. 
    No private mortgage association was ever established under the program and in 1948, fourteen years later, the program was repealed. 
    In 1938 the Federal National Mortgage Association, sometimes called Fannie Mae, was chartered. 
    One of its purposes was to create a secondary market for mortgages, thereby channeling Federal credit to the housing industry but Fannie Mae did not issue mortgage backed securities. 
    In 1954 it was reorganized under a new charter as a mixed ownership Government corporation. 
    It's secondary market function was to be financed by bonds, by funds borrowed in the private market and these obligations were not secured by the United States. 
    It was a number of years later, in 1968, thirty-four years after the beginning of only meagerly successful efforts in this area, that Fannie Mae was divided into two corporations. 
    One of these, Ginnie Mae, Government National Mortgage Association, was established as a wholly-owned Government corporation. 
    The other corporation retained the Fannie Mae name and Government ownership in it was terminated on September 30, 1968. 
    By the terms of the statute, Ginnie Mae is, and I quote Section 1717(a)(2)(A) of Title 12 of the U.S. Code: 
    "Ginnie Mae is in the Department of Housing and Urban Development. " 
    "It has no Board of Directors and its powers are, by statute, exercised by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. " 
    "It has a President who is nominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate. " 
    "Its other officers are appointed by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. " 
    Thus Ginnie Mae is unquestionably an instrumentality of the United States and its obligations are clearly, in the normal sense, obligations of the United States.

    Mr. Erwin N. Griswold 
    There is an understructure but the only obligation is the United States. 
    The Joint Appendix at Pages 56 to the end, has in bold type the text of the bond. 
    I have lodged with the clerk one of the exhibits which shows what they look like. 
    Actually, the original is a little more impressive. 
    It's got a green background and a brown border and this is the Seal of the United States in the center of it. 
    But the language is on Page 58. 
    It's also on the bond or the certificate, a copy of which has been given to you.

    But, Mr. Chief Justice, let me just point a little further in it. 
    Page 58 of the Joint Appendix, the upper righthand corner of the certificate: 
    "Except as hereafter undertaken, this certificate does not constitute a liability of nor evidence any recourse against the issuer. " 
    and then the things which are hereafter undertaken is that the issuer promises that these are true and valid bonds and properly handled but no promise to pay and then, at the bottom of Page 58 appears the Guaranty.

    Yes, I think the Government agrees in its amicus brief. 
    The issuer is an agent. 
    He remains an agent for Ginnie Mae. 
    He collects a service fee. 
    He makes what he gets on the original sale of the bonds but he carries no liability to the holder of this instrument, despite what it says in the first, because that's taken back.

    That all depends upon what actually happens along the way. 
    In normal course, I suppose it's the mortgagor who pays. 
    He pays in wherever he is supposed to pay, which has been arranged by the issuer to accumulate the funds and the issuer then makes the payment, if he has the funds and is able and hasn't gone bankrupt and various other things, to the holder of the certificate.

    Of that he is, but he is the direct promisee of the unqualified pledge of the full faith and credit of the United States made pursuant to an Act of Congress by the Government National Mortgage Association and that is the heart of the case and it is because of that unqualified guarantee that these things have worked. 
    Contrary to the prior experience, where mortgage financing was not very successful, Ginnie Mae bonds are now approaching a 120 billion dollars.

    Ginnie Mae could do things; yes. 
    Ginnie Mae can remove the issuer. 
    It can require the transfer, not only of the custody of the mortgages but their title. 
    It can deal with them. 
    It can do all kinds of things but the only obligation to the holder, is that of Ginnie Mae. 
    Now, Ginnie Mae is unquestionably an instrumentality of the United States. 
    Its obligations are clearly, in the normal sense, obligations of the United States. 
    The Congressional reports leading up to this suggested the creation of a mortgage-backed securities program and the desirability of Federal Government guarantee of such securities. 
    Congress adopted such a program, including for the first time the Federal guarantee. 
    The program has been a great success and it is quite clear that making the Federal Government's credit available through the guarantee has been the key to that success.

 There's nothing in the law that requires you to have a signature.

    Mr. Erwin N. Griswold 
    But I think it is irrelevant in view of that language, "Except as hereinafter undertaken". 
    It could hardly be clearer and was intended. 
    There's an aspect of the 1968 reorganization which seems of special significance. 
    Two corporations were established by that Act. 
    One of these, Fannie Mae, is privately owned and Congress expressly provided, twice in the Federal Housing Act, now found in Section 17/19 of Title 12: 
    "The corporation #"-- 
    That is Fannie Mae. 
    "# shall insert appropriate language in all of its obligations issued under this sub-section, clearly indicating that such obligations, together with the interest thereon, are not guaranteed by the United States and do not constitute a debt or obligation of the United States or of any Agency or Instrumentality thereof, other than the corporation. " 
    And the contrast with the powers granted to Ginnie Mae, just two sections later, is very great. 
    I may add that Ginnie Mae issues are quoted daily in the Wall Street Journal. 
    This is the current column... it's not all Ginnie Mae... Ginnie Mae is down here under the heading Government Agency Issues. 
    Ginnie Mae futures are quoted in the New York Times daily. 
    Baron's, which is a widely-used financial sheet under the heading Bonds, Government, has two places where Ginnie Maes are quoted. 
    One of futures. 
    Mortgage securities dealers make primary and secondary cash markets in these securities, providing for both immediate and future transfer. 
    There are futures markets in Ginnie Maes and on major exchanges, and exchange-based Ginnie Mae options have been authorized by the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
    Any broker can get current quotations on Ginnie Mae bonds by ticker.

    --Very likely not. 
    And this is one reason why I have been stressing this marketability quoted, treated like bonds. 
    The Veterans Administration undertaking is mortgage-by-mortgage. 
    You're still responsible if you have the mortgage, if they don't pay, you've got to go out and find them and it there has to be foreclosure, you have to do it. 
    The Federal Housing Administration is an insurance program and there are a number of limitations, including the fact that the interest isn't insured. 
    The thing that has made these things marketable and which has attracted large sums of money into it, is this unqualified promise of the United States, pursuant to an Act of Congress, pledging the full faith and credit of the United States.

    Mr. Erwin N. Griswold 
    Now, there is a good deal of talk in the other side's briefs about the case of Smith and Davis. 
    That is dealt with extensively in our brief and in our reply brief and I think I will leave it to that now. 
    The introduction of the full faith and credit of the United States in the Ginnie Mae certificate opened the floodgates. 
    Thereafter, the financing of home mortgages was like traffic on a four-lane highway, with the money flowing freely to a total now approaching, as I've said, 120 billion dollars. 
    Prior to that, without the guarantee, mortgages were not effectively marketable. 
    In those pre-Ginnie Mae days it was like a winding country road with speed blocks and the money only trickled, and this serves, as I have said, to distinguish the Ginnie Mae certificates from Veterans Administration guarantees or from FHA insurance. 
    Congress has spoken in broad and unqualified terms in Section 742. 
    Within both the ordinary and the technical meaning of the language, the certificates clearly state an obligation involving the full faith and credit of the United States. 
    There is no reason to give that language an artificial construction. 
    Whether the language is too broad is essentially a political question. 
    The statute can be changed by Congress where the many competing factors can be appropriately considered and I would call attention to the State's brief, Page 33/34 where they say essentially that. 
    The statutory language seems unusually clear and applicable and it should not be rewritten by this Court. 
    The judgment below should be reversed. 
   
   
   
   Argument of Patricia Rosen

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Thank you, Mr. Griswold.

speaker="patricia_rosen" startTime="1713.355" stopTime="1794.557">
    Ms. Patricia Rosen 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    I would like to first talk for a moment, if I might, about the Ginnie Mae certificates themselves and who is obligated on the face of the certificates. 
    As the Court pointed out, the certificate itself states that the issuer, who is named on the face of the certificate, undertakes to promise to pay to Rockford Life Insurance Company payments of both principal and interest on the certificate. 
    In addition, I would like to point out that as the Appellate Court noted in its opinion, the certificates involved in this case are what is generically known as modified pass-through certificates. 
    That is, the issuer undertakes to pay both principal and interest, not only as a straight pass-through, that is, as those payments are received by the mortgagor... paid in by the mortgagor, but whether or not those payments are received. 
    Specifically, I would like to invite the Court's attention to page 57, in the center of the second paragraph. 
    The line I'm referring to reads: 
    "However, the issuer shall pay to holder, whether or not collected by the issuer, and shall remit as set forth below, monthly payment on both principal and interest. "

    Ms. Patricia Rosen 
    Yes, Your Honor, I agree that the holder of the certificate has no recourse against the issuer. 
    However, counsel for the taxpayer here tries to make that the determinative factor in the case and we strongly disagree with such excessive reliance on simple enforceability by the holder of the certificate. 
    There are other agreements, as pointed out by both the Appellate Court and the Supreme Court, in rejecting this argument of the taxpayer. 
    The issuer has promised, not only on the face of the certificate but also in the guarantee agreement which is signed with Ginnie Mae and, as pointed out by the Court in the opening argument, Ginnie Mae is the one who enforces this obligation of this issuer. 
    It is not the holder of the certificate but it is Ginnie Mae. 
    But certainly the issuer, in this case the Kissell Company, is liable on these certificates and that liability is enforced.

    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    Well, I thought the reason it might be important that there was an obligor to respond to any complaints on the part of the holder, other than a Government corporation, was part of the language in Smith against Davis, where it says that one of the characteristics of the obligation of the United States is a binding promise by the United States to pay specified sums and specified dates.
speaker="patricia_rosen" startTime="1903.776" stopTime="1923.273">
    Ms. Patricia Rosen 
    --But I believe what the Court was referring to in Smith versus Davis is that the promise should not be, as it is in this case, only activated in the event of the default on the basis of the primary obligor, but it should be a binding promise from the beginning. 
    In other words, a bond, a stock, something where the United States is obligated to--

    It can only be sued by Ginnie Mae to enforce its obligations. 
    It cannot be sued by the holder of the certificate. 
    It's not that the obligation is unenforceable. 
    The obligation, number one, is there. 
    It's printed on the face of the certificate. 
    It is in the guarantee agreement, so it is obligated.

    Ms. Patricia Rosen 
    That's correct. 
    Under the circumstances which, hopefully, I have just described to you, the question involved in this case concerns the ability of the States, in particular Illinois here, to impose a tax on these mortgage-backed securities which are guaranteed by Ginnie Mae. 
    More broadly, it involves a question of the doctrine of intergovernmental tax immunity, which unquestionably provides that both the State Governments themselves, and the Federal Government, the property of those Governments, their instrumentalities and their obligations must be free from taxation by the other Government. 
    The purpose of this doctrine is to allow both Governments, both at the State and Federal level, to coexist without undue interference by the other Government, through the exercise of its taxing power. 
    It is important, when deciding any question under this doctrine, however, to recognize that the power to raise revenue by taxation is, itself, essential to the operation of any sovereign Government, because it is the only way through which that Government is able to raise the funds necessary to its operation and, therefore, this Court has always been unwilling to broadly interpret either the constitutional or the statutory immunity from taxation.

    Ms. Patricia Rosen 
    I believe because, under an earlier interpretation by the Department of Local Government Affairs, they didn't think they were able to impose the tax. 
    There was a question raised at the Appellate Court and Supreme Court level of estoppel, relying on a previous interpretation of the Department, which was later changed. 
    It is unquestionably true that any securities which are issued directly to raise money for the operation of a Government cannot be taxed. 
    And examples of those securities would be stocks, bonds, certificates of indebtedness, Treasury bills and the like. 
    However, we submit that this immunity should not be extended to cover obligations which are issued by private institutions merely because they are Federally guaranteed and the investor has no recourse against the private issuer, in the event the issuer defaults. 
    The taxpayer in this case wants the Court to focus upon this investment transaction from the perspective of the private investor in a default situation and we submit that this is an inappropriate focus for the Court, for several reasons. 
    First of all, it gives a distorted view of the program and does not take into consideration the primary focus of the Court should be on the degree of interference caused with the operation of the Federal Government and the operation of the program itself. 
    As pointed out by amicus on National Governors Association and the like in their brief, 38 States and the District of Columbia, impose not property taxes but income taxes, which would also be barred under the interpretation which is being advanced by the taxpayer in this case, since neither the obligations themselves, nor the income from those obligations could be subject to State taxation, if you adopt the view proposed by the private taxpayer here.

    Very few impose a property tax. 
    In fact, Illinois no longer imposes the tax which is at issue in this case. 
    Only four states were listed as imposing a property tax on Ginnie Mae bonds but 38 and the District of Columbia tax the income from the bonds.

    Yes, there were a number of replacement taxes issued. 
    Under the Illinois constitution, all taxation of intangible personal property was repealed and the State legislature was required to enact replacement taxes, to cover the income which would be lost by abolishing those taxes.

    Ms. Patricia Rosen 
    I believe it was a wide variety and I can't specifically name a particular... they were state-wide taxes, called replacement taxes but the tax itself was not abolished having anything to do with the issues which are presented by this Court. 
    It was abolished along with all other property taxes on intangibles. 
    And as I pointed out previously, focusing on the recourse by a private investor in the event of a default, is inappropriate because it gives a distorted view of the Ginnie Mae program. 
    Default, as pointed out by the statistics which are reproduced in several of the briefs, are quite rare and, therefore, it has not been shown that the State taxation imposes any real impediment to the success of the Federal program or interferes in any significant way with the operation of the program. 
    As of fiscal 1984, as the briefs point out, the cumulative total of the securities issued by Ginnie Mae was in excess of 215 billion dollars. 
    Contingent liability as of that year was 175 1/2 billion dollars a actual liability amounted to $98,532. 
    To require the States to refrain from taxing a program in excess of 215 billion dollars on the basis of liability somewhat less than $100,000, is not a sensible construction of constitutional or statutory tax immunity. 
    Furthermore, the task which the taxpayer proposes in this case completely ignores the real consideration whenever this Court seeks to determine whether securities should be exempted from State taxation. 
    The focus here should be exclusively on the degree of interference with the Federal Government's program and such interference has not been shown here. 
    In this case, the immunity which the taxpayer seeks, would primarily serve to shield private investments from State taxation. 
    So that immunity is not mandated either by the Constitution or by the Statute. 
    Unlike stocks, bonds or Treasury bills, Ginnie Mae certificates are issued by private banking institutions, not the Government and those private institutions are primarily liable on these certificates. 
    The Government's liability is contingent and unliquidated. 
    The issuance if Ginnie Maes does not increase the public debt, nor does it secure funds for the operation of the Federal Government and these were essentially the tasks which this Court stressed in the Smith case. 
    In Smith the Court looked to several factors, but the factors which essentially we would ask the Court to consider here are, first of all, there is no credit instrument or instrument which is utilized by the Federal Government in order to raise revenue. 
    This is the most important factor because, essentially, what this Court is doing when it says the State cannot impose a tax on these obligations, it is excluding an entire area from the ability of the States to impose taxes. 
    Where the area relates to the ability of the Federal Government to raise revenue, certainly the function involved is an essential one to the operation of--

    Well, Your Honor, I would point out first of all, that there has... since tax is imposed, at least on the income on these certificates in most States, there hasn't been shown to be any serious adverse impact on the operation of the program.

    Ms. Patricia Rosen 
    Yes, Your Honor, that is correct. 
    That is part of the initial agreements which are entered into. 
    When a mortgage lending institution wants to become an issuer of Ginnie Maes, they assemble a pool of mortgages generally in excess of a million dollars and then they apply to become an issuer and, in doing that, their financial situation is scrutinized and also they must supply fidelity bonds to guarantee performance. 
    Essentially, what the taxpayer seeks to do in this case is to expand the doctrine of Federal tax immunity to cover a Federally guaranteed, private investment transaction. 
    Such immunity should not be conferred in the absence of a decision that it is necessary to the success of the Federal program and we submit that decision is one which should be made by Congress-- 
    Here Congress has never indicated either in the statute creating Ginnie Mae, that these bonds... that it intended to, in the language itself nor in the legislative history, is there any indication that it intended, when it authorized Ginnie Mae to guarantee these obligations, that it intended to confer immunity from State taxation and this Court has many, many times indicated that the question of whether the constitutional and statutory immunity should be expanded is one which is best left to Congress, because it is a question which is essentially legislative in nature. 
    Congress here has not indicated that immunity from State taxation is necessary to the success of this program. 
    The program has been phenomenally successful without immunity from State taxation and we would ask this Court to agree with the decisions of the Illinois Appellate and Supreme Courts and to hold that Ginnie Mae securities are not obligations of the Federal Government and they are not entitled to either statutory or constitutional immunity. 
    Thank you.

    Ms. Rosen's final argument simply ignores Section 742, which is the whole basis of our claim for exemption.

    Mr. Erwin N. Griswold 
    --In any event, States have been taxing the income. 
    On the other hand, States generally did not impose property taxes. 
    There are only four states which now impose property taxes. 
    They came to it lately, particularly after there was an Illinois decision sustaining it and now Illinois has abandoned the property tax. 
    It is perfectly clear that the key to the success of this program is the Government guarantee. 
    Using patent language, 
    "that was a stroke of genius. " 
    It changed things from one level to a wholly higher level. 
    As one of the witnesses in this record, Joint Appendix on Page 54, said: 
    "But rather than taxpayer money for it, the Ginnie Mae was one of the real beautiful devices that has come along to attract private capital but you use the Government's credit in order to make it credit worthy. " 
    And this is a situation where the Government has wisely and successfully used its credit but it is the Government's credit which is being used through an instrumentality of the United States and that should make it not subject to State property taxes.
