Société Nationale Industrielle Aérospatiale v. United States District Court for the Southern District of Iowa
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="0.000" stopTime="18.431">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    We will hear arguments first this morning in No. 85-1695, Societe Nationale Industrielle, et cetera, versus United States District Court for the Southern District of Iowa. 
    Mr. Ford, you may proceed whenever you are ready.
speaker="john_w_ford" startTime="18.431" stopTime="178.226">
    Mr. John W. Ford 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this case concerns The Hague Evidence Convention which establishes procedures for gathering evidence located on the soil of other signator nations. 
    The United States and the other Convention signators before the Court all agree the court below erred in holding the Convention does not apply here. 
    They all agree the decision of the Eighth Circuit should be vacated and the case remanded. 
    The major issue before the Court today is how to harmonize the Convention with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure because both are the law of the United States. 
    As the amicus briefs show, the extent to which the Convention displaces U.S. discovery rules is a question on which the Convention signators hold divergent views. 
    To reconcile those differences and to effectuate the Convention's purpose, today we urge the Court to adopt a general rule requiring resort by American courts to The Hague Evidence Convention in the first instance. 
    The Convention preamble states its basic purpose of mutual judicial cooperation in civil or commercial matters. 
    Its history shows the Convention was adopted in large measure to avoid the friction created by the extraterritorial application of American discovery procedures as the new restatement of the law of foreign relations of the United States recognizes American attempts to conduct discovery abroad have been a major source of friction with our European trading partners. 
    In negotiation of the treaty the United States obtained significant concessions from the civil law nations on the basis that Convention procedures would be a substitute for the unsupervised extraterritorial use of American discovery rules, or as some writers have referred to it, legal tourism by American lawyers on the discovery trail. 
    At the bargaining table the civil law nations made clear they regarded such American discovery practices as invasive of their sovereign rights. 
    Ultimately, the civil law nations agreed to liberalize and simplify the process for obtaining evidence through their Courts for use abroad as the quid pro quo for lessening foreign intrusions of their sovereignty.

    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Mr. Ford, may I just interrupt? 
    You say your position now is that they should resort to The Hague Convention in the first instance. 
    Is that the same position you took in the trial court?
speaker="john_w_ford" startTime="186.910" stopTime="195.955">
    Mr. John W. Ford 
    Justice Stevens, it is to this extent. 
    In the trial court we urged first upon the Court exclusive use.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="195.955" stopTime="196.486">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Right.
speaker="john_w_ford" startTime="196.486" stopTime="198.437">
    Mr. John W. Ford 
    Alternatively we argued--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="198.437" stopTime="200.514">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    And are you abandoning the exclusive use position?
speaker="john_w_ford" startTime="200.514" stopTime="251.524">
    Mr. John W. Ford 
    --We are not abandoning, Justice Stevens, the exclusive use position. 
    As a French national, my client supports the position of its home sovereign as stated in the amicus brief filed for the Republic of France. 
    However, as an independent entity, an independently managed entity, although albeit we are owned, our shares are owned by the government of France, we must face the practical results of litigating before United States courts, and recognizing the position taken by the Solicitor General, particularly after the opinion given to the Court in Falzon, Volkswagen versus Falzon, cited in the briefs, we today urge the Court for a general rule for American courts of first use.

speaker="john_w_ford" startTime="298.771" stopTime="334.710">
    Mr. John W. Ford 
    I believe in the American courts the opinions below have a great deal of confusion. 
    A number of cases, without saying so, look upon the Convention in a particular case as somehow a conflict of law problem with foreign law, and as the Justice observed, it is not foreign law, it is the law of the United States. 
    Very few cases have, and we have cited them in the brief, addressed the problem of reconciling The Hague Evidence Convention with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="334.710" stopTime="349.970">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Mr. Ford, as I understand it, the Solicitor General doesn't agree that it has to always be resorted to in the first instance, does he? 
    how does your position now differ from that of the Solicitor General, would you say?
speaker="john_w_ford" startTime="349.970" stopTime="362.247">
    Mr. John W. Ford 
    The present position of the Solicitor General as I understand it, Justice O'Connor, is, this case should be remanded for a case by case comity analysis.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="362.247" stopTime="368.901">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Which wouldn't necessarily require a resort to the Hague procedures in the first instance.
speaker="john_w_ford" startTime="368.901" stopTime="389.457">
    Mr. John W. Ford 
    In our view a comity analysis certainly in this case and any similar case necessarily leads to that conclusion, but the rule proposed a change from the Solicitor General's earlier position in Volkswagen versus Falzon, where the Solicitor General of the United States amicus took the position the Convention was exclusive--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="389.457" stopTime="389.970">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Right.
speaker="john_w_ford" startTime="389.970" stopTime="404.809">
    Mr. John W. Ford 
    --just a few years ago, now turns us to the suggestion the case be sent back for American courts in each case to have a factually laden, a factually burdened comity inquiry.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="404.809" stopTime="411.946">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    And as I understand it it would not under his view, at least, require resort in the first instance to The Hague procedures--
speaker="john_w_ford" startTime="411.946" stopTime="412.274">
    Mr. John W. Ford 
    That is--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="412.274" stopTime="413.086">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    --necessarily.
speaker="john_w_ford" startTime="413.086" stopTime="414.679">
    Mr. John W. Ford 
    --That is my understanding.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="414.679" stopTime="438.515">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Now, what is your position on who has the burden of proof to show what other procedures can accommodate a plaintiff's needs? 
    For example, does your client, being a foreign national, should your client have the burden of proof on what accommodation should be made, if any?
speaker="john_w_ford" startTime="438.515" stopTime="463.191">
    Mr. John W. Ford 
    I do not believe so, Justice O'Connor, because it is not a fact question. 
    To the extent we have a factual inquiry, of course, of comity analysis it would rest with the party proposing it, but it is not a fact question. 
    I do not view it and submit it is not a conflict of law question. 
    It is part of the law of the forum, and for the application of the proper law of the forum no one has the burden of proof.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="463.191" stopTime="487.431">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Well, certainly the foreign national is going to know what the procedures are in that country better than the American litigant, presumably, and you don't think there should be any burden on the foreign national, at least, to go forward and establish what the procedures are which are available in the foreign country?
speaker="john_w_ford" startTime="487.431" stopTime="521.530">
    Mr. John W. Ford 
    I do not, Justice O'Connor. 
    I think it is a logical assumption to be made but it does need further analysis. 
    I speak as one in that position, and I have no better information than respondent. 
    If I do, of course, I pass it immediately to him. 
    We share the same information. 
    There is, I submit, no proper warrant for placing a burden of proof concept upon a party urging the applicability of The Hague Evidence Convention outside of the comity analysis. 
    It is the law of the forum.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="521.530" stopTime="562.375">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Well, Mr. Ford, are you urging the applicability of The Hague Convention? 
    I admire your statesmanship in backing off from the position that it is exclusive and you must use it, but once you back off of that position, what is left other than the doctrine of comity? 
    But we didn't need The Hague Convention for the doctrine of comity. 
    That presumably existed before The Hague Convention was even entered into. 
    And I don't see why the obligation of a federal court to consider the sensitivities of foreign governments is increased a whit by the existence of The Hague Convention from what it was before that was adopted. 
    So how is the Hague Convention a part of your argument any more?
speaker="john_w_ford" startTime="562.375" stopTime="575.245">
    Mr. John W. Ford 
    Well, Justice Scalia if I may point out, we are urging that this be a rule for all American courts. 
    As we see from the cases below state courts must deal with the problem as well.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="575.245" stopTime="581.571">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    I understand, but what imposes that rule? 
    Where does that rule come from? 
    It doesn't come from The Hague Convention, if The Hague Convention is not exclusive.
speaker="john_w_ford" startTime="581.571" stopTime="589.522">
    Mr. John W. Ford 
    It comes from a consideration of comity, which we have discussed in the brief.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="589.522" stopTime="592.552">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Right, which would have existed before The Hague Convention, right?
speaker="john_w_ford" startTime="592.552" stopTime="594.988">
    Mr. John W. Ford 
    Yes, that is true, Justice Scalia. 
    Also--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="594.988" stopTime="596.550">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    So we can just stop talking about The Hague Convention.
speaker="john_w_ford" startTime="596.550" stopTime="598.191">
    Mr. John W. Ford 
    --Well, I would like to say--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="598.191" stopTime="607.844">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    And all we are discussing is whether as a matter of comity American courts should generally not conduct discovery abroad, or not permit discovery to be conducted abroad.
speaker="john_w_ford" startTime="607.844" stopTime="634.334">
    Mr. John W. Ford 
    --I should have made it clear in the first instance, a reading of the Convention itself and the Convention history supports prior to any resort to comity principles the proposition that The Hague Evidence Convention by an American court must be... must be used in the first instance. 
    Resort must be had in the first instance. 
    It is clear that any fair reading of the negotiations, the bargaining table--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="634.334" stopTime="647.142">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    May I interrupt you? 
    Must be used? 
    Suppose a plaintiff serves you with an interrogatory, did you place this ad in this flying magazine, and you could answer it yes or no. 
    You say you can't answer that question without requiring resort to The Hague Convention?
speaker="john_w_ford" startTime="647.142" stopTime="648.376">
    Mr. John W. Ford 
    --We do not, Justice Stevens.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="648.376" stopTime="652.484">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    So it is not must in every sense. 
    It is something you could waive as a defense.
speaker="john_w_ford" startTime="652.484" stopTime="656.405">
    Mr. John W. Ford 
    We have responded to all discovery against us.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="656.405" stopTime="660.201">

    And you didn't violate any international treaties by doing that, did you?
speaker="john_w_ford" startTime="660.201" stopTime="666.152">
    Mr. John W. Ford 
    Based on any and all information we could get in the United States. 
    It is not part of the Joint Appendix. 
    We did admit--

    I understand--

speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="670.182" stopTime="674.057">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    --And by doing so you acted consistently with the Convention, as I understand.
speaker="john_w_ford" startTime="674.057" stopTime="674.666">
    Mr. John W. Ford 
    That is our position.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="674.666" stopTime="681.617">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Well, then, when must the Convention first be resorted to, just whenever the defendant, whenever the party opposing discovery requests that they do?
speaker="john_w_ford" startTime="681.617" stopTime="711.073">
    Mr. John W. Ford 
    When we are unable within the United States to reach the evidence gathering process to respond, we or any other party, or, to put it another way, when the evidence must be gathered by whatever means on foreign soil of a signator, it is not the nationality, if the Court will permit, that controls, and there is where we find much confusion below. 
    It is the geographic location of the evidence, whatever the evidence may be.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="711.073" stopTime="721.960">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Even if the officer of the corporate defendant who is subject to the jurisdiction of the American court could write a letter that says please send me a copy of this document, it still means they have to go through The Hague Convention?
speaker="john_w_ford" startTime="721.960" stopTime="724.132">
    Mr. John W. Ford 
    That is our position, because otherwise the divergent--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="724.132" stopTime="725.271">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Even if the officer is willing to do it?
speaker="john_w_ford" startTime="725.271" stopTime="740.937">
    Mr. John W. Ford 
    --That is correct, because in the case of France we have the defensive legislation referred to in the cases as the blocking statute, a term we have adopted to avoid confusion, and in the case put to me by Justice--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="740.937" stopTime="744.577">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    The statute, which, if I understand it correctly, you would not have needed if the Convention means what you say it means.
speaker="john_w_ford" startTime="744.577" stopTime="747.152">
    Mr. John W. Ford 
    --We would not have needed--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="747.152" stopTime="751.057">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    At least if the Convention is exclusive you wouldn't have needed that statute.
speaker="john_w_ford" startTime="751.057" stopTime="810.662">
    Mr. John W. Ford 
    --Well, it isn't so much a question of our need as France's declaration of its own policy. 
    The statute is a criminal statute. 
    It is a declaration of the policy of France with respect to essentially growing out of its judicial control as a civil law nation of evidence gathering within its borders, as we know, of course, vastly different from common law countries and the American courts. 
    In the case of the corporate officer that the Court posed to me again it is the location of the evidence. 
    Of course the Court has jurisdiction over him, has the power, but the inquiry is whether or not it is a proper exercise of that power in ordering a foreign national over whom an American court has jurisdiction to gather evidence on the foreign soil of a signatory when it is the clear and unambiguous policy of that foreign country signatory that it and it alone controls evidence gathering on its soil and within its borders.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="810.662" stopTime="822.315">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Would this be true also of an American corporation with a French wholly owned subsidiary? 
    The American corporation could also say that the evidence that you request is in France and we insist that you follow the procedures?
speaker="john_w_ford" startTime="822.315" stopTime="838.544">
    Mr. John W. Ford 
    If we have the situation where the evidence reposes on French soil and French soil alone and we are dealing with the The Hague Convention, again, it is the location of the evidence controls.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="838.544" stopTime="845.243">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Right, even if it is a wholly owned subsidiary, say, of General Motors or some company like that? 
    They could make the same objection, I suppose.
speaker="john_w_ford" startTime="845.243" stopTime="861.722">
    Mr. John W. Ford 
    That is correct. 
    They are in the same position. 
    The first use rule, as I have recited, we believe, does reconcile the divergent viewpoints. 
    France regards the Convention as exclusive.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="861.722" stopTime="876.827">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    I don't understand... if I understood your response to Justice O'Connor correctly, it isn't a first use rule. 
    Or if it is a first use rule it is substantially different from what the Solicitor General is proposing. 
    Right?
speaker="john_w_ford" startTime="876.827" stopTime="877.607">
    Mr. John W. Ford 
    It is.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="877.607" stopTime="886.650">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Okay, so you think that you always must do it first, or generally must do it first? 
    What is--
speaker="john_w_ford" startTime="886.650" stopTime="887.275">
    Mr. John W. Ford 
    Always.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="887.275" stopTime="887.916">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    --Always?
speaker="john_w_ford" startTime="887.916" stopTime="913.096">
    Mr. John W. Ford 
    Absent an absolute extreme situation where there has been a demonstrated record that this would be completely futile. 
    We find none of that in the courts below. 
    We find American courts speculating what a contracting national sovereign, a contracting state might or might not do. 
    There is the first folly. 
    That is for the contracting state. 
    And this... and it is in the record in this case.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="913.096" stopTime="931.527">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    And this would be so even though it has become clear from the past experience of a particular federal court or of all the federal courts or state courts that a particular country, a particular signatory to the Convention in fact has not permitted these procedures to be used properly?
speaker="john_w_ford" startTime="931.527" stopTime="932.433">
    Mr. John W. Ford 
    Or has returned--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="932.433" stopTime="933.043">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Right.

    Mr. John W. Ford 
    --letter after letter of request unexecuted. 
    We now have a developed record in that situation, Justice Scalia, and that is exactly what we are contending is the wisdom of the general rule. 
    The American courts have no reported experience with France or any of the other signatory nations, certainly with France--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="953.160" stopTime="954.972">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Right. 
    Are you going to answer my question, though?

    Mr. John W. Ford 
    --of dissatisfaction.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="955.457" stopTime="961.532">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Are you going to answer my question? 
    What if you do have such experience? 
    Does your first use rule still apply?
speaker="john_w_ford" startTime="961.532" stopTime="969.343">
    Mr. John W. Ford 
    That is for the Court upon a record to create an exception to the general rule, so my answer would be--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="969.343" stopTime="974.403">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    So it isn't absolute first use rule. 
    A court can use some factors to say--

    Mr. John W. Ford 
    --Of course. 
    Of course.

    Mr. John W. Ford 
    --And I didn't quite make it clear. 
    The position is, for a general rule with the Court to carve out such exceptions as experience warrants, it is that experience that is currently lacking.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="989.789" stopTime="1001.909">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    And as experience warrants. 
    What other exceptions might there be besides the fact that we know that a particular foreign country won't in fact allow these procedures to be used properly? 
    Anything else?
speaker="john_w_ford" startTime="1001.909" stopTime="1019.933">
    Mr. John W. Ford 
    Obviously where there are some exceptions or reservations taken that show incompatibility and collide with overriding national interests of the United States is one that occurs to me, but I say that only experience could determine this with a general rule in place from this Court.

    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Mr. Ford, for example, haven't some countries party to the Convention made an Article 23 reservation so that, for example, documents will not be... requests for documents will not be honored.

    The position of France today is as expressed in the letter from the Minister of Justice to the Minister of Foreign Affairs in Appendix A to the amicus brief for the Republic of France.

Justice O'Connor's question was today, and I understand the letter has just gone out or is just going out in furtherance of the interdepartmental memorandum, but the Convention, the Report of Convention Proceedings in 1985 shows the civil law countries do not have the same understanding that American courts think they do with respect to unfocused document requests on the one hand as opposed to pretrial discovery as known in the common law countries on the other.

speaker="john_w_ford" startTime="1255.516" stopTime="1377.311">
    Mr. John W. Ford 
    Yes. 
    Well, following, for example, the Interhandle case, or Societe Internationale versus Rogers, cited in the brief, we suggest that following the analysis the court would fashion an appropriate discovery order, a workaday item for any American trial court, and in fashioning that appropriate order it would not make dismissals or such similar types of sanctions become routine at all, if ever. 
    Indeed, in fashioning an appropriate order it would consider such options as evidentiary preclusion, the issue elimination, perhaps, other type of similar control over the evidentiary stream as the result of a limitation on the flow of pretrial information. 
    And of course therefore it is then for the party whose evidence is on foreign soil to consider in a genuinely voluntary basis the use of the Chapter 2 proceedings, and there is the other option that has been removed from any nationals, be they foreign nationals as my client or anyone else, where the evidence can be found only abroad. 
    Without that appropriate discovery order fashioned, Justice White, they cannot adequately consider what could be done under voluntary methods and considered in the proper light. 
    We ask here, of course, that respondent avail itself of the Convention as we have from the beginning. 
    They have not chosen to do so, which has brought us here. 
    The first use rule, we submit, as a general rule, with exceptions carved out as necessary, has every chance of working in practice and is exactly what is needed to develop an experience in this area within the American courts subject, of course, to review at appropriate stages by this Court. 
    I would like to reserve if I may any remaining time I have for rebuttal.

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Thank you, Mr. Ford.

speaker="jeffrey_p_minear" startTime="1380.966" stopTime="1415.390">
    Mr. Jeffrey P. Minear 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the United States agrees that the Court of Appeals erred in holding that The Hague Evidence Convention has no application in this case. 
    We do not agree, however, that this Court should adopt a general first use rule in using the Convention. 
    Instead, the determination whether to use the Convention should be made on a case by case basis. 
    The judgment below should therefore be vacated and the case remanded for further proceedings.

    Mr. Jeffrey P. Minear 
    Falzon dealt with the problem of oral depositions on foreign soil. 
    The United States adheres to the position that those depositions are improper without the consent of the foreign nation.

speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="1457.034" stopTime="1464.483">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Now, as to the taking of depositions do you adhere to the position that The Hague Convention procedures are exclusive?

    Mr. Jeffrey P. Minear 
    --No. 
    No, we do not, Your Honor. 
    There is a statement on Page 6 of the Falzon brief that mentioned exclusivity, which said strictly within the confines of depositions on foreign soil. 
    We still believe that depositions could be taken in the United States without violation of a nation's judicial sovereignty.

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    So why didn't we use comity before with respect to England? 
    Are you aware of any federal court that felt compelled in a discovery matter to withhold action until use of the British internal procedures for obtaining the information was resorted to?
speaker="jeffrey_p_minear" startTime="1558.343" stopTime="1572.870">
    Mr. Jeffrey P. Minear 
    Prior to the formulation of The Hague Convention these issues typically arose in the case of depositions that were to take place on foreign soil. 
    In a number of cases American litigants simply went to the foreign country and attempted to take depositions, and this, in fact, was what the genesis for the Convention was.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1572.870" stopTime="1575.134">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    But weren't those third party depositions, for the cost part?
speaker="jeffrey_p_minear" startTime="1575.134" stopTime="1577.743">
    Mr. Jeffrey P. Minear 
    For the most part they were. 
    That is correct, Your honor. 
    Now--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="1577.743" stopTime="1591.988">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Well, Mr. Minear, does the fact that this country has entered into The Hague Convention now weigh in the comity balance? 
    Is it now a factor in the comity analysis?
speaker="jeffrey_p_minear" startTime="1591.988" stopTime="1638.272">
    Mr. Jeffrey P. Minear 
    --Your Honor, it weighs in in this way, that the foreign nations generally view The Hague Convention as exclusive. 
    The United States' view is that this supplements American procedures for obtaining evidence. 
    It does impose obligations on the United States in response to your question, Justice Scalia, particularly as a receiving state. 
    We now have to meet the minimum requirements for providing evidence to foreign countries, and they do likewise. 
    But with respect to the comity analysis the conflict right now exists in the fact that we view this as a supplemental matter and that parties in the United States can typically choose among the discovery methods they might use. 
    The respondents here are free to use the Convention if they wish under American laws but they are not mandated to do so. 
    This is where the conflict arises, and this is why there is a need for a comity type of analysis.

    But I mean there is no comity involved.

    Mr. Jeffrey P. Minear 
    --As a receiving state that is correct, Your Honor.

    The treaty, the Constitution says a treaty is it.
speaker="jeffrey_p_minear" startTime="1671.776" stopTime="1674.477">
    Mr. Jeffrey P. Minear 
    Yes, but it only provides a supplement--

    Mr. Jeffrey P. Minear 
    --Your Honor, yes, the treaty is mandatory insofar as we must provide evidence to foreign countries. 
    Now, a court adjudicating a transnational dispute is faced with a choice of employing The Hague Convention, using traditional American discovery methods, or a combination of both methods. 
    Petitioners contend that the Court must always choose the Convention, at least in the first instance, to obtain any foreign evidence.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="1701.623" stopTime="1719.756">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, that is a perfectly fair position, and even if comity wouldn't have required resorting to foreign mechanisms in the first instance, it is perfectly fair to argue that The Hague Convention does require it, no matter what comity would have said.
speaker="jeffrey_p_minear" startTime="1719.756" stopTime="1721.053">
    Mr. Jeffrey P. Minear 
    We disagree.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="1721.053" stopTime="1728.643">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    I know. 
    Why do you? 
    Why do you say that The Hague Convention does not require first resort?
speaker="jeffrey_p_minear" startTime="1728.643" stopTime="1747.948">
    Mr. Jeffrey P. Minear 
    Our view is, first of all, there is nothing in the Convention that indicates a first use requirement, and there is nothing in the ratification history that indicates a first use requirement as well, but furthermore petitioner's rule rests on the assumption that The Hague Convention will always produce fair, effective, and efficient discovery, and that is a matter that is subject to considerable debate.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="1747.948" stopTime="1753.883">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, if it just requires first resort I am not so sure about that.
speaker="jeffrey_p_minear" startTime="1753.883" stopTime="1764.347">
    Mr. Jeffrey P. Minear 
    Your Honor, the problem here is a domestic plaintiff who is forced to go through first resort to the Convention may in fact encounter so many obstacles that he is forced to give up his lawsuit.

    Mr. Jeffrey P. Minear 
    Then that would be controlling.

speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1776.685" stopTime="1790.962">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    So we are just talking basically about how stringent the provisions of The Hague Convention are, you know, what impetus Congress gave or the executive gave to require some sort of use of it before you get to ordinary discovery proceedings.

    Mr. Jeffrey P. Minear

speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="1798.538" stopTime="1817.982">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, if we construe, if we say that The Hague Convention does not require exclusive use or first resort, do we have to decide anything else? 
    Do we have to get into comity? 
    Or is the only issue here the effect of The Hague Convention?
speaker="jeffrey_p_minear" startTime="1817.982" stopTime="1833.758">
    Mr. Jeffrey P. Minear 
    We believe that the Court should identify those principles that should control the comity analysis. 
    For instance, we think it is important that a foreign nation identify the foreign interest, the reason why the use of The Hague Convention is necessary within its country. 
    We also believe the Court should stress--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1833.758" stopTime="1842.427">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Are they supposed to do that in each case?

    Mr. Jeffrey P. Minear 
    --Yes, Your Honor, we believe that that is--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1843.957" stopTime="1853.783">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    But did they do that in this case? 
    Didn't they just take a position that there can be no discovery except pursuant to The Hague Convention? 
    They didn't put out any facts that say there is anything special about this lawsuit.
speaker="jeffrey_p_minear" startTime="1853.783" stopTime="1878.071">
    Mr. Jeffrey P. Minear 
    --Yes, Your Honor, but the statement that a foreign nation objects, and being able to point to specific policies of the foreign nation we believe will generally suffice to show that there is a legitimate foreign interest here. 
    Now, some foreign interests are entitled to greater weight or greater comity than perhaps other interests. 
    For instance, we believe that the Court could reasonably conclude that the privacy interests of a nation, for instance, trade secret laws require use of The Hague Convention.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1878.071" stopTime="1885.397">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Yes, but don't they have to say in their motion to limit discovery, we have got a trade secret problem in this case that you have got to be sensitive about, and they didn't do that.
speaker="jeffrey_p_minear" startTime="1885.397" stopTime="1895.941">
    Mr. Jeffrey P. Minear 
    Well, yes, Your Honor, and this brings up another problem. 
    These issues are typically arising in the context of protective orders, and in fact there is a mechanism, the Federal Rules.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1895.941" stopTime="1898.910">

    Mr. Jeffrey P. Minear

    We certainly agree with the result, Your Honor. 
    Where we differ with the parties and the amicus parties to this case is that The Hague Evidence Convention does not apply at all to the discovery requested in this case, that being interrogatories, requests for admissions, and requests for production, for the reason that the discovery requested in this case does not fall within the very terms of the Convention itself, that is, the taking of evidence abroad. 
    In this case the plaintiffs are not abroad taking evidence. 
    The evidence is produced in the United States.

    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    I am really puzzled, because Article 3(g) of the Convention says in words 
    "The letter request shall specify the documents or other property, real or personal, to be inspected. " 
    Now, do you mean it doesn't apply because they are documents possessed by a party? 
    Or it just has no application to document production?
speaker="richard_h_doyle" startTime="2180.967" stopTime="2211.080">
    Mr. Richard H. Doyle, IV 
    No, The Hague Evidence Convention applies to document production, Your Honor. 
    As we view the Convention if the discovery takes place in the United States, in other words, if there are no adversaries, United States adversaries intruding upon French soil, that The Hague Convention does not apply. 
    Those provisions with regard to the production of documents would apply in the taking of a deposition upon French soil.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="2211.080" stopTime="2224.700">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Well, it may not apply in the sense that it mandates that the procedure be adopted, but is it not at least an optional procedure that you could have requested a letter of request and you could have asked the Court to follow The Hague Convention if you thought it would be advantageous?
speaker="richard_h_doyle" startTime="2224.700" stopTime="2229.260">

    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    You see, using the words "doesn't apply" is really kind of a confusing term. 
    When you use it you mean it does not mandate following the procedures, but conceivably it would apply in the sense that it is an optional alternative available to you. 
    What do you mean when you say it doesn't apply?

    Mr. Richard H. Doyle, IV 
    Yes, Your Honor. 
    The exclusivity issue has not been resolved by the signatories to the Convention, and in the 1985 special commission that they had the parties were in disagreement as to whether or not the Convention was exclusive.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="2296.986" stopTime="2314.761">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Now, even if the Court were... even if we were to decide it isn't exclusive, do you think that a trial court has no obligation to consider whether Convention procedures could be followed in obtaining the requested discovery?
speaker="richard_h_doyle" startTime="2314.761" stopTime="2324.491">
    Mr. Richard H. Doyle, IV 
    In this case, Your Honor, it is our position that the trial court indeed has no obligation to consider whether or not Hague Evidence Convention procedures should be applied.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="2324.491" stopTime="2339.157">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    And why? 
    You don't think that the United States interests in getting information might be affected by international concerns to a degree that the Court should consider that question?
speaker="richard_h_doyle" startTime="2339.157" stopTime="2358.509">
    Mr. Richard H. Doyle, IV 
    There are two reasons why it should not apply in this case. 
    Number One, it is our position that we are not intruding upon French judicial sovereignty or French soil in the production of documents, answers to interrogatories, requests for admissions that are made, produced in the United States, and secondly--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="2358.509" stopTime="2385.233">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Well, if we disagree with the court below on that point and believe that if the document is presently on foreign soil and has to be taken from there to be produced here, and if we think that is something that would trigger The Hague Convention as a possible procedure to use, then must the trial court not think about these international concerns?
speaker="richard_h_doyle" startTime="2385.233" stopTime="2427.124">
    Mr. Richard H. Doyle, IV 
    --In this particular case, Your Honor, no. 
    Not in this case, for the reason that, one, the terms of the Convention itself is not exclusive. 
    In a reading of the history, particularly the history of the American adoption of the Convention, clearly shows that there was no intent by the United States to make the Convention exclusive. 
    Thirdly, the problem in this case is that France has adopted Article 23 where they state unequivocally that they will refuse to honor any letters of request for production of documents for pretrial discovery, as known in common law countries.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="2427.124" stopTime="2434.371">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    But now we have the letter from the foreign minister indicating possible availability of the procedure, do we not?
speaker="richard_h_doyle" startTime="2434.371" stopTime="2484.292">
    Mr. Richard H. Doyle, IV 
    Your Honor, I have some difficulties with that letter. 
    Number One, that letter was generated six days before the French amicus brief was filed with this Court. 
    That position was not raised in the lower courts at any other time until six days before they filed their brief. 
    Secondly, that is an intergovernmental communication. 
    It is not the law of France. 
    It has not been adopted by the French legislature. 
    Article 23 indeed has. 
    Another problem with that letter, Your Honor, is, if France receives a favorable ruling from this Court, what is to prevent the Ministry of Justice in France from changing their position away from that letter?

speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2559.014" stopTime="2572.430">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    What if the French lawyer goes to France representing the French company and he is subject to some sort of sanctions by the French government because he is attempting to comply with the District Court discovery order?
speaker="richard_h_doyle" startTime="2572.430" stopTime="2624.785">
    Mr. Richard H. Doyle, IV 
    The safety valve in that case is that the French litigant would inform the District Court that if we comply with this discovery order we are subject to criminal penalties. 
    At that point, I think the District Court has to make an analysis as to whether or not that is a valid argument, in other words, that in fact is going to have. 
    The French have adopted their blocking statute, which makes it a criminal penalty to release certain information. 
    The question is, and the question the District Court should look at is, can that blocking statute be waived, and we don't have any sufficient record in this case.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2624.785" stopTime="2636.530">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Do you think the District Court can focus solely on the concerns of the litigants before it to get information pertinent to their lawsuit and ignore foreign policy considerations in making this sort of a determination?

    Mr. Richard H. Doyle, IV 
    Your Honor, no. 
    In this case we submit that The Hague Evidence Convention is not applicable to the discovery requested. 
    The Court need go no further. 
    If the Court needs not go any further, of course, it doesn't have to make that analysis.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2657.679" stopTime="2669.441">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    When you say it is not applicable, you are saying, I take it, not that it would not be available if you chose to use it, but that by its terms it is not required to be used?
speaker="richard_h_doyle" startTime="2669.441" stopTime="2673.657">
    Mr. Richard H. Doyle, IV 
    Absolutely, Your Honor. 
    It is not required to be used in the circumstances of this case.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="2673.657" stopTime="2694.243">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    What does The Hague Convention have to do with that? 
    Suppose France had a blocking statute and The Hague Convention didn't exist. 
    In that situation do you think the District Court would have no obligation to consider the situation it was putting the litigant in by compelling information to be handed over where perhaps some other means could be devised?
speaker="richard_h_doyle" startTime="2694.243" stopTime="2697.368">
    Mr. Richard H. Doyle, IV 
    Your Honor, the Court certainly has to take into consideration that statute.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="2697.368" stopTime="2713.581">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    So the inapplicability of The Hague statute is really irrelevant. 
    Even if we accept your position that maybe a particular procedure in The Hague Convention was not usable, the District Court should still consider when it is dealing with a foreign litigant what kind of a situation its discovery order is putting him in, no?
speaker="richard_h_doyle" startTime="2713.581" stopTime="2766.062">
    Mr. Richard H. Doyle, IV 
    That's really a two-pronged test. 
    One, does The Hague Evidence Convention apply, and secondly, if it does not can we obtain the information without subjecting someone to the violation of French criminal law. 
    The Societe Internationale versus Rogers case, of course, dealt with that type of situation long before The Hague Evidence Convention came into being. 
    In that case, of course, the Court required the District Court to make a comity analysis to see whether or not in imposing sanctions for failure to make discovery, whether or not the foreign national had made a good faith effort to get around that blocking statute, in other words, to waive that blocking statute.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="2766.062" stopTime="2779.136">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    So your argument about the applicability of The Hague Convention merely goes to the manner in which the comity decision should be made. 
    It doesn't go to whether you make any kind of a comity judgment.
speaker="richard_h_doyle" startTime="2779.136" stopTime="2820.917">
    Mr. Richard H. Doyle, IV 
    That's right. 
    Our position is that rather than make the comity analysis up front is that you make the comity analysis when the discovery procedure falls apart, and you cannot receive the discovery because of the blocking statute. 
    In other words, we need no comity analysis to determine whether or not The Hague Evidence Convention would be applicable in a particular case initially. 
    But when the Court gets down the road to determine whether or not sanctions should be imposed against a foreign national, then, of course, the comity analysis should be made to determine whether or not those sanctions are appropriate.

    Yes, Your Honor.

    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    That would be one way to find out. 
    Did your client explore in this case whether the requested information, for example, about advertisements in the United States could have been obtained from sources outside France?
speaker="richard_h_doyle" startTime="3026.466" stopTime="3065.139">
    Mr. Richard H. Doyle, IV 
    Our client has not, Your Honor. 
    We have presumed that some of that evidence in fact was generated in the United States and in fact was in the United States. 
    Mr. Ford has indicated this morning that the information we were given in response to our discovery requests and documents indeed came from United States sources. 
    We don't know whether or not there is any additional information that could be obtained from United States sources in this particular case.

    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Mr. Doyle, the District Court order, if I remember correctly, permitted you to take depositions only in France, but it did permit you to go ahead and take them. 
    Have you taken any depositions yet?
speaker="richard_h_doyle" startTime="3074.823" stopTime="3091.786">
    Mr. Richard H. Doyle, IV 
    No, we haven't. 
    We have not, Your Honor. 
    Your Honor, I believe the order in the District Court case said that we could take depositions in the United States, but that if we were to take depositions in France, that the provisions of The Hague Evidence Convention would apply.

    Who was your District Judge?
speaker="richard_h_doyle" startTime="3093.615" stopTime="3096.615">
    Mr. Richard H. Doyle, IV 
    It was Magistrate Ronald Longstaff, Your Honor.
speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="3096.615" stopTime="3102.255">
    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    Well, that is why I asked, because I thought it was a magistrate's case, not a District Court's case.
speaker="richard_h_doyle" startTime="3102.255" stopTime="3123.807">
    Mr. Richard H. Doyle, IV 
    The case was submitted to the magistrate under Section 636, Your Honor, for submission. 
    The Hague Evidence Convention is not exclusive in any way. 
    One, the terms of the Convention? 
    don't indicate any--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="3123.807" stopTime="3134.477">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Mr. Doyle, the order says if discovery depositions are to be undertaken the court will require compliance with The Hague Convention. 
    It doesn't say undertaken in France. 
    That is why I thought they had to all be in France. 
    You say I misread the order.
speaker="richard_h_doyle" startTime="3134.477" stopTime="3142.881">
    Mr. Richard H. Doyle, IV 
    --Well, we read the order as saying, if we are to take depositions in France, The Hague Evidence Convention applies.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="3142.881" stopTime="3143.225">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    That is not what it says.
speaker="richard_h_doyle" startTime="3143.225" stopTime="3147.865">
    Mr. Richard H. Doyle, IV 
    I is our position that the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure certainly allow us to--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="3147.865" stopTime="3149.427">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Oh, I see. 
    I see what you are saying.
speaker="richard_h_doyle" startTime="3149.427" stopTime="3151.802">
    Mr. Richard H. Doyle, IV 
    --to require parties--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="3151.802" stopTime="3154.255">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    But you haven't taken any depositions in the United States either, then, have you?
speaker="richard_h_doyle" startTime="3154.255" stopTime="3371.995">
    Mr. Richard H. Doyle, IV 
    --No, we have not, Your Honor. 
    The total extent of discovery in this case is before this Court. 
    And we have proceeded no further. 
    And of course the reason for that, Your Honor, is that we are subjected to a stay which was entered originally by the District Court and then by the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals, and we are still under a stay to this day, so even if be wanted to take additional depositions we could not, Your Honor. 
    The Hague Convention cannot be exclusive. 
    The results, if this Court finds it to be exclusive, particularly in view of France's adoption of Article 23 and the blocking statute, will have significant effects with regard to litigation and also the economy of this country. 
    If The Hague Evidence Convention is exclusive, as argued by some parties in this case, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure necessarily would not apply, and that would include the sanction provisions. 
    This, we submit, would cause the creation of information havens, the example of General Motors using a subsidiary to house its documents in a foreign country, a signatory to The Hague Evidence Convention, with the adoption of an Article 23 and a blocking statute. 
    An American litigant would not be able to obtain those documents, and secondly, it may well create offshore immunity. 
    In other words, an America manufacturer may decide to manufacture his products in a foreign country so he is not subjected in a real sense to liability in this country because they can effectively thwart any meaningful discovery. 
    To thwart any meaningful discovery flies in the face of the fundamental principles of this country's judicial system. 
    Discovery is critical in these cases, and without it American litigants would have their hands tied and be unable to proceed meaningfully with their litigation against foreign nationals. 
    The Court may want to look at the fairness issue in this case. 
    It is totally unfair to allow a French nationalized company to be subject to the in personam jurisdiction of the United States court to be able to shield itself from pretrial discovery by use of The Hague Convention and the blocking statute, and on the other hand and at the same time have the availability of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which are liberal in regard to their discovery positions, to be used offensively against a domestic litigant, and the domestic litigant not having an opportunity to use those same Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. 
    A totally unfair situation, and I think that when the United States adopted the Hague Convention there was no intent that such a result be reached.

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Well, even under your theory you can't get equality. 
    I mean, you acknowledge that you can't take depositions in France under the Federal Rules, right?
speaker="richard_h_doyle" startTime="3381.633" stopTime="3383.163">
    Mr. Richard H. Doyle, IV 
    That is true, Your Honor.

    Mr. Richard H. Doyle, IV

    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    No, I am not talking about the individual. 
    You have got a corporate defendant. 
    You say you don't think you could serve notice to have them produce the president of the corporation if he has knowledge of the whole matter in the United States for testimony?
speaker="richard_h_doyle" startTime="3413.905" stopTime="3425.931">
    Mr. Richard H. Doyle, IV 
    Yes. 
    The United States Court certainly has that power. 
    The Court does not have the power to force that individual to physically come to the United States. 
    If--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="3425.931" stopTime="3432.210">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Well, they can tell the corporation we will dismiss your... strike your answer if you don't show up, or something like that.

    Mr. Richard H. Doyle, IV

    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    --Do you contend there is any difference at all between the power... just forgetting the Convention between the power of the Federal District Judge to order an officer of an American corporation... say his office is in New York... to testify in Iowa or California and an officer of a French corporation who does business in Iowa to testify in Iowa? 
    What is the difference?

    Assume they've got jurisdiction over the corporation. 
    They transact business in Iowa, and they have an officer who is either in New York or Paris. 
    Is there a difference in the power of the District Judge to compel the officer to appear and testify?

   Rebuttal of John W. Ford

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Thank you, Mr. Doyle. 
    Mr. Ford, you have two minutes remaining.

    Mr. John W. Ford 
    With respect to respondent's remarks regarding questions of the applicability of the French defensive legislation or blocking statute and the Solicitor General's representative's remarks, which I understood to be there was some question in that office whether or not the French law applies to French attorneys highlights one of the major points be are trying to make. 
    That is not a question to be second-guessed on this shore. 
    That is what has led all of the American courts into the chagmire again without a general rule. 
    That is France's prerogative as it is of any foreign sovereign nation to state its own philosophy. 
    Whether or not it reflects fines, imprisonment, or whatever, in declaring that philosophy it is for that sovereign, and as we know from the Schooner Exchange versus McFadden, cited in the briefs, it is not for the courts of this nation to perform any function with respect to that declaration of a foreign sovereign other than understanding what it is the foreign sovereign--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="3558.755" stopTime="3571.078">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Mr. Ford, as I understand the questions presented and the position you espouse here, it doesn't depend at all on a blocking statute. 
    You would make exactly the same argument if they repealed the blocking statute, that you must resort in the first instance to The Hague Convention.
speaker="john_w_ford" startTime="3571.078" stopTime="3571.938">
    Mr. John W. Ford 
    --Oh, yes, Justice Stevens.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="3571.938" stopTime="3587.684">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    And your questions presented don't mention the blocking statute, in your cert petition. 
    So I don't see how that affects the analysis of the issue you have asked us to decide, the blocking statute, because you would make the same argument if there were no blocking statute.
speaker="john_w_ford" startTime="3587.684" stopTime="3592.933">
    Mr. John W. Ford 
    The same argument would be made for a general rule if there were no blocking statute.

    Correct.
