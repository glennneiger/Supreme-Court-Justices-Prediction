    Mr. Rex E. Lee 
    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    This case involves the constitutionality of Congress' 1972 Amendment to Section 702 of Title VII. 
    It is an amendment which restored to religious employers a right that they had enjoyed for 175 years before there was a Title VII: the right to prefer their own members for their own employment without running afoul of Title VII's prohibition against employment discrimination based on religion. 
    When originally enacted in 1964, Section 702 permitted religious preference hiring, but restricted it to the church's religious activities. 
    The undisputed purpose of the 1972 amendment was to free the courts and the EEOC from entangling themselves in deciding which of a church's activities are and which are not sufficiently religious to qualify for the exemption. 
    Section 702 has none of the traditional indicia of an establishment of religion. 
    It involves no endorsement, no subsidy, no preference for one sect over another. 
    The statute simply does not promote religion. 
    All that it does is to permit churches to promote religion in the same way that they have done for all but eight years of our national existence. 
    There is nothing in the establishment clause that prohibits churches from promoting religion. 
    Indeed, that is the very reason for their existence. 
    And neither does the establishment clause prohibit government from permitting churches to promote religion. 
    Neither the Appellees nor the District Court has ever really faced up to the nature of the problem that Congress faced, and the limited range of available solutions to Congress, given the other decisions that Congress made. 
    Congress could have simply made Title VII applicable only to race, sex and national origin. 
    But once it decided to include religion as one of its criteria, it had to provide some kind of exemption from that criterion for religious employers, lest, in violation of the free exercise clause, they be prevented from hiring their own members for purely ecclesiastical positions. 
    Once it is recognized then, as I gather it is by everyone in this courtroom, that the Constitution required Congress to pick some exemption, the only real issue is whether the Constitution precluded the choice that Congress made. 
    In other words, Congress having opted for an anti-employment discrimination package that is not quite as large as the one the Appellees would have chosen, is Congress constitutionally obligated to make it larger? 
    The answer to that question has to be no. 
    Surely the establishment clause is not violated every time government regulates churches to a lesser degree than it might have, or every time that it lifts a governmental burden that would otherwise be imposed. 
    That means that the real objection to this statute finds its roots not in constitutional law, but in public policy. 
    It boils down to the fact that the Appellees wish that Congress had gone further and prohibited more than Congress chose to prohibit.

    Mr. Rex E. Lee 
    I do, Justice O'Connor, for this reason. 
    I stress that it is not this case, as you indicated. 
    The first reason that I give that answer is that as is stressed by most of the amicus briefs that have been filed in this case, the distinction between what is secular and what is sectarian is a very difficult one to draw. 
    And, indeed, that intrudes. 
    And that's why Congress drew the line where it did. 
    And as a consequence, we think that at any point along the employment spectrum, you're going to have some line-drawing problems. 
    Therefore, the best place to draw the line is the place where Congress drew it. 
    Moreover, this Court has said many times... beginning at least as early as Walz versus the Tax Commission... that Congress does have a certain degree of line-drawing capacity in this area; that there is a channel between what the establishment clause prohibits on the one hand and the free exercise requires on the other, and that within that channel Congress may safely legislate. 
    If that means anything at all, we think it gives Congress the right to draw the kind of distinction that it drew in this case.

speaker="rex_e_lee" startTime="380.613" stopTime="634.562">
    Mr. Rex E. Lee 
    There is no question; there is no question that it is a more difficult choice. 
    But two points: One, I think that at the end of the day you're going to be better off observing the dividing line that Congress drew and giving that deference that the Court has said since Walz that we give to Congress in the area. 
    But, in any event, it does not apply to this case. 
    So the only serious First Amendment issue in this case is presented not by what Congress did in 1972, but by the District Court's own test, which by its terms requires federal courts to decide what a church really believes and whether its practices are true to its beliefs. 
    The Court's opinion, for example, quotes the Book of Mormon, the Doctrine Covenants, a theological treatise entitled "Mormon Doctrine", and then draws its own conclusions as to what the church's tenets really are and whether there is an adequate fit between what the church believes and what it does. 
    We submit that the First Amendment reserves those kinds of issues: what are a church's beliefs, and are its practices the best way to achieve them to the churches themselves. 
    But the Court need not reach that issue, because if the principle that has been so often stated that there is some room between the floor and the ceiling, between the free exercise and the establishment clause, then it must mean at a very minimum that Congress can constitutionally choose between two exemptions where those were its only options, where either one is going to have a differential effect on religion. 
    But the one that Congress chooses is the one that does not put the courts and the EEOC into the business of deciding what are religious beliefs and how they can best be achieved. 
    Finally, the Appellees have never really faced up to the fact that this is not a religious benefit case. 
    This is not a case in which Congress, starting from ground zero, gave to religious organizations something that they would not have had absent any action by Congress at all. 
    It is a religious exemption case, and the religious exemption cases make very clear that the rule has to be different for those cases. 
    The Appellees and the District Court's position is very simple. 
    It is that the statute is unconstitutional because its effect is to give religious employers something that non-religious employers do not enjoy and that it, therefore, fails the effects prong of Lemon. 
    But if that's the rule, then it's hard to see how any religious exemption can ever survive, because by their very definition, religious exemptions always affect religious groups and always affect them differently than other groups. 
    If that were enough to invalidate it, then Walz and Gillette would have to be overruled; Bob Jones would have been decided differently. 
    And in United States versus Lee, the Amish social security exemption case, Congress could not constitutionally have exempted the Amish from social security taxes, even if it had wanted to; and the exemption that it did give, which is an exemption that is still on the books to self-employed Amish, is unconstitutional. 
    The analysis is really no different, if it is expressed in terms of the traditional Lemon test, because if you assume the applicability of Lemon, then the analysis is basically the same. 
    You look first to see whether there was a proper purpose, and the District Court held that there was. 
    But Lemon's second prong inquires into primary effect. 
    In an exemption case, in determining primaryness, you have to consider not just the effect if Congress had done... if Congress acted, but you have to make a comparison between the effect of Congress doing nothing and Congress doing what it did. 
    The Appellees' case could not survive a comparative analysis, as even they appear to concede on page 22 of their brief. 
    They have not attempted to make it, and under those circumstances, this statute clearly survives. 
    Mr. Chief Justice, unless the Court has questions, I'd like to reserve the rest of my time. 
   
   
   
   Argument of William Bradford Reynolds
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="634.562" stopTime="643.234">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Thank you, Mr. Lee. 
    We'll hear now from you, Mr. Reynolds.
speaker="william_bradford_reynolds" startTime="643.234" stopTime="1009.939">
    Mr. William Bradford Reynolds 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court: 
    This is, it seems to me, a case that brings to the Court a First Amendment religious clause challenge to legislative action in perhaps its cleanest and simplest form. 
    Congress has barred religious discrimination in employment decisions under Title VII, but in so doing it has elected in Section 702 to exempt from that prohibition religious organizations, associations, institutions and corporations. 
    Rather than imposing certain obligations on employers in order to accommodate a particular religious view which was the case with the Connecticut statutes struck down in Thornton and Caldor, what Congress here has done is imposed no obligation on religious employers in the interest of religious accommodation. 
    In essence, it has adopted a hands-off policy with regard to religious-based employment decisions of religious organizations. 
    As stated, and indeed the uniformly recognized purpose for leaving religious institutions alone, was Congress' desire to avoid governmental control over and entanglement with the affairs and activities of religious organizations. 
    As the court below correctly found, this satisfies the secular purpose requirement of Walz and Gillette and the like cases of this Court. 
    Section 702 exemption removes the prospect of intrusive and likely constitutionally-offensive inquiry, investigation and probing by government into the religious or the secular nature of church-related activities. 
    On another level, the exemption eliminates the prospect of secular control over and entanglement with the church's ability to fulfill its religious mission. 
    There is thus no tension here between the religious accommodation requirement that's incorporated in the free exercise clause and the establishment clause's prohibition against state endorsement or advancement of religion. 
    Rather, Congress' hands-off approach brings the values of both the free exercise clause and the establishment clause into perfect harmony. 
    The exemption from an intrusive government regulation furthers the free exercise interest by preserving the liberty of religious organizations to create and exert authority over self-defining religious communities, and for much the same reason, it furthers the establishment clause's interest in avoiding undue secular control and entanglement. 
    It cannot be, as Appellants argue, that disharmonization fails in First Amendment terms, because Congress' accommodation of religion is broader in this instance than might be required or compelled by the free exercise clause. 
    Any narrower exemption, whether defined along the lines suggested by the court below or in some other fashion, would of necessity bring into play the kind of line drawing on secular terms that would exacerbate the very tension between the two religious clauses that Congress effectively avoided in Section 702. 
    Indeed, it's precisely for this reason that this Court in Walz and other decisions has acknowledged that there is considerable room between the floor set by the free exercise clause and the ceiling that's erected by the establishment clause in which legislatures may chart their own course of benevolent neutrality. 
    That Congress safely navigated a neutral course in Section 702 is quite clear. 
    The exemption applies to all religions even handedly, not to a particular sect or to select religions. 
    It involves no endorsement of, financial support for, or active involvement in religious affairs by government. 
    In this regard, the wall between church and state has not been breached. 
    Religion is neither enhanced nor inhibited by the Section 702 exemption. 
    Now, Appellees have argued that the statute effectively grants religious employers a benefit, that is, to discriminate on account of religion, which is unavailable to non-religious employers but this is the inevitable consequence of a hands-off policy by the Governemnt in First Amendment matters. 
    It allows religious institutions to advance their own religious mission on their own terms and through their own membership. 
    To the extent such autonomy is regarded as a beneficial effect of religious exemption, it is precisely the sort of benefit that is protected, not condemned, by the religious liberty interest in the Free Exercise clause. 
    Nor is there any reason to fault the exemption because it might well open the door to uneven treatment of employees, either as between or among various religions or as between religious organizations and those that are not religious. 
    Whatever the particular employment decisions and the religious reasons on which they are based are from one religion to another. 
    That is not State action that determines different individual treatment but unregulated private action by religious groups of the sort constitutionally protected by the Free Exercise clause. 
    Here, Congress acted to preserve the autonomy of religious institutions to manage their own affairs with respect to matters of religious employment. 
    In fashioning a broad exemption, Congress emphatically removed from the judicial agenda precisely this sort of intrusive secular probing of the operations, activities and beliefs of religious institutions that preoccupied the Court below.

    Mr. William Bradford Reynolds 
    Right, under the religious clauses. 
    I think that the legislative judgment that Congress made is one that comfortably safeguards the non-interference interests implicated in the establishment clause, while fully serving the religious liberty interests of religious institutions that are protected by the Free Exercise clause. 
    Perhaps it is a case that Congress could have drawn the exemption line elsewhere, indeed even in a manner that produced more secular entanglement and intrusion by the Courts but nothing suggests that it must do so and whereas here Congress believes that religious freedom concerns outweigh its own interests in imposing the regulations at issue, it should, be free to strike the balance in favor of religious freedom. 
    Far from raising any First Amendment problems, such enlightened self-restraint serves to further the religious pluralism and peaceful coexistence between church and state that lies at the heart of the religion clauses. 
    Accordingly, Section 702, Religious Exemption in Title 7 of the Civil Rights Act of '64, suffers no constitutional infirmity, in our view, and the United States, therefore, urges reversal of the District Court's judgment. 
    Mr. Chief Justice, there are no questions.

    Mr. David B. Watkiss 
    That, essentially, is the Government's argument. 
    It says, "We didn't fire Mason". 
    , so there are no cognizable effects under the establishment clause, as I understand Mr. Reynolds' argument. 
    That just won't work, Justice Scalia. 
    There are plenty of effects. 
    There's lots of benefits that flow from being exempted and there's lots of burdens that are visited on third parties and the sad thing about the Government's and the Church's view of this case is, they do not once tell you about the cost that this exemption visits on the religious liberty of third parties, of people like Mr. Mason. 
    They want to talk about economy and hands-off. 
    They refuse to concede that the central value protected by both the Free Exercise and the Establishment clauses is individual religious liberty and this exemption visits a very heavy direct burden on the religious burden on the religious liberty of people like Mason.

    Congress says, 
    "The nation has simply changed its mind. "

    Mr. David B. Watkiss 
    We are not dealing with whether Congress could eliminate Title 7 tomorrow. 
    Whether Congress could eliminate the prohibition against religious discrimination tomorrow. 
    What we are dealing with is whether Congress can draw the sort of line that it drew in Section 702. 
    That's the issue before this Court. 
    I do not frankly know. 
    I think the considerations are complicated as to whether Congress could eliminate Title 7. 
    I have my doubts but that issue is not before you. 
    What is before you is a statute that singles out religious employers, as such, for absolute and sweeping accommodation and that accommodation visits substantial burdens on third parties and it provides substantial benefits to the religious employer. 
    It obviously provides substantial benefits to Mr. Lee's clients here. 
    They were essentially using that power to force people into their church houses and to force people to pay tithing and they were doing that at the exact same time they were exempting from this new rule the non-Mormons who were employed at these entities. 
    For example, at the Deseret Gymnasium, the Catholic squash pro wasn't threatened. 
    Mr. Mason was fired because he wasn't going to church and he wasn't paying his tithing. 
    So they could make exceptions to this policy. 
    It is quite clear that what was going on here was merely a heavy handed attempt to coerce people into line.

    Mr. David B. Watkiss 
    The difference is that the activities of the house of worship itself and the activities of religious schools are both, in common understanding and in the precedents of this Court and, indeed, in Title 7, recognized for what they are. 
    They are quite close to the core functions of religious practice, and, indeed, the Courts themselves have carved out an exemption that Congress forgot to give them and that is, for minister-like employees who are totally exempt under judicial construction from Title 7, similarly, Congress has created a more narrow and, I submit, constitutionally more justifiable exemption for religious schools in Section 703(e). 
    Now, we are not challenging that exemption here. 
    It's not at issue here. 
    But obviously, religious schools are much more at the heart of the religious mission than a gymnasium, a department store.

    Mr. David B. Watkiss 
    --I think marginally is correct, Justice O'Connor. 
    Your question is complicated, and respond to all of the parts will take me a minute. 
    But I think the first thing I'd like to focus on is the gymnasium. 
    The district court found a number of facts which plainly are not clearly erroneous, and indeed, on the record we've got here, they're clearly compelled. 
    The district court found that there's nothing in the running or the purpose of that gymnasium to suggest that it was intended to spread or teach religious beliefs, doctrine or the practice of sacred ritual. 
    Its primary purpose is to provide facilities for physical exercise and athletic games. 
    Now that gymnasium is open to the public. 
    It advertises to the public. 
    Those advertisements contain no religious message. 
    Throughout all the time that Mr. Mayson was employed there, the Mormon Church found it satisfactory to employ non-Mormons as well. 
    And indeed, there are still some non-Mormons there. 
    Your question also adverted to the profit/nonprofit distinction. 
    The first problem is, there's nothing in 702 that draws that line. 
    So Mr. Lee is quite right at least in his suggestion that the Mormon Church's string of department stores could start imposing these sorts of tests--

    --It's not gratis. 
    If you or I wanted to go there an work out, Justice Scalia, we'd pay. 
    The fact that they subsidize it, the fact that it's tax exempt because it's a charitable donation of its facilities to a wide number of social groups, is their choice, and it's a laudable choice. 
    But I don't think you can merely say that profit/nonprofit draws a line responsive to the First Amendment concerns here. 
    It's too crude a device, and it doesn't exist in the statute.

    No, absolutely not. 
    The fallacy of this... of this entanglement business is that... you've got to remember the opinion an which Judge Winder rendered his judgment as to the constitutionality of the statute as applied to Mr. Mayson was made on the basis of the Church's motion to dismiss. 
    The only evidentiary materials before the Judge were a few affidavits by my clients, and anything that they wanted to put in the record. 
    They took their best shot on the gymnasium. 
    And the Judge was clearly right in finding what he did. 
    Those findings are not clearly erroneous. 
    They're clearly compelled on this record.

    That's not a line that gives you any meaningful differentiations.

    Mr. David B. Watkiss 
    --Justice Scalia, maybe that line can be drawn. 
    Maybe it can't. 
    My guess is, it'll get murkier. 
    Because my guess is that Mr. Lee's clients, for example, would say that they own a number of broadcast stations not just to make money but because it is a vehicle for promulgating views and interests and perspectives that are consistent with their beliefs. 
    So I don't think you're even going to get... I don't think you're going to get any religious employer merely to say that something they do is only to make money. 
    Rarely will you. 
    I won't yield a meaningful line. 
    Let's look at why the statute is unconstitutional as applied to Mr. Mayson. 
    This statute grants absolute and unyielding accommodation to the interests of religious employers by imposing a direct and a substantial burden, both secular and religious, on third parties, principally the employees. 
    Now in the Thornton v. Calder case, decided in 1985, this Court held that the state may not accommodate the religious interests of some by imposing substantial secular burdens on others. 
    Here, it seems to me, we have a much stronger case of unconstitutionality. 
    Because not only are serious secular burdens being imposed, but serious burdens on religious liberty of other people are being imposed.

    The burden I think was that the employer, when the employee invoked the power of that statute... and I think it's important to remember that under both of these statutes, it was an individual who invoked the power of them... but in the Calder case, when the employee told the employer that he wanted a day off for his religious reasons, then the employer had the duty to try to accommodate him taking that day off.

    Mr. David B. Watkiss 
    That's right. 
    Mr. Mayson either pays his tithe and goes to church or loses his job. 
    Section 702's second serious defect is its glaring lack of neutrality. 
    Now whether one characterizes the constitutional requirement as benevolent neutrality or as complete neutrality, Section 702 is obviously not benevolent, and it's obviously not neutral.

    Mr. David B. Watkiss 
    I think that's probably right. 
    And we're not arguing that every accommodation is just because of a lack of neutrality, unconstitutional. 
    The lack of neutrality is very important, though, as an indicia for suspicion. 
    This statute is nonneutral in a couple of ways. 
    It obviously treats religion better than nonreligion. 
    It says, the interests of Mr. Lee's clients get absolute deference. 
    Other employers don't get the benefit, and Mr. Mayson's secular interests don't get the benefit. 
    But it discriminates among religious interests too. 
    Mr. Mayson's religious liberty is given absolutely no weight. 
    The interests of Mr. Lee's clients to impose religious qualifications is given absolute weight. 
    You have nonneutrality going both ways. 
    Religion, nonreligion, and it discriminates among religious interests.

    Mr. David B. Watkiss 
    Well, it seems to me that this statute turns First Amendment values on their head. 
    The establishment clause, just as much as the free exercise clause, has as its principal concern the protection of individual religious liberty. 
    Now to be sure, we give religious organizations some degree of autonomy. 
    But individual religious liberty is the primary goal of both religion clauses of the Constitution. 
    This statute turns those values right on their head. 
    They say that we will accommodate a religious organization just as such; let it do whatever it wants to in this area, regardless of the cost that that imposes on individual religious liberty. 
    Sure, it gives Mr. Lee's clients a very powerful tool to advance religion. 
    But that tool is economic coercion.

    Mr. David B. Watkiss 
    --No, not true. 
    And that's not what I'm saying, Justice Scalia. 
    I'm saying that the reason we protect... the reason we give churches some degree of autonomy is because individuals fulfill their religious needs through groups. 
    Now, the church and the government try to get some mileage out of a couple of significant cases of this Court, beginning in the 19th Century opinion in Watson v. Jones and continuing through the Kedroff opinion, and most recently, through the Serbian Eastern Diocese opinion. 
    I think it's very, very important to reflect upon what those cases mean, and what they were based on. 
    The cases essentially hold that there is a degree of autonomy afforded to religious organizations in resolving internal disputes; and that civil courts won't interfere. 
    There's a very important passage from Watson v. Jones that gets repeated in variably by the Court's later opinions. 
    And I'd like to read it, because I think it focuses on the problem with 702. 
    In Watson, this Court wrote: The right to organize voluntary religious organizations to assist in the expression and dissemination of religious doctrine, and to create tribunals for controverted questions of faith within the association... and I'll skip some of it... is unquestioned. 
    All who unite themselves to such a body do so with an implied consent to this government, and are bound to submit by it. 
    Now the emphasis on religious voluntarism in that passage, and in all those cases, is very clear. 
    Because individuals voluntary join churches, we give churches some deference. 
    This statute makes Mayson join a church to keep his job, his secular job. 
    It subverts the very notion of voluntariness which is fundamental... which is a fundamental peg of the reasons that we give churches some autonomy. 
    But you take that away, your churches are allowed to grow not because of the appeal of their dogma, as Justice Douglass put it, but because they can use economic muscle over employees in secular activities. 
    We have... we have fundamentally distorted First Amendment values. 
    You've given churches a vehicle to grow through coercion. 
    Not zeal, not appeal of dogma; but economic coercion. 
    That's fundamentally at odds with what the values of the First Amendment... the First Amendment protects.

    Mr. Rex E. Lee 
    That is definitely... a nonsmoking, nondrinking Catholic; better in that respect than some other Catholics that I know. 
    I think that the best answer... the best answer to that question of who is to draw the line at the margin is simply that you don't draw it. 
    That was Congress' judgment. 
    It was Congress' judgment after it had had eight years experience of Ceasar potentially having his hands on the things of God. 
    And then Congress simply said, let's draw it nice and clean. 
    I think Mr. Watkiss has effectively conceded that that's the best place to draw the line. 
    He's conceded that even though my clients do not assert Section 702 for their purely commercial activities, that there is difficult drawing the line there; and that if the courts' statements really mean anything, that there is some room between Scylla and Charybdis, then it has to mean that Congress can choose between the only two available exemptions to it, the 1964 and the 1972 version, particularly when you consider that all of the impacts that Mr. Watkiss was talking about would have been identical under the 1964 version, if you accept our view of the Desseret gym. 
    And that brings me to my next point. 
    Assume that you disagree, and that there is to be some line... there is to be some line that's drawn, that there is some minimum threshold, in order to cross what Thomas v. the Unemployment Commission said, you have to get past a practice that is just bizarre, that is just purely not religious, this is... that has clearly been satisfied in this case, and there are no findings in the district court to the contrary. 
    The district court did not make what we would call findings of fact. 
    It drew conclusions of law. 
    And what it said was, that there is nothing in the Mormon faith that requires employment discrimination; and there is nothing that requires exercise in a gym that... that practices discrimination. 
    But that takes entirely too narrow a view, and gets the courts far too deeply into what Mormonism is really all about, and the amount of leeway, administrative, implementing leeway that the church really has to have in order to carry out its objectives. 
    Because the fact of the matter is that the court... the church has concluded that its purposes can be furthered by providing a place where physical health, which according to Mormon belief is intimately linked to spiritual health, can be pursued in an environment where church standards are understood, respected and maintained. 
    It's further concluded that this can best be accomplished by people who understand those standards and are committed to them. 
    Other churches might reach different conclusions, but this is the conclusion that this church has made, and this is a conclusion that Congress vouchsafes to it. 
    Now, finally, there has been nothing said, either in the briefs or in this courtroom this morning, about the fact that if you rule against my clients in this case, that all exemptions are unconstitutional, including, I submit, the 1964 version, if you really apply the standards that Mr. Watkiss has expressed here. 
    Congress has to have the authority, when it perceives dangers to First Amendment values that have been raised by Congress' own statutes, to eliminate... to eliminate its own lawmaking as the cause of those problems. 
    For this reason, the judgment of the district court should be reversed.
