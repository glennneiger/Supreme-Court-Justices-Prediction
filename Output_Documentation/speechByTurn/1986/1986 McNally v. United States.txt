McNally v. United States

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Mr. Phillips, you may proceed whenever you're ready.
speaker="carter_g_phillips" startTime="53.718" stopTime="140.841">
    Mr. Carter G. Phillips 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    --This case involves the proper interpretation of 18 U.S.C. Section 1341, the Federal Mail Fraud Statute. 
    The primary issue presented is whether it is fraud within the meaning of that statute for a political party leader to fail to disclose to state officials a potential conflict of interest in his handling of the state's patronage system. 
    The Court of Appeals held that a conviction under this so-called intangible rights theory is proper and we urge this court to reverse. 
    The basic facts were as follows: The petitioners and the third individual, Howard Hunt, were politically active in the Democratic Party, in the state of Kentucky, during the 1970s. 
    In part because of their hard work on behalf of Governor Carroll, who was elected in 1974, petitioner Gray was appointed to a cabinet position in 1976 and Mr. Hunt was named head of the Democratic Party. 
    Hunt as the head of the Democratic Party was invested with substantial patronage powers by the governor, which is not an uncommon practice, I think, in any state. 
    What may be somewhat less common is the decades long tradition in Kentucky that certain state insurance commissions are treated as part of the patronage system. 
    Thus, the agent for the state in procuring insurance was asked to share commissions with other individuals holding insurance licenses.

    Mr. Carter G. Phillips 
    I would say two things about that, Justice O'Connor. 
    First, that's correct. 
    No state law was violated. 
    Two, even if state law had been violated there was no instruction to the jury asking the jury to find that state law had been violated. 
    So that it's not, you know, whether there was a violation of state law in this case is simply not relevant to what the jury decided. 
    As I was suggesting. 
    It was not uncommon for public officials, or the relatives of public officials themselves to receive shared commissions under the patronage scheme. 
    The Insurance Commissioner himself testified that his son was receiving insurance commissions as a part of this practice. 
    He knew about it and never doubted that it was a lawful practice. 
    In this case the government has however, challenged Mr. Hunt's recommendation to the Insurance Commissioner to appoint the Wombwell Insurance Agency as the agent of the state for Worker's Compensation and his directions as to how to share those commissions. 
    Because the government in its brief, in this Court on the merits, has for the first time suggested that this case is not really an intangible rights case, I think that it is terribly important that the court understand clearly, precisely how the case was submitted to the jury. 
    The government has reproduced the relevant instructions in its brief at pages nine to ten and footnote eight. 
    In reading them as a whole, I submit, reveals quite clearly that the District Court told the jury, at the government's request that it could conclude that petitioners "devised such a scheme", describing the scheme in the indictment as read in relevant portion to the jury, if the jury found five facts basically. 
    One, that there was control over the naming of an insurance agency by Mr. Hunt. 
    Two, that Mr. Hunt had something to do with the selection of Wombwell. 
    Three, that he directed Wombwell to share those commissions in a particular way, four, that he held an ownership interest in Seton Investments. 
    And five, that he failed to disclose debt interest to the state government. 
    With respect to the petitioners then, they are charged solely with aiding and abetting that basic claim. 
    Our position is that however you analyze those facts as required to be found by the jury, there is no fraud in this case. 
    And that the jury was clearly instructed that it could find on that theory as an alternative basis for holding that the Mail Fraud Statute has been violated and that the jury, and therefore the government must justify its extension of the Mail Fraud Statute to the situation involving Hunt.

    Mr. Carter G. Phillips 
    In light of the jury instructions in this case, it seems to us quite remarkable that the government has all, I think, but conceded that the Mail Fraud Statute as applied to a political party leader is wholly inapplicable. 
    It's sole defense on this issue in the brief appears in a single paragraph on page 32. 
    And the government tells the court, quote, it is at least clear that those individuals, referring to party leaders given the power to carry on the state's business, have a duty not to use that governmental party to criminally profit themselves or their friends. 
    The problem with that statement and it's the sole defense of the government's case here, is that it again ignores the jury instructions. 
    There was no criminal profit. 
    There was no profit at all, in terms of what the jury was asked to find. 
    The sole theory in this case involves a matter of non-disclosure. 
    That's what the jury was instructed on and that's what the jury found. 
    The fact the jury found that however is unfortunate for the government because this is not mail fraud. 
    It's not fraud of any sort. 
    Because as this Court said in Schiarella, in order for there to be fraud, there must be a duty to disclose and what is utterly missing in anything, in either the government's brief or anything at the trial in this case is any indication of where a duty to disclose exists and extends to a political party leader. 
    And because of that, the government's case necessarily fails as a matter of law. 
    Mr. Gray was a political official, but as the jury--

    Mr. Carter G. Phillips 
    Well, I hesitate to speak on it, for Mr. Hunt, but I think the answer is they were friends and I don't think it is a scheme, frankly. 
    They were friends and they happened to have an inter-relationship. 
    But I don't know that from our perspective and given that the jury wasn't required to make any findings, I hesitate to say that he was involved in that particular scheme. 
    But I think the important point to remember, Justice White, is that the jury was instructed on that point in the alternative and therefore, whether or not, and I don't think the Gray theory would hold water either, but whether or not it would is irrelevant to this case. 
    The government still has to demonstrate that Mr. Hunt violated the law in the ways that he did and that the petitioners aided and abetted that violation.

    Mr. Carter G. Phillips 
    Well, the jury instruction didn't ask for that. 
    All the jury was asked to find was that he had control over those decisions and so, and the evidence was that he made recommendations and those recommendations were followed. 
    To say that he had defacto control in that sense strikes me as not any different than any other party leader making recommendations to his own party leaders who happened to hold public offices. 
    So, in a sense sure, he had defacto control, but our position is that jury instruction is so far removed from anything that would make him a public official, that there is simply no basis for creating a duty, certainly if the government has cited nothing--

    Mr. Carter G. Phillips 
    --Well, on that issue, just on that one issue as to whether they're might be a state law duty to disclose the issue would be different. 
    On the issue of whether or not there's any pecuniary gain, and whether pecuniary gain is a necessary requirement of the Mail Fraud Statute, I'd say that's a separate and open issue. 
    I think we would also have made some additional arguments if this case turned on Mr. Gray's status in terms of when does a duty trigger. 
    It is one thing to say that public officials have some duties to disclose, but it doesn't seem to me that every, that you know, in this case the government says, Mr. Gray had a duty to disclose basically because he saw some wrong doing going on. 
    Not that he necessarily benefitted from it. 
    So, it's not at all clear to me that he would of had a duty to disclose in this case. 
    But again, we run far afield from anything the jury was asked to decide in this particular case.

    Mr. Carter G. Phillips 
    Sure, he was clearly a public official. 
    Nobody disputes that. 
    And, none of the petitioners are, I mean, Hunt does not. 
    In sum, the government today asks this Court to sign what is basically a prosecutorial blank check to rid the mails of any political act that a United States attorney finds unacceptable. 
    What makes this request most dangerous we think, is the fact that even an indictment in the context of political officials or public, or it's going to be party leaders, can be devastating to their public careers. 
    And thus, the government is asking this Court not only to sign a blank check, but a check that is of enormous consequence. 
    This Court cannot sign that check. 
    Only Congress can because only Congress can declare conduct to be illegal. 
    And Congress has not declared anything that the petitioners have done in this case, as presented to the jury, to be against the law. 
    Now, what the government--

    Mr. Carter G. Phillips 
    He was charged in the alternative as a principal. 
    The instruction is quite clear at footnote A, the District Court's instruction to the jury says, in order to find this scheme, you must find one of the following: Either that Hunt engaged in certain activities and was aided and abetted by the two petitioners, or that Mr. Gray engaged in certain activities and was aided and abetted by petitioner McNally. 
    It is clearly in the alternative and therefore, the government is obliged to justify both of those theories. 
    With respect, unless there are further questions on the mail fraud count, with respect to the conspiracy issue and the failure of the Court of Appeals to consider petitioner's contention that the government failed to prove the tax object of the conspiracy, we explained in both our opening brief and our reply brief, why the government's request for a rule of per se harmless error seems to us unwarranted. 
    In light of the government's concession; however, that if it loses on the mail fraud issue that the conspiracy count must necessarily be reversed. 
    I would rest on the briefs unless the Court has questions and reserve the balance of my time.

   Argument of Donald B. Ayer
speaker="donald_b_ayer" startTime="1350.672" stopTime="1435.091">
    Mr. Donald B. Ayer 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    The government agrees, I think, with one general proposition that is made by the petitioners in this case. 
    And that's the point that there is a substantial amount of confusion concerning this intangible rights mail fraud theory. 
    And we would further agree that there is in some opinions of various courts of appeals, what I would describe as extravagant language, talking in terms of standards of moral uprightness, fundamental honesty, fair play and right dealing. 
    But that's, I think, where our agreement ends because first of all, in terms of this case, which is before this Court, that language I think is completely irrelevant. 
    Also, as to the very cases in which that language appears, I think one is hard-pressed to find even one where the language itself is necessary to the holding of the case and indeed where the outcome, the decision and indeed the reasoning, if you read the opinion further, isn't well supported on a much sounder and narrower theory of the Mail Fraud Statute. 
    But before we get to that question of intangible rights, I want to address the first proposition made in our brief, which is the point that this intangible rights theory need not and indeed I think, should not be addressed in order to resolve this case.

    Mr. Donald B. Ayer 
    The government's brief at page 11 indicates in footnote eight. 
    What must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt is that the defendant's knowingly and willfully devised, or intended to devise a scheme to defraud as described in instruction 11. 
    I don't know why the reference to instruction 11 because the precise language of instruction 11 appears in this instruction 15. 
    But, in any event, repeated twice is the description of the scheme. 
    Repeated in instruction 11 and in instruction 15. 
    If you look at page nine at the beginning of footnote eight back where it first indents, is the reference to the scheme to defraud the citizens of their right to have the business and it's affairs conducted honestly, etcetera. 
    And then immediately following, the same scheme to obtain directly and indirectly money and other things of value by means of false and fraudulent pretenses, representations and promises and the concealment of facts. 
    There is no instruction as is typical in situations where you have multiple ways of violating a particular statute. 
    There is no instruction that says the jury must agree unanimously. 
    I have at least one of these ways of violating the statute.

    But, Mr. Ayer, that instruction does charge that, devised a scheme or artifice to and then it's a conjunctive not a disjunctive that links one or two which suggests that the scheme or artifice embodied both (a)(1) and (2).
speaker="donald_b_ayer" startTime="1585.635" stopTime="1613.720">
    Mr. Donald B. Ayer 
    That's exactly right, Your Honor. 
    That's exactly our point is that the jury was told that they had to find a scheme to do both, or they couldn't convict and indeed they did find a scheme to do both. 
    They found a scheme to obtain property by false pretenses and having done that, and we knowing that they have done that there is no occasion to go further and ask whether the theory and the evidence would support the other theory as well.

    Mr. Donald B. Ayer 
    Well, I will address that now, Your Honor, as you brought it up. 
    That the first, that is paragraph one requires in order to convict Mr. Gray that he had aided and abetted Mr. Hunt. 
    Mr. Gray was at all times relevant either or both the Secretary to the Cabinet, or the Secretary of Public Protection in Regulation. 
    And in both of those positions, in the second position of protection and regulation, he directly oversaw the entire state insurance program. 
    And as Secretary to the Cabinet, he was one step and oversaw among others the Secretary of Regulation. 
    Our theory is that in order to have found one, In order to have convicted under one, and who to have convicted Gray as the jury did, they must have found that Gray aided and abetted Hunt. 
    And for Gray in his public position to have been essentially turn, at least turning his head to the diversion of this money in ways which in a minute I will show to have been quite improper. 
    That in itself constitutes the breach of a public duty. 
    That is his duty as a public official.

    Mr. Donald B. Ayer 
    I think what might be helpful in answering this question in a slightly, maybe circuitous way, but nonetheless it may be useful to refer to the facts in the case and in order to that in a brief way, I have submitted through the clerk, copies of exhibits that were used at trial. 
    And what they do, I'm not going to go through them line by line, but they were indeed used in trial to demonstrate the evidence in the case in a fairly brief and concise way. 
    Exhibits one and two are essentially flow charts of the way the money flowed from the Commonwealth of Kentucky to, in premium payments, to two different insurance companies and then the Commission's coming back from the carriers to the Wombwell Agency. 
    The Wombwell agency being the broker who got the business and agreed to handle this Workman's Compensation business for $50,000 a year and then at Hunt's request agreed, take that $50,000 and I, Hunt, as head of the Democratic Party will tell you where to send the rest of the commissions that you get back. 
    The key part of these diagrams. 
    Number one covers the period of 1976, I guess '76 through the middle of '77 and then other one covers the period '77 through '79. 
    Is what happens with the money, the premium, I'm sorry the commission payments once hey come back to the Wombwell Agency and what these, the little boxes over on the right hand side show, are the channeling of the checks to two different places. 
    One is to Seton Investments. 
    Now Seton Investments as we've indicated in our brief is an entity which was created by Hunt and Gray. 
    It was set up as a real estate investment company, but in fact, transacted no real estate business except the purchase of two condominiums, which the evidence showed was for the personal use of Gray and Hunt. 
    It purported to be for purposes of this scheme because it had to be under state law an insurance brokerage entity. 
    In fact, it transacted and the evidence showed it transacted no insurance business whatsoever. 
    It did not have an insurance license. 
    It put on forms which were submitted to the Wombwell agency as proof.

    That was the business it was in, Justice White. 
    And that is illegal under state law. 
    It is illegal under the provision of state law, under Kentucky revised statute 34.9-100, which we've cited in our brief, says that it is not a proper purpose of an insurance license to have it for the purpose and solely for the purpose of enabling the licensee to receive rebates or premiums.

    Mr. Donald B. Ayer 
    Well, who has been done out of money, number one, we would dispute and there is evidence I think in the record that supports the dispute that there was simply no way for Kentucky to do anything other than pay the money that it paid and to have the premiums that were paid, I'm sorry, the commissions that were paid back to Wombwell paid in a certain amount. 
    It is true that there's a regional commission that is set up. 
    I think it's basically part of the insurance industry that studies and decides what a reasonable commission is on a certain kind of policy. 
    It is always possible to renegotiate something like that and indeed there is testimony in the record that there, that that is a possibility. 
    It was never done here--

    Mr. Donald B. Ayer 
    No, I am not. 
    I'm trying to answer Justice Scalia's question as to who was done out of money. 
    It is indeed the case that had people been public watchdogs, looking for where the money's going, it would have come out differently. 
    That's not the point. 
    That's not the reason why this is illegal. 
    This is illegal, what I'd like to do is--

    Justice Scalia 
    Here is the analogy that I'm, patronage systems were never considered illegal. 
    I mean, that's why we had to have a law to have the civil service. 
    And the theory was, somebody has to have the job, you're going to give the job to somebody, why not give it to our guys? 
    That was never thought unlawful, or it certainly wasn't considered fraud. 
    Now it seems to me, you would have to persuade me that this is something any different from that to convince me that it's fraud. 
    And so far, you haven't. 
    I don't see how anybody has been done out of any money. 
    Just, the money has to go to somebody. 
    It might as well go to our guys.

 Here is the analogy that I'm, patronage systems were never considered illegal. 
 I mean, that's why we had to have a law to have the civil service.

 Now it seems to me, you would have to persuade me that this is something any different from that to convince me that it's fraud.

    Mr. Donald B. Ayer 
    That's correct. 
    What has been done here, what I'd like to do is start with the proposition that, hypothetically speaking, let's forget that these people are in fact, public officials. 
    Let's leave that out of it. 
    As I think we have demonstrated in our brief, what was done was a, what was shown was a complete scheme for obtaining property by false pretenses. 
    The false pretenses are the setting up a phony insurance brokerage outfit for the purpose of making it appear acceptable to channel this commission money to them. 
    Under state law it is illegal to split commissions with anyone other than an insurance broker or agency. 
    And so what they did was to create this entity as an independent company, disassociate themselves, that is Gray and Hunt, from it by bringing in at least at a late date, McNally, to serve as its president and act like this is an independent entity that McNally is in charge of. 
    And indeed at trial the argument was that McNally owns this. 
    This is all his, we don't own it, that is Gray and Hunt don't own it, McNally owns it. 
    That scheme, just leaving out the element of public official and public obligation is in and of itself, that deception to allow the channeling of money to Seton, which indeed then goes essentially to the use, as is indicated on our exhibit three, to the use of these individuals in the form of condominiums. 
    That is itself a complete mail fraud scheme. 
    A scheme for obtaining property by false pretenses and we believe that that is the first and easiest way to resolve the case.

 You don't say I defraud somebody if I go up and say, I'll buy your car for $500 and I give him my wrong name. 
 You wouldn't say that I defrauded him of the car so long as I give him the $500.

    Well, what we would suggest as a description of what must be shown, as a set of requirements under this intangible, first of all, let me say, I think it makes very little sense to conclude that somehow the mail fraud statute doesn't cover schemes to defraud of intangible rights. 
    If you define an intangible right as any right other than the physical possession of something. 
    You talk about a right to a stream of income under a contract. 
    Or, you talk about a right to purchase a piece of property. 
    You talk about almost any right in our society.

    --I think in the following, when you meet the following set of requirements the answer would be yes. 
    And this is what we would be suggesting as a substitute for what I referred to earlier as the extravagant language of some opinions. 
    Number one, that there must be the duty that you're talking about has got to be an enforceable duty of some kind. 
    The thing you're being defrauded out of is not just a moral aspiration. 
    It's got to be a real duty. 
    It can arise from the criminal law. 
    It can arise from the civil law. 
    It can rise from a statute, or the common law. 
    And we would suggest it can arise from contract.

    Mr. Donald B. Ayer 
    --Well, I think the state can sue, or can bring a criminal action for defrauding it of the right to honest services of its employees. 
    Or the honest services of people who have been given trusted, trusted with responsibilities. 
    But, that's only the first part. 
    That's the first step. 
    The second step is that there must be a causal relationship between the breach of that duty and either the appropriation or the deprivation of a thing of value. 
    We are not suggesting that simply the abstract non-performance of a duty is a sufficient basis to bring a criminal action. 
    We think that it is quite appropriate to require that the breach of the duty have some kind of a consequence and in this case the consequence, well let me skip over this case for a minute. 
    The third element would be an element of deception. 
    Which is a traditional element of the Mail Fraud Statute. 
    That there must be some effort to cover up the scheme to deceive, to essentially hide what's going on. 
    And when you put those three things together, I would submit what you have is really only another way of saying what is going on in a more traditional property oriented male fraud case.

    Mr. Donald B. Ayer 
    Well, I think there's two different things going on here. 
    One is the duty to disclose. 
    And we would not put primary emphasis on that. 
    What I would suggest is that starting with the premise that there was an obtaining of property by false pretenses, how was it done? 
    It was done by these two individuals setting up the scheme and it happens that Hunt was imbued with official power, that is, the governor told him that he had the power to pick the insurance companies and to direct the commissions. 
    And secondly, Gray was in a position overseeing all of this and a lot of other activity. 
    What had to happen was the, by Hunt, the misuse of his position and of his authority. 
    He had to misuse state governmental power to direct this money to himself. 
    That's the first thing that had to happen. 
    And, Gray had to, in his position, essentially at a minimum, look the other way and happily receive the money at the other end. 
    And we think the use of state governmental power essentially to commit a federal mail fraud and that's going back to the first step. 
    That is apart from their state governmental authority, they committed a mail fraud. 
    The use of power to do that is a separate abuse of authority, that is, an abuse of the governmental authority.

    --I think there is a duty to disclose. 
    The only reason I am hesitant to rely primarily on that is that I frankly think the basic scheme to defraud, that is to get the money, by using Seton is a more persuasive fraud. 
    There is indeed a duty, on the part of a public official to disclose and I think, I would argue if we had say it to get, you know, to resolve the case which I think we don't for at least two other reasons. 
    That there's a duty on the part of Hunt to disclose based on his use of governmental authority.

   Rebuttal of Carter G. Phillips
speaker="carter_g_phillips" startTime="3176.761" stopTime="3301.992">
    Mr. Carter G. Phillips 
    Thank you Mr. Chief Justice. 
    I would like to make simply three points. 
    I hate to drag you back into the jury instructions, but I think they're fairly important in this context. 
    The first statement that Mr. Ayer made with respect to the instruction, I think, requires some clarification was his suggestion that Mr. Gray and his aiding and abetting must have been a public official, that the jury must have found that. 
    Aside from the point that I believe Justice Stevens made, which is that there was no requirement in the jury instruction that that be found. 
    The truth is that at the closing argument, the United States attorneys, the Assistant U.S. Attorney told the jury that the aiding and abetting was in setting up Seton. 
    And it is undisputed that when Seton was set up by Mr. Gray he was not a public official. 
    So, it's both contrary to the instruction and contrary to the facts of the case. 
    Second, with the respect to the false pretenses, I guess I would just like to repeat what Justice Stevens said, this whole notion of a phony business and the various ways that that may have operated is an interesting theory. 
    It is not the theory that was presented to the jury in this case and I take that as the best evidence that the reference to false pretenses was not regarded as somehow a separate item in this case at all, either to the court, or to the jury. 
    And the court made it quite clear what it thought the appropriate theory for conviction was in this case. 
    And that set out in the portion that describes the scheme underwritten in the indictment. 
    And finally, with respect to the government's eleventh hour effort to find some limiting principles for its mail fraud, I took it as quite interesting that in describing that there must first be a duty, Mr. Ayer suggests that he wouldn't put primary emphasis on that point and it's quite clear to me why he wouldn't do that in this case because wherever you look there is simply no duty. 
    And I think ultimately what it came down to was that the duty that exists in this case is a federal duty. 
    But that's not what the Mail Fraud Statute requires. 
    This Court made quite clear in Parr that you look to other sources to determine what is fraud, and the fraud in this case is based on a duty. 
    You must look to those sources to find out where that duty exists. 
    There are none accordingly and the petitioner's conviction should be reversed.
