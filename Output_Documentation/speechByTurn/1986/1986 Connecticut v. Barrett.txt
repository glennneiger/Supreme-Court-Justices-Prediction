Connecticut v. Barrett

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Ms. Dewey, you may proceed whenever you are ready.
speaker="julia_dicocco_dewey" startTime="56.920" stopTime="300.894">
    Ms. Julia Dicocco Dewey 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    The respondent in this case, William Barrett, was arrested on a charge of sexual assault. 
    Shortly after his arrest, within a matter of hours, he was given four separate sets of Miranda warnings. 
    He told police officers that he had no problem talking about the incident, but he would not give a written statement without an attorney. 
    The question presented in this case is whether an oral statement given by the respondent is admissible as evidence in the subsequent criminal trial. 
    As I just indicated, Mr. Barrett was arrested on a charge of sexual assault. 
    At the time of his arrest he was warned in accordance with Miranda versus Arizona. 
    He was then transported to a nearly town. 
    Upon arriving he was again given his Miranda warnings. 
    He received a third set of Miranda warnings prior to the actual interrogation. 
    The Connecticut trial court and the Connecticut Supreme Court both found that the defendant stated he had no problem talking to the officers but he would not give a written statement without an attorney. 
    Mr. Barrett then proceeded to give a narrative account of the incident, admitting that he and his co-defendant had intercourse with their victim. 
    He claimed, however, that this was a consensual act, despite the fact that during the act he had in his hands a screwdriver. 
    The police had unsuccessfully attempted to tape record the defendant's first statement. 
    In an effort to get a valid tape recording of this statement, they once again advised Mr. Barrett of his Miranda rights. 
    Again the defendant repeated that he had no problem talking with the officers but he would not give a written statement in the absence of counsel. 
    The defendant then proceeded to give a narrative account paralleling the first account. 
    At trial the defendant contended that his two statements were involuntary. 
    However, at the conclusion of a suppression hearing the trial court held that the defendant had made a knowing, voluntary and intelligent waiver of his right to remain silent. 
    Therefore, the two statements were both introduced. 
    On appeal, Mr. Barrett again contended that the statements were involuntary, but he added the contention that the statements were taken in violation of Edwards versus Arizona. 
    The trial court's factual finding was basically not challenged by the Connecticut Supreme Court. 
    Instead, that Court held that the defendant's refusal to give a written statement without an attorney present was a clear request for the assistance of counsel to protect his Fifth Amendment rights. 
    In reaching this conclusion the Connecticut Supreme Court never considered the fact that the defendant had not invoked his right to remain silent for purposes of that oral interrogation. 
    Thus, the Connecticut Supreme Court misconstrued this Court's holding in Miranda and in Edwards. 
    This Court has consistently made it clear that the purpose of the Miranda warnings is to dispel that coercion that is inherent in police interrogation. 
    Additionally, Miranda is designed to assure that a suspect in police custody is adequately advised of his Fifth Amendment rights prior to giving any statements. 
    Custodial interrogation was viewed as inherently coercive. 
    However, under the Miranda holdings, holdings, once a suspect has been adequately advised, it is possible for a trial court to find that that suspect did in fact waive his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination and that waiver was an act of free will. 
    The state does acknowledge that there is a bright line if a defendant does request counsel at the interrogation.

    Justice O'Connor, I don't believe that this Court has every held that the individual knowledge of a defendant or suspect, a knowledge that's not communicated to the police officers, would have any bearing on whether there was a free and voluntary act by the defendant. 
    Of course, at a suppression hearing that would become a factor that would be considered by the trial court.

    --Under the facts of particular case, it might be possible theta selective waiver, if it were somehow inherently inconsistent, could suggest a lack of knowledge or could suggest that the defendant did not truly comprehend his Miranda rights. 
    But again, that would be a factual determination for the trial court, and in this particular case the determination by the trial court was that that waiver, that selective waiver, was not an indication of an indication of a right to counsel or any uncertainty, but rather that the defendant was so aware of what his rights were that he chose to exercise some of the rights but not the other. 
    He chose not to have counsel present for the oral aspect, as opposed to the written aspect of the interrogation. 
    In the present case the Connecticut Supreme Court applied the Edwards rationale in a vacuum.

    The result should be same as was held by the Connecticut trial court. 
    The fact that the defendant, or the suspect, hasn't made a shrewd choice once advised of his Miranda rights does not bar the subsequent admission of that statement that the defendant subsequently makes. 
    An ill-advised choice, an ill choice, rather; a shrewd choice, a choice not in the defendant's interest is not what Miranda was designed to protect. 
    Miranda was just designed to assure that the defendant was in fact advised.

    He and the officers had also testified that in their perception the defendant understood what the Miranda rights entailed. 
    So, in this case there is no question.

    There's an inconsistency is the Connecticut Supreme Court's decision in the regard, where they state that the trial court implied found that the defendant had requested counsel. 
    What they are doing is taking the trial court's holding, which is in the joint appendix, and the part of that holding, that indicates that the defendant had no problem talking with the officers but would not put anything in writing. 
    The trial court and that was all that the trial court found about the defendant's asserting the right to counsel. 
    There was never an explicit finding by the trial court regarding an assertion of the right to counsel.

    Absolutely nothing. 
    The rights didn't talk about the written statement. 
    They talked about the oral statement, which is what this defendant did give. 
    Had there been a written statement that the police attempted to utilize, then of course that written statement would have been inadmissible. 
    That was the right that this defendant had invoked.

    Ms. Julia Dicocco Dewey 
    Yes, they are. 
    In essence, the Connecticut Supreme Court refused to reach the issue of whether there had been a waiver of rights, and whether that waiver of rights had been an act of free will. 
    We agree that a request for counsel must be narrowly construed, but here the Connecticut trial court ignored the clear tenor of the defendant's own request, giving a talismanic quality to the word "attorney". 
    This, in effect, engrafted an additional prophylactic rule upon this Court's Miranda mandate. 
    This unwarranted expansion of federal law created obstacles to legitimate waivers and to legitimate choice by defendants. 
    It thus restricted interrogation in ways not contemplated by the Miranda Decision. 
    For that reason, the opinion of the Connecticut Supreme should be reversed and the trial court decision affirmed. 
    Thank you. 
   
   
   
   Argument of Charles A. Rothfeld
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1079.723" stopTime="1086.843">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Thank you, Ms. Dewey. 
    We'll hear now from you, Mr. Rothfeld.
speaker="charles_a_rothfeld" startTime="1086.843" stopTime="1221.532">
    Mr. Charles A. Rothfeld 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court. 
    I think it's important in the resolution of this case to focus on precisely what went on and what the findings were of the lower courts, because I think that frames the question that's presented to the Court here. 
    The first point to make, I think, in that regard relates to questions that were asked by Justices O'Connor, Marshall and Brennan and Scalia about precisely what the suspect understood he was doing and what he knew about his rights. 
    I think it's clear on the record here that respondent testified at trial. 
    The trial court expressly found that he understood the nature of his rights, he understood what he had been told by the police, and that understanding of course included the statement that, 
    "Anything you say can and will be used against you at trial. " 
    That factual determination was nowhere challenged by the Connecticut Supreme Court. 
    Nothing in its opinion suggests that there's anything wrong with that factual finding by the trial court. 
    I think that it's also important to recognize that there's nothing inherently contradictory between an understanding of that right, understanding of the consequences of speaking, and the course of action followed by the suspect here where he chose to make an oral but not a written statement. 
    I think it is a common experience, courts have frequently recognized that people simply are reluctant to put things in writing even though they appreciate that their oral statements have legal consequences. 
    This Court encountered something very similar to this in Butler versus North Carolina, where a suspect refused to sign a waiver statement but proceeded to waive his rights. 
    The Court found that his waiver was effective because not the necessary inconsistencies, so long as he appreciated what he was doing. 
    The fact that he didn't make a sensible distinction in his actions is not of any relevance for purposes of Miranda. 
    Courts of appeals and other lower courts have encountered situations almost identical to the one involved in this case where a suspect refuses to put a statement in writing, refuses to sign a statement. 
    Those courts have recognized that suspects frequently are simply reluctant to put statements in writing even though they fully appreciate the nature and consequences of what they are doing.

    Mr. Charles A. Rothfeld 
    --Well, I think I should say something also about the factual findings of the lower courts here, as you were discussing before. 
    First, I think there is no disagreement between the two Connecticut courts in this case as to what respondent understood and what the factual setting of the case was. 
    The courts agreed as to what respondent actually said, that he was willing to make a statement but that he would not put it in writing until his lawyer arrived. 
    The Connecticut Supreme Court nowhere attempted to overturn any of the factual findings--

    Mr. Charles A. Rothfeld 
    --No, not at all. 
    But I think that what that statement means, Justice Stevens, is a factual account of what the trial court did. 
    The trial court found that he had requested counsel before making a written statement, and the holding of the Connecticut Supreme Court was based on a legal conclusion about the significance of the request that the respondent made. 
    The Connecticut Supreme Court found that when the suspect stated, 
    "I am willing to speak to you but I will not make a written statement until counsel arrives. " 
    that that was an invocation, a legal invocation of his Miranda rights within the meaning of Edwards versus Arizona.

    Mr. Charles A. Rothfeld 
    Well, the question here is whether or not he in fact requested a lawyer. 
    He stated that he was perfectly willing to speak to the police but that he would not make a written statement without the presence of counsel. 
    But he had no objection to talking to the police before counsel arrived. 
    The question here is the legal significance of this type of partial invocation of Miranda rights. 
    Now, a partial invocation is just that, a partial, limited invocation and nothing more. 
    The requirements of Miranda are satisfied if the inherently coercive effects of custodial interrogation are dispelled and that is accomplished by advising the suspect of his Miranda rights and honoring whatever decision he makes about whether or not he is willing to speak to the police, make a statement. 
    If the suspect freely, voluntarily chooses to invoke his rights only for a limited purpose, which is what the respondent did here, and he then proceeds to voluntarily make a statement to the police, nothing in Miranda or in any of this Court's other decisions would prevent him from doing so or would prevent the police from listening to what he has to say. 
    The difficulty with the Connecticut Supreme Court's decision I think this returns to Justice Stevens' reading of it and exactly what the Court meant to hold the Connecticut Supreme Court, I think understood the meaning of Miranda to be that any time a suspect recognizes the value of counsel in any of his dealings with the police, that all questioning must come to a halt until an attorney is present. 
    But this idea that the police or the courts have some obligation to safeguard the interest of the suspect more fully than the suspect himself thinks necessary or wants, if completely alien to Miranda which was designed to insure that it is the person who is being interrogated who controls whether or not he is able to make a statement. 
    The Court emphasized that its holding in Miranda was not designed to make interrogations impossible. 
    It was not designed to prevent suspects from confessing. 
    And the Miranda rules are not intended to insure that a suspect will always act in his own best interest or will always make the wisest possible decision when he--

    Mr. Charles A. Rothfeld 
    Well, I think as I was suggesting, there are these two types of reasons the suspect may rationally make that distinction. 
    We may think that it is in his interest to try to talk him way out of it, but that he is reluctant to commit himself in writing because if he wants to change his story, it would be more effective if there is a written statement, that in that case it would only be his word against the policeman's. 
    So, there are all kinds of entirely rational reasons that a suspect may make the distinction. 
    The suspect amy in fact be right, that an oral statement carries less weight with the jury than a written statement. 
    And, again as the Court at least implicitly recognized in Butler and the lower courts have explicitly recognized, people are reluctant to put things in writing even though they appreciate that their oral statements have legal significance. 
    I think, given the fact that the suspect was explicitly warned on a number of occasions that everything he said could be used against him, he stated that he understood that, the trial court found that he understood that, there is no reason for anyone to second-guess that conclusion. 
    I think that... If there are no further questions, Your Honor--

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Thank you, Mr. Rothfeld.

    Mr. Robert L. Genuario 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court-- 
    The case at bar, like the case in Smith versus Illinois, deals with the threshold inquiry that is mandated by this Court's decision in Edwards versus Arizona, and that threshold inquiry is whether or not the accused in the first instance has invoked his right to counsel. 
    If the accused has not invoked his right to counsel, then this Court should reverse and remand. 
    If the accused has invoked his right to counsel in the first instance, then under the standards set forth in Edwards, in Smith versus Illinois, in Michigan versus Jackson most recently, there could no waiver of that right to counsel unless there was a cessation of the interrogation and then further discussions and conversations were initiated by the defendant.

    Rather, the Connecticut Supreme Court decided that it did not have to reach the issue of voluntary, knowing and intelligent waiver because as a matter of law he had invoked his right to counsel. 
    So, we didn't even have to get into that issue of the voluntariness and the intelligence of his waiver.

speaker="robert_l_genuario" startTime="2039.563" stopTime="2114.862">
    Mr. Robert L. Genuario 
    --Well, let me illustrate it this way. 
    If we asked ten Wallingford police officers what Mr. Barrett meant by, 
    "Nothing in writing but I'll be happy to talk about it; I have no problem in talking about it. " 
    I'm sure those ten Wallingford police officers would say that, 
    "Nothing in writing and no written statement. " 
    in that context means that, 
    "We won't take out a particular form and we won't have Mr. Barrett write cut a statement and we won't have Mr. Barrett sign that statement. " 
    On the other hand, if we asked ten 19 or 20-year old individuals who had no prior dealing with the police, as in the case of my client, that what the words "nothing in writing" mean, I suggest that they would say, 
    "It means you're not going to write down what I say. " 
    I might emphasize, one of the arguments that Attorney Dewey gave during oral argument was one of the reasons somebody would make that distinction is because he wouldn't want his statement preserved. 
    I suggest that the ambiguity, "nothing in writing", deals with the basis upon which the very fundamental basis upon which the defendant was willing to speak with the police.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2114.862" stopTime="2127.669">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    So, you would have no quarrel then, under those circumstances if the police had not made any notes of defendant's statements and had simply relied on their recollection in the testimony at trial?
speaker="robert_l_genuario" startTime="2127.669" stopTime="2130.371">
    Mr. Robert L. Genuario 
    Well, I think the issue goes further than that.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2130.371" stopTime="2131.571">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    Well, could you answer my question?
speaker="robert_l_genuario" startTime="2131.571" stopTime="2150.951">
    Mr. Robert L. Genuario 
    Certainly, Your Honor. 
    In that situation, I think that the statements would still be excluded and the reason for that is that he has expressed affirmatively a desire for assistance of counsel. 
    There are two questions here. 
    One is whether it was ambiguous, and two, whether it was selective--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2150.951" stopTime="2171.614">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    Now, do you agree that my hypothesis meets your ambiguousness argument? 
    In other words, the ambiguity as you see it, I understood, was that he might have meant that nothing should be written down. 
    My hypothesis is, nothing is written down. 
    Does that meet your ambiguity problem?
speaker="robert_l_genuario" startTime="2171.614" stopTime="2186.374">
    Mr. Robert L. Genuario 
    --It does on the first level, Your Honor, but it doesn't answer the question that Justice Marshall has asked, doesn't it imply that he doesn't understand the distinction and that therefore the reason he wants counsel, and the request for counsel.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2186.374" stopTime="2204.586">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    Well, I think a lot of people probably didn't realize that Miranda was quite this complicated. 
    I can see from the way you view it that a hearing like this could go on for days, while we get into first levels of ambiguity and second levels of ambiguity. 
    It's a fairly complicated process, I take it, in your view.
speaker="robert_l_genuario" startTime="2204.586" stopTime="2232.069">
    Mr. Robert L. Genuario 
    On the contrary, Your Honor. 
    The position that we take is fairly straightforward position, that if the defendant has affirmatively requested counsel, and not just in any setting but the setting where he's dealing with the police and he wants counsel to assist him in dealing with the police, that under Edwards all we're asking is that the police step back for a moment.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2232.069" stopTime="2244.044">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    But he requested counsel conditionally here. 
    He said, even granting all your business about ambiguity, 
    "If it's going to be put in writing I want counsel, but I'm perfectly willing to talk. "
speaker="robert_l_genuario" startTime="2244.044" stopTime="2254.851">
    Mr. Robert L. Genuario 
    Well, nothing in any of the decisions of this Court have indicated that a conditional request for counsel is not an invocation of that right.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2254.851" stopTime="2269.194">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    Well, but a good many of our decisions see Miranda as a plain, simple, easy to follow principle, very simple. 
    And we have refused times and again to add on any additional prophylactic rules such as the one you're asking us to add on here.
speaker="robert_l_genuario" startTime="2269.194" stopTime="2288.239">
    Mr. Robert L. Genuario 
    I don't think I'm asking for any additional rules to be added on. 
    What I'm suggesting is that when an accused in custody, in dealing with the police, requests counsel that under Edwards it requires the cessation of interrogation.

    Mr. Robert L. Genuario 
    Well, I think that our reasoning follows from Miranda, and I think it's consistent with Edwards. 
    Matter of fact, perhaps the best factual pattern is a reading of the facts in Edwards, but we've been talking about a conditional waiver. 
    But in the Edwards case, the defendant invoked his right to counsel and the Arizona Supreme Court and this Supreme Court found that he had in fact invoked his right to counsel by using the words, 
    "I do not want to make a deal until my attorney arrives. " 
    This Court expressly found that that was an invocation of the right to counsel. 
    Rather than our approach being a novel approach, the novel approach is to say that, having requested counsel in dealing with the police, we can now back away from our holding in Edwards to the--

    --No, I don't believe it does, Your Honor. 
    I think it's ingrained in the Edwards case. 
    Similarly, in Oregon versus Bradshaw, the statement made by the defendant in invoking his right to counsel is, 
    "I would like to have counsel before this goes much further. " 
    What I would suggest to this Court is that if we too narrowly construe request for counsel, then the ease with which that right can be circumvented becomes too apparent. 
    And indeed the facts in this case the facts in this case are illustrative of that, 
    "I will not make a written statement. "

    He can waive it, but there has to be a time period in which he's given a little more room, and that's all we're saying. 
    That's all we're saying. 
    Your Honors, if there are no more questions, I think I will conclude there. 
    Thank you.

    Ms. Julia Dicocco Dewey 
    Just briefly, Your Honor. 
    The defendant in this case was given control over the course of his interrogation. 
    He was given a choice by the police officers, and the police officers respected that choice. 
    My opponent suggests that what the defendant did in this case was give an ambiguous statement, and that that ambiguity that he alleges mandates a presumption that there has been invocation of the right to counsel. 
    But that is a factual question that was never reached by any of the courts below. 
    He is relying upon a factual determination that was never made by the trial court or by the Connecticut Supreme Court. 
    Instead, the Connecticut Supreme Court applied a bright line rule: any time the word "attorney" is mentioned, it is automatically an invocation of a right to counsel. 
    They reached that determination without a factual basis, and therefore their decision should be reversed.
