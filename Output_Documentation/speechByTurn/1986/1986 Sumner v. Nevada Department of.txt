    Mr. D. Brian McKay 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court: 
    The State of Nevada is here today on a writ of certiorari to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. 
    That Federal Circuit Court of Appeals held a Nevada statute, which provided for the mandatory imposition of a death penalty under certain circumstances, unconstitutional. 
    That holding of the Ninth Circuit was contrary to a holding of the highest court in Nevada, the Nevada Supreme Court, which addressed the same question, and held it to be constitutional under both the U.S. Constitution, and the Nevada constitution. 
    Which brings us here this morning to the issue, to the question that is presented for this Court's determination this morning. 
    Which is: Did the imposition of a mandatory death penalty on an inmate, convicted of premeditated murder while serving a sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole, imposed for an earlier, unrelated first degree... first degree murder conviction, constitute a cruel and unusual punishment as prohibited by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution. 
    The State of Nevada submits that, no, it did not. 
    The imposition of a mandatory death sentence in this case did not violate the Eighth Amendment, or did not violate any other provisions of the United States Constitution; and that the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals decision was incorrect for the following reasons. 
    First, the Nevada statute is consistent... was consistent... with the basic tenets, the basic holdings of the Eighth Amendment, that in death penalty cases there be an individualized consideration of the character, in this case of the inmate, his record, and the circumstances of the latest murder. 
    Secondly, Nevada submits that its statute, as drawn at that time, narrowly defined the class of persons who were eligible for imposition of a mandatory death penalty. 
    Only the most incorrigible of people were subject to this ultimate sanction: those who are serving a life term, a life sentence, without the possibility of parole who then commit another first degree murder and are convicted of that. 
    There's been a societal decision to remove these people forever from free society. 
    Their criminal behavior is so unacceptable that there has been a determination that rehabilitation in these instances is simply not possible.

    --Well, first of all, under the Nevada statute and under the facts of this case, that's not what occurred. 
    But if it is a felony murder that occurs within the prison walls during his incarceration, I don't think that would make any difference. 
    I don't think that's an extenuating circumstance. 
    This individual... any person who fits within this category... has already been placed within a very narrowly defined category of eligibility.

    Nevada also submits that there is no other sanction that could be adequate or meaningful if it were not able to impose a death penalty in this particular case. 
    Without a death penalty, the latest crime, the latest murder, committed by this respondent would simply go unpunished.

    Mr. D. Brian McKay 
    That is correct. 
    And that's the next point that I was going to come to, Your Honor. 
    There has been a legislative determination, or there was a legislative determination, by the elected representatives of the people of the State that a mandatory death penalty was in fact necessary to enhance the valid goals of criminal justice that this Court has recognized, the goals of retribution, of deterrence, and of incapacitation. 
    And if that legislative judgment, provided of course that it comports with the basic requirements of the Eighth Amendment and the other constitutional provisions that apply to death penalty cases, is entitled to great deference by this Court. 
    Additionally, there is no question in this case as to the personal culpability, the personal responsibility, the moral guilt of the respondent; that's been conceded. 
    This Court has also been greatly concerned with the reliability of the process of the imposition of the death penalty. 
    We would submit that the quality of the record in this case makes clear that the process has been reliable. 
    There's been no wanton, arbitrary, capricious or irrational imposition in this case. 
    Addressing the respondent's primary argument that has been made, and his reliance upon Eddings v. Oklahoma, I think revolves around this Court's holding in Eddings v. Oklahoma. 
    The Court held in that case that when a statute that provided for aggravating and mitigating circumstances was on the books, and had to be addressed before there could be an imposition of the death penalty, that the sentencer was required to give weight and to consider any and all mitigating circumstances, and that they could not preclude consideration of mitigating circumstances. 
    That was the major holding in the Eddings case, and citing back to Lockett v. Ohio. 
    That case was not a mandatory death penalty case. 
    That case did not involve the inmate who was serving a life sentence without the possibility of parole. 
    I submit to this Court that Eddings v. Oklahoma did not say that in each and every capital case that any and all mitigating circumstances had to be presented to the sentencer prior to the imposition of a sentence at a separate sentencing hearing. 
    The Court simply didn't hold that. 
    I believe that the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals has put words in this Court's mouth that it has yet to utter on this particular subject. 
    Therefore, because none of the constitutional infirmities that have been found by this Court in the past in Furman, in Woodson, in Lockett, in Coker, in Inman, in Eddings, simply do not exist in the case, in this particular case, because they simply are not there; that Nevada's mandatory death penalty statute at that time, imposing a mandatory death penalty on inmates who commit a murder while serving a life sentence without the possibility of parole is constitutional; and that such a holding would be consistent with this Court's prior holding on mandatory death cases. 
    We also submit that Shuman's death sentence is valid as applied under the facts of this case, and that the Ninth Circuit decision needs to be reversed. 
    Now the legal issue in this case has arisen from the following facts, which I think are necessary and appropriate to briefly go over. 
    In 1973 the respondent, Raymond Wallace Shuman, was incarcerated in the Nevada State Prison, where he was serving a life sentence without the possibility of parole, having been convicted of a prior first degree murder. 
    While incarcerated in prison in 1973, he became embroiled in an argument with the inmate occupying an adjacent cell. 
    That argument was over the opening and closing of a window. 
    Respondent elected to resolve that argument by pouring flammable liquid all over the inmate and lighting him on fire. 
    As a result of this burning, the inmate died three days later. 
    Respondent was charged with murder. 
    He was tried in 1975 by a jury. 
    He testified on his own behalf. 
    He testified as to his character. 
    He testified as to the circumstances of the offense. 
    Other witnesses testified on his behalf. 
    Nonetheless, the jury found his guilty of capital murder, and under Nevada law, in effect at that time, a mandatory death sentence was required. 
    Also under Nevada law at that time, the automatic appellate process began. 
    In 1978, the Nevada Supreme Court upheld both the conviction of the respondent and the imposition of the mandatory death sentence, specifically recognizing this Court's intervening decisions in Woodson v. North Carolina and Roberts v. Louisiana. 
    The court, the Nevada Supreme Court, held that this was that rare and unique circumstance that the Court had alluded to in Gregg, and had specifically footnoted in Woodson and in Roberts. 
    The Court found that there simply could not be any mitigating circumstances in a case such as this that would allow for this latest crime, this latest murder, to go unpunished. 
    As a result of that... and the court also found, for what it's worth, that the respondent was entitled and not precluded from introducing mitigating evidence or mitigating circumstances on his behalf. 
    Respondent then initiated post-conviction proceedings--

    Mr. D. Brian McKay 
    After the State post-conviction proceedings were unsuccessful, the respondent commenced Federal habeas corpus proceedings in a Federal district court for the District of Nevada. 
    A number of issues were raised in those habeas proceedings. 
    He attacked his 1958 conviction. 
    He attacked his 1975 conviction. 
    And of course, the imposition of the mandatory death penalty sentence. 
    Also during those habeas-corpus proceedings, respondent requested or asked to be allowed to present evidence of mitigating circumstances, assumedly because this Court had handed down its intervening decisions that allowed and addressed that particular subject. 
    The Court ordered respondent to provide a specification of proof before deciding whether to hold an evidentiary hearing, and respondent never provided any evidence that there were or could have been any mitigating circumstances to lessen a death penalty sentence in 1975. 
    Finally, I think it's appropriate to address the whole concept of appellate review as it applies to a death penalty case such as this. 
    So that we can assure that there has been... the Court can be assured that there has been no imposition of a death penalty without the individual examination of the character, of the record, and the circumstances of the offense. 
    This Court has held in its more recent decisions, Zant v. Stephens, Cabana, even in Pulley, that to some extent there is the availability of appellate review to ensure that there have been no constitutional violations before a death penalty, the ultimate sanction is imposed. 
    In Zant, I believe the Court held that if there is a narrow definition, if the class of eligibility is so narrowed that you have only a small class of people who are eligible, and if there has been an individualized consideration, then certain findings can be made at the appellate level. 
    We believe that the Court has the unusual opportunity to look at the facts of this case as if it were in a laboratory. 
    There can be a microscopic review of everything that occurred, everything that's finite. 
    There are no extraneous contaminations that come into play. 
    There's a limited application. 
    The statute came into effect in 1973. 
    Nevada's legislative response to this Court's determination in Furman v. Georgia, and it went out of existence in 1977, Nevada's legislative response to this Court's determinations in Woodson and in Roberts. 
    So we would submit that, again, there is a narrow class of individuals who are qualitatively different from any other conceivable class of individuals who could be subject to the death penalty. 
    Only if an individual commits a first degree murder and is convicted, and has been serving a life sentence in prison, a life sentence that a jury previously found was... made him eligible for this sentence, and the crime was so serious, and his character and his record so required, that that life sentence be without the possibility of parole, that he should never be put in... back into--

    Mr. D. Brian McKay 
    In 1958, he was not the triggerman for that first degree murder conviction, no, not for the predicate offense. 
    There is no question that he was the perpetrator of the 1975 offense... 1973 offense for which the mandatory death penalty was imposed. 
    So we would submit that the Nevada mandatory statute in effect at that time was constitutional, and would not be inconsistent with this Court's other determinations. 
    If there are no other questions, I would like--

    Well, but it... I would submit that it didn't have to say this particular categories of murders. 
    Because it was quoting from Lockett, but Eddings was not a mandatory death penalty case. 
    It did not involve a life... an inmate serving a life sentence without the possibility of parole... of parole. 
    So I would just submit that in reducing the quote for that case, that's what occurred, it certainly was not a holding by this Court that that exception was now extinguished. 
    That's what the Ninth Circuit believes that this Court did, is extinguish Eddings. 
    That's what respondent has argued. 
    We respectfully submit that that is not what the Court did in Eddings v. Oklahoma.

    And let me just carry that one step forward. 
    He killed in 1958. 
    He killed again in 1973. 
    Does that mean he's going to kill again in 1988? 
    Do we wait until he is on his normal schedule? 
    He has been found to be a person who should be removed from society. 
    He then committed murder. 
    There simply can be no other sanction it the death penalty cannot be imposed in this case. 
    The murder will go unpunished.

   Argument of M. Daniel Markoff
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1454.353" stopTime="1460.173">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Thank you, General McKay. 
    We will hear now from you, Mr. Markoff.
speaker="m_daniel_markoff" startTime="1460.173" stopTime="1499.195">
    Mr. M. Daniel Markoff 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court: 
    The issue, as we have looked at, really boils down to something very, very simple here. 
    And that's whether a State can kill a person without at least giving them a hearing first to show some mitigating factors on his behalf. 
    As was previously indicated, every State in the United States has repealed mandatory death penalty statutes such as the one we are talking about here.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1499.195" stopTime="1516.257">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    xxx that bears on the constitutional question, Mr. Markoff. 
    If they do that in response to decisions such as Woodson, can you not say that they're simply reacting to what they perceive the Court's constitutional doctrine to be, rather than this being the sentiment of the community?
speaker="m_daniel_markoff" startTime="1516.257" stopTime="1558.068">
    Mr. M. Daniel Markoff 
    I would suggest, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, that the reason we had the mandatory death penalties was a response not to Woodson but to Furman. 
    Up to 1963, as recognized by the previous opinions of this Court, all states back then had repealed mandatory death penalty statutes, We went along, and then we had Furman in 1971. 
    And then all of a sudden, reaction to that decision, they passed mandatory death penalty statutes. 
    Legislatures pass them. 
    However, there is another indicia as to how the people felt at approximately that time, and that comes in the form of opinion forms as well, perhaps not the most reliable thing--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1558.068" stopTime="1562.121">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    You're using opinion polls to prove what?
speaker="m_daniel_markoff" startTime="1562.121" stopTime="1566.923">
    Mr. M. Daniel Markoff 
    --That people at that point in time did not favor mandatory death penalty statutes.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1566.923" stopTime="1571.827">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    And how does that factor into the constitutional equation, these opinion polls?
speaker="m_daniel_markoff" startTime="1571.827" stopTime="1587.703">
    Mr. M. Daniel Markoff 
    This Court has recognized that there are several ways of guaging or using as a barometer, how the people have felt. 
    The standard which we are concerned with here are the evolving standards of human decency in a maturing society. 
    And the Court--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1587.703" stopTime="1590.555">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    And how do the opinion polls factor into that?

    Mr. M. Daniel Markoff 
    --Well, that's what I'm leading at.

    The opinion polls--

    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    But that's why I asked you the question.

    Because my question is, might it not just show what the legislatures perceive what this Court's constitutional doctrine to require, rather than independently reflecting public opinion?
speaker="m_daniel_markoff" startTime="1617.439" stopTime="1660.635">
    Mr. M. Daniel Markoff 
    --I would submit to the Court that there is a long history in this country of abhorrence with mandatory death penalties; that the history of this country has demonstrated that, over the years, we have... if the death penalty is to be imposed, that it be at least somewhat discretionary, and now it's guided discretion. 
    And that is what the legislatures have done, in effect; that's what the court has approved, this Court has approved. 
    And I wasn't pulling public opinion polls out of my hat. 
    That was referred to in the Woodson decision, I believe it was, that... just as another Indicia. 
    And they referred to a poll which was conducted by the Harris Survey back in 1974 or '5 along in there.

    Mr. M. Daniel Markoff 
    I submit that we were... we didn't have them all repealed by '63, we were certainly going that direction in having them all repealed until the Furman decision came out. 
    The vast majority of the states did not approve this type of a sentencing procedure. 
    So what we then have is the standard as far as the substantive law is under the Constitution, the Eighth Amendment, of these evolving standards of human decency in a maturing society. 
    We have also submitted to the Court that the statute which we are concerned with procedurally violates the Constitution, and that such a mandatory death penalty, because of its unusual nature, cannot be imposed in an arbitrary and capricious fashion, and must give due consideration to the record and character and circumstances of the offense.

    Mr. M. Daniel Markoff 
    The best way to guage the punishment that Mr. Shuman is continuing to suffer at this point in time is by simply looking at the case on which he was originally sentenced in 1958, where he was given life without the possibility of parole. 
    As the Court has already noted, our client was not the killer in that particular case in 1958. 
    The codefendant was. 
    The codefendant received the same sentence that Mr. Shuman did, which was life without parole.

    It is possible. 
    That could happen. 
    Judge Reed in the lower court, in the U.S. District Court for Nevada, had sentence... had referred the matter back for resentencing in front of the state courts. 
    And then of course the state took their appeal to the Ninth Circuit.

    Mr. M. Daniel Markoff 
    It's possible. 
    Depending of course upon the way the Court prefers to remand it. 
    There is other possibilities that are available for this individual as well. 
    People who have been sentenced under the mandatory statute in Nevada have had their sentences just made simply consecutive to any other life without parole that they were doing. 
    For instance, if a person killed two policemen or something like that, under the old mandatory statute, he would have two consecutive life sentences then. 
    I submit to the Court also that there are a number of mitigating factors that could have been submitted to... to the Court on behalf... and I'm talking about submitting to the state court on behalf of Mr. Shuman if it had been allowed.

    That's basically it. 
    That's all the law... well, unless of course, the death penalty still applies, and they could resentence and give him that again, also. 
    But to this day, he has not even had any sort of a hearing concerning anything in his life, which is interesting. 
    Because if you go back and look at the 1958 case, the jury set the penalty there. 
    Sure, there was perhaps some mitigating factors that were introduced, as far as the actual defense was concerned in 1958; and the same thing could be said for '75. 
    But there was nothing presented that I am aware of concerning this individual's background, his psychological condition, his youth, anything. 
    Even '58 he never got the hearing as far as those hearings are concerned... '75. 
    So we are looking here at a man who is about to be killed, perhaps, and nobody has never heard anything about his life in detail at all.

    No, no, the death sentence which had been imposed at that time. 
    I submit some of the mitigating factors that the court would consider would be his mental and emotional condition, his age, his youth and background such as it was before he went to prison, the fact that the codefendant was released in 1977, ten years ago; the conduct of the victim as well in this case, which is sometimes, under some of the state death penalty statutes, one of the mitigating factors to be considered; as well as his record in the institution, and whether or not the system itself contributed in anyway to this whole incident coming about.

speaker="m_daniel_markoff" startTime="3031.016" stopTime="3227.243">
    Mr. M. Daniel Markoff 
    No, no, it's mitigating evidence as to why the death penalty shouldn't be imposed. 
    They say he's in this particular class of people that are never, ever to be released in society again. 
    And yet here you have a codefendant in the same situation who is released into society again. 
    And certainly a jury should be able... or a sentencer should be able to take that into account as well. 
    I submit, however, that the district court, the U.S. district court, was not concerned with the actual facts, but whether there should be an opportunity for a hearing to hear these mitigating factors in the state court before a sentencer. 
    I submit to the court, also, that there are numerous policy reasons, and therefore, supporting our position that the Constitution mandates a mitigation hearing in these cases, as to why you should be entitled to have a mitigation hearing. 
    First of all, the only person to lose anything as a result of this sentence, if you will, is going to be Mr. Shuman. 
    He will be executed, and that will be it for him. 
    If you have a mitigation hearing, the state doesn't lose anything. 
    They could still seek perhaps the same punishment. 
    So they're not out of the ballpark, so to speak. 
    The state interests are also served by a discretionary death penalty statute, if you order having a mitigating hearing. 
    Because they can still seek the same thing, as I indicated. 
    They're not going to lose out on making their arguments. 
    And it's also an interest of a state, I submit, that they hear whether a life is worth saving; I submit that they cannot close their ears and bury their head in the sand before they hear about a person's life and just send him off to be executed. 
    Another extremely important factor is that no legislature can ever forecast all the mitigating factors of a person's life. 
    The state, in effect, has conceded this by changing the law in Nevada 10 years ago, in 1977, by allowing the hearing of mitigating factors. 
    The argument that the state has raised, in saying that these types of individuals should never, ever have the possibility of being out in society again, and should be automatically executed, is belied by the... and contradicted by the own conduct of the state in providing for the present scheme that they now have. 
    I submit to the Court, also, that not all people who do life are necessarily murderers. 
    You could be an aider and abetter, perhaps, or it could come under the felony murder rule, or something of that nature. 
    Finally... thank you very much.

    Mr. D. Brian McKay 
    It covers any type of... any type of clemency is the purpose of the board, and this is just one particular area. 
    Let me go... let me please address one other issue. 
    You're correct, Justice Scalia, the crime in this instance would simply go unpunished. 
    There's no collateral impact, there's no collateral method of punishment within the prison system that would do anything to the contrary. 
    And I submit that single-celling an individual or putting them in solitary confinement is like saying, go to your room. 
    And that's fine for certain violations. 
    That's not fine for the crime of murder. 
    Additionally, in the condition that our prisons are in today, single-cell confinement might be considered a reward. 
    And I don't say that facetiously; it's a very serious problem that we face. 
    One final point that I'd like to make: The respondent had the opportunity at habeas corpus proceedings to present any mitigating circumstances, if they exist. 
    He did not. 
    He was ordered to by the court; did not. 
    And I submit there simply were not any. 
    Therefore, I suggest that the imposition of the death sentence in this case, mandatorily imposed by the Nevada statute, on an inmate serving a life sentence without the possibility of parole, was constitutional and did not violate his Eighth Amendment rights.
