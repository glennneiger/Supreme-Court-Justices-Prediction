    Mr. Robert J. Collins 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    This case raises serious questions about whether a city can prohibit the intentional interruption of a police officer during an investigation without infringing Constitutional rights protected under the First Amendment. 
    The answer to this question is of vital importance to both the city of Houston and many other cities and states in this country. 
    There are three principle legal issues that must be addressed by the court.

    Mr. Robert J. Collins 
    It was not put in the codification because at the time of codification the panel decision in the Hill case by the Fifth Circuit had been decided two to one and we were concerned that if we did put it in, it would be inadvertently be enforced. 
    So if it's not codified we're not enforcing it at the current time. 
    The legal issues before the Court center around the application of the Overbreadth Doctrine to a core criminal conduct statute. 
    It's the city's contention that the appellee, Mr. Hill, was involved in activities that were well within the Constitutionally prescribable realm of core criminal conduct, and as such he should not be able to assert the rights of other individuals not before this Court.

    Mr. Robert J. Collins 
    There are a lot of speculative reasons. 
    There could of been a situation where the judge felt that he had made a statement that prejudged the case and therefore that for technical reasons it could nave been dismissed. 
    There are a number of reasons, but it is not in the record before this Court as to why it was.

    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    Did it go to trial?
speaker="robert_j_collins" startTime="279.880" stopTime="450.026">
    Mr. Robert J. Collins 
    It did not go to trial to my knowledge, no. 
    The second legal issue that we have here is if indeed Mr. Hill is allowed to raise the Constitutional rights of others not before the Court and if he can assert those rights, is the ordinances overbreadth both real and substantial. 
    And again, in a subsidiary issue is a narrowing construction of the ordinance available? 
    Late one evening, early in the morning, in 1982, Officer James Kelley of the Houston Police Department and his partner were on patrol in a high crime area of the city of Houston. 
    While they were stopped and while Officer Kelley's partner was issuing a traffic citation, Officer Kelley observed an individual standing in the middle of a street stopping traffic. 
    He had stopped a city bus and a number of cars. 
    Officer Kelley approached the man and directed the man to the sidewalk in order to insure his safety and attempt to unblock the traffic in the street. 
    As part of his investigation, Officer Kelley had been talking to the man. 
    As he became more involved in the investigation, the individual became erratic in his actions and started to walk away from Officer Kelley. 
    At that point in time, Officer Kelley told the man to stop, approached the man, touched him on the shoulder to turn him around. 
    At that point in time, Officer Kelley heard a voice from the sidewalk where a crowd was gathering. 
    That voice was the voice of the appellee in this case, Ray Hill. 
    Mr. Hill yelled at Officer Kelley, told him to leave the man alone; he hadn't done anything wrong. 
    Officer Kelley continued to speak to the man. 
    He continued with his investigation. 
    Ray Hill also continued. 
    He continued to yell at Officer Kelley in a loud and boisterous voice, 
    "leave him alone, why don't you pick on somebody your own size. " 
    Mr. Hill yelled. 
    Officer Kelley then asked Hill if he was interrupting him in his capacity as a police officer. 
    Mr. Hill replied, 
    "Yes, why don't you pick on somebody my size. " 
    At that point in time, Officer Kelley, being concerned with the gathering crowd, concerned about the possibility of violence and feeling that Ray Hill was baiting him, and challenging him, and interrupting him in his investigation, arrested Mr. Hill and charged him with the violation of the ordinance at issue here. 
    The precise wording of the ordinance at issue here is: 
    "It shall be unlawful for any person to assault, strike, or in any manner oppose, molest, abuse or interrupt any policeman in the execution of his duty, or any person summoned to aid in making an arrest. "

 Justice Scalia 
 Mr. Collins, can I get something squared away? 
 I didn't, in our earlier, I didn't, I understood your answer to the Chief Justice's question, but it didn't comport with my recollection. 
 You said in your brief that Hill was later tried and found not guilty of the offense. 
 And likewise, the Appellee's brief says the same thing. 
 Hill subsequently was found, not guilty of violating the ordinance, following a non-jury trial before a Houston Municipal Court. 
 Now, was he tried and found not guilty, or not?

    Mr. Robert J. Collins 
    I don't think so, Justice Marshall. 
    [Laughter] 
    I think that there is a legitimate interest that a city has in protecting its police officers while they are involved in investigations, interference, and interruption. 
    The ordinance itself does not contain a scienter requirement. 
    But the scienter requirement is added by state law. 
    State law in Texas requires that all ordinances have a scienter requirement. 
    Therefore in this case an individual cannot be convicted under this ordinance unless he knowingly interferes with a police officer in the performance of his duties.

    Yes. 
    I think that the instances in the record are prime examples of it. 
    The cameramen who were involved on the crime scene, interfering with the officers in two cases. 
    The individual who attempted to hold back the officers that were making a vice investigation into a club. 
    Those instances have been characterized by the counsel in the lower court in this case as being representative of the way the ordinance is enforced.

    Mr. Robert J. Collins 
    I distinguish Lewis on the basis that Lewis, the statute in Lewis was a statute that could not apply to conduct. 
    It was limited by its words to speech. 
    The other thing that needs to be made, as far as the ordinance goes, the other point that needs to be made is that in many instances this ordinance is violated by an individual who refuses to obey an officer. 
    In some respects the ordinance can be characterized as a refusal to move on ordinance. 
    The other important factor to remember about the ordinance is the ordinance itself does not include trivial and insignificant interruptions within it's ambit. 
    There's testimony in the record by the city's chief prosecutor that these are not considered to be violations under the ordinance. 
    So what you have is an ordinance that regulates and prohibits. 
    And what it prohibits is within a narrow range. 
    It prohibits conduct intentionally done with the view to interrupt and interfere with a police officer at the time that they're making their investigation. 
    There are a number of statutes contained in the appendix to the city's reply brief that use similar words to the city's ordinance. 
    They would use words like hinders, obstruct. 
    Most of them have scienter requirements. 
    Some of them are a little different in that they do apply to language by their own terms. 
    We feel that the city ordinance is valid and these ordinances are also valid.

   Argument of Charles Alan Wright
speaker="charles_alan_wright" startTime="1362.470" stopTime="1412.117">
    Mr. Charles Alan Wright 
    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 
    If the court please I'd like to begin, I suffer from the disadvantage that Mr. Collins does that I was not present at the trial in municipal court, but I think on the basis of what is in the record that several of the answers that he gave were not wholly accurate. 
    We have in the Joint Appendix at page three, the judgment as signed by the state judge on that day in April 1982 and it says: 
    "This day this cause was called for trial and both parties appeared, announced ready for trial and the defendant pleaded not guilty and the court having heard the evidence is of the opinion that the defendant is not guilty it as charged. " 
    It seems to me that--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1412.117" stopTime="1417.604">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    Said that could be a form, Mr. Wright, that isn't inconsistent with Counsel's oral statement here.
speaker="charles_alan_wright" startTime="1417.604" stopTime="1485.565">
    Mr. Charles Alan Wright 
    --It is certainly inconsistent, Mr. Chief Justice, with his answer to you that the defendant was not tried. 
    The defendant was surely tried. 
    It was not a dismissal on some legal reason, it is an entry of the judgment that he is not guilty and to me that amounts to an acquittal. 
    In response to a question from Justice O'Connor about the status of the ordinance, Mr. Collins said that in an early stage in the code revision process, the thought was that possibly the ordinance should be repealed. 
    If you will look at the footnote at the bottom of page eleven of our brief, we state the fact that the city, the Houston City Council unanimously passed motion Number 811303 on April 7th, 1981, approving the city legal department's recommendation to omit the ordinance from what ultimately became the revised 1985 Code of Ordinances. 
    So that it was not merely a thought that possibly we will repeal the ordinance. 
    It was an act by the City Council saying in the new Code of Ordinances this is not to appear--

    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    Well, Mr. Wright, perhaps I didn't follow you just then.

    Mr. Charles Alan Wright 
    It would have been had the city attorney not in the request for council action in 1985 said, do not include section 3411A in the new code but do not repeal it also because we are currently involved in a lawsuit. 
    We might have to pay substantial attorney's fees if we repealed it.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1514.251" stopTime="1515.734">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    So it isn't repealed.
speaker="charles_alan_wright" startTime="1515.734" stopTime="1583.645">
    Mr. Charles Alan Wright 
    It is not repealed, no. 
    No, it is still on the books. 
    But it is on the books as the record, as the actions of the Houston City Council clearly show only because of the pendency of this lawsuit. 
    Getting to the constitutional issue itself, it seems to me common ground here that this ordinance has unconstitutional applications. 
    In its jurisdictional statement at page seven, the city said, 
    "On its face the ordinance can be applied to a wide variety of activities, some of which concededly cannot constitutionally be punished. " 
    And again at page eleven of that document, 
    "Since the state courts may yet limit the ordinance's application to proscribable conduct. " 
    And, Judge Higginbotham speaking for the seven dissenting justices, judges in the Court of Appeals, 
    "Because the Houston ordinance is undeniably susceptible to applications that would impermissibly regulate or proscribe protected speech. "

    Mr. Charles Alan Wright 
    Yes, I think so. 
    But we have an ordinance that everyone agrees reaches some forms of speech that are constitutionally protected. 
    On the other side, the argument then really is not is this ordinance overbroad, of course it is. 
    The question has to be in the terms in which this Court formulates it, is it substantially overbroad? 
    And there, our submission is that it is hard even to think of a valid application of the ordinance given the Texas preemption doctrine. 
    The Texas preemption doctrine has been something that is, something that is very hard to persuade the city to acknowledge the reality of. 
    They know about it. 
    The city attorney's memorandum to the, to the city council on why he recommended in 1981 that the ordinance be repealed says because it's all covered by the Texas Penal Code. 
    The issue of preemption has been raised by my colleague, Mr. Maness at every stage in this case and yet it is not until the city's reply brief in this Court that it mentions for the first time that there is even a doctrine that city ordinances cannot work in the same field in which there are state statutes.

    Well is that necessarily relevant to the constitutional analysis, Mr. Wright? 
    Supposing that we were to conclude by some mathematical calculation of which you were capable that this ordinance is capable of 70 percent constitutional application, 30 percent unconstitutional application. 
    If it covered, if it could apply in every situation which by its terms it applied to. 
    And, and this Court would say under those circumstances it is not substantially overbroad this is all hypothetical. 
    But then you come in and say, well yes but in 70, in half of that 70 percent it can't apply because of the Texas preemptious, preemption doctrine. 
    Is there a case from this Court saying that if a, if an ordinance is preempted by state law it, it is not applicable for overbreadth purposes? 
    I can't recall any.

    Chief Justice Rehnquist

    Mr. Charles Alan Wright 
    --No, it may well be out on principle that has to be the result I submit, Mr. Chief Justice, that the reason for Broderick v. Oklahoma and for the substantial overbreadth is that if a statute in most of its applications is valid then we're not going to strike it even though there is some imprecision and the stretch is too far at the outside. 
    But if it turns out that the statute, though making a pretty verbal display of covering a lot of conduct that validly can be prohibited, in fact doesn't, and I don't think it's a question of 30 percent, I would be very hard put and be happy to hear Mr. Collins help us with a single instance in which the ordinance can validly be applied today as a matter of Texas law to conduct that is not constitutionally protected. 
    He gave examples in his opening argument that, I think he discounts the full range of Texas statutes.

speaker="charles_alan_wright" startTime="2024.779" stopTime="2285.446">
    Mr. Charles Alan Wright 
    There is a great deal, Justice Scalia, of the overbreadth doctrine as this Court seems to have formulated it, that I find very strange indeed. 
    It seems to me that the Court would do well as it twice has in Justice Blackmun's opinion in Munson and in Justice White's opinion in Ferber to read Professor Monahan's article in the 1981 Supreme Court Review, I think it offers analytically sound approach to all of this that gets you out of a lot of the verbal traps of the sort that you have just instanced. 
    But the real issue is not how do we count up the number of valid and invalid things, it's really a less restrictive means approach. 
    Is there a way that the state can accomplish its legitimate purpose of protecting the police without sweeping into interference with people's rights to express themselves. 
    That, I think, is the way you ought to come to overbreadth problems. 
    But here, I submit, there really is very little, if anything, that is a valid application of this statute. 
    And I was especially pleased to hear my friend, Mr. Collins, refer the Court to page 77 of the Joint Appendix, Officer Kelley's testimony that it's only in the course of an investigation you do this. 
    Because I was re-reading the Joint Appendix this week-end and something struck me that somehow I'd missed the significance of it in all my other preparation of the case. 
    On that very page, Officer Kelley says that in the course of my investigations I have been interrupted thousands of times without making an arrest. 
    And the court intervenes; Judge DeAnda says: how often have you made an arrest for violation of this ordinance? 
    And Officer Kelley says: twice, this case and one other that's referred to. 
    It seems to me the danger in an ordinance where an officer feels that I've been interrupted thousands of times and he only makes an arrest twice suggests that the real flaw in this ordinance is that it does give such wide discretion to the arresting officer to decide what is an interruption and what is not. 
    But, even if the person he arrests is acquitted, as Raymond Hill was, to be arrested and to spend 18 hours in jail is not insignificant. 
    The probability, I hardly need remind this court is that sweeping statutes of this kind are not likely to be used against people who wear three-pieced suits. 
    They are likely to be used against those who are not at the top of the ladder socially. 
    I well remember in 1967, the night before the Texas/Oklahoma game, I was in Dallas and observing what I observed, what I thought to be improper police force in arresting a young man for allegedly jaywalking, my friend and I went to every police officer in sight and said: Officer, I want to get your name and badge number for the 1983 action I am bringing Monday morning. 
    And the officers were all very cooperative and indeed we didn't have a pen so we'd have to say, would you please lend us your pen and they would. 
    Now I am glad that the game was played in Dallas and not in Houston because I take it that I would have violated the ordinance, although it seems to me highly unlikely that I would have been prosecuted for violating it. 
    I'd like to change slightly, it I may, an example that was discussed during Mr. Collins' argument and put it in the terms that the American Civil Liberties Union did in its amicus brief. 
    Let us suppose that we have a police officer who is actually writing a ticket and someone comes up to him and says, excuse me officer, a man was shot in the next block. 
    I do not see any way one can read that ordinance without concluding that that is a violation of the ordinance even though it is hard to see how you protect the police or what social value there is in purporting to--

    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    --Don't you think the Texas courts might take that into consideration in construing the ordinance?
speaker="charles_alan_wright" startTime="2290.450" stopTime="2394.084">
    Mr. Charles Alan Wright 
    --It's awfully hard, Mr. Chief Justice, when you have an ordinance that says, "in any manner interrupt". 
    Now there's been talk here of getting a limiting construction or perhaps belatedly after five years of litigation sending the case over to see if the state court will tell us what it means. 
    I do not see how a state court can put a limiting construction on it in the sense of any valid interpretative process clear where there is no legislative history of what the Houston City Council meant in 1886 when it originally adopted the ordinance of the words themselves, "in any manner interrupt". 
    Those are very broad words. 
    It is hard to say as a matter of interpretation they apply only to physical conduct or things of that sort. 
    If there is a need in Houston that is not covered by the state statutes and I commend particularly to the Court the statement we quoted, pages 17 and 18 of our brief, from the committee that drew up the Texas Penal Code in 1974. 
    It seems to me it's a sensitive, thoughtful statement of why we aren't legislating more broadly than we are in this murky constitutional waters of disorderly conducts. 
    But if there is a need that is met here, the way to achieve that need is not to ask some court to pretend that we are interpreting the intention of the Houston City Council. 
    It is for the Houston City Council to adopt an ordinance that will address itself to the things it's concerned about that are not already adequately protected against by state legislation.

    Mr. Wright, the Seconds, this is a hundred year old ordinance and just for fun, I looked up interrupt in the Second Webster's International and it gives an obsolete meaning of the word. 
    It says obsolete, but a hundred years is old enough to obsolesce I suppose, and the obsolete meaning is about the same obstruct, prevent, something like that. 
    Now, you know, if the state court said that's what it means, obstruct or prevent, would that be close enough to validate it?

    Mr. Charles Alan Wright 
    Of course I would. 
    But I would go on, Justice Scalia, to say that that's something, that what is needed is a narrowly drawn, regulatory statute rather than trying to breathe validity into obsolete meanings of the word in a century old ordinance. 
    Just have the state court interpret it, to put in a modern word for what the old one was, right? 
    Well is that a valid part of the interpretive process? 
    I would wonder about that. 
    And I wonder even whether there is anyway to get a state court interpretation of it. 
    We now have a, have had since January 1st a certification procedure in Texas. 
    But whether a Texas court, given their historic reluctance in these matters, is likely in fact to answer some general question about the meaning of the ordinance seems to me quite unlikely.

    Possibilities are not enough for abstention, that the test be something that is realistically likely to happen.

    Mr. Charles Alan Wright 
    With respect, I don't think, I do not agree that it is. 
    They make rather fun in their brief, of the fact that we say the Texas Disorderly Conduct Statute, 42.01, covers much of the ground that 34.11 does and yet, the Texas Disorderly Conduct Statute is not the ancient, vague sorts of disorderly conduct statute that this Court has worried with in the past. 
    It bears a clear ancestry from the model penal code and seems to me a remarkably careful statute. 
    I'm not saying that I couldn't imagine some constitutional problems with it, but that on the whole I would have no difficulty with it. 
    But even with regard to those statutes and ordinances here that use words that on their face might appear to reach the kind of situation we are talking about, we don't know anything until we know, (a) how is that statute or ordinance interpreted, if it has been in the state, and (b) how in fact is it used in practice? 
    For example, they we here in their appendix at page 23, a Utah statute. 
    And then they also have a Salt Lake City Ordinance at page 34-A. 
    In our brief, in the footnote on page 22, we have cited to you a Utah case in which the court says: we cannot believe that the legislature intended to make it an offense merely to interrupt or distract a policeman. 
    And so, despite the breadth of language in the Utah statute and the Salt Lake City ordinance, what Mr. Hill was arrested for could not have been a criminal offense in Utah. 
    And I suspect that if we were to make an examination that we would find that either by court interpretation or by administrative implementation that very few if any places in the country would hold that the police can arrest for matters as insignificant as the Houston Police arrest people for by the thousands. 
    In my view, the court below properly held the Houston Ordinance unconstitutional and we urge you affirm it.

    I think that they can if they need too. 
    I really doubt that they need to. 
    I think, for example, Section 38.05 of the state statutes on hindering an investigation is a very good statute and other portions. 
    We have said throughout in our brief, Justice Powell, that of course there are times when even words constitutionally are proscribable. 
    Contrary to what is suggested in reply brief we have never argued that pure speech is all that's left. 
    That is if words in themselves are a threat of imminent violence, you can arrest. 
    If the words are reasonably likely to incite others to imminent violence that also can be made criminal. 
    Those are the general, normal bounds that the First Amendment puts on the situation in which words by themselves can be regarded as closely enough brigaded with actions so that one is inseparable from the other to use Justice Douglas's phrase. 
    We think that you can draw, if it is needed, an ordinance that will reach those situations where the city has a valid concern.

 May I put a very simple example to you? 
 Let's assume a motorist, at a very busy intersection with a traffic officer in the center of the intersection directing traffic concluded that the officer had made a dreadful mistake and had directed him or her to move, or not to move at the right time. 
 The individual gets out of the automobile, goes over to the officer and engages in extended conversation. 
 Heavy traffic, the officer has to try to direct the traffic and the person is interrupting his efforts to conduct his duties. 
 Don't you think that would be unlawful?

    I repeat that I think it can be done, but I would take my stand with the draftsmen of the Texas Penal Code and that portion of the report at page 18 of our brief that in case of doubt it is better to under penalize than to over penalize. 
    That this is the lesson taught us by our regard for liberty. 
    That if we have to err, it is better to err in the direction of having the policeman hear too much talk than of arresting people for talking. 
    You yourself, Justice Powell, in your concurring opinions twice in Lewis pointed out that we should expect the police to be trained and to be better able to resist words that are directed at them than our populous generally. 
    And it seems to me that that is right and that a policeman carrying as they normally do a gun and with a badge of authority that I think they're going to be able to take care of themselves.

    Mr. Charles Alan Wright 
    --I think, Justice Scalia, the statute for example that was upheld in Colten v. Kentucky and that seems to me to address itself to that kind of a problem in a much more effective way. 
    The elements in that statute, as the Court will remember are first, the crime was not merely speaking. 
    The crime was refusal to disperse in response to a lawful order by a law enforcement officer to do so. 
    So you had to first be given the order to disperse. 
    It has to be lawful or it will fail. 
    It must be with intent to cause public inconvenience, annoyance, or alarm and the Kentucky Court of Appeals had put a limiting construction on it that this ordinance, this statute does not apply to thing that are not predominately speech, but only to those in which speech is an incidental element of a dangerous situation. 
    And this court accepted that limiting construction. 
    I think those show the kinds of possibilities there are of protecting these perfectly legitimate situations without allowing the police unfettered discretion to make arrests where it is not legitimate to do so.

    Mr. Robert J. Collins 
    I do not know, Your Honor. 
    Insofar as the language and what we are prohibiting, we are simply prohibiting utterances intentionally directed at disturbing a legitimate governmental function. 
    I think this case is very similar to the situation that existed in the Grayned case where the speech, whether it was violent or non-violent, was not allowed where it would tend to disturb a school in session. 
    I think we have the same type of situation here. 
    If we have a situation where the substantial reach of the ordinance covers situations that the city has a legitimate interest in preventing and I think in determining substantiality of overbreadth that one needs to weigh the substantial interest that the city has against the potential effect on speech. 
    Especially the potential chilling effect on speech. 
    Nowhere today have we heard anything about anyone who this ordinance has prevented them from complaining about the incidents that Mr. Hill wished to complain about. 
    Those incidents can be complained about in many places and at many times other than at the scene of an arrest. 
    They can be complained at city council. 
    They can be complained at by picketing the police department, but the fact that we are involved in a situation that is a highly delicate situation, that of an investigation, detention and arrest, makes it an inappropriate place to allow the unfettered exercise of freedom of speech. 
    Most of the examples that we've talked about today have been examples of an officer walking up to, or an officer writing a ticket and the man comes up and says he was shot in the back and he can be arrested. 
    Well, I don't think he would be arrested under that ordinance. 
    I think a police officer would turn around and say where. 
    Part of a police officer's job is communicating with citizens. 
    But that's not what we're dealing here. 
    It's not an ordinance that says you cannot talk to a police officer. 
    It's not an ordinance that says you cannot annoy a police officer. 
    It's an ordinance that says you cannot obstruct a police officer who is involved in an investigation.

    Mr. Robert J. Collins 
    I believe the reason that was given, and it's in the record, is that the individual wanted to stop traffic so he could back a truck out into the street. 
    In conclusion, what I would like to say is that this ordinance is a constitutional regulation and it protects police officers in the performance of their duties without impinging and is not on a great deal protected free speech.
