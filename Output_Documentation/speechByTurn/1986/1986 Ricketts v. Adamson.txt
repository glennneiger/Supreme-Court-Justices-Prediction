    Mr. William J. Schafer, III 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    The issue in this case is whether the State of Arizona can prosecute John Adamson for the crime it dismissed when it entered into a plea bargain with him after he breached the plea agreement. 
    As we were selecting the jury to try Mr. Adamson for the murder of Don Boiles, he struck a bargain with the State. 
    He would testify in four different cases in return for a sentence of 48 to 49 years. 
    If he refused to testify or refused to be interviewed in reference to preparation for trial in this specific instance in any of these cases, the agreement was void and he would be subject to the original charge. 
    Adamson testified in three of the four cases. 
    One was the murder of Don Boiles. 
    On his testimony Dunlap and Robison were convicted. 
    When their convictions were reversed on appeal in March of 1980, Adamson refused to testify at their retrials. 
    He wrote us a letter--

    Mr. William J. Schafer, III 
    I wouldn't classify it a rush to judgment, Your Honor, but I would say this, although it does not appear in the record. 
    I... we were concerned as to the problems not sentencing him would raise. 
    This was a unique case in many ways. 
    One of the unique features about it is that Mr. Adamson all during the time he was testifying up until the time of sentencing had been in local custody which was really a county jail. 
    That facility, as most county facilities in the State of Arizona, are not really adequate for holding anyone for an indefinite period of time. 
    It was our consideration that we should get on with sentencing Mr. Adamson so that he could get into federal custody as he finally did.

    Mr. William J. Schafer, III 
    Yes, he is. 
    Mr. Adamson wrote us a letter saying he would not testify unless we made additional concessions. 
    We told him that we would not make more concessions and that his refusal was a breach of the agreement which reinstated the original charge which included a possible death sentence. 
    We tried to force him to testify but he refused and we re-filed the original charge. 
    He attacked that re-filing unsuccessfully in the xx court immediately, and then with a special action in the Arizona Supreme Court, arguing in both instances that the re-filing was barred by double jeopardy principles. 
    We then did two things. 
    We filed a response to the special action in the Arizona Supreme Court urging that Court to construe the agreement and determine whether he had breached it, and then we also filed a motion in the trial court seeking to have Dunlap's retrial continued because it was just a week away. 
    After those two convictions were reversed by the Arizona Supreme Court, those cases were separated although they had started out as one case. 
    So, what we were facing were two retrials, one for Dunlap and one for Robison. 
    The first one was set, as I said, just a week away was the retrial for Mr. Dunlap. 
    The same day that we did these two things, Adamson moved to withdraw his Petition for Special Action. 
    He later said in one of his federal habeas corpus pleadings that he did that when it became clear to him that the question of his breach might be decided by the Arizona Supreme Court. 
    The Supreme Court refused to dismiss his petition. 
    They set the matter for a hearing and Dunlap's pending trial was stayed. 
    It was now clear what Adamson was trying to do. 
    He was trying to delay a judicial determination of whether he had breached the agreement until after the Dunlap trial started, with no resolution of that question, and the jury seated in the Dunlap trial. 
    If we wanted to pursue Dunlap, we would have no choice but to accede to Adamson's demands. 
    The only other choice would be to forget Adamson as a witness and dismiss the cases against both Dunlap and Robison, and Adamson was betting that we would not do that. 
    Adamson lost in the Arizona Supreme Court. 
    They decided that the plea agreement included retrials and that Adamson had breached the agreement and they reinstated the original information. 
    That was on Thursday. 
    The stay of Dunlap's trial was lifted on Friday, the following day, and his trial was set for the following Monday. 
    Our attempts at negotiation with Adamson were not successful, and without him--

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    We will resume there at 1:00 o'clock, Mr. Schafer. 
    Mr. Schafer, you may proceed.
speaker="william_j_schafer_iii" startTime="484.458" stopTime="642.493">
    Mr. William J. Schafer, III 
    Mr. Chief Justice, thank you and may it please the Court: 
    When we decided that we did not have John Adamson as a witness, we moved to dismiss the cases against Dunlap and Robison, and Dunlap's was dismissed on that Monday, the day set for trial. 
    Adamson then was tried and convicted. 
    His conviction was affirmed on appeal by the Arizona Supreme Court. 
    He then went into federal court with a Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus. 
    The Ninth Circuit held that we could not prosecute Mr. Adamson on the original charge because of the lesser included offense rule of Brown versus Ohio, and secondly, that Adamson did not waive his double jeopardy rights. 
    We believe that the circuit court was wrong on both of those counts. 
    First, the circuit court drew its own conclusions as to the meaning of the plea agreement and Adamson's letter to us. 
    It should not have done that, as that was a question for the Arizona courts. 
    That was, we contend, a matter of Arizona law and it was composed of determinations on factual issues, both things which are commonly set aside for decision by a state court, and once made, entitled to great deference and as to factual issues in a habeas corpus case, a presumption of correctness. 
    If, then, the finding of the Arizona court that Adamson breached his plea agreement is accepted, the next question is whether anything prevented prosecution on that original charge. 
    The Ninth Circuit said that Brown versus Ohio prevented the prosecution but we do not believe that that is correct. 
    As this Court noted in Jeffers versus United States, there are exceptions to the Brown lesser included offense rule. 
    One of those exceptions is where the defendant asks for two trials, or where his deliberate actions result in two trials. 
    In this case, Adamson's deliberate breach resulted in two trials and he knew that would be the result of his breach for he had agreed to that.

    As this Court noted in Jeffers, there are exceptions to the Brown lesser included offense rule, and as I say, one of those is where the defendant himself asks for two trials or where his deliberate actions force two trials. 
    In this case Adamson's breach resulted in those two trials and he knew what he was doing.

    Mr. Schafer, if the Supreme Court of Arizona had come out the other way in construing Adamson's plea bargain, you would concede, I suppose, that what he said was correct?

    Mr. William J. Schafer, III 
    I don't disagree with what he did. 
    I think I would phrase it a little differently than you did. 
    It wasn't as best he could. 
    What he said was, we'll go back to the original plea agreement and there is not much question. 
    We said no, we cannot do that. 
    We cannot go back to the agreement that you just breached. 
    We tried to come up with an agreement that would allow us to trust Mr. Adamson, and we could not construct such an agreement.

 I mean, you know, if that makes you feel better, I suppose you can put it that way.

    Mr. William J. Schafer, III 
    I believe I would be, Your Honor, and my argument is that Johnson versus Zerbst really should not apply here because there are other considerations that this Court has to have in mind and they could not be fulfilled, I think in most of the cases, if we were to apply a Johnson versus Zerbst theory to this and require that there be a knowing and voluntary waiver by the defendant. 
    However, if this Court is to say that Johnson versus Zerbst applies, it seems to me that this record is quite clear that Mr. Adamson knew exactly what he was doing. 
    There is a very lengthy plea taking by Judge Birdsall, which as I recall is about 35 pages, where this is discussed with Mr. Adamson, the plea agreement. 
    In fact, every one of the paragraphs in the plea agreement is discussed and at the end of that, and all through it, he indicates that he knew exactly what he was doing. 
    I believe this case is more like Ohio versus Johnson in that Mr. Johnson pleaded to two of four counts. 
    The argument was raised that the lesser included offense rule came into play and double jeopardy barred it, and this Court said no, that that is not true. 
    Underlying the double jeopardy principle is a realization that there are few hard rules that can be drawn, and that the solution in each case lies more in an analysis of the respective interests involved. 
    Adamson had an interest, in seeing to it that the state did not prosecute him repeatedly for the same crime. 
    He also had an interest in retaining control over whether his guilt would be determined at one sitting before one tribunal. 
    He has not been denied either of those interests. 
    We have not prosecuted him repeatedly and he retained control over the course his trial would take, giving up that control when he entered into the plea agreement. 
    On the other hand, the state's interest is in seeing to it that we have an opportunity to marshal our forces and present our case against John Adamson. 
    The Ninth Circuit opinion denies us that opportunity and it should be reversed. 
    I would like to reserve the rest of my time.

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Thank you, Mr. Schafer.

speaker="roy_t_englert" startTime="1128.839" stopTime="1244.229">
    Mr. Roy T. Englert, Jr. 
    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    There is no need in this case for a knowing, intelligent and voluntary waiver of double jeopardy rights above and beyond that which is clearly contained in the plea agreement itself. 
    Indeed, in Scott this Court has held that when it is the defendant's action that brings about the need for successive prosecution, concepts of waiver need not be invoked. 
    The Court's decisions in the appeal cases and the mistrial cases have not rested on waiver rationale. 
    To take another concrete example, in Jeffers the defendant objected to the government's attempt to have the continuing criminal enterprise and conspiracy counts all joined in one trial. 
    When he failed in that effort, he... I am sorry, when he succeeded in that effort he surely was not entering into a Johnson v. Zerbst knowing and voluntary waiver of his right not to be free of double jeopardy, because it wasn't until this Court's decision in Jeffers that it was clear whether CCE and the underlying conspiracy were greater and lesser included offenses. 
    Nonetheless, this court held that because of the defendant's action it was appropriate for him to be tried separately on the greater and lesser included offenses in that case. 
    The fundamental question in this case is whether a defendant can breach his plea agreement but nevertheless prevent charges from being reinstated as the plea agreement said they would be, on the grounds that the double jeopardy clause automatically prevents reinstatement.

    Mr. Adamson did not... Mr. Adamson's counsel did not write a letter saying, 
    "We have a disagreement about this. " 
    "Let's work it out. " 
    The letter of April 3rd, 1980, which is reprinted at pages 106 to 110 of the Joint Appendix, stated Mr. Adamson's refusal to testify unless his non-negotiable demands were met.

    Mr. Roy T. Englert, Jr. 
    --That concession was mistaken, and that, I believe, is made clear starting with the letter of April 9th, 1980 from the State and continuing through six years of proceedings in State courts, federal habeas courts. 
    It certainly has been the State's position that the April 3rd letter was breached. 
    There was a preceding conversation on April 2nd which was reconfirmed by that letter of April 3rd, in which Mr. Adamson refused to testify unless his non-negotiable demands were met. 
    That is shown by the very first sentence in Mr. Adamson's counsel's letter. 
    That refusal to testify on April 2nd was a breach of the agreement. 
    Mr. Schafer's letter of April 9th reflects another conversation, a conversation which defendant now denied, to be sure, but nothing else in the record shows any denial. 
    That April 9th conversation appears to be a breach of the agreement. 
    It was not Mr. Adamson's position that this was a disagreement that needed to be gotten before a court as quickly as possible. 
    Indeed, Mr. Adamson resisted the State's attempt to get the agreement construed. 
    On page 86 of the Joint Appendix there is a very clear statement by Mr. Adamson's counsel to the Supreme Court of Arizona that Mr. Adamson has never asked any court to construe this agreement. 
    His position was that he did not want the agreement construed, and as Mr. Schafer suggested in his argument, the timing of the Dunlap and Robison retrials is critical to take into account in terms of what was going on in the month of May, 1980, when this action was being brought before the Arizona Supreme Court. 
    It is the position of the United States that there really is no double jeopardy issue in this case, and despite the holding of the Ninth Circuit, respondent's brief doesn't place most of its effort in an attempt to say that there is any real double jeopardy issue in this case. 
    Their position is that there is something special and unusual about this case, that somehow it was fundamentally unfair for the Supreme Court of Arizona to find the breach it did in this case because there was just a good faith disagreement and as soon as it got resolved Mr. Adamson was willing to testify. 
    First of all, I don't know what federal constitutional issue that raises. 
    At best, in some extreme case, there might be an argument that an insupportable state finding of breach violated due process, but this is not that case. 
    There is ample evidence in the record that Mr. Adamson refused to testify unless his demands were met. 
    The agreement, as interpreted by the Supreme Court of Arizona, made clear his obligations. 
    The Ninth Circuit and the district court, the first time they had heard this case, found the interpretation of the agreement to be eminently reasonable, and we submit, correctly so. 
    We think that this case was summed up extremely well by the Ninth Circuit in 1981, the first time it considered this precise issue. 
    As the Court said, on page 161 of the Joint Appendix, 
    "In his written refusal to testify, and list of demands, Adamson acknowledged that he ran the risk of reprosecution for first degree murder under the terms of the plea agreement. " 
    "He cannot now claim immunity in what proved to be a losing gamble. " 
    If the Court has no further questions, thank you. 
   
   
   
   Argument of Timothy K. Ford
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1600.393" stopTime="1603.279">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Thank you, Mr. Englert. 
    We will hear now from you, Mr. Ford.
speaker="timothy_k_ford" startTime="1603.279" stopTime="1968.360">
    Mr. Timothy K. Ford 
    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    This case most certainly does involve a double jeopardy issue. 
    Mr. John Adamson was in prison serving the second year of a prison term for the murder of Don Bolles when he was charged with the murder of Don Bolles. 
    Now, the issue here arises at an unusual context. 
    The context has to do with... and begins with an agreement between attorneys and a disagreement over what the terms of that agreement were. 
    Like most such disagreements, it arose because something happened that nobody anticipated when the agreement was entered into. 
    What everybody anticipated, when the agreement was entered into, is that Mr. Adamson would plead guilty. 
    He would tell the State who else was involved in this murder. 
    He would testify against those people and he would testify against others involved in other crimes and at the conclusion of that testimony he would be sentenced and after that, in a separate provision of the agreement, it said he would be transferred from Pima County Sheriff's custody into a different form of custody which turned out to be Federal Witness Protection program custody. 
    Mr. Adamson did plead guilty. 
    He did solve this crime for the State of Arizona. 
    He did testify against these other people, and not just once or twice or five times or ten times, but he counted 14 times, 31 days, 190 hours, in court, 205 he counted and it is undisputed, interrogative sessions outside of court. 
    He waived his rights. 
    Now, that includes some occasions after the breakdown of the plea agreement where he continued to voluntarily cooperate with federal authorities in this matter. 
    What happened that was not anticipated was that after the State sentenced Mr. Adamson, and he was sentenced after he testified in all those cases and everybody was convicted, and after he was transferred into federal custody one of the convictions was reversed. 
    It was reversed on a ground that required Mr. Adamson's immunity agreement to be renegotiated because the State for some reason, and it's not in the record... and I'm at a disadvantage here because I have to stick to the record that's before this Court, and of course there has never been an evidentiary hearing on these questions and I was not counsel at this stage... but for some reason the State refused to give Mr. Adamson immunity as to a receiving stolen property crime that involves selling an illegal suit that got tied up in this set of facts. 
    Because of that he took the Fifth Amendment and there was cross examination limitations during the Dunlap and Robison trials, and that was why their cases were reversed. 
    So, when that happened everybody knew that there had to be further negotiations between Mr. Adamson and the State because that changed his situation. 
    Mr. Schafer said so in the newspaper, and Mr. Adamson read that. 
    Mr. Adamson's counsel said so, and in fact, there were negotiations. 
    They started discussing, what are the terms and Mr. Adamson's position and his lawyer's position was, 
    "We have performed. " 
    "We have testified time and time and time again. " 
    "We have been sentenced. " 
    "We have been transferred. " 
    "Our part of the bargain has been completed. " 
    "So for further testimony, we want further considerations. " 
    Primary in his mind was safety. 
    This is an extremely volatile, dangerous case involving allegations of organized crime and governmental corruption, and Mr. Adamson's safety was placed in the record by Mr. Schafer as the reason why they couldn't find a place for him in the State of Arizona and had to transfer him. 
    For his own safety, is what Mr. Schafer said back then. 
    Mr. Adamson's lawyers took a tough position. 
    In Mr. Adamson's words in that letter of April 3rd, he asked for the moon. 
    That was their position in negotiations. 
    He said it may have been untutored, but it was in good faith because in that letter he never said, 
    "I repudiate this agreement. " 
    "I want to go back. " 
    "I want this to be undone. " 
    He said, 
    "This is how we read this agreement. " 
    or his lawyer said this. 
    "This is what we agreed on when we entered this agreement, that we would testify and then we would be sentenced, and that has been done and now there has to be additional consideration and here is the consideration that we demand. " 
    He did not say, and it is important to remember the context that we are in here of negotiations between attorneys, and frankly there is nothing in the record that there was any meeting on April 2nd. 
    We have a footnote regarding the reference to April 9th. 
    We know nothing about any such meeting. 
    There has never been an allegation of any of those two things happening. 
    Again, we have a problem here. 
    There has never been an evidentiary hearing. 
    But I know nothing of those. 
    The question that has been raised, and what I understand to have happened, is there was this call on April 2nd and the response was this letter. 
    And the letter did not say, John Harvey Adamson hereby refuses to testify in any further cases, signed William Feldhacker. 
    The letter said, here's our legal position. 
    Here is how we construe the agreement. 
    Here are the additional items of consideration we wish in addition to testimony, and if you find that there is an absolute prohibition to any of these we can anticipate that Mr. Adamson will not testify in any future trials. 
    Now, that is bargaining. 
    That is negotiating position. 
    That is not a breach of the plea bargain agreement. 
    The plea bargain agreement never said anywhere, you will not write a letter, you will not assert a position through counsel.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1968.360" stopTime="1979.464">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    In the sentence before that, Mr. Ford, he said, 
    "I would like to advise you that the demands outlined above are basically non-negotiable demands. " 
    That doesn't sound like a letter asking for negotiations.
speaker="timothy_k_ford" startTime="1979.464" stopTime="2131.127">
    Mr. Timothy K. Ford 
    Well, I think it is an inartful letter asking for negotiations, Your Honor, and I think that both sides in this case, if they were at this point the negotiations broke down, and I think partly because of these kind of miscommunications between counsel. 
    The position Mr. Schafer has described his response as taking... of trying to get Mr. Adamson to go along. 
    It's not how Mr. Adamson said, and his counsel have placed on the record, that they interpreted it, they interpreted it as, "You have already breached", and that is how the Solicitor General read it in their brief here in this Court and that is how I read it. 
    "We may now prosecute you. " 
    "You are subject to prosecution. " 
    Therefore, then, Mr. Adamson did not refuse to testify, or did not testify at this pretrial hearing. 
    Justice Rehnquist, it is important for me to differentiate, I think throughout this, the contract questions and the waiver questions and the syllogism that Mr. Schafer's argument proceeds with, which says he agreed, if he breached, he would be reprosecuted. 
    He breached; therefore he can be reprosecuted. 
    What that does is just substitute one legal conclusion for another. 
    The legal conclusion of breach is not what leads to the legal conclusion of waiver. 
    What the plea agreement said is, if he should refuse to testify then the agreement is null and void and he may be reprosecuted. 
    The only time in all these years Mr. Adamson refused to testify was in those proceedings before Judge Myers after the State had said, 
    "You are already in breach. " 
    "We are going to prosecute you for all these things. " 
    Mr. Adamson's lawyers... when Mr. Adamson refused he did not refuse in the sense of saying, 
    "Well, whatever the Court says, I am not going to say another word. " 
    "I am standing on my Fifth Amendment privilege. " 
    Indeed, Judge Myers did at first go along with the State's argument and say, 
    "Mr. Adamson, you have to testify. " 
    "I'm ordering you to testify. " 
    And then what happened was, he did not defy the court or the agreement. 
    His lawyer stood up and said, 
    "Just a minute, Judge Myers, please let me explain to you what has happened here. " 
    and he explained this chronology and he showed the letter that Mr. Schafer had written that had threatened and said that he was subject to reprosecution then. 
    And he said, 
    "In light of this and in light of our position the plea bargain agreement has been satisfied, we believe we have no double jeopardy. " 
    --or, I'm sorry, "self-incrimination protection".

    But Justice Scalia... I mean, saying, 
    "When you call me into court next week I don't think I am going to testify unless you pay me ten million dollars. "

    Mr. Timothy K. Ford 
    Under the restatement, no. 
    Under the vast majority of state laws, my understanding is no. 
    This kind of a statement as far as I can tell, nowhere in the law is treated as a breach of the contract and certainly not one that permits and relieves the State from all of its obligations. 
    This is not just a situation... if this had happened in the commercial media where somebody had ordered 1,000 widgets and 900 were delivered and then there was a dispute among their lawyers over whether the additional hundred had to be delivered, one side could never say even if they were proven right that the other hundred was owing,

    Mr. Timothy K. Ford 
    Without... well, let me retreat from the position and point out, because I do not want to get fixed to this question of whether or not... I mean the State, the important thing is, I guess, if this is a breach, I think as your question earlier to Mr. Schafer pointed out, Mr. Roberts, the Assistant Attorney General of the State of Arizona conceded in the Ninth Circuit this wasn't a breach.

    Mr. Timothy K. Ford 
    Well, perhaps you are not, Mr. Chief Justice, but at least it indicates that a reasonable person with some knowledge of this case and the law could believe that Mr. Adamson could write that letter or his lawyers could write that letter without breach.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2397.000" stopTime="2405.254">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    That it may indicate, but certainly we evaluate for ourselves what is before us. 
    We are not bound by concessions made by parties in another court.

    Mr. Timothy K. Ford 
    I agree, Your Honor, and of course it's not... again the question is not breach. 
    It seems to me the question is whether in the context of this agreement Mr. Adamson committed an action that constitutes a waiver of a constitutional right which clearly had attached to him. 
    Now, in order to even get to this question, of course we have to say, a waiver can occur through counsel. 
    We have to say that the obligations of the contract were so clear that by taking this position that he was making a waiver--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2440.910" stopTime="2452.735">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    Well, why do you need a waiver in this case, Mr. Ford? 
    Certainly cases like Dinitz and Scott say that where a retrial occurs as a result of something the defendant did the waiver doctrine doesn't apply?
speaker="timothy_k_ford" startTime="2452.735" stopTime="2471.095">
    Mr. Timothy K. Ford 
    --Well, Dinitz and Scott, as I understand them, involve a different double jeopardy interest. 
    And what this Court, I think has emphasized to be a secondary double jeopardy interest and that is the interest in continuing before... or completing the trial before a single fact finder.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2471.095" stopTime="2472.547">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    That is secondary.
speaker="timothy_k_ford" startTime="2472.547" stopTime="2558.736">
    Mr. Timothy K. Ford 
    This Court certainly said, I believe in Dinitz itself, that this is not the same as the central common-law basis for the double jeopardy clause which are the three common-law pleas and one of those is what is involved in here. 
    The French, and my French is awful... autrefois, convict. 
    That is Mr. Adamson's plea and it is the center and the core of the double jeopardy clause that he is relying on for protection here, not... he's not... again although those cases say, we're not analyzing this in a waiver term, that of course, that whole line of authority arose out of the Green case where the State was arguing and based on some 19th Century precedent that this is a waiver. 
    The Court refused to inject that body of law against the defendant. 
    But even if you take the Court's terms, and I have looked at all these cases, Jefferson, Scott, Dinitz, and they talk about voluntary choice and the defendant's, deliberate election and indeed, they are all absolutely accurate in my mind. 
    The defendant in those cases chose to have exactly the consequence that he got. 
    He said, 
    "I want to have another trial. " 
    "I want this trial suspended and to try again. " 
    Or he said, 
    "I want to vacate my plea. "

    And that is, he did not agree that if he should breach he could be retried. 
    He agreed that if he refused to testify he could be retried. 
    And that is a different thing, and that is the difference between a state law question in this case and a federal law question in this case. 
    Now, with regard to that agreement the Ninth Circuit, I think, was absolutely correct when they said there is no way to read the plea agreement itself as a waiver of double jeopardy because it only says, if something happens in the future then a consequence can occur that implicitly waives double jeopardy, if you read everything against Mr. Adamson. 
    Now, there is no explicit... there were many constitutional rights listed there and they didn't put that one in. 
    The reason they didn't put that one in is because they didn't think he was going to be sentenced until everything was over. 
    What happened was, he was sentenced and he thought everything was over and the other side thought it was not, with the exception of this Ashford Plumbing thing. 
    At that point it seems to me that you can't have a defendant sign kind of a contract of adhesion that says, "I agree"... perhaps that's the wrong phrase. 
    I'm not a contract lawyers. 
    But you can't have a defendant say, 
    "By entering into this agreement we've got you; now you've waived your double jeopardy rights. "

    Mr. Timothy K. Ford 
    It's a waiver that involves two different event. 
    Even if you imply the waiver, which this Court refused to do in Menna versus New York, the implied waiver only occurs with first, the signing of the agreement and then the later event. 
    It seems to me that at least the later event has to be voluntary. 
    You couldn't... this Court would not entertain a situation where if Mr. Adamson was unable to... was hospitalized and was unable to get to the courthouse the state could say, 
    "He refused to testify and it says in here he has failed to testify. " 
    That kind of... there's got to be a voluntariness. 
    If we're going to allow these kind of agreements to supplant constitutional rights, they can't take away the basic essence of those constitutional rights and the loss of them.

    They could have written into the agreement, either as they did, it will be over at sentencing or if the defendant is sentenced prior to any testimony then he agrees to waive double jeopardy with regard to any later refusals to testify.

    Mr. Timothy K. Ford 
    Well, that's a good question. 
    I think that, as I understand double jeopardy law now from reading Dinitz and the cases that have gone over the history of it and the interests involved, I think that double jeopardy does not attach until in a guilty plea situation, there is a sentence. 
    I think that really, implicitly, that is what is held by Ohio versus Johnson, that you can't just say guilty now, double jeopardy; that there has to be more that implicates the core principles of the double jeopardy clause and that the sentencing does that, certainly under Arizona law and the understanding of the parties here, the sentencing did that. 
    So, the double jeopardy question... the contract question, for example in this case, the contract protected Mr. Adamson from prosecution for a number of other crimes. 
    The federal Constitution did not because jeopardy had not attached as to those crimes. 
    After this breakdown in the Arizona Supreme Court's holding he was prosecuted and given lengthy prison sentences for those other crimes. 
    We have raised no double jeopardy objection to those because that was a separate question. 
    That was a state law contract question.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="3161.246" stopTime="3185.444">
    Justice Stevens 
    Mr. Ford, can I ask you a question about the agreement because you are getting into the other crimes now which are one of the things that interests me. 
    In paragraph 8 of the agreement it says that he will be sentenced at the conclusion of his testimony in all of the cases referred to in this agreement and Exhibits A and B which accompany it. 
    Is it... do I correctly understand that his sentencing did not take place until all of the testimony the State wanted had been given?
speaker="timothy_k_ford" startTime="3185.444" stopTime="3229.057">
    Mr. Timothy K. Ford 
    There was one case left, Justice Stevens, and that involved this Ashford Plumbing case. 
    What happened was, just before they went down to sentencing Mr. Schafer and Mr. Adamson's lawyers got together and Mr. Schafer said, well, I want you to understand we may still call you for Ashford Plumbing. 
    Mr. Martin Feldhacker said, Mr. Adamson that and that's why the statement was made on the record that was, and of course that's the statement... that's what the Arizona Supreme Court found was the binding agreement, not the plea agreement. 
    They found there was ambiguity in the plea agreement clarified by this colloquy, but what they didn't know is that counsel had had an out of court discussion in which they said, 
    "We're talking about one case, Ashford Plumbing, and that's what we're agreeing to. "
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="3229.057" stopTime="3248.868">
    Justice Stevens 
    And also I want to be sure on this. 
    Paragraph 18 says, 
    "The defendant is to remain in the custody of the Pima County Sheriff from the date of the entry of his plea until the conclusion of his testimony in all of the cases in which the defendant agrees to testify as a result of this agreement. " 
    Now, when was he transferred from the custody of the Pima County Sheriff elsewhere?
speaker="timothy_k_ford" startTime="3248.868" stopTime="3249.887">
    Mr. Timothy K. Ford 
    The day after sentencing.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="3249.887" stopTime="3255.005">
    Justice Stevens 
    The day after sentencing, so it was also before that one bit of testimony, the last one you mentioned, had taken place?
speaker="timothy_k_ford" startTime="3255.005" stopTime="3259.325">
    Mr. Timothy K. Ford 
    The last one never has taken place. 
    It has never been prosecuted.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="3259.325" stopTime="3265.979">
    Justice Stevens 
    You did not contend, I take it, at any time that the transfer of custody violated the agreement?
speaker="timothy_k_ford" startTime="3265.979" stopTime="3268.662">
    Mr. Timothy K. Ford 
    No, it was the--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="3268.662" stopTime="3274.733">
    Justice Stevens 
    Your interpretation was the agreement had been fully performed at the time of the transfer; that's your reading?
speaker="timothy_k_ford" startTime="3274.733" stopTime="3306.837">
    Mr. Timothy K. Ford 
    --I wasn't there. 
    That was their understanding and that is our position now, that that was what the agreement meant. 
    The Arizona Supreme Court again, in construing this, they never said, 
    "Oh, no, this contract means he doesn't have to testify. " 
    or, 
    "He does have to testify for sentencing. " 
    This says, well, maybe there is an ambiguity created by paragraph 8, if you read their statement. 
    But then look at this colloquy, and they relied on the colloquy to establish this ongoing obligation. 
    Counsel knew and Mr. Adamson knew--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="3306.837" stopTime="3308.056">
    Justice Stevens 
    That that only pertained to the one case?
speaker="timothy_k_ford" startTime="3308.056" stopTime="3387.039">
    Mr. Timothy K. Ford 
    --It pertained to the one case and that's what Mr. Schafer said. 
    This is a case in which the double jeopardy clause was being asserted as a shield by a defendant who said, 
    "I have testified. " 
    "I have testified truthfully. " 
    "Many people have gone to prison. " 
    "I have endangered myself. " 
    "I have done what I was obligated to do, and then took perhaps an extreme position in trying to get something more in advance of the State's request for more. " 
    But the double jeopardy clause, I believe, must give him some assurance that, having done that, having fulfilled his obligations to the best of his knowledge and belief and to his counsel's knowledge and belief, and having been sentenced and sent to prison for this crime, that at some point there is an end. 
    The State cannot continue to demand from him more and more and more or at the least when they do, he has the right to object and to say, 
    "No, this is not my obligation. " 
    "This is my position and it's a different one from yours. " 
    without fear of losing everything and letting the State keep all the benefits of its bargain and all the people in prison that he's testified against and him and his admission of guilt and give him nothing and indeed in this case, take his life. 
    Thank you very much. 
   
   
   
   Rebuttal of William J. Schafer, III
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="3387.039" stopTime="3390.924">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Thank you very much, Mr. Ford. 
    Mr. Schafer, you have two minutes remaining.
speaker="william_j_schafer_iii" startTime="3390.924" stopTime="3443.576">
    Mr. William J. Schafer, III 
    The agreement was that Mr. Adamson would testify in four cases. 
    He testified in three. 
    Paragraph 8 of the plea agreement concerning the sentencing was gone over by Judge Birdsall at the plea taking of Mr. Adamson, and I don't think there is much question that the explanations of Mr. Adamson, the explanation to his attorneys, and nothing was said controverting that, was that this provision was in the agreement to get around the requirement of the State of Arizona that you must be sentenced within 30 days of the plea. 
    At page 24 of the Joint Appendix that you have before you, that is exactly what Judge Birdsall says. 
    It reads, paragraph 8 and it says, 
    "You have a right to be sentenced within 30 days. " 
    and that's what--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="3443.576" stopTime="3462.171">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    And this of course waives that. 
    It does say... one could read this agreement to indicate that the parties thought that at the time he was transferred from the Sheriff's custody to prison or wherever he was transferred that he would not get that transfer until he had fully performed his testimonial obligation? 
    It is certainly a permissible reading, isn't it?
speaker="william_j_schafer_iii" startTime="3462.171" stopTime="3490.290">
    Mr. William J. Schafer, III 
    --Your Honor, I hearken back then to the Arizona Supreme Court findings. 
    I believe there is no question in their opinion, and this was specifically argued at the oral argument before the Arizona Supreme Court, the paragraph 8. 
    They said, and I quote to you... this is from page 113... 
    "if item 8 specifically appears to limit the availability of the petitioner for additional testimony, the foregoing exchange. " 
    --and that was the exchange at the sentencing itself about he has to come back--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="3490.290" stopTime="3492.890">
    Justice Stevens 
    But what did they say about paragraph 18?
speaker="william_j_schafer_iii" startTime="3492.890" stopTime="3497.778">
    Mr. William J. Schafer, III 
    --They do not discuss paragraph 18.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="3497.778" stopTime="3506.467">
    Justice Stevens 
    Because it does say he is to remain in the Sheriff's custody until the conclusion of his testimony in all of the cases in which the defendant agrees to testify as a result of this agreement.
speaker="william_j_schafer_iii" startTime="3506.467" stopTime="3507.167">
    Mr. William J. Schafer, III 
    Yes.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="3507.167" stopTime="3513.437">
    Justice Stevens 
    So, does not that contemplate his transfer will not occur until he has performed his testimonial obligation?
speaker="william_j_schafer_iii" startTime="3513.437" stopTime="3539.921">
    Mr. William J. Schafer, III 
    Well, I think a reasonable reading of that provision is that simply when he is sentenced he is going to go into federal custody. 
    There was a reason for the federal custody. 
    No, and I don't think a reasonable reading of that would be that his obligation is totally finished. 
    It is much like the paragraph number 8, which says he will be sentenced at the completion of his testimony in these cases. 
    That is what the Arizona Supreme Court was referring to as I was going to quote on page 113.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="3539.921" stopTime="3542.907">
