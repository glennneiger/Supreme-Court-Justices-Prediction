    Mr. Gary M. Ford 
    Right. 
    The question here is whether in striking down the rebuttable presumption the Congress enacted for use in withdrawal liability arbitrations the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit in a divided panel decision committed error. 
    Now, when Congress enacted withdrawal liability in 1980 it knew that there are literally thousands of withdrawals from the thousands of multiemployer pension plans in the United States every year, and that it would be difficult if not impossible to set up a Federal bureaucracy to assess and collect these amounts, so it assigned to the trustees of the pension plans the practical task of formulating the initial claims for this liability. 
    Briefly, the trustees take the value of unfunded vested benefits in the plan, certified by the enrolled actuary of the plan, and divide it up using a statutory formula or a formula approved by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. 
    They then send out a bill after determining if any of the exemption or forgiveness provisions in the statute apply. 
    If the employer disputes the bill, the plan and the employer are required to try to resolve that dispute without litigation, but if they can't--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="172.295" stopTime="175.580">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    What is the bill supposed to represent, Mr. Ford?
speaker="gary_m_ford" startTime="175.580" stopTime="181.068">
    Mr. Gary M. Ford 
    --It represents an initial claim of the pension plan for liability for the employer's withdrawal.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="181.068" stopTime="184.769">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    And how is that measured?
speaker="gary_m_ford" startTime="184.769" stopTime="220.859">
    Mr. Gary M. Ford 
    The statute starts out with the amount of benefits that the plan is legally bound to pay but which are unfunded as of a date before the employer's withdrawal and then the statute has four detailed rules which the plan may choose among for dividing up that unfunded vested benefit amount based generally, Mr. Chief Justice, on the level of the employer's prior participation in the plan. 
    So the employer gets a share that is based generally upon what he contributed when he was a contributing employer under the pension plan.

    This Court in Thomas against Union Carbide held that where the procedures themselves are objected to is fundamentally unconstitutional, that ripeness is a prudential matter in essence, and here the Third Circuit having struck down a provision of law enacted by Congress, the appeal being mandatory to this Court, and there being considerable uncertainty among the courts and the arbitrators who are dealing with these disputes, we would suggest to the Court that it exercise its prudential judgment to decide this matter.

    Mr. Gary M. Ford 
    --That is how I understand the argument. 
    Yes, Justice O'Connor. 
    Now, once the trustees have sent the bill and they have failed to resolve it amicably if there is a dispute, they proceed to what we consider the first adjudication in this case, and that is arbitration. 
    It is mandatory under the statute, and it is worth noting how it works in practice. 
    It is a plenary proceeding. 
    There is full prehearing discovery. 
    There is the first occasion on which there is the calling and cross examination of witnesses, the first occasion on which a record is made. 
    It is before a neutral arbitrator chosen by the parties or appointed by a Federal District Judge. 
    And it is the first occasion in which a written decision is entered. 
    It is the first adjudication. 
    Congress chose arbitration as the forum for these disputes because it is inexpensive, quick, and therefore accessible, unusually accessible even to small employers that have a substantial disagreement with the claim of the pension plan. 
    Congress was not seeking to foreclose substantial challenges and it chose to enact rebuttable presumptions for use in the arbitration for three equally sound reasons. 
    In both the House and the Senate Congress noted that its judgment was that it would be unworkable and an invitation to abuse to assign the burden of proof in the arbitration to the pension plan. 
    Why? 
    Because the plan's calculation involves a large number of steps, and the plan would have to come forward and establish the reasonableness of every actuarial assumption, the accuracy of every underlying data, and inapplicability of every exemption provision set forth in the statute. 
    Congress was concerned that that would be an invitation to employers to lodge vague or nominal challenges or general challenges just to put the plan through the many days, perhaps even weeks of expensive testimony, documentary evidence, and the like that would be necessary to establish the reasonableness of the original claim. 
    Congress decided it would make more sense to have the claim serve essentially as a target at which the employer could take aim at those issues which we had a substantial disagreement, and I should note that in the arbitration proceeding there is no limitation on the issues the employer can raise, no limitation on the facts he may adduce. 
    It is a plenary proceeding where the employer comes forward with a substantial challenge.

    Mr. Gary M. Ford 
    Justice O'Connor, let me state at the outset my agreement that the language is at least curious. 
    It is ambiguous in our view and internally inconsistent, and not merely for the reason that you refer to, but also because the language, and this is at Page 65A of our jurisdictional statement, melds a trial type standard, preponderance of the evidence, which is generally understood to mean greater weight of the evidence or more probable than not, with words which appear in Rule 52, an appellate standard, clearly erroneous, which is generally understood again to this Court's decisions in Anderson against the City of Bessemer and so on, to mean that the Appellate Court has a firm and definite conviction that error has been committed. 
    Now, we consider, first of all, the melding of the trial type standard with the appellate standard to be an inconsistency in itself, and second, the preponderance standard, to show that something is more likely than not, is a somewhat lower standard in suggesting that the Appellate Court had a firm and definite conviction that error has been committed. 
    We suggest in view of the legislative history, also in view of the related provisions of the statute which this must be interpreted alongside, and in view of the possibility of avoiding a somewhat more difficult constitutional question, that the Court construe that language to require the employer to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the plan's determination was unreasonable or incorrect, in other words, that it not give the clearly erroneous language, the strict Rule 52 gloss.

    Mr. Gary M. Ford 
    Right. 
    That's correct. 
    In fact, we believe that this presumption goes to factual determinations only, and that the trustees' determinations of law or interpretations of law, which after all they are not necessarily expert on, reside where they have always resided, the authority for making those, in the Federal courts, and if one looks at the next provision, related provision in 66(A), which is Section 1401(c), that is the standard for the trial court's review of what the arbitrator did, and it provides that there shall be a presumption, rebuttable only by a clear preponderance of the evidence, that the findings of fact made by the arbitrator were correct. 
    Now, two important things there. 
    One, it makes clear what we are talking about are factual determinations, not legal determinations, and in fact the PBGC's regulations enjoin the arbitrator to apply all controlling precedent, the regulations, opinions, and so on in reaching its determination on issues of law.

    Mr. Gary M. Ford 
    --It suggests... I think that is correct. 
    It says the burden is a clear preponderance, which again is a less than clear choice of words on Congress's part. 
    This is a confused set of legislative drafting. 
    There is no way around it. 
    What makes sense about interpreting the preceding provision to require a more preponderance showing by the employer of error is that the District Court in 1401(c) is reviewing for whether something is correct or not and it would make no sense to have the District Court look for mere error if the arbitrator is applying a clearly erroneous standard, which is a much narrower scope of review. 
    Your scope of review on appeal would be expanding instead of decreasing, and that makes no sense to us. 
    Now, there were two other policy reasons that Congress had in mind when it enacted these presumptions besides the preventing abuse. 
    The second was, as it noted in the legislative history, on these exemption provisions which were made much of in the papers. 
    It is the employer that has the evidence. 
    The facts are in the employer's control. 
    This Court has noted in other decisions when you claim an exemption from the statutory provision it is traditional that you have the burden of proof and it makes a lot of practical sense if the employer has the evidence that is relevant to that exemption. 
    And finally, Congress wanted at least modestly to encourage uniform treatment of similarly situated employers. 
    These pension plans are amalgamations of a lot of different employers who may many of them be competitors, and the glue that holds them together is the sense that everyone in the plan is being treated the same, evenhandedly, and the presumption, while not guaranteeing that in every case, goes some distance in discouraging arbitrators from issuing inconsistent compromise awards that could undo the basic cohesion of the multiemployer pension plan.

    Mr. Gary M. Ford 
    The presumption in the arbitration that assigns the burden of proof to the employer discourages the arbitrator from essentially allowing an employer to slip a marginal case by and discourages employers from feeling they can succumb to that temptation. 
    If the employer is right on the law or the facts or the combination he ought to win, but the arbitrators ought not to do what Congress was concerned in some other areas they do, which is enter compromise awards just to get along and get to the next case. 
    They wanted them to act more like judges. 
    And so the preponderance of the evidence burden encourages them to do so.

    --Simply to accomplish the several important practical policy goals that I have enumerated, preventing abuse, making the party with the evidence come forward, encouraging uniformity, and second, looking at the same factors that courts look at when they order the burden and weight of evidence, order and weight of evidence in judicial proceedings at common law, who is changing the status quo? 
    In this case the employer is leaving the pension plan. 
    He has had an ongoing relationship with the plan. 
    It is the employer who is changing the status quo. 
    Where is it more convenient to have the burden? 
    Well, again, the facts. 
    There are at least partially in the possession of the employer. 
    Courts often say let's assign the burden of proof to the parties seeking to prove the less likely proposition. 
    Congress could very reasonably have concluded that the plan with its expertise, including an ongoing actuarial consultant, may be the more likely to prevail and assign the burden of proof on that basis.

 But when you get to the things covered by the first subsection, and purely factual questions, I just wonder how much sense it makes to give a biased decisionmaker a presumption of correctness for that kind of thing.

    Mr. Gary M. Ford 
    We would suggest that the Court read it to assign to the employer the burden of proof of showing by a preponderance of the evidence that a determination was unreasonable or erroneous or read the words "clearly erroneous" to be satisfied where he preponderance of the evidence establishes it, and I would--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1270.944" stopTime="1292.591">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    Now, that still gives me some problem. 
    It seems to me it is a fairly manageable standard, if you say the burden is on the employer to establish by the preponderance of the evidence that his view of the facts are correct. 
    But when you say it is the preponderance of the evidence to prove that the trustees' view is unreasonable, that just melds, as you say, questions of fact and questions of law.

    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    Okay, but then the... to say that the burden is on the employer to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the determination was clearly erroneous, I mean, that isn't the easiest thing when you start parsing it down. 
    Is that any different than saying the burden is on the employer to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the employer's view is correct?

    Mr. Gary M. Ford 
    --I think it is not. 
    What we are suggesting, in other words, is that the strict Rule 52 gloss on the words "clearly erroneous" not be adopted in this context because it simply in our view doesn't work. 
    For one thing, this is not an appellate proceeding. 
    It is the first trial. 
    Why have an appellate standard? 
    I would refer the Court to a case which we found after we filed our briefs but I notified opposing counsel of, and that is the Court's decision in United States against First City National Bank, 386 US 361, where the Court was faced with some other language about the word "clearly" and noted that it could fairly be construed to be consistent with the preponderance of the evidence burden, and there are a couple of other points in that case that are helpful here as well.

    Justice Scalia, I think that in reading this language and rationalizing it, one must either deemphasize preponderance of the evidence which would be inconsistent with the legislative history, with 1401(c) on the next page, and would present the Court with a more difficult question, or it must deemphasize the word 1401(c).

    Mr. Gary M. Ford 
    There was raised, prior to arbitration, claims by the company for treatment under certain exception provisions. 
    They did not press those claims in their arguments either to the District Court or to the Court of Appeals, and in our view the Court of Appeals should not have as a matter of prudence relied on those exception provisions in reaching its decision given that they weren't briefed to it, and we see no reason for this Court to reach the exception issue either.

    Mr. Gary M. Ford 
    Now, the conclusion that... the importance of the whole entire discussion of the operation of the presumption is that the Third Circuit concluded that it insulates the decision of the trustees made in formulating a claim, a civil claim from effective review by the arbitrator. 
    We respectfully submit it does nothing of the sort, and that that indispensable... that it merely allocates a burden of proof, and that that indispensable element in the Third Circuit's decision was in error, and that the decision was therefore in error. 
    We submit further that the Third Circuit erred when it concluded that the trustees prior to this arbitration, which proceeds very promptly, are functioning as adjudicators merely because they formulate a claim. 
    They don't decide a dispute between two parties. 
    They are one of the parties and they bring a claim, and that is all they do. 
    And finally, that they erred when they concluded that the same Congress that they believed appointed the trustees as adjudicators required them to be biased in the exercise of that function. 
    Congress, the simplest refutation of that argument is that Congress itself said in the legislative history it was requiring no such thing. 
    I would reserve the balance of my time for rebuttal.

    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, I would like first to address the question why is this case ripe, because it seems to me that should be addressed at the outset. 
    There are three answers in sequence. 
    The first is that this challenge is facial and systemic. 
    The second is that because it involves a standard of proof, Santosky v. Kramer, decided by this Court in 1982, applies, where this Court said, 
    "Respective case by case review cannot preserve fundamental fairness when a class of proceedings is governed by a constitutionally defective evidentiary standard. "

    Mr. Carl L. Taylor 
    What I read that as saying, Your Honor, is that the... how the statute works in one particular case cannot inform us when we are looking at a constitutionally defective evidentiary standard. 
    The rare case, the exceptional case, as the Santosky decision goes on to point out in a footnote, cannot decide the constitutionality of an evidentiary standard. 
    We must look at the statute, and we must look at the statute in a facial way, much as this Court has looked at this statute before in determining the substantive due process constitutionality of this statute in a facial context both in Gray and in Connelly. 
    We must look at it here in a facial way to determine the constitutionality of this presumption from a procedural due process point of view, and I might add that where the claim is lack of an an impartial decisionmaker, where that is the procedural due process violation, that is precisely what this Court has done in cases like Gibson versus Berryhill, where the Court upheld a Federal District Court enjoining the proceedings of the State Board of Optometry before those proceedings had concluded, before any decision was rendered on the ground that the members of that board were inherently biased because they were competitors and had a pecuniary interest and therefore the proceedings shouldn't even start.

    Mr. Carl L. Taylor 
    I don't recall that that was the case, Your honor. 
    I think the proceeding was to determine whether the optometrists who were on trial, as it were, should be disbarred, if you want to use that phrase, for being employees of a corporation practicing optometry. 
    I think that was the context in which that arose. 
    And they sued in District Court to enjoin the proceedings. 
    Now, in a facial challenge you must look at the language of the entire statute, we suggest, which gets to the next preliminary question of can we look at exceptions; can we look at decisions, at determinations made by trustees that may not specifically apply to this employer? 
    And the answer is, if this is a facial challenge, of course we can, just as in Gray and--

    Mr. Carl L. Taylor 
    --Our client did in fact raise a contest under 1405 of the statute, 29 US Code 1405, as to whether as a liquidating employer it was entitled to a reduction. 
    It also raised the point that its net liquidation value would be essentially zero so that it was entitled also to a reduction under 29 US Code Section 1405(b). 
    The PBGC points out that those were not pressed in District Court. 
    The PBGC's brief, its reply brief concedes that particular exceptions don't need to be pressed even in review, even in requesting plan review in order to be raised in arbitration. 
    The PBGC says expressly, clearly, succinctly in its reply brief that you can... that an employer can raise in arbitration things that it has not previously raised, so that to return to where I was, I do suggest to this Court that in determining how this presumption works, the Court needs to look at the provisions of the statute to which it applies, and the kinds of decisions, the kinds of determinations that the trustees must make, and it needs to look at those also to see why the trustees have a conflict of interest and how that conflict of interest translates through into the presumption. 
    Now, this case essentially involves the constitutionality of ex parte adjudicative determinations made by the trustees with a conflicting legal, financial, and personal interest, without a de novo review of any sort. 
    Now the thing that blocks that de novo review is this presumption.

    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    Are those disputed here?
speaker="carl_l_taylor" startTime="2008.289" stopTime="2064.458">
    Mr. Carl L. Taylor 
    Yes, they are. 
    Among the disputes in terms of what this employer specifically raised below are whether it is a liquidating employer and what its not liquidation value is and whether, as the plan replied, it is not entitled to those because there are other employers in the control group who are... who have assets. 
    Now, to go beyond that and look at the kinds of things that the plan has the authority to determine in determining whether liability should be assessed, there are questions of whether the employer has withdrawn, when it has withdrawn. 
    As was pointed out earlier in this argument, those are historic facts.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2064.458" stopTime="2069.760">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    Are either of those disputed here, when and whether there has been withdrawal?
speaker="carl_l_taylor" startTime="2069.760" stopTime="2167.943">
    Mr. Carl L. Taylor 
    Not that I am aware of, Your Honor. 
    The date is not a critical date... is not a critical question here, and the whether as I understand it is not an issue either. 
    It is the how and whether some of these, these ameliorating provisions apply. 
    Now, if I might take one of the ameliorating provisions as an example, the plan says or the PBGC says that these are really just exceptions, and therefore the employer should have the burden on them because people that are trying to take advantage of an exception usually have the burden on that anyway. 
    One of the provisions of the statute, 29 US Code Section 1398, says that notwithstanding any other provision of this part, an employer shall not be considered to have withdrawn because he is in a labor dispute. 
    Now, that language, it seems to me, clearly enjoins the plan from assessing if there is a labor dispute, and therefore that the plan has to bear the burden of showing that there is no labor dispute. 
    Now, another provision, 29 US Code Section 1398.1, enjoins the plan from making an assessment because of a change in corporate form such as where a parent company sells the stock of a subsidiary and the subsidiary continues for a while and then fails. 
    The plan says that is all very fine but we allege alter ego. 
    We allege that you really continued to control that company after you sold the stock of it. 
    That's the sort of an allegation--

    --The only difference, Your Honor, would be that the plan must prove that the assumptions are reasonable in the aggregate rather than the employer having to prove that they are unreasonable in the aggregate because 29 US Code Section 1393 independently says that the assumptions must be reasonable in the aggregate. 
    We are not contending that there is a right or wrong answer when it comes to actuarial assumptions, and that suggestion on the part of the plan, on the part of the PBGC is erroneous. 
    Now, when we get to the second kind of question that the plan has to determine ex parte it is the amount of the liability, and among the key ingredients there are things like what is the interest rate going to be for return on investments in the future. 
    Now, these are arbitrable assumptions. 
    These are arbitrable matters and not legislative matters and not policy matters because Congress has made them arbitrable under the statute. 
    That is the short and simple answer. 
    It is clear under 1401 that these matters go to arbitration. 
    That is why we have a presumption on it.

    Mr. Carl L. Taylor 
    If the Court would turn to Page 9A of the appellee's brief, we have set forth in the appendix the actual assessment made by this plan to this employer. 
    Page 9A under Subparagraph 7A, the Court will see that current assets are valued at market value. 
    If the Court will then look at Subparagraph (C)(1) the Court will see that the interest assumption for the future is 6 percent. 
    Now, to the extent, for example, that the present assets are held in let's say 30-year government bonds at 14 percent, bought back in 1982 with good foresight, those bonds are already... their current market value takes into account that 14 percent, and we suggest it is nonsense to assume that the future income stream on those is going to be 6 percent, but that is precisely what this plan is doing when it says that the blanket assumption on the return on all investments is 6 percent, which is the lowest you could possibly get and still stay within the range of reason.

    Mr. Carl L. Taylor 
    Now, there is an issue in the brief as to... by the way, before I leave that, we do concede, we agree with the PGBC that the allocation method, the presumptive or one of the other three or four methods for determining how the unfunded vested liability is going to be allocated is not an arbitrable matter. 
    Congress has not provided for that to go to arbitration.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2567.167" stopTime="2568.469">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    That doesn't go to arbitration at all?
speaker="carl_l_taylor" startTime="2568.469" stopTime="2733.843">
    Mr. Carl L. Taylor 
    That doesn't go to arbitration at all. 
    That simply determines what formula they are going to use to divide up whatever liability they come up with, and that does not go to arbitration. 
    Now, I would like to turn to why the trustees have a conflict of interest. 
    First of all, they have an adverse legal duty. 
    The plan, the plan involved in this case concedes that the trustees are biased. 
    It says at Page 30 of its main brief that 
    "The bias of the trustees is permissible because the trustees are obligated by Congress to be biased in favor of pension plans. " 
    Now, that may be... that may be all to the good, but the plan concedes that they are biased, but the plan goes on to say at the same page, Page 30 of their main brief, 
    "By its very nature an assessment of withdrawal liability is intended to benefit the interests of the plan over those of a withdrawing employer. " 
    What that amounts to is nothing more than this Court has said in Amax Coal, which is that the trustees owe an exclusive duty to the beneficiaries, which excludes any consideration of anyone else, including employers. 
    Now, the trustees also have a duty to ensure full funding, and while it is quite true, as the PBGC points out, that they may not get sued in any individual withdrawal liability case for having failed to collect the maximum, if they don't perform their duty over a period of time to ensure full funding they have got a risk, and they have got a risk of personal fiduciary liability. 
    That is what they are there for, is to protect the beneficiaries by ensuring full funding. 
    And in that sense this case is just like Ward versus Monroeville, were the mayor had executive responsibility for the finances of a town. 
    These trustees have executive responsibility for the finances of the plan. 
    Now, second, the employer trustees have an adverse financial interest, and the PBGC concedes that. 
    The PBGC at Page... at... I am sorry, it is not in its brief, it is in a Federal regulation which is cited in our brief at Page 14, it is 50 Federal Register 34680, PBGC says, 
    "Interests of employers that will withdraw in the future are materially different from those of employers who will not withdraw. " 
    Now, it is not hard to see why. 
    The more that the staying employers can assess from the leaving employers, the less the staying employers are going to have to pay of that liability. 
    There is 100 percent of the liability. 
    If they can collect a greater percentage of it from the leavers then they will have less to pay in the future.

 Now, I can understand your argument under (a)(3)(A) if there is some fact issue being decided by a biased decisionmaker, but I frankly don't understand it under B as to the actuarial assumptions.

    Mr. Carl L. Taylor 
    Your Honor, I will agree with the Court's suggestion that the harm under B is less than the harm under A. 
    That certainly is a permissible view of it. 
    But the harm is still there. 
    And the harm is that... the harm is less because of this range of reasonableness which certainly is reasonable for Congress to have imposed.

    Your Honor, I think that analysis applies. 
    The answer is, yes, I would still be complaining, and I think the reason is that that analysis applies only if you can say that we are trying to get the benefits of this statute and therefore must take its burdens as well, as in, for example, Arnette v. Kennedy, involving Civil Service dismissal. 
    We would be happy not to have the statute at all. 
    We are not trying to claim the benefits of it, and we would not be trying to claim the benefits of it even if we had joined it after the effective date, which we did not. 
    We were predecessor... we were... this employer was part of this plan before this statute was enacted, and renewed its contract, by the way, in December of 1980, but that makes no difference because it couldn't have withdrawn without getting the liability.

    --This Court's opinions, Overmeyer v. Freckam and others, say that a waiver of procedural due process rights must be clear and unmistakable. 
    It must appear on the face of the contract. 
    It must not be a contract of adhesion. 
    The Court said that in Fuentes v. Chevon. 
    If this is consent at all, if this is waiver at all, it is a waiver of adhesion.

    Mr. Carl L. Taylor 
    Exactly. 
    This is not a clear... there is no clear and unmistakable waiver that you can apply to all employers who first enter a plan after the statute was passed, I suggest, unless they say that more explicitly than simply signing a union contract that calls for contributions to a pension plan. 
    Again, this is not like Arnette v. Kennedy, which describes a very narrow exception, that you waive your procedural due process rights to have your liability fairly determined and impartially determined when you take the benefit of a government job. 
    This is not like that at all. 
    There is no benefit to the employer in this statute.

    Mr. Carl L. Taylor 
    Yes, and also the contract of adhesion is important in Fuentes and in Overmeyer v. Shick. 
    Just briefly, the Union has an adverse... the Union trustees have an adverse personal interest because they have very often been embroiled in the underlying controversy that has led to the withdrawal, such as a strike or a decertification of the Union by the employees. 
    And therefore they are like the judge in Aetna v. Lavoie decided here last year. 
    Now, under those circumstances there is no need for a special showing of bias. 
    As Aetna said, you don't need to decide whether in fact someone is biased; whether in fact there is a conflict of interest, but only whether there is a possible temptation by the average person. 
    Withrow v. Larkin said that bias or conflict of interest is systemic where experience teaches that probability is too high. 
    Now, let me suggest that labels do not save this presumption. 
    The critical defect in this presumption is ex parte determination by a person who is not impartial without any de novo review. 
    An ex parte bias is not a substitute for evidence, no matter what sort of a presumption label you put on it. 
    If you say that it simply establishes a prima facie case, it is still a biased or conflict of evidence prima facie case. 
    If you simply say it shifts the burden of persuasion, it shifts it because of bias or conflict of interest, and that is not permissible either.

    --Well, Your Honor, the IRS is one agency. 
    The distinction that this Court made in Marshall v. Jericho was that even though the money was going to the agency, it was not going in any particular proportion to results. 
    Here the money isn't even going to the agency. 
    In Marshall v. Jericho the Court found that distinction to be important.

    --where Fact A can be presumed from Fact B. 
    Here Congress has determined nothing in particular. 
    Congress has not exercised a legislative policy judgment at all that any particular fact flows from any particular other fact. 
    It is whatever the trustees of this plan decide to determine, that is presumed correct. 
    That is all that Congress has said here. 
    Congress has not looked at any particular fact situation. 
    Now, to get back to the tax question, the final distinction there is that the IRS regs provide for an impartial internal appeal to the Office of Appeals which is managed completely separate from the field agents. 
    They are an entirely different chain of command, and by regulation says it must be impartial.

    In order to finish going through a couple more points I would like to say that since they have it and since that reg itself points out, I think maybe the best answer is the reg itself. 
    I am looking at 26 CFR, Section 601.106, Rule 1, which says, 
    "An exaction by the United States Government which is not based on law, statutory or otherwise, is a taking of property without due process of law in violation of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution. " 
    "Accordingly you must be scrupulously careful to be impartial. " 
    I think the IRS regs suggest that it would otherwise be unconstitutional.

   Rebuttal of Gary M. Ford

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Mr. Ford, you have four minutes remaining.
speaker="gary_m_ford" startTime="3354.562" stopTime="3580.992">
    Mr. Gary M. Ford 
    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 
    Let me note at the outset an important concession that counsel made, and that is that one of the three fundamental bases of the Third Circuit's decision, that is, that the allocation method selection by the trustees was an adjudicative decision, was incorrect, and the appellees agree with the PBGC that it is not an adjudicative decision. 
    Also, the appellees have largely conceded the actuarial matter. 
    They have noted that the standard, the substantive standard enacted by Congress was reasonable. 
    They have noted further that in answer to a question that there may be a case by case determination of the actuarial interest rate. 
    We respectfully disagree. 
    This case does not present those facts. 
    We are aware of no plan in which the actuarial work has been anything other than planwide and applied evenhandedly to all withdrawn employers. 
    And the statute itself says that they may use the same assumptions for withdrawn employers as they use for ongoing employers, and the Controller General's report states that about two-thirds of them do just that. 
    Now, as to the application of exemption provisions in formulating the initial claim of the plan we would respectfully suggest that this case involves much more limited discretion on the part of the trustees than, for example, the administrator in Marshall against Jericho, who applied broad standards in formulating, determining whether there had been a violation of the child labor laws in formulating claims under the child labor laws. 
    There are detailed provisions set forth in what the Court has called before this comprehensive and reticulated statute, and the suggestion that in merely formulating a civil claim, not deciding one, but formulating one, that they are transformed into judges or like judges, would surprise both the trustees and most of the parties to these plans as well as the agency. 
    Now, finally, as to bias, there is no full funding requirement for these plans. 
    There is a mechanical rule set forth in Section 412 of the Internal Revenue Code, and if they meet that mechanical rule or if they obtain a waiver from the rule from the IRS, they have satisfied the basic funding requirements for a pension plan. 
    So standing alone, full funding is not a requirement for a fiduciary under one of these plans and therefore there is not... that may explain why in all the life of the statute there has not been a single suit brought challenging the decisions of the trustees and formulating these withdrawal liability claims. 
    The notion that they are somehow exposed to suit as fiduciaries for funding or other reasons in formulating a withdrawal liability claim is something that occurs entirely in the realm of theory. 
    Now, they have no pecuniary or personal interest of the sort this Court has found offensive in the past. 
    They receive salaries if they are paid at all that are not contingent upon their performance in collecting withdrawal liability claims. 
    Withdrawal liability is typically a very small percentage of the revenues of the plan. 
    They have an interest and bias, if you will, in carrying out faithfully the provisions of law that Congress has assigned them to carry out. 
    No different from the school board in the Hortonville School District case, and no different from the optometric board in Freeman against Rogers, where this Court has upheld the choice of the state legislatures in assigning that task to people who believe in that law and will faithfully carry it out. 
    And the suggestion that they bring to their job as trustees, as fiduciaries, personal interests as employers or as unions is unsubstantiated on this record, and reads into oblivion this Court's decision in the Amax Coal Case, which in fact trustees generally truly endeavor to follow.
