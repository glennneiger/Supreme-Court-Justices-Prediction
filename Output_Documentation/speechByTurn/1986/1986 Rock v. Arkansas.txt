Rock v. Arkansas

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    We'll hear argument now in Number 86-130, Vickie Lorene Rock v. Arkansas. 
    Mr. Luffman, you may proceed whenever you're ready.
speaker="james_m_luffman" startTime="12.058" stopTime="214.371">
    Mr. James M. Luffman 
    Thank you Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Frank Rock died on July 2nd, 1983. 
    Vickie Rock maintains that his death was caused by the accidental discharge of a Saturday night special pistol which fired when her husband grabbed her hand. 
    He was attempting to prevent her from leaving the house to get a hamburger. 
    The pistol was in her hand, she maintains, because her husband had become suddenly violent striking her and slamming her into a wall. 
    She thought it would keep him from hitting her again. 
    Vickie Rock went through the trauma of a fruitless wait for the ambulance she called and watching for the police while they began their investigation while her husband lay dying on the floor. 
    She was taken to jail before the ambulance arrived to pick up her unconscious husband and she learned of his death in a jail cell. 
    The evidence is that only Frank Rock and Vickie Rock were in the room when the gun discharged. 
    Frank Rock made no statement to the police before his death. 
    Almost a year later on June 25th, 1984, Vickie Rock was arraigned on a charge of manslaughter in the death of her husband. 
    Three months after her arraignment, Vickie Rock was still unable to recall some of the detail of the events that occurred between the time her husband slammed her against the wall and the time she went to the telephone to call for the ambulance, a matter of seconds. 
    Such amnesia is apparently not unusual for persons involved in violent confrontations but in her case it was not complete. 
    She remembered a great deal of detail from both before the gun discharged and after. 
    The record does not reflect what other methods were used by her lawyer to attempt to refresh her recollection of those violent moments. 
    But he finally employed a professional psychologist for the purpose of trying to refresh her memory with the use of hypnosis. 
    After two sessions with the psychologist she was able to recall much of what she knew but had forgotten. 
    The most important thing she was able to remember was that she never pulled the trigger. 
    That in fact, her finger was outside the trigger guard when the pistol discharged. 
    This revelation enabled her lawyer to employ an expert gunsmith, who after extensive testing of the weapon was able to testify that the pistol not only could but was quite likely to discharge in the manner related by petitioner, something that had previously been thought to be impossible. 
    As the case stood at this point a clear and probably close jury question was presented. 
    Did the gun discharge by accident in defect in design, or was it fired by petitioner in the course of a scuffle? 
    Believing Vickie Rock's testimony the jury could have acquitted her. 
    Disbelieving her they had almost no alternative but to convict. 
    The jury though never had the opportunity to make that choice. 
    Vickie Rock's testimony about what happened in those few seconds was suppressed by a pre-trial order which limited her testimony about those events to what she had told her psychologist prior to the first hypnotic session. 
    That order, more than any other ruling, took the decision away from the jury. 
    The jury was left with the mere sign--

    Yes, sir. 
    That's correct. 
    The jury then was left with the mere scientific probability that the gun could have discharged by accident but under the limiting ruling with no claim by the petitioner that in fact it did. 
    Clearly this ruling tipped the scale on the weight of the evidence in favor of the state. 
    What then was the basis for that ruling that insured petitioner's convictions? 
    A ruling in the face of the state constitutional right for a defendant to testify. 
    No record exists of the hearing on which the order was based. 
    An omission that seems to escape notice prior to these proceedings, leaving what is stated in the order itself as the only basis for the ruling. 
    That the testimonies of matters recalled by petitioner due to hypnosis would be excluded because of 
    "inherent unreliability and the effect of hypnosis in eliminating any meaningful cross examination. "

    Mr. James M. Luffman 
    --I do agree that the state has the right to make that decision of what is reliable and what is not so long as it does not interfere with the person's constitutional right to fairly present his defense. 
    And I think there would be a great argument of difference between the hypothetical that you posed just basically on the fact that in our case, Vickie Rock, was there. 
    She was physically present. 
    She was in the room. 
    She undoubtedly saw and felt what happened and I think it's certainly arguable that the medium was not there in any realistic sense.

    Dr. Back's testimony was that she customarily made an audio recording of such sessions. 
    There are a number of cases involving hypnosis and a number of articles involving hypnosis where the strong suggestion is made for the use of video tape. 
    But it was not used in this case.

    Mr. James M. Luffman 
    Yes, Mr. Justice Blackmun, we do. 
    We've cited one such case in our brief. 
    Clines v State. 
    The same prosecuting attorney that was involved in this case took two eye witnesses to a murder in a capital murder case and had those two eyewitnesses hypnotized. 
    That hypnosis was not disclosed during the course of the trial. 
    It was only after conviction and the men were awarded the death penalty that a disclosure was made that two of the eyewitnesses had been hypnotized. 
    Counsel for those gentlemen filed a motion with the Arkansas Supreme Court asking for a remand of that case. 
    That the case be remanded to the circuit court for an evidentiary hearing on that matter. 
    That motion was dismissed by the Arkansas Supreme Court without opinion. 
    The case when it was decided, and that was Clines v. State, made no mention of the issue.

    But, his step by step ruling are the only indicators of what apparently the trial judge thought might have been the product of hypnosis and what was not. 
    But there were three qualifications that the trial judge put on her testimony. 
    Number one, that she could not testify to matters which were the product of hypnosis; or secondly, matters which had not been stated to the psychologist, or the hypnotist prior to the hypnosis; and thirdly, matters which were the product of post-hypnotic suggestion. 
    In the rulings of the trial court when he disallowed various pieces of testimony there was no attempt made by the trial court to justify under which provision of that order he was excluding the evidence.

    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    Well the Supreme Court of Arkansas on the first page of its opinion, Appendix A in your petition for certiorari, says that the trial court ruled testimony of matters recalled by appellant due to hypnosis inadmissible because of its unreliability and because of the effect of hypnosis on cross, appellant was allowed to testify about things she remembered prior to being subjected to hypnosis though testimony resulting from post hypnotic suggestion was excluded. 
    We believe the trial court's ruling was correct. 
    Certainly the Supreme Court of Arkansas thought that the trial court had ruled that testimony not affected by the hypnotic suggestion could come in. 
    Testimony that was induced by the hypnotic suggestion would be kept out.

    Mr. James M. Luffman 
    --There are degrees, of course, of unreliability. 
    But I think if once it's classified as unreliable, I think that was true in the Chambers case, hearsay evidence was kept out because it was thought to be, because hearsay is generally thought to be unreliable. 
    Yet, the categorization of all of the combination of rulings by the trial court were held to have been applied in such a way that even though the individual evidentiary rules themselves may have been constitutional that the cumulative effect of them when they prevented the defendant from presenting his defense was to deny him due process of law and that's what we're arguing for Mrs. Rock.

    Mr. James M. Luffman 
    That's correct, sir. 
    We would submit that it is very difficult to distinguish this problem from the problem of a witness who refreshes his recollection by referring to notes or a written document and then adopts the version of those facts for his testimony. 
    He may become difficult to cross examine, but it has never been suggested that a witness who so refreshes his recollection not be allowed to testify.

    Well the difference there is when somebody refreshes his recollection that way, in such a manner that he's lying, I mean he knows that he didn't remember it before, the jury can observe his demeanor. 
    I gather that the really nefarious thing about hypnotically induced recollection is that the witness himself doesn't know that the recollection is inaccurate. 
    He doesn't know he's lying because the hypnosis could of had that effect. 
    So the jury cannot say, you know, I can tell by his demeanor that this fellow is lying.

    Mr. James M. Luffman 
    I don't think so, Mr. Justice Scalia, because the cross examination and demeanor of the witness is not the only way to impeach his testimony. 
    There are many other ways to do it and any skilled trial attorney, I would submit, could cross examine such a witness by establishing a great amount of detail, some of which is undoubtedly going to be provably false. 
    There are just any number of ways for a competent trial attorney to discredit witnesses. 
    And the argument that this leaves defendant not subject to cross examination suggests, in effect, that there is no other way to get at the truthfulness of the witness's testimony and we submit that there are.

   Argument of J. Steven Clark
speaker="j_steven_clark" startTime="1582.471" stopTime="1634.337">
    Mr. J. Steven Clark 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I submit to this court that the issue clearly here presented to you today is whether this hypnotically refreshed testimony is so inherently unreliable that the state of Arkansas may, consistent with the United States Constitution, exclude that testimony when it's offered by the defendant in a criminal case. 
    The answer to that question, I submit to this Court is yes, and further that the state of Arkansas can properly fashion its own rules of evidence if they do not violate fundamental constitutional safeguards. 
    And the Arkansas rule does not. 
    Although hypnosis has been accepted clearly as an aid in therapy, it's validity as a means of enhancing or refreshing memory has been challenged repeatedly. 
    Hypnosis creates within the subject a hyper state of suggestibility, lowered critical reasoning, the potential for altered memory,--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1634.337" stopTime="1642.442">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    Well now, why should we take your word for all of this, General Clark? 
    I mean, you don't have any degrees on the subject, I take it, and we don't either.
speaker="j_steven_clark" startTime="1642.442" stopTime="1677.949">
    Mr. J. Steven Clark 
    --No, Your Honor, I do not. 
    The Arkansas Supreme Court in reviewing this testimony had it applied the Frye test for instance, in terms of generally accepted by the scientific community as a procedure that is advanced as being legitimate. 
    Said if you'd applied the Frye test under the testimony submitted with the experts of Orrin and Diamond and others would not have admitted this testimony because it was not generally accepted by a scientific community as being reliable and credible. 
    And so I submit to you in this instance that the court, though not applying that rule is my contention to this court, said it could have or even a lesser standard and still would have excluded this testimony because of its inherent unreliability.

    Mr. J. Steven Clark 
    Your Honor, the prosecutor, in fact in the Cline case did attempt to hypnotize two witnesses. 
    One which was unable to be hypnotized. 
    The other which was hypnotized did not recall anything under hypnosis other than what they had recalled prior to that. 
    The Arkansas Supreme Court however, has never ruled on this issue until this case. 
    As a matter of footnote since this was raised by petitioner I went back to check. 
    In that Cline case, counsel, an associate of Mr. Putman, defense counsel in this instance until he died, participated in that case and if the petitioner had thought that that was an improper application could have raised that issue at trial and did not or with the Arkansas Supreme Court. 
    And I would submit to this Court that that's procedurally barred in the sense that they bring it to this Court now.

    Mr. J. Steven Clark 
    Your Honor, there were two hypnotic trances in this. 
    In the first trance, the Psycho Psychologist, Ms. Back, Dr. Back, never mentioned the question of whether the gun had been cocked. 
    In our Joint Appendix on page 95 in a second hypnotic trance she indicated that she asked these series of questions. 
    Five, I believe, to be specific about the gun itself and did Ms. Rock recall any of these instances. 
    One of the answers is that Ms. Rock recalled putting her thumb on the hammer to cock the weapon. 
    This was a double action weapon. 
    You had to cock it and then pull the trigger to make it fire. 
    There was a great deal of, on cross examination the prosecutor tried to make a big issue of the fact that were these leading questions getting Ms. Rock to remember a combination of fact and fiction. 
    The phenomenon called confabulation to resolve herself from responsibility in this instance. 
    Now we submit to the Court that that in fact occurred. 
    Although that testimony was never given at the trial, it was proffered, but she never was allowed to testify.

    Basically I think, Your Honor, because the Arkansas Supreme Court has found that when you rely upon hypnosis that a judicial proceeding ceases to be a judicial proceeding because you're calling on the trier of fact, in this instance, the jury to reach its judgment not based on logical inference from the facts and the evidence deduced, but to reach its judgment simply on guess work. 
    As Justice Scalia questioned a moment ago, we cannot have a, by constitutional bar, the judge comment on the weight of the evidence.

    Mr. J. Steven Clark 
    Yes, Your Honor, in the instance that the phenomenon called confabulation, mixing fact and fiction. 
    I submit to this Court that what Mrs. Rock did in terms of confabulation through the two hypnotic trances was to find a way to escape two types of prison. 
    The actual prison which she now is facing and secondly that prison in terms of her own moral guilt with having been involved in the shooting of her husband. 
    She was trying because of hyper suggestibility to find acceptance to relieve herself of that moral doubt and guilt and to say, and respond in a positive manner to the questions imposed by the hypnotist.

    Mr. J. Steven Clark 
    Your Honor, I only know this in the instance that, of course I've read the proffered testimony, but in the instance of the scientific comments on expert, or hypnosis and its effect on an individual is that the weight of scientific authority and the reason that the scientific community has rejected this as a generally accepted standard is that it is unreliable because you lower critical judgment. 
    People then accept; they don't question. 
    You put them in a state of hyper acceptance so that they want to find an answer with a combination of fact and fiction to fantasize even as much to get to the desired answer and that in terms of a judicial proceeding that we have no way, we, being any attorney, whether it's a criminal action or a civil action, of going to the core of the credibility of that witness because the witness coming out of the hypnosis and the post hypnotic state believes absolutely to a moral certainty it's right.

    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    Well, do these experts say that every single witness coming out of a hypnotic state is this way?

    Mr. J. Steven Clark 
    Your Honor, I think the experts tend to believe that what is remembered post hypnotic, that person believes to a moral certainty that that is accuracy. 
    That is, whether it is a combination of fact or fiction is not the issue and that it could not be rebutted by traditional means. 
    If you said to a witness, did you have a meeting on Friday the 18th and the witness said: no. 
    You say, well I show you your diary. 
    It says Friday the 18th, scheduled meeting with. 
    You say well at the result of hypnosis and the confabulation, you say, I'm sorry it was the 19th. 
    Well, I show you a letter saying the meeting was scheduled for the 18th? 
    Was in fact the meeting on the 18th? 
    No it was on the 19th. 
    The letter may have said it was on the 18th, the diary may say it was supposed to be on the 18th, but it wasn't, it was on the 19th. 
    Completely unshakable testimony and that is inherently unreliable.

    Mr. J. Steven Clark 
    I think the rule has been applied by the Arkansas court is one that is applied so that juries can reach verdicts on the basis of logical inference and not guess work. 
    Hypnotically refreshed testimony is not akin to those other methods of refreshing memory. 
    For such hypnotically enhanced or refreshed recollection does blight cross examination I say to this court. 
    It does so by producing in that witness that absolute, firm belief to a moral certainty that everything they have recollected is absolutely fact. 
    Whether it is fact or fiction, or some fact, some fiction, or a fantasized result of a combination of all that. 
    And that literally what that produces is a situation where the trier of fact in any proceeding cannot use the objective indicia or manifestation of the credibility of a witness; that they would really have to try to guess what's in that witness's mind and whether that witness in fact knows what's in that witness's mind. 
    And that is not the underpinnings of what I submit to this Court is the truth finding function in a jury system or in any judicial process. 
    Due process of the law does not give any witness a license to lie or to throw any and everything into a judicial proceeding.

    And that the Arkansas rule that excludes that, 403, on the probative value versus the potential for confusion, misleading, is one that's a weighing test that can be fairly applied and it's a rule that Arkansas can articulate and one that is within the residual power of the state to set in terms of its rules of evidence is applied.

    Mr. J. Steven Clark 
    The problem is, Your Honor, she doesn't really know. 
    And in the instance of what actually happened here, if the court made error and I submit they did not, but if they did I believe it was harmless error in the instance that Mrs. Rock, if you look at the Joint Appendix at pages 105 and 107, the trial judge who's a veteran trial judge for some twenty years faced with a complicated issue, did everything possible to give her latitude to give live testimony her own. 
    He didn't rely on other witnesses. 
    He allowed Mrs. Rock to testify. 
    She said in response to questions from her counsel which were these: 
    "Did you intend to kill your husband? " 
    "No, I loved him, I would not shoot him. " 
    "Did you ever point the gun at him? " 
    "No". 
    There was ample evidence in the record that it was an accident.

    In the first hypnotic trance, Your Honor, she was asked what she saw. 
    She never remembered a specific at all about the gun or her position of her hand on the gun. 
    In the second trance, Your Honor, after five questions from the hypnotist. 
    Five questions about the gun, the location of her hand on the gun, was her thumb on the trigger?

    Mr. J. Steven Clark 
    Yes, Your Honor, that's correct, too. 
    In the instant case, I submit to this Court, the petitioner was not denied any due process by the exclusion of this hypnotically enhanced testimony. 
    Since this veteran trial judge, as I stated, did show great deference and latitude to Mrs. Rock, in allowing her to participate in her own defense through her live testimony, this case is simply one where the Arkansas court has properly applied a rule to fundamentally insure in Arkansas and protect that truth finding function of the jury and thereby enable the jury to make decisions rationally and not based on guess work and that rule, I submit does not offend any section or provision of the Constitution, or any of those protected safeguards afforded a criminal defendant. 
    And for that reason, the Arkansas rule and the Arkansas decision should be affirmed.

    Mr. James M. Luffman 
    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 
    I'm not at all enough familiar with the process to say unequivocally what hypnosis is in the sense that I can testify to it from personal experience, but I know that from the point of view of looking at it from the legal process that I see little difference in that process and the process of a lawyer going over and over and over a story with the witness, which any good lawyer does, in preparation for trial so he'll be able to withstand cross examination. 
    I'm not even sure that I can see the difference if the witness listened to his own story on tape at night while he's asleep. 
    The ultimate issue, I think, here is that jury question issue and that is whether this case is going to stand as the first case in recent legal history where a defendant in a criminal case who was an eyewitness to the alleged crime was not allowed to tell the jury what happened according to her own present waking memory.

    Mr. Luffman, that's not unthinkable. 
    Let me quote you from Nix v. Whiteside where we said that until the latter part of the preceding century criminal defendants in this country as at common law, were considered to be disqualified from giving sworn testimony at their own trial, by reason of their interest as a party to the case. 
    So until the 1900s your client wouldn't have been able to testify at all in many states. 
    And that was not considered to violate the Constitution. 
    Now, this is a close question here. 
    Even if we hold that you now have to let defendants as a matter of constitutional law, although you didn't in the 1800s, even though you have to let them testify, how can we go so far as to say that this close call must go in one way rather than another given the history of testimony by defendants?

 Mr. Luffman, that's not unthinkable. 
 Let me quote you from Nix v. Whiteside where we said that until the latter part of the preceding century criminal defendants in this country as at common law, were considered to be disqualified from giving sworn testimony at their own trial, by reason of their interest as a party to the case. 
 So until the 1900s your client wouldn't have been able to testify at all in many states. 
 And that was not considered to violate the Constitution.

    Mr. James M. Luffman 
    I think the answer is a combination of two cases, first Nix v. Whiteside as I understand it says that certainly the right to testify is now a Fourteenth Amendment right.

    It's assumed to be. 
    And I would apply to that, you know, to that question the Chambers reasoning that where the state evidentiary rules or, even though there may be good reason for them, when they are applied in such a way so that a criminal defendant does not have that fundamental right of fairness to tell his story to the jury then due process is violated. 
    Because two things, number one, the inherent value on allowing an individual accused of a crime to tell his story and number two, the traditional function as between the judge and the jury. 
    And that determination of reliability and inherent worth of the testimony is historically and traditionally the function of the jury and I think properly so. 
    Thank you.
