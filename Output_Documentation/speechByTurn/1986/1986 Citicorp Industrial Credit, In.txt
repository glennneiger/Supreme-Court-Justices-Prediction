Citicorp Industrial Credit, Inc. v. Brock

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    We'll hear argument first this morning in No. 86-88, Citicorp Industrial Credit versus William E. Brock. 
    Mr. Lee, you may proceed whenever you're ready.
speaker="rex_e_lee" startTime="12.496" stopTime="176.616">
    Mr. Rex E. Lee 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court: 
    This case involves the competing claims of creditors to proceeds of an insolvent debtor's collateral. 
    The question presented is whether Congress when it enacted the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 intended not only to prevent employers from paying unconscionably low wages, but also to repeal otherwise applicable state and federal laws governing the lien priorities of wage earners vis a vis other creditors where the employer becomes insolvent and therefore fails to meet his payroll just before he goes out of business. 
    The legal issue in the case arises out of the following facts. 
    The Petitioner, Citicorp Industrial Credit, financed the manufacturing operations of a now defunct entity known as the Ely Group under an ordinary secured financing arrangement that gave Petitioner a security interest, which Petitioner properly perfected, in Ely's accounts receivable and inventory. 
    Approximately one-year later, Ely went out of business, defaulted on its obligations to Petitioner, and also failed to meet its payrolls in the last weeks of its operation. 
    Two district courts found... and this is a quote from both of those opinions... that: 
    "Both the employees and the secured creditor are innocent parties, the culprit being the manufacturer. " 
    Factually, therefore, the case fits the classic insolvency mold: no creditor is at fault, the debtor's assets are insufficient to satisfy all creditors, some will be paid and some will not. 
    So that the crucial practical question becomes, how do you determine which claims will be paid, which will be paid ahead of the others, and what law governs that priority. 
    The Secretary and the lower courts contend that that question is answered by our minimum wage and hour law, and that the FLSA resolves this issue in favor of the unsecured wage claimants because the FLSA's so-called hot goods provision, Section 15(a)(1), permits any person from shipping goods produced in violation of the Act. 
    That view, if adopted by this Court, is going to work some very large changes in state and federal statutes that specifically deal with the priorities of creditors' claims in cases of insolvency, notwithstanding the fact that even the Government agrees that there is no evidence Congress intended that result. 
    Everyone agrees that Congress has never considered whether the hot goods provision should apply to secured creditors.

    The Fair Labor Standards Act was... it has come up at least twice... well, several times. 
    The Fair Labor Standards Act was enacted in 1938. 
    So far as I can tell... and the best authority on this is the Second Circuit's decision in Powell Knitting, which was the first case to reach it in 1966... for the first quarter of a century the Secretary did not take the position that he takes today. 
    And indeed, if you look at that part of our brief that deals with a statement on how to insure against hot goods that the Secretary published early in the game, that was not his position. 
    The first effort to take this position, to apply it against secured creditors, apparently occurred about a quarter of a century after it was enacted, in the mid-1960's. 
    And on that occasion the Second Circuit rejected it.

    Mr. Rex E. Lee 
    Congress has amended the Act substantively, has amended the hot goods provision, once. 
    That amendment, in 1949, was to correct an erroneous interpretation by the Administrator as to its reach. 
    And I prefer not to go into all the detail of that legislative history here, but as set forth in our brief it is just quite clear that what Congress was doing simply correcting one erroneous interpretation by the Secretary. 
    Now, insofar as the language is concerned, the strongest argument that the Government has is the "any person" argument. 
    This is not the first time, however, that this Court has been called upon to consider a Congressional statute whose literal language reached any person or any case, and the Court has held that, though the language fit, it was not the kind of case that Congress wanted to cover with its statute.

    Mr. Rex E. Lee 
    I think there is a real difference, Justice Scalia, between the kind of circumstance where Congress simply came up against the issue and there were competing views on both sides, neither side had the votes, and as a consequence they simply dodged it, and both sides made a lot of legislative history and then left it for this Court to fill in the details... I think that's one circumstance. 
    It is quite another circumstance where Congress, in order to achieve one objective, used some language that was maybe a little bit broader than it should have achieved... or than it might have used, and then later on there is a circumstance that everyone agrees Congress has simply never focused on. 
    And it is particularly different where the effect of that interpretation is going to be to displace some state and federal laws that have specifically focused on the issue. 
    The leading case on this issue... and frankly, the more I look at it, the more I conclude it is this case... is this Holy Trinity case. 
    That involved also a federal statute, and it was a federal statute which prohibited the importation of any person, any person, for the purpose of performing labor within the United States. 
    And then it provided exceptions, and there were exceptions for actors, lecturers, teachers, but not exceptions for ministers of the gospel. 
    And the Holy Trinity Church brought in a Reverend Walpole for the purpose of preaching to their congregation, and the Secretary... or, excuse me... the United States of America brought suit, contending that the statute was violated. 
    And they won in the lower court. 
    The argument they made when they came to this Court, argument by Mr. William A. Maury, Assistant Attorney General of the United States, was that: Where the meaning of a statute is plain it is the duty of the Court to enforce it according to its obvious terms; in such case, there is no necessity for construction. 
    The case really comes down to this, we submit--

    Mr. Rex E. Lee 
    --What I just read, of course, whether it is good or bad, was the statement that was rejected by this Court in Holy Trinity. 
    And they held, in that very famous language, that it may be within the technical language, yet if it is outside what Congress was obviously thinking about the narrow language may not govern. 
    The reason that it is particularly compelling, we submit, that you not apply the literal language in this instance is as follows. 
    It is agreed on all sides that Congress has never squarely dealt with the question whether in insolvency wage claims ought to come ahead of secured creditors. 
    It did not specifically intend, therefore, a change, to effect a change in the state and federal laws that specifically deal with that issue. 
    Yet, a specific, focused Congressional intent is exactly what this court's cases make very clear is required before state and federal law otherwise applicable can be displaced.

    Mr. Rex E. Lee 
    That is correct, that is correct. 
    And indeed, one of our positions is... you don't have to go quite that far... that the Fair Labor Standards Act was simply never intended to apply to instances where the employer was paying the minimum wage, there is no question that he was paying the $3.35 an hour, but he simply went out of business and went broke, and that the Fair Labor Standards Act was never intended--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="697.375" stopTime="707.231">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    --Well, you say he was paying the minimum wage but went broke. 
    I take it you would add that a few weeks before he went broke he didn't pay the minimum wage because he was unable to?
speaker="rex_e_lee" startTime="707.231" stopTime="707.887">
    Mr. Rex E. Lee 
    --That is correct.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="707.887" stopTime="713.556">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    So you would put up a means test a defense for any employer sued under the Fair Labor Standards Act?
speaker="rex_e_lee" startTime="713.556" stopTime="732.955">
    Mr. Rex E. Lee 
    Well, it is simply another approach, another view that we think supports our position, that the Fair Labor Standards Act was not intended to apply to the insolvency circumstance, for a couple of reasons.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="732.955" stopTime="739.514">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    This doesn't take away the property of the secured creditor. 
    It just says he can't ship it in interstate commerce.
speaker="rex_e_lee" startTime="739.514" stopTime="740.030">
    Mr. Rex E. Lee 
    That is correct.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="740.030" stopTime="746.387">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    Granted, that makes it largely valueless. 
    But it's not like a lien statute that says the property passes from A to B.
speaker="rex_e_lee" startTime="746.387" stopTime="887.660">
    Mr. Rex E. Lee 
    That is correct, and that's basically the Government's argument. 
    We think it's insufficient, for a couple of reasons, because frankly my client just doesn't take much comfort from the Government's assurance that the Sixth Circuit's Interpretation here does not create a lien, because the reality is that under the Sixth Circuit's rule Citicorp's first priority lien that it enjoys because of article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code, which would otherwise govern but for the Sixth Circuit's ruling, does it no good unless it first pays off another batch of unsecured junior creditors. 
    So that the effect, though not the label that goes on it and not the concept... and that's part of our argument, that since this was not the intent of the Fair Labor Standards Act it shouldn't apply to this circumstance. 
    But the effect is not only to create a wage earner's lien, but also to move that new lien ahead of secured creditors. 
    Now, there is also a batch of federal statutes that will necessarily be affected by the Secretary's interpretation of the Fair Labor Standards Act. 
    They include: the Bankruptcy Act, which, like the UCC, gives secured creditors priority over unpaid wage earners; the Federal Tax Lien Act, under which either the Secretary of the Treasury or his delegate, usually the IRS district director, both of whom are clearly persons, have the responsibility of levying and enforcing federal tax liens; and two other federal statutes that give the unpaid sellers of livestock and perishable agricultural commodities a priority over other creditors, including employees whose wages have not been paid. 
    The Government observes, and correctly so, that this case does not involve bankruptcy and does not involve any of those other statutes. 
    But the point is that the literal interpretation of "any person" which the Government seeks will necessarily change a lot of lien statutes that would otherwise be applicable in this circumstance.

 He had taken the opposite position or had taken no position?

    We think he had taken the opposite position. 
    There is not a lot of evidence as to the position that he had taken. 
    I refer you to Powell Knitting, the Second Circuit decision which was the first one to come up in 1966, and that case observes that this is apparently the first time the Secretary has taken this position.

    Mr. Rex E. Lee 
    It was in the form, Justice Brennan, of a statement in a... the BNA put put a manual called a manual for Fair Labor Standards Act compliance, and there was a statement in that manual that dealt with insurance against hot goods. 
    And in that manual the Secretary took the position... it told you how you could get insurance against hot goods, and basically where it came out was that you could get insurance against hot goods if you could show that you had acted in good faith. 
    It used the example of those who bought... lumber processors who bought from mills, and said that if they would monitor the FLSA compliance of the lumber mills then that would be insurance against hot goods. 
    Now, under the provision... under the position that the Government takes today, there is no insurance against hot goods. 
    If they are hot at one time, they simply remain hot and no amount of insurance... or, excuse me... no amount of innocence will change that. 
    Now, the Government takes the position that what that manual said... or, not what the manual, what the insurance against hot goods was talking about was criminal prosecution. 
    And I simply submit that there is no way that that particular provision can be read that way, because what it talks about is goods that are in the hands of the creditor and that he can't ship them and how to avoid that circumstance.

    All of their victories have been Sixth Circuit victories, and they've all come in the 1980's. 
    The other federal statutes that will be affected are these two that deal with the trusts that are imposed on the sellers of perishable agricultural commodities and of livestock by federal statutes. 
    The point is that the wage and hour law need not be interpreted in such a way that it alters lien priorities, and it should not be. 
    It's a point that is further underscored by the Government's reliance on the Flammable Fabrics Act.

 Is there any language, interpretation of the language, that you can give us that would lead to the conclusion that you want? 
 Or is it just you're inviting us to throw up our hands and say, well, it doesn't say that, but we appeal to the spirit of the laws?

    Mr. Rex E. Lee 
    Well, let me give you three brief answers. 
    The first is, it's an old chestnut but a good one. 
    It's been around for a long time and it's entitled to some respect. 
    And I submit, it is indistinguishable. 
    They were doing exactly the same thing. 
    They were bringing people here, and it fairly fit the statute that says that any person... it's unlawful to import any person any alien, for those purposes.

    Mr. Rex E. Lee 
    In the good spirit of true adjudication, they decided only that case that was before them at that particular instance. 
    But there was an exception for lecturers, there was an exception for teachers, there was an exception for domestics, and several others. 
    The second answer is that that isn't the only case. 
    There is another one that we think is right on point. 
    Unfortunately, we didn't find it until we were preparing for oral argument, though I have advised Mr. Rothfeld of that right after we found it. 
    It's a 1975 decision by this Court. 
    I would pronounce it Muniz versus Hoffman, and it also arose out of the labor context. 
    It involved the question of jury trial, jury trial for an individual who was convicted of contempt because of a violation of a court's order pending... for an injunction pending determination of that issue by the National Labor Relations Act. 
    And the statute says that in any case involving or growing out of a labor dispute the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy trial. 
    This Court, relying on Holy Trinity, said: 
    "It is not unusual that exceptions to the applicability of a statute's otherwise all-inclusive language are not contained in the enactment itself, but are found in another statute dealing with particular situations to which the first statute might otherwise apply. " 
    All I'm saying is that there is good precedent for not extending the "any person" language where it's going to have the kind of mischievous effects that it's going to have here.

    Probably not, probably not. 
    The point is that, just as you referred to a moment ago, Justice Scalia, in connection with how many exceptions are carved out, your ruling in this case as to any person, if it means secured creditors, I don't see how you can stop it from meaning trustees in bankruptcy. 
    And I don't believe that anyone can seriously say that Congress three days after it passed the Chandler Act intended to reverse those lien priorities that were effected there. 
    And I also don't think--

    Mr. Rex E. Lee 
    I would not put it that Congress cannot make a mistake. 
    I would rather say that in melding together the rules dealing with preemption and repeal by implication, and applying both the Muniz case and also the Holy Trinity case, that in those instances where everyone agrees that Congress simply didn't face or decide these kinds of issues that you're not going to preempt inadvertently nor repeal by implication inadvertently when there is another interpretation.

   Argument of Charles A. Rothfeld

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Thank you, Mr. Lee.

speaker="charles_a_rothfeld" startTime="1561.826" stopTime="1601.654">
    Mr. Charles A. Rothfeld 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court: 
    This case is not about secret liens or state insolvency laws or priorities in bankruptcy, as Citicorp has argued this morning. 
    It is about the meaning of a completely unambiguous statute, the Fair Labor Standards Act. 
    Now, when it has talked about the Act at all, Citicorp has painted a picture that is a caricature of what was and is a dramatic piece of legislation. 
    The Act is written in the broadest possible terms. 
    It makes it illegal for any person to sell hot goods in interstate commerce until those goods are cured. 
    And Justice O'Connor, in response to your question, the goods are cured by the payment of the minimum wage, not all wages due the employees.

    Mr. Charles A. Rothfeld 
    That's true, Justice Stevens, the statute doesn't address that issue at all. 
    And the Secretary's reasoning, I think, is that because the goods were produced under substandard conditions, the taint is cured if the conditions are essentially corrected. 
    And the conditions are corrected by paying, albeit retroactively, what the employees were due. 
    I should add that Citicorp--

    Mr. Charles A. Rothfeld 
    --I think that's quite different, Justice Stevens. 
    Let me preface my answer by saying Citicorp invited this relief and it was granted by the district courts, the Court of Appeals, over the Secretary's objection. 
    The Secretary did not agree that it was appropriate to stay the lower court judgments. 
    But I think that the Secretary is dealing with an issue which simply is not addressed in the statute at all, whether or not the taint can be cured. 
    The issue here that Citicorp is talking about is quite explicitly dealt with in the statute. 
    The statute says flatly no one can sell hot goods in interstate commerce, period.

speaker="charles_a_rothfeld" startTime="1833.545" stopTime="1951.544">
    Mr. Charles A. Rothfeld 
    Well, I think actually that is quite right, Justice Stevens. 
    And there is no conflict that we see between Section 1501 and priorities in bankruptcy, for several reasons. 
    First of all, the Bankruptcy Code itself recognizes the distinction that we have drawn in our statute between regulatory statutes and creditor's rights provisions. 
    Section 362(b)(4) and (b)(5), it explicitly permits the Government to prosecute an action to enforce an injunctive... obtain injunctive relief when necessary to enforce public law requirements. 
    District courts and bankruptcy courts have uniformly concluded that the Fair Labor Standards Act is precisely that sort of statute. 
    So if this were a bankruptcy case, the code itself would permit this very action to proceed and the same relief to be awarded. 
    Second of all, we don't think that the application of the Fair Labor Standards Act here affects priorities in bankruptcy at all, even apart from the Section 362(b)(4) and (b)(5) relief. 
    Now, we talked about this at length in our brief, and what I would like to do, with your indulgence, is explain how we think the statute operates and what we think it means, because that I think answers the question about whether or not this affects priorities in bankruptcy. 
    The short answer is that as a statute like the Flammable Fabrics Act, for example, which we cite in our brief... if flammable fabrics turned up in a bankrupt estate, the trustee certainly couldn't claim that he had a right to sell those fabrics until they were conformed to the requirements of federal law. 
    Precisely the same thing is true here. 
    If goods that were tainted because they were produced under substandard labor conditions turn up in a bankrupt estate, the trustee cannot sell them until he satisfies the absolute requirements of federal law, which is that the taint be removed. 
    Now, the taint is removed by the payment of wages, essentially remedying the substandard labor condition. 
    But that doesn't affect priorities in bankruptcy. 
    And as I say, I think as I outline how the operation of the statute and what Congress meant to accomplish, that becomes quite clear. 
    I'd like to talk about, I think, two things.

speaker="charles_a_rothfeld" startTime="2003.647" stopTime="2021.126">
    Mr. Charles A. Rothfeld 
    Well, but the nature of the statutes are identical. 
    Both statutes are public laws that create general regulatory prohibitions on the introduction of certain goods into interstate commerce, for particular reasons, until those reasons are removed, whether or not it's a question of enforcement discretion or it's simply a straightforward interpretation of the statute.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2021.126" stopTime="2053.425">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    Well, but there is, it seems to me, a considerable difference between some item that's perhaps made out of flammable fabrics and is simply dangerous, branded so by the statutory scheme, and say an automobile that may have been manufactured by a bankrupt automobile company, that the last couple weeks didn't pay minimum wages. 
    That automobile is a source of value somewhere, and you certainly want to find some way that you can cure whatever defect there was and get it back in commerce, in a way that you don't with a flammable fabric.
speaker="charles_a_rothfeld" startTime="2053.425" stopTime="2067.871">
    Mr. Charles A. Rothfeld 
    Well, I'm not sure that's entirely true, as a flammable fabric can be cured, can be brought Into conformity with the federal standards. 
    The flammable fabric is not without value. 
    It simply is of reduced value because it's defective. 
    And I think that--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2067.871" stopTime="2090.551">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    But certainly we shouldn't strain to reach a result that says Congress intended that these particular goods simply rot here because their defect can't be cured and they can't be shipped, if there's nothing really inherently wrong with the goods. 
    If Congress says that's the result, now that's what has to obtain. 
    But you don't certainly strain to reach that result.
speaker="charles_a_rothfeld" startTime="2090.551" stopTime="2107.716">
    Mr. Charles A. Rothfeld 
    --Well, let me answer that in two ways, Justice Rehnquist. 
    First, we don't suggest that that's the result which should obtain in this case. 
    I think we all agree that if the employees are paid, if the statutory requirements are satisfied, the goods can be introduced into interstate commerce. 
    The Secretary won't object to that.

    Mr. Charles A. Rothfeld 
    Well, I think that's right, Justice Stevens. 
    And the result that the Act ordains is quite clear. 
    Certainly if goods are produced, in the normal course of business employees are not paid until the week following the production of the goods, those goods are not hot goods during the week prior to the payment of the employees.

speaker="charles_a_rothfeld" startTime="2363.877" stopTime="2412.796">
    Mr. Charles A. Rothfeld 
    Well, let me give you two answers to that. 
    First of all, accepting your assumption, it is true that this does not disturb generally priorities in bankruptcy. 
    Congress was legislating with a particular problem in mind, the problem of employees who did not receive wages, and that is dealt with in this statute explicitly. 
    And no matter what any other provision of state law or the Bankruptcy Code says, this is the statute which deals with that problem. 
    The second answer to the question again is that this does not affect priorities in bankruptcy. 
    The Fair Labor Standards Act does not give employees any claim in the goods, does not give employees a claim on the bankrupt estate, does not create liens, does not adjust Citicorp's property interest in the goods themselves vis a vis anyone else. 
    It simply provides a general federal prohibition, a universal prohibition, on the sale of tainted goods.

    Mr. Charles A. Rothfeld 
    That's quite right. 
    This is something... and I think that's an important point, Justice Stevens. 
    An action of this sort under Section 17, 27 U.S.C. Section 217, is brought in the public interest by the Secretary. 
    It is not brought to benefit individual employees. 
    It is brought to combat generally the spread of substandard labor conditions and to exclude tainted goods from interstate commerce... all considerations that Congress was very concerned about when it passed the Act. 
    I think the Courts of Appeals have uniformly held that this should not be viewed as an action on behalf of the individual employee. 
    This is an action to enforce a requirement of public law.

    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    That was in the tradition of a lot of these Acts, the Webb-Kenyon Act, the Asher-Summers Act, that all described the tainted goods interstate commerce. 
    That was the way Congress got at them.

    Mr. Charles A. Rothfeld 
    Well, that's quite right, Justice Rehnquist. 
    There were two aspects of this. 
    One is that was the way Congress got at a problem and accomplished its purpose. 
    Another is Congress viewed these goods as, as then Assistant Attorney General Jackson put it, the product of ruined lives and, as President Roosevelt put it, contraband which should not be allowed to pollute the channels of interstate trade. 
    I think Congress did in fact want to exclude these goods for its own sake. 
    But there were also other purposes--

    Mr. Charles A. Rothfeld 
    --Well, there were a number of purposes to be served. 
    First of all, the Congress was concerned... Citicorp has sort of raised the suggestion that Congress was not really concerned with problems of insolvency or employers who just didn't meet their payroll occasionally. 
    We think that is just plainly not true. 
    Congress applied the Act to every employer. 
    Congress wrote the Act in 1938 and it was aware of problems of insolvency and marginal employers. 
    And while it is certainly true that an employer can chisel, in Citicorp's phrase, an employee by paying him regularly at half the minimum rate, it can chisel him just as effectively by skipping half of its payrolls. 
    There is no reason to think that Congress was unconcerned with that group of marginal employers who managed to operate close to the edge and stayed in business by bouncing payroll checks that they had no real expectations of ever being able to meet.

 He contracted with them to pay above the minimum wage, but he failed to pay them. 
 And I asked Mr. Lee the same question and he said that he doesn't think the law is clear on it.

    Mr. Charles A. Rothfeld 
    We think it is clear, Justice Scalia. 
    We cited in our brief on pages 16 and 17 a number of cases in which employers were sued for back pay. 
    There is no indication in the case, and I believe there is affirmative indication in the case, that the employers contracted to pay the regular rate, but simply didn't pay for reasons of financial difficulty. 
    And when they were sued for back pay, the Courts of Appeals uniformly held that an employer's financial difficulty is not a defense in the case, not a defense to a suit under the Fair Labor Standards Act.

    I am not aware of any reported decisions, Justice White. 
    The Secretary I know does bring as a matter of practice suits under both Section 15(a)(1) and 15(a)(2), that combines the hot goods clause and a direct suit against the employer for violating the minimum wage and overtime requirements. 
    So I think it is a common practice to bring such suits, and I think it is so clearly accepted that perhaps it hasn't been discussed generally by the Courts of Appeals.

    Mr. Charles A. Rothfeld 
    Well, I think that's simply not true, Justice O'Connor. 
    The Secretary first dealt with this issue in 1966, as Mr. Lee suggested, in the Powell Mills case, largely because, I suspect, the issue didn't arise very often and still doesn't arise very often. 
    We cite in footnote 31 in our brief all of the actions of which we're aware in which the Secretary has tried to enforce the hot goods clause against secured creditor. 
    There were two in the 1970's. 
    There have been a number in the 1980's. 
    There was one in 1966. 
    Prior to 1966, this issue simply wasn't addressed. 
    Mr. Lee has suggested that in 1949 the Secretary took a contrary position. 
    We discussed that at length in our brief at pages 29 to 31, and we think it is quite clear from the circular that Citicorp relies upon that the Secretary simply meant to say that good faith operators... the Secretary was not dealing there at all with secured creditors, but good faith operators generally could protect themselves only by making certain that their suppliers had complied with the Act. 
    The Secretary said innocence was a defense simply to criminal prosecution under Section 16, 16(a). 
    And I invite the Court's examination of the document that Citicorp relies upon. 
    I think it is quite clear that our reading is correct. 
    The Secretary since 1966 has consistently taken the position in every case in which this issue has arisen--

    Mr. Charles A. Rothfeld 
    --Well, I'm not sure that's true. 
    Citicorp represents, and I think it's probably right, that early on inventory bank financing was relatively rare. 
    So it may be that there simply were not that many factual situations like this. 
    And I should add that even since 1966 there have been relatively few cases. 
    In order to prosecute an action of this sort, the Secretary has to find the violation and obtain an injunction relatively quickly, and he has to do it in the circumstance in which he thinks it's appropriate. 
    So it may be that there simply are not that many instances in which this issue arises. 
    I should return, while on that point, to the question of the Act, but before I do that I want to deal more directly with the plain language of the statute. 
    Citicorp's entire argument, I think as the Court generally has noted, is devoted to running away from what Congress actually said in Section 15. 
    Its entire argument is based on cases like Holy Trinity, which relies upon the proposition that Congress here simply didn't know what it was doing when it wrote Section 15(a)(1). 
    Whatever the propriety of departing from the statutory language in a situation like that, where Congress specifically intended an outcome in a given case, obviously a claim that Congress didn't know what it was doing is one that should be treated with great skepticism.

speaker="charles_a_rothfeld" startTime="3032.733" stopTime="3141.424">
    Mr. Charles A. Rothfeld 
    But I can certainly say that we think that the plain language of the statute is the clearest indication of how the statute should be applied. 
    And if one even deals with Citicorp on its own ground and says, did Congress mean what it was saying when it wrote Section 15(a)(1), I think there is no question that Congress meant precisely what it said. 
    Citicorp never exactly says precisely what the term "person" should mean if it doesn't mean what it is defined to mean in the statute. 
    But it sort of hints in its brief that it means perhaps dealers and subcontractors or culpable parties. 
    If Congress had wanted to write those restrictions into the statute, it knew how to do that. 
    It wrote precisely those restrictions into other provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act. 
    Dealers and manufacturers are dealt with by the child labor prohibitions of Section 12. 
    Willful violators are dealt with in the criminal penalty provisions of Section 16. 
    Other provisions of the Act deal only with employers. 
    But Section 15(a)(1), alone among the substantive prohibitions of the Act, deals with "any person". 
    That could not have been inadvertent. 
    If there is any doubt about this, Section 15(a)(1) contains two explicit exemptions, one for common carriers, which was added only because Congress didn't want a test of the constitutionality of the statute to arise in a case involving a carrier's obligation to transport goods; the other for certain good faith purchasers which was added in 1949. 
    That exemption is worth looking at closely, because it is unusually strict. 
    It is not enough that a purchaser acquire goods for value and in good faith. 
    To benefit from that exemption, he also must acquire goods in reliance on the producer's written statement of compliance with the Act. 
    Now, if Congress felt it necessary to write special exemptions of that sort into Section 15 to benefit two discrete and demonstrably innocent categories of people, it certainly thought that the Act otherwise would reach everyone, no matter how innocent or uninvolved.

speaker="charles_a_rothfeld" startTime="3168.101" stopTime="3312.792">
    Mr. Charles A. Rothfeld 
    Well, probably, Justice White. 
    The term 3, I believe it's Section 3(j), to include goods that were handled by employees who... both production and handling. 
    So if the goods were handled by employees who hadn't been paid, those goods could not be shipped either. 
    If the goods had entirely been treated by employees who were paid in compliance with the Act, they could of course be shipped. 
    There would be no statutory prohibition. 
    Our point is that the plain language of the statute applies in a case like this one, where there was the statutory obligation to pay and no pay was made, and where the person as defined in the statute, and Citicorp undoubtedly is a person as defined in the statute, is trying to introduce those goods into interstate commerce. 
    Section 15 says on its face that Citicorp shouldn't be able to do that. 
    Applying the statute here accomplishes precisely what Congress set out to accomplish when it wrote Section 15, because Congress intended to make sure that everyone... well, Congress intended to apply Section 15 to everyone, so that no one would be able to deal in hot goods, so that everyone would be aware to watch out for hot goods, everyone would be aware that they could not benefit from an employer's failure to pay minimum wage. 
    That is part of the entire enforcement scheme of the Act. 
    Citicorp's argument to the contrary simply ignores the theory on which the Fair Labor Standards Act operates. 
    I should add one additional thing about this insolvency and bankruptcy point, which we think is a red herring thrown into the case by Citicorp to distract the Court from the plain language of the statute. 
    As I was suggesting before, the Act essentially creates a universal prohibition on anyone's ability to deal with certain types of goods. 
    It does not create property interests in those goods, it does not create liens. 
    It simply says no one can deal with those goods until they have been cured in the meaning of the statute or until the Secretary determines not to bring an enforcement action. 
    Nothing in that addresses insolvency. 
    Nothing in that type of enactment addresses priorities in bankruptcy. 
    It simply, as I say, creates a universal prohibition as a matter of public policy, a familiar type of prohibition that Congress created many times. 
    There is no doubt that if, for example, any of these goods had been flammable rather than hot, they could not have been introduced into interstate commerce. 
    And we think precisely the same principle is at stake in this case. 
    We urge the Court to apply the statute as it was written, to accomplish the purposes Congress tried to accomplish. 
    If there are no further questions. 
   
   
   
   Rebuttal of Rex E. Lee

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Thank you, Mr. Rothfeld. 
    Mr. Lee, you have four minutes remaining.
speaker="rex_e_lee" startTime="3318.023" stopTime="3373.565">
    Mr. Rex E. Lee 
    One objective of the Fair Labor Standards Act was to force the payment of minimum wages by chiseling employers, and it had one other objective which was supportive thereof, and that was to take away the competitive advantage in interstate commerce that the substandard employers would enjoy vis a vis those who had paid standard wages. 
    You do not get at that objective by requiring third parties whose only leverage existed because of something they did a year before the insolvency occurs. 
    Mr. Rothfeld has conceded, as of course he must, that there is a conflict between the substantive provisions of the Bankruptcy Act, which deal with creditors' priorities, and the Fair Labor Standards Act as it would be interpreted here.

    Mr. Rex E. Lee 
    There is no question that Congress has the power to repeal state and federal laws dealing with these lien priorities and to move wage creditors to the head of the line. 
    But this Court said just last year in Bowen versus American Hospital Association that the implications and limitations of our federal system constitute a major premise of all Congressional legislation and that Congress will not be deemed to have displaced state law unless otherwise the purpose of the Act would be defeated. 
    At a very minimum, we submit that means that in making decisions such as in this case some kind of a comparative balance of the comparative impact on state and federal laws must be taken into account. 
    That does not mean that we are taking the position that Congress did not know what it was doing. 
    We are simply saying that in every instance that I am aware of in which the Court has faced the identical situation in this case, Congress was aiming at a particular problem, used language that would sweep in a few other instances, this Court has not simply woodenly said, therefore those other instances were also legislated unintentionally. 
    The only cases that deal with it so far as I am aware are Holy Trinity... and there has been no attempt to distinguish Holy Trinity... this Muniz case, and then there is a case that comes fairly close to it, this Court's recent decision in the Jersey Shore Bank case.

    Mr. Rex E. Lee 
    --That goes back to the conversation that I had with Justice Scalia. 
    May I answer the question, Mr. Chief Justice? 
    It goes back to the conversation that I had earlier with Justice Scalia. 
    There is a difference between the circumstances where Congress was facing either one interpretation or the other and didn't actually make it clear which it was doing. 
    That's the Johnson and the Weber circumstance, at least as I read Johnson and Weber. 
    This is a circumstance that is quite different, where Congress used language that no one contends, no one contends, was intended to be applicable.
