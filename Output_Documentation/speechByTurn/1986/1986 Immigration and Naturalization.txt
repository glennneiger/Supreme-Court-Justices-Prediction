Immigration and Naturalization Service v. Cardoza-Fonseca

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    We will hear argument first this morning in No. 85-782, Immigration and Naturalization Service versus Luz Marina Cardoza-Fonseca. 
    Mr. Wallace.
speaker="lawrence_g_wallace" startTime="13.424" stopTime="238.754">
    Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court: 
    In June of 1984 this Court held in INS against Stevic that an alien's burden of proving eligibility for withholding of deportation to a particular country under Section 243(h) of the Immigration and Nationality Act is to show that it is more likely than not that the alien would be subject to persecution if sent back to that country. 
    In the present case, the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit correctly recognized that the Board of Immigration Appeals has consistently taken the position that essentially the same standard, although formulated in various ways, also applies to an alien's burden of proving eligibility for the greater benefit of asylum under Section 208(a) of the Act. 
    The Court of Appeals, however, rejected the Board's interpretation and remanded the case for reconsideration by the Board under a standard devised by the Court of Appeals. 
    This Court granted certiorari to resolve a conflict in circuits about whether the Board's interpretation of the statute is a permissible one, entitled to be upheld by the courts. 
    The Board of Immigration Appeals, whose interpretations are binding by regulation on district directors and other Immigration and Naturalization Service employees, has been recognized by this Court as the expert body whose interpretations of the immigration laws are entitled to judicial deference. 
    And after this Court's opinion in Stevic and the conflict in the circuits developed, the Board re-examined at some length its position with respect to Section 208(a) in an opinion which we reproduced in the appendix to the petition for certiorari, called Acosta, beginning on page 29A of the appendix to the petition for certiorari and taking up the remainder of the appendix. 
    And I commend that opinion to the Court's attention. 
    There the Board carefully considered the legislative history of the Refugee Act of 1980, its international law background, the judicial opinions that have commented on it, and, as the Court knows, the Board determined that its position had been correct all along, and it had good reasons for doing so. 
    The question is whether the Board's interpretation is a reasonable one that should be upheld, reasonable in the sense that it is not precluded by the statutory language or by the legislative history or by the sense of the statute. 
    And we submit that there are three categories of reasons why the Board's interpretation is a reasonable one, entitled to judicial deference.

    Justice Blackmun 
    Mr. Wallace, am I correct in understanding that in the Sevic case, whatever it is, the Court assumed the standards were different?
speaker="lawrence_g_wallace" startTime="249.712" stopTime="271.743">
    Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace 
    It assumed for purposes of decision, but it expressly left the question open. 
    You know, there is some commentary which suggests the possibility that the standards could be different, and the assumption was made for purposes of decision. 
    But this is the question that was expressly left open in Stevic.

    Justice O'Connor 
    Mr. Wallace, I'm also concerned by the fact that Congress considered an express requirement that applicants for asylum meet the same standard required for withholding deportation and rejected it. 
    And is that something that we should consider in the balance here of how much deference to give to the Board's present interpretation?

    Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace 
    Well, of course it can be considered, but there were no circumstances connected with that particular incident that indicated that Congress clearly thought a different standard did apply. 
    And it's just part of the legislative background which the Board has considered as a whole. 
    I don't think there's any one incident that's dispositive.

    Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace 
    --That is still the Board's position. 
    That has always been the Board's position, that a clear probability or likelihood or what this Court called in Stevic more likely than not, three formulations which the Court recognized as equivalent in Stevic, are for practical purposes the same as well-founded fear of prosecution; that while the verbal formulations differ, as the Board put it, for practical purposes the standards converged.

    Justice Jr. 
    And do you still support the Board?

 Justice Jr. 
 And do you still support the Board?
speaker="lawrence_g_wallace" startTime="381.715" stopTime="500.292">
    Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace 
    That is our position. 
    That has consistently been the Board's position. 
    The Court of Appeals stated that that has consistently been the Board's position and correctly cited Board decisions starting in 1973 up through the Acosta case in which the Board has stated that position. 
    That is the Board's position. 
    As we see it, there are three categories of reasons why the Board's position is a reasonable interpretation of the statute. 
    The first category is that the Board's position takes a coherent view of these interrelated provisions of the statute, so that they make sense considered as a whole. 
    It must be remembered that asylum provides greater benefits in two important respects than does what was before the Court in Stevic, the right to withholding of deportation to a particular country upon a proper showing. 
    In one respect asylum is broader because it grants a right not to be deported anywhere. 
    Somebody who shows that he's entitled to withholding of deportation under Section 243(h) is only granted the right not to be sent back to that particular country. 
    He may still be deported to some other country if there's another country willing to accept him, and that as a matter of fact is happening with some frequency currently. 
    There are a number of persons who have been refugees from Afghanistan coming into our country--

    --That is entirely correct, and the Court pointed that out in Stevic. 
    But it should be remembered that this is a highly structured exercise of discretion. 
    It is not an ad hoc determination about individuals by the Attorney General. 
    In practice, this is an exercise of discretion dealing with more than 10,000 asylum claims per year, an exercise of discretion which is made by the 33 district directors and by the 60 immigration judges whose decisions are reviewable by the Board of Immigration Appeals. 
    And the discretion is exercised in accordance with legal standards that are set forth in the Code of Federal Regulations and that have been developed in Board of Immigration Appeals decisions.

    --There certainly could, Mr. Justice, and there is a plausible argument to be made that a coherent way of looking at the statute would be to rely on that distinction. 
    That does not mean that the Board's interpretation is not also a plausible, reasonable, coherent way of reconciling the provisions. 
    And the burden in attacking the Board's interpretation is to show that the Board's interpretation is the one that's precluded. 
    We do not have the burden of showing that that interpretation is precluded. 
    I concede that it is not precluded, that perhaps the Board could have adopted it.

    --Well, it has expertise because the Department of Justice was an active participant in the legislation as it developed. 
    It has had the occasion to study the legislative background against the experience that it has had in applying the standards. 
    It is closely familiar with what the administrative and judicial interpretations were that Congress was acting against the background of. 
    And it is the sort of question that expert agencies traditionally are recognized to have expertise about. 
    I mean, the National Labor Relations Board is interpreting the National Labor Relations Act constantly, and this Court has deferred to its expert judgment about the meaning of the Act, which gains content through experience in its administration.

    Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace 
    --Well, I'll have to let them speak for themselves on that. 
    I'm sure the argument could be made that once the court determined that Congress intended two different standards to apply, it would be an abuse of discretion for the Attorney General to in effect repeal that difference by regulation. 
    We could argue that his discretion under Section 208(a) should be interpreted that broadly. 
    But of course, it could be a more awkward way for the law to be administered, even if such a regulation were upheld, because then we would be in a position of deporting people to countries where they have shown that they meet the statutory standard of showing a sufficient probability that they would be persecuted in that country, and nonetheless we would be deporting them. 
    And we don't believe that the law requires the Attorney General to make that call.

    Mr. Wallace, if your first answer to Justice Scalia is correct, then the Attorney General would have the power under the statute to adopt a regulation substantially adopting the standard, perhaps saying except in very exceptional cases on a particularized showing or something like that, you must meet the same standard.

 What you're basically arguing for here is to give your client less discretion than your opponent thinks he should have. 
 So it's in kind of a strange position.

    Well, we recognize that. 
    But there are virtues in this field of delicate international relations and international obligations to having the Attorney General being able to point to someone's failure to meet the statutory showing that is required in order to qualify for asylum status on the basis of fear of persecution. 
    And we don't invariably argue for broader discretion than we think the law confers on us.

 Does asylum usually lead to citizenship?
speaker="lawrence_g_wallace" startTime="979.338" stopTime="1155.054">
    Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace 
    That is the other major difference between asylum and deportation. 
    Within one year after asylum has been granted, the alien is eligible to achieve legal permanent residency, which in turn then can lead to citizenship. 
    And the answer for practical purposes is yes. 
    Whereas someone granted withholding of deportation is left standing in the same line he was standing in prior to that, waiting to come in under a quota. 
    He doesn't in any way advance toward achieving permanent legal residency. 
    Those are the main differences, and they are the key to the coherence of the Board's position here, that aliens facing a lower probability of persecution than is required for withholding of deportation should not obtain the greater relief available to asylees while being ineligible for the lesser relief. 
    Rather, the greater relief is available within the Attorney General's discretion to a reduced category of those who qualify for the lesser relief. 
    As I began to tell the Court, that has recently been done with respect to refugees from Afghanistan who have entered this country from Pakistan on the basis of forged entry documents. 
    Because of the way they gained admittance to the country, the Attorney General through the Board has refused to grant them asylum, and these days a case like Stevic is a great rarity. 
    Everyone asks for withholding of deportation or asylum, rather than just the withholding. 
    The Attorney General has refused to grant them asylum, but because this was not a serious crime he has granted them withholding of deportation to Afghanistan and the great majority of them have subsequently been deported back to Pakistan, where this is something worked out through international negotiations with Pakistan. 
    It depends on Pakistan's willingness to take them back. 
    They have been willing to take back some 90 percent of them. 
    So that is a very meaningful difference between the two standards, which adds coherence to the Board's position. 
    Now, the second category--

    Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace 
    --Well, there's always the possibility that the Attorney General will achieve the same result we are saying the statute achieves, through an exercise of discretion that gets back to that point. 
    Let me rather briefly mention the other two categories of considerations that support the reasonableness of the Board's interpretation. 
    One is the legislative history and background of the Refugee Act of 1980, and it's important to recognize that there were two propositions established in our law at the time Congress acted that are highly pertinent here. 
    One is, as we have recounted in our brief, asylum had been created by regulation prior to its first statutory recognition in the 1980 Act. 
    And those regulations had been amended in 1979 to state explicitly, as we point out on page 17 of our brief, that the standard for proving asylum is the same as the standard for proving withholding of deportation. 
    The Court recognized this in Stevic. 
    And against that background, both the Senate report and expert testimony before Congress referred to asylum and the new provision as not changing the substantive standards. 
    Now, questions have been raised about the authoritativeness of these statements. 
    It is true that the conference report didn't repeat that. 
    The Senate's version of the bill on this subject wasn't the one adopted. 
    Nonetheless, there was no express repudiation of any of these considerations, and the Board has reasonably relief on this aspect of the law, of the legislative background, as indicating that Congress did not intend to digress from what had been the established law with respect to asylum at that point. 
    And the other thing that was established in our law is that the well-founded fear of persecution language had itself been interpreted prior to its use in the 1980 law. 
    That was first interpreted by the Board in the Dunar case, where a claim was made that because of that language in the protocol the standards for withholding of deportation should be changed, and the Board said in effect that they concluded that it was essentially the same standard as they had been applying in Section 3243(h) for withholding of deportation. 
    And two Courts of Appeals had upheld the Board's view on that, the Fifth Circuit and the Seventh Circuit. 
    We recount that on page 25 of our brief. 
    And no court at that time had held to the contrary. 
    That was the state of the law at the time Congress adopted that very language in the Act, and Congress did not say it was using that language with any different meaning than had been established in the law at that time. 
    That too entitled the Board to rely on Congress' use of language that had been authoritatively interpreted as meaning the same thing as those authoritative interpretations, rather than attributing some other meaning to that language. 
    And the last category of reasons why the Board's interpretation is reasonable is because there is no authoritative source for any other interpretation to give content to the meaning of "well-founded fear of persecution". 
    The Court of Appeals merely says, well, it should be a subjective fear combined with some objective basis. 
    Well, if the alien's country is persecuting any persons on the basis of their political views and the alien has applied for asylum, which could be interpreted as a hostile act, there's always some objective basis. 
    There isn't much guidance in the standard developed by the Court of Appeals on its own. 
    And the Board, with its vast experience in administering this statute, has concluded that the practical standard is the familiar one that it has utilized right along. 
    I'd like to reserve the balance of my time, if I may. 
   
   
   
   Argument of Dana Marks Keener
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1561.368" stopTime="1565.070">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Thank you, Mr. Wallace. 
    We'll hear from you now, Ms. Keener.
speaker="dana_marks_keener" startTime="1565.070" stopTime="1605.980">
    Ms. Dana Marks Keener 
    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    Understandably, the Government is putting considerable emphasis on their deference argument. 
    That's because it's the only argument that it has. 
    Unfortunately, there are some... or fortunately for our side... there are some considerable problems with deference to the agency in this particular context. 
    By reviewing the statutory canons that apply to deference, the first place you start is with the fact that a court is the expert in terms of statutory construction. 
    The meaning of the "well-founded fear" standard is an issue of law. 
    It's clearly within the traditional function of this Court to interpret. 
    It is not an area--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1605.980" stopTime="1628.928">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    Ms. Keener, Mr. Wallace, in response to a question from, I believe it was, Justice Stevens, said that, for example, the National Labor Relations Board had been deferred to when it was construing even a provision of the Act, not that its view was final but that it was given deference. 
    Are you suggesting that the INS in this case should be given no deference simply because it is construing a term of the statute?
speaker="dana_marks_keener" startTime="1628.928" stopTime="1639.284">
    Ms. Dana Marks Keener 
    --No. 
    Of course the Court also looks at other factors, and deference cases talk about the fact, Chevron for example, that first always is Congress' intent.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1639.284" stopTime="1650.775">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    Well, my question to you was, which I don't think you've yet answered, is is the agency entitled to no deference because what it is construing is a term of the statute?
speaker="dana_marks_keener" startTime="1650.775" stopTime="1661.649">
    Ms. Dana Marks Keener 
    I think that answer is probably correct. 
    But in arriving at whether deference is considered or not, the courts usually look at several factors, which include the legislative history, the plain language of the statute.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1661.649" stopTime="1664.601">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    Well, is deference one of those factors or not?
speaker="dana_marks_keener" startTime="1664.601" stopTime="1681.895">
    Ms. Dana Marks Keener 
    Well, it can be if a standard is not a question of pure law, if it is an application of the law to a specific set of facts. 
    And courts often look to the agency's expertise to decide whether or not that's the kind of situation presented. 
    However, that's not the case here.

    Ms. Dana Marks Keener 
    There was a technical gap in Chevron, and it was involved in the implementation. 
    So it was construing a term involved in implementing a standard. 
    However, here the standard was explicitly set forth by Congress as a well-founded fear standard. 
    But Congress went even further. 
    Congress stated that this term, well-founded fear, is to be construed consistently with the United Nations protocol, with the international understanding of the term. 
    That's different from deferring the interpretation of a standard to an agency in the process of administering its law. 
    There is no discretion in what the substantive standard is for asylum.

speaker="dana_marks_keener" startTime="1752.224" stopTime="1940.528">
    Ms. Dana Marks Keener 
    That's correct. 
    Because the standard was selected by Congress, because Congress specifically indicated the criteria it was to be evaluated by, any interpretation by the agency which does not carry out that explicit intent of Congress is therefore unreasonable. 
    Amicus in this case from the United Nations High Commissioner on Refugees has stated explicitly that the Government's interpretation here is not consistent with the United Nations protocol. 
    This is also not an area where there's the special expertise of the agency, as there are in some deference cases. 
    This is an internationally accepted standard. 
    It's a standard that has been in our law in various forms, not just since the 1973 case that the Government is relying on, but going back to the 1948 Displaced Persons Act. 
    The main flaw in the Government's reasoning here is the fact that they are not tracing the history of the standard, okay. 
    United States law for 30 years has had separate refugee admissions policies and separate standards and statutes which relate to the deportation of refugees. 
    Since 1948, the refugee admission standards have been based on a good reason to fear formulation, and that was derived from the United Nations... the grandfather of the United Nations protocol, which is the International Refugee Organization constitution, starting with a good reason to fear standard, a fear of persecution standard. 
    That fear of persecution standard is traced in our briefs and in amicus briefs to the predecessor provision to the current provision today of the 1965 Act. 
    And in the 1965 Act, a provision under Section 203(a)(7), conditional entry, was admitted by this Court in Stevic to be the predecessor provision to the asylum provision which was now codified, and also to be a standard available under good reason to fear. 
    The agency itself has recognized that good reason to fear is a more lenient and more generous standard than the standard under withholding of deportations. 
    So far from being consistent, the Government now is taking a position which is inconsistent with that long historical development. 
    It evidences a confusion on the part of the agency, rather than consistency. 
    Congress when it codified the Refugee Act of 1980 specifically stated that its purpose was to revise and to regularize refugee admissions. 
    In doing that, it pointed out the kinds of relief that it was replacing. 
    That was Section 203(a)(7), the good reason to fear admissions, the Attorney General's general parole obligations, and also it did mention the regulatory asylum standards. 
    However, in his introduction on the Senate floor the sponsor of the bill, Senatory Kennedy, explicitly said present regulations and provisions do not, simply do not conform with the spirit or the provisions of the United Nations protocol. 
    That is clear. 
    That is clear legislative intent.

    Ms. Dana Marks Keener 
    I do not. 
    I felt my colleague stated my position very well, in essence, as he hypothesized how we would answer, that discretion has to be exercised on a case by case basis. 
    And any time that the Attorney General would promulgate a blanket rule in this kind of this case would most likely violate that case by case determination or exercise of discretion, and it would violate the clear intent of Congress. 
    The standard, again, was not delegated.

    The State Department now participates in evaluation of country conditions, which is a very important aspect of the asylum determination. 
    The Government is very involved in helping find whether someone's fear of return to a particular locale is in fact an objective fear. 
    And of course, there could be policies developed that assist the tryer of fact in evaluating that case. 
    From that perspective, it would be completely appropriate.

    Your response to that argument, your principal response in your brief, is no, it's not irrational because the standard for purposes of asylum is a discretionary one. 
    It just establishes the threshold and the Attorney General doesn't have to use it. 
    But now you're telling us he does indeed have to use it, unless he has some very special factor.

    Ms. Dana Marks Keener 
    I didn't mean to be saying that. 
    If that is what I was saying, then it's not correct. 
    It seems to me that the Attorney General cannot on a blanket situation say... he can say everyone from Afghanistan has a well-founded fear of persecution. 
    I think he would be abdicating his exercise of discretion to say everyone from Afghanistan will either be granted asylum or, maybe he'd say, will be denied asylum in the exercise of discretion. 
    But that's a factor to be analyzed on an individual case, as to whether there is a valid basis for the exercise of that discretion.

    --Because... and it was pointed out in Stevic quite clearly... by meeting the definition of refugee, someone who has a well-founded fear of persecution, that does not automatically require a grant of asylum. 
    That's in the Congressional history as well. 
    That's what discretion means, that although the statutory formulation is met, it is not required. 
    It's up to the Attorney... but that doesn't mean that the Attorney General can then have a wooden formulation of who's going to qualify and who is not, because that violates the intent of Congress. 
    The history of this provision shows that the Congress was very concerned with the unfettered discretion of the executive. 
    There is a very thorough law review article, Anker and Posner, that goes back on the history of various bills which were introduced into Congress which show that was precisely what Congress was attempting to circumscribe, the unfettered discretion and the lack of uniformity of refugee admissions.

    That seemed to be what Justice Scalia was interested in. 
    I feel uncomfortable in the sense of I don't think that's an issue raised by this case as well. 
    I feel the issue today is what the standard is and did Congress choose a standard. 
    And if Congress indicated a standard, how is it to be interpreted. 
    Congress specifically... the Government indicates in their brief also that Congress said the standard was to conform with the United Nations protocol. 
    We agree on that. 
    Whether the Government's interpretation conforms or not is the essence of our dispute here, okay.

speaker="dana_marks_keener" startTime="2404.925" stopTime="2606.636">
    Ms. Dana Marks Keener 
    The answer to that I believe is found also in Stevic, that because refugee admissions were not required our accession to the protocol back in 1967 did not affect our refugee admissions procedures. 
    The fatal flaw in the Government's argument that regulatory asylum should be adopted as the standard also goes back. 
    There was no standard for regulatory asylum in 1965. 
    In 1965, what Congress was talking about at that time, at the time of our accession, was the good reason to fear standard in the predecessory section of 203(a)(7), which is what we have been saying over and over and over. 
    That's what the legislative history shows, and the Government has never come up with an answer as to why the specific standard for regulatory asylum which they finally set forth in the 1979 regulations, that standard was expressly rejected by Congress in its actions. 
    And the Government has never come up for a justification how to avoid Congress' clear intent. 
    In interpreting legislative history, again, it's a canon of construction that the court does not lightly disregard what Congress has considered and explicitly refused to do. 
    The Government, yes, they proposed a formulation of the bill and that formulation, which would have said in essence that if someone qualifies for, show a clear probability of persecution, then they are eligible for asylum. 
    Congress took that cut. 
    Congress said if someone is a refugee. 
    And the other major flaw in the Government's argument, that they have never responded to in their briefs or in their argument today, is about the fact that there's another asylum provision, another refugee admissions provision that they are failing to discuss. 
    And that's Section 207. 
    Section 208, which is the issue in this case, and Section 207 both go back to a definitional section in 101(a)(42). 
    That is where "refugee" is defined. 
    That is where the well-founded fear language comes from. 
    It does not apply, as this Court pointed cut in its textual analysis in Stevic. 
    That well-founded fear of persecution does not apply to the withholding of deportation provisions. 
    It does not mention it, it is not referred to, nor is the language comparable. 
    And the Government has never explained how it's going to apply two different statements to refugees. 
    That is far more anomalous and far more unworkable than what we are proposing to do here today. 
    The Government is going to treat refugees who are currently in Afghanistan differently from those who are at the United States borders. 
    And that again was explicitly discussed in the legislative history. 
    It was that lack of uniformity of procedures that Congress was hoping to address, was planning to address, and specifically did address. 
    And that's what the Government seeks to ignore. 
    Another major flaw in the deference argument is the fact that the agency's interpretation which it relies so heavily on, the decision in Dunar, is sheer dicta. 
    Dunar was a case very much like Stevic, which simply held that accession to the United States... United Nations protocol did not alter the standard under Section 243(h), and any further discussion was dicta, and I think that's an important factor to remember.

    If you can handle torture you wouldn't be applying for asylum, all kidding aside.

    That's not a person who would convince a tryer of fact that they do have a genuine, well-founded fear. 
    But the way to determine whether or not somebody qualifies for the well-founded fear standard... you're not alone without support as to how to make that decision. 
    There's a United Nations handbookk which is the compilation of 30 years of experience of various factors. 
    And in fact, in a letter from the Assistant Attorney General Olson to the General Counsel of the Immigration Service which is part of the record of the 1981 House Judiciary Committee oversight hearings, it was specifically said that that's an appropriate aid to construction. 
    We assume that Congress was aware of the criteria articulated in the handbook. 
    That United Nations handbook is of course an invaluable aid to construction. 
    But the courts have already used the handbook and applied it.

    I don't know the basis for his remarks, I am sorry. 
    The point is, the Court has applied the standard and it has not found it to be a difficult to apply standard. 
    The courts have come out and said mere assertions of a possible fear are not enough; a genuine fear of widespread violence, of civil strife, that's not enough. 
    What the courts have said is a specific factual proof of an objective situation which demonstrates that persecution is a reasonable possibility. 
    I would submit if the chances of persecution are one in a thousand it's not a reasonable possibility that you would be persecuted.

    The focus on probability takes out of consideration the focus on subjective feelings and beliefs which is a critical element in the refugee status definition because of the fact that it recognizes the everyday realities of refugees proving their cases.

    Because likelihood implies probability, and in fact in the history of the Immigration Act realistic likelihood has teen a synonym for clear probability or more likely than not. 
    It does not... has never been associated with the good reason to fear standard. 
    And that good reason to fear standard, as I mentioned before, has been applied successfully by the Attorney General through his delegates since 1948. 
    It's not a difficult standard to apply. 
    It implies a lesser degree of certainty, and a judge can figure cut what that means. 
    Again, the individual facts of on individual case, based on who the applicant is, based on where he's going to be returned to, based on all kinds of factors, of course come into play and certainly would influence a decision.

    --is not a reasoned... it's not a reasonable possibility that I will be one in a thousand. 
    That's my fear. 
    If a judge feels that that's reasonable or a tryer of fact, that's also... that's his decision to make. 
    But there are aids to construction. 
    There is an established history of applying this term. 
    And it simply is the agency's recalcitrance in recognizing that Congress wanted a different standard, and there seems that there is no basis to honor their interpretation which so clearly flies in the face of unequivocal Congressional intent.

    That's our main point. 
    And in footnote 14 of our reply brief, and this is on page 11 of our reply brief, we pointed out that the House report explicitly said at the time of the 1980 Act that the asylum provision was to provide a statutory basis for the part 108 regulatory asylum policy, not to provide a statutory basis to replace the old 203(a)(7) or the other earlier statutes. 
    And that was the policy that in the 1979 regulations said that the asylum standard was the same as the standard for the withholding of deportation.

    Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace 
    That is correct, that is correct. 
    Now, I also want to point out to the Court that in its decision in Immigration and Naturalization Service against Jong How Wang, 450 U.S. 139, the Court deferred to the INS', to the Board's interpretation of a statutory term, 244 of the Immigration and Naturalization Act... Nationality Act. 
    And it not only deferred to the interpretation, but deferred to a categorical interpretation, that the Board was entitled to take the position that a mere showing of economic detriment is not sufficient to show extreme hardship within the meaning of that statutory provision. 
    And the last point I wish to make is that the mere fact that a reference is made in our statute to a term in the international protocol does not mean that this case presents a question of international law. 
    It does not involve an international obligation. 
    The only international obligation is the withholding of deportation obligation, and non-referralment which was before the Court in Stevic. 
    This is a question of asylum, which is not required by international law, and the question is what did Congress mean by using the term in our domestic law. 
    We have shown in the latter part of our reply brief that there is in any event no uniform practice among other countries bound by the protocol to interpret the protocol more generously in their own practice than we do. 
    This is... we have gone through in case by case, but it's also shown in an aggregate way by the statistics in footnote 25 on page 19 of our brief, because the fact is, as those show, in both 1984 and 1985 the United States provided a haven for more refugees and asylees, using our standard, than were accommodated in all of Europe and Canada combined, which certainly--
