Edwards v. Aguillard

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    We will hear arguments first this morning in No. 85-1513, Edwards against Aguillard. 
    Mr. Bird, you may proceed whenever you're ready.
speaker="wendell_r_bird" startTime="17.610" stopTime="100.497">
    Mr. Wendell R. Bird 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    This case is an appeal from an 8-7 decision of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. 
    It involves a facial Constitutional challenge to Louisiana's law for balanced treatment of creation science and evolution in public schools. 
    That law defines evolution as scientific evidences supporting evolution, and inferences from those scientific evidences. 
    In parallel, it defines creation science as scientific evidences supporting creation, and inferences from those scientific evidences. 
    The State today hopes to address two key questions: first, the procedural question of the material factual issues, and particularly, the uncontroverted affidavits, which must be addressed in order to apply the tripart test, and which preclude summary judgment; and then, second, the Constitutional question, particularly of the abundant evidence in the record of a secular purpose, although not an exclusively secular purpose, we concede. 
    I'll mention the relevant facts in connection with each of these two major issues. 
    The first major question is the procedural question which the State believes should be decisive. 
    The decision under review contradicts the unquestioned procedural rule for summary judgment regarding uncontradicted affidavits and material factual issues, as the seven dissenting judges acknowledged. 
    The uncontroverted factual issues of the State--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="100.497" stopTime="102.449">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, this wasn't really an en banc decision, was it?
speaker="wendell_r_bird" startTime="102.449" stopTime="119.874">
    Mr. Wendell R. Bird 
    --No, sir, it wasn't. 
    It was denial of rehearing en banc. 
    And in fact, the eight judge majority did not enter a written opinion. 
    It simply affirmed; in effect, denied rehearing of the three-judge opinion. 
    Seven judges disagreed very strongly. 
    The uncontroverted affidavits--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="119.874" stopTime="122.843">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Of course, they just said the case should be reheard en banc.
speaker="wendell_r_bird" startTime="122.843" stopTime="125.895">
    Mr. Wendell R. Bird 
    --Yes. 
    Yes, Your Honor, that's correct.
speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="125.895" stopTime="132.134">
    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    Disagreers always disagree very strongly. 
    [Laughter]
speaker="wendell_r_bird" startTime="132.134" stopTime="178.830">
    Mr. Wendell R. Bird 
    And in this case, they certainly upheld that tradition. 
    The uncontroverted affidavits of the State on factual issues erroneously were not taken as true or admitted for purposes of summary judgment and appeal. 
    The other factual issues raised by the State in its Brandeis memorandum of 630 pages, with nearly 2,000 citations, were not viewed in the most favorable light, like the affidavits, and in fact, were hardly given credence at all. 
    They certainly weren't accepted as true for purposes of summary judgment. 
    The facts in regard to this procedural issue are that the State filed affidavits by creationist and evolutionist scientists; by a creationist philosopher; an evolutionist theologian; and a creationist educator. 
    They were not only Protestants, but two Roman Catholics and one agnostic.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="178.830" stopTime="183.484">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Mr. Bird, what would you say was the factual issue that had to be resolved?
speaker="wendell_r_bird" startTime="183.484" stopTime="188.887">
    Mr. Wendell R. Bird 
    Your Honor, the definition of creation science is one very important factual issue, what the statute's about.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="188.887" stopTime="190.787">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    You don't think the statute defines the term adequately?
speaker="wendell_r_bird" startTime="190.787" stopTime="199.076">
    Mr. Wendell R. Bird 
    Well, Your Honor, it does give a definition that's highly scientific, and referring only to scientific evidences, and inferences from those scientific evidences.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="199.076" stopTime="203.230">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    But the factual issue was, what does... what does the statutory term mean, is that what it is?
speaker="wendell_r_bird" startTime="203.230" stopTime="206.016">
    Mr. Wendell R. Bird 
    Yes, sir. 
    A very important factual issue in order--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="206.016" stopTime="209.468">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    And these people, who had nothing to do with enacting the statute, are able to tell us what the statute means?
speaker="wendell_r_bird" startTime="209.468" stopTime="239.570">
    Mr. Wendell R. Bird 
    --Because it is bringing a term from a technical term into a statute, yes, Your Honor, much like in some of the technical regulatory statutes that might take a term of art from another field without attempting to give a plenary definition in the statute. 
    And besides the definition, another factual issue is the religious... the nonreligious nature of that scientific evidence supporting creation. 
    And a third factual issue, the scientific nature of creation science as compared with evolution.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="239.570" stopTime="260.750">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Why is the meaning of the statute a factual issue? 
    I would think that that's a legal issue. 
    And indeed, haven't we in earlier cases abstained from passing on the Constitutionality of statutes until the State courts could tell us what their own statute meant? 
    Isn't the meaning of it ultimately a question of Louisiana law for the Louisiana courts?
speaker="wendell_r_bird" startTime="260.750" stopTime="282.932">
    Mr. Wendell R. Bird 
    Your Honor, taking those questions in reverse, the Louisiana Supreme Court has reviewed this statute on different grounds, and has upheld it under applicable provisions of the Louisiana Constitution regarding prescribing curriculum. 
    It did not see fit to give a definition of creation science, or even to indicate that it regarded that as within its prerogatives. 
    I'd suggest--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="282.932" stopTime="288.836">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    As within its prerogative? 
    Within whose prerogatives would it be, if not within the prerogatives of the Louisiana Supreme Court?
speaker="wendell_r_bird" startTime="288.836" stopTime="324.426">
    Mr. Wendell R. Bird 
    --Because a term that is a technical term, a term used within the scientific field, was being embodied in the statute, the State submits, Your Honor, that the definition of that term is a factual matter, appropriate for resolution by expert testimony on that field, much like if the State had regulated some particular form of, say, asbestos contamination, or whatever, and had used technical terms of art. 
    It wouldn't be an issue of State law as to what they meant, when the intent was to bring in a technical definition from the relevant academic field.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="324.426" stopTime="333.782">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    So if we, as a Federal court, say that the Louisiana statute means X, the Louisiana Supreme Court couldn't say, no, it doesn't mean X, it means Y?
speaker="wendell_r_bird" startTime="333.782" stopTime="348.891">
    Mr. Wendell R. Bird 
    Well, Your Honor, I would suggest, in the context of the procedural issue, that this Court should not be saying, the statute means X, but instead, should allow the case to go to trial, a trial it's never had, in order to develop a factual record on that issue.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="348.891" stopTime="356.028">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    In order that we can say whether it means X. 
    I mean, ultimately, you want us to say whether it means X or Y. 
    And why is that our business rather than the Louisiana courts?
speaker="wendell_r_bird" startTime="356.028" stopTime="370.888">
    Mr. Wendell R. Bird 
    Your Honor, with all respect, what we would like you to say is that this Court should not have to say whether it means X or Y, but that a trial, with factual development, ought to occur to enable expert witnesses on both sides to give definitions.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="370.888" stopTime="376.359">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    After which... after which a Federal court will say whether it means X or Y. 
    Isn't that what you're saying?
speaker="wendell_r_bird" startTime="376.359" stopTime="378.228">
    Mr. Wendell R. Bird 
    Not quite, Your Honor, because a Federal court--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="378.228" stopTime="381.780">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    You're just quarreling that it was done too soon; not that it shouldn't be done by Federal courts.
speaker="wendell_r_bird" startTime="381.780" stopTime="382.680">
    Mr. Wendell R. Bird 
    --Your Honor, I'm suggesting--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="382.680" stopTime="383.565">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    And I'm questioning whether--
speaker="wendell_r_bird" startTime="383.565" stopTime="430.378">
    Mr. Wendell R. Bird 
    --that the only thing a Federal court ought to do is review whether the factual determination by the trial court, after a trial, is clearly erroneous. 
    This Court, in Lynch v. Donnelly, used the clearly erroneous standard in reviewing district court findings. 
    And in fact, the dissenting opinion did the same thing in footnote 11, recognizing the heavily factual issue of many issues of that nature. 
    The role of this Court, the State would suggest, is not to determine, as the two lower courts did, out of thin air, what a technical term means, but to recognize that that is a factual issue, or at least involved factual issues that this Court is entitled to a trial record on before this Court is asked to apply the clearly erroneous standard.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="430.378" stopTime="437.282">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    --What if Louisiana chooses to use a technical term in an inaccurate sense? 
    Can it do that if it wants to?
speaker="wendell_r_bird" startTime="437.282" stopTime="440.568">
    Mr. Wendell R. Bird 
    A State certainly could use a term and define it differently.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="440.568" stopTime="450.324">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Of course it could. 
    And isn't it up to Louisiana State court to say whether it's using a technical term accurately or inaccurately? 
    It could use that term any way it wants, couldn't it?
speaker="wendell_r_bird" startTime="450.324" stopTime="478.693">
    Mr. Wendell R. Bird 
    Your Honor, recognizing the correctness of your point about State interpretations of terms that have a... have a State law background behind them, the term in this statute was a term borrowed from a technical field. 
    And it's our suggestion that the trier of fact, at the trial court level, can correctly determine the meaning of that term, based on the legislative history and expert testimony, whether that trier of fact is a State court or a Federal court.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="478.693" stopTime="500.090">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well, Mr. Bird, I understood the opinion of the Fifth Circuit, from which you're appealing, to say that the statute was unconstitutional because it had no secular purpose, and it failed that part of the so-called Lemon test. 
    Is it really necessary to get into all this meaning of technical terms in order to review that what seems to be a rather narrow ruling of the Fifth Circuit?
speaker="wendell_r_bird" startTime="500.090" stopTime="535.946">
    Mr. Wendell R. Bird 
    Well, Your Honor, first, I think it's very important to notice that the Fifth Circuit and the District Court did not rely at all on the legislative history in reaching that determination. 
    They instead said, effectively by judicial notice we submit, creation science means X. 
    It means religious doctrine including a creator. 
    Not based on any factual evidence in the record, but just a priori. 
    And consequently, those courts were not even applying the purpose prong of the establishment clause test in the way that this Court has indicated it should be applied.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="535.946" stopTime="562.347">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Well, Mr. Bird, if we were to do that here, wouldn't we just look at the legislative history and the stated purpose of the legislature in making that determination? 
    Why would we have to perpetuate the alleged error you think was made below? 
    Why couldn't we look at the record here and determine whether the court was correct in its decision on the purpose prong of the Lemon test?
speaker="wendell_r_bird" startTime="562.347" stopTime="703.521">
    Mr. Wendell R. Bird 
    Your Honor, that might be possible given two caveats. 
    The first is that the legislative history does involve technical terms of science, not only terms such as creation science and creation and their meaning, but also terms about mathematical probability, paleontology, and so forth. 
    This Court could assume that all of the State's allegations are correct on those factual issues, and in that context, could interpret the legislative history, including those terms. 
    Now, the appellees are also arguing that the social context is relevant to a determination of legislative purpose. 
    We do disagree with that, particularly where there is a clear legislative history and where there is a clear statute. 
    However, addressing the social context involves questions of history which similarly are factual issues. 
    My second caveat is, if this Court were to apply the purpose prong of the tripartite test, ab initio, it again ought to determine all historical, factual type questions in the light most favorable to the State, just as it should the definitional questions. 
    In that sense, it might be possible for this Court to reach a purpose determination based on a full review of the record. 
    I'd urge the Court not to do so. 
    Because certainly for effect and entanglement, the definitions of terms are highly critical. 
    But if the Court did so, I... I would urge this Court to give the kind of full review of the legislative history I know it would. 
    We have, for the convenience of the Court, in our reply brief, footnotes 56a to 56c, cited some of the most important portions of the legislative history on the purpose to advance academic freedom, students right to hear, by teaching additional scientific information, a nonreligious information. 
    It's critical that the legislative history be read in context. 
    It's also critical that the standard applied by this Court, at all times in the past for purpose review, be applied; that it is not necessary to have an exclusively secular purpose; but instead, it is sufficient to have a secular purpose. 
    In fact, I think the legislative history in this case indicates a primary secular purpose, although the State does recognize that there are tertiary religious purposes indicated in the record. 
    We would suggest that the appellees highly selective--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="703.521" stopTime="707.825">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    What are those religious that you acknowledge are indicated in the record?
speaker="wendell_r_bird" startTime="707.825" stopTime="714.996">
    Mr. Wendell R. Bird 
    --Your Honor, we'd suggest that the legislative history indicates that there were a variety of reasons for this Act being passed.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="714.996" stopTime="719.465">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    No, I just asked you what were the religious purposes that are... that you acknowledge are present.
speaker="wendell_r_bird" startTime="719.465" stopTime="721.834">
    Mr. Wendell R. Bird 
    As a tertiary purpose only, not as the primary--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="721.834" stopTime="722.301">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    I understand.
speaker="wendell_r_bird" startTime="722.301" stopTime="748.735">
    Mr. Wendell R. Bird 
    --or even the secondary purpose, we'd recognize that, doubtless, some legislators had a desire to teach religious doctrine in the classroom. 
    We feel that was a small minority of the legislators, as indicated by the record. 
    But certainly there's no question that in this mixture of many different purposes that would certainly be a tertiary or less important purpose, along with basic concepts of fairness; the academic freedom concern of students' right to receive--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="748.735" stopTime="754.389">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Do you think there was also a purpose... do you think there was also a purpose to exclude the teaching of evolutionary science, or whatever you might call it?
speaker="wendell_r_bird" startTime="754.389" stopTime="757.056">
    Mr. Wendell R. Bird 
    --No, sir, I don't. 
    It is true that there are--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="757.056" stopTime="761.309">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    So to the extent that there's a religious purpose, it's to add to the curriculum, rather than to subtract from it?
speaker="wendell_r_bird" startTime="761.309" stopTime="791.896">
    Mr. Wendell R. Bird 
    --Yes, sir. 
    And if that were the case, I'd suggest that the courts could properly address any... that issue if they... if they saw that issue being a sufficiently significant purpose, simply by stating what the State agrees wholeheartedly with, that the teaching of the Bible, as part of implementing this statute, would be unconstitutional. 
    The State has consistently taken the position that that, in a science classroom, would not be appropriate under the Constitution or under the statute.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="791.896" stopTime="808.607">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Mr. Bird, do you think that it is Constitutional within the establishment clause to teach a purely religious concept in public school in order to balance other concepts that are perceived to be anti-religious?
speaker="wendell_r_bird" startTime="808.607" stopTime="812.242">
    Mr. Wendell R. Bird 
    Your Honor, not in this case, and not in the general case.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="812.242" stopTime="814.408">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Well, in general, I asked.
speaker="wendell_r_bird" startTime="814.408" stopTime="814.758">
    Mr. Wendell R. Bird 
    Yes, Your Honor.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="814.758" stopTime="816.694">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    In general. 
    Is that... is that valid?
speaker="wendell_r_bird" startTime="816.694" stopTime="817.127">
    Mr. Wendell R. Bird 
    No.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="817.127" stopTime="817.594">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    No?
speaker="wendell_r_bird" startTime="817.594" stopTime="847.613">
    Mr. Wendell R. Bird 
    Only in the limited context this Court has recognized in Shemp and other decisions of an objective, neutral discussions of a wide variety of religious views. 
    We don't believe that that is even applicable to this case. 
    The State has consistently taken the position that to teach religious doctrine would not only violate the establishment clause in science classes, but would violate the terms of the statute. 
    It's critical, as many of the questions, I believe, reflect, to know what creation science is. 
    We--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="847.613" stopTime="868.329">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Mr. Bird, before you go further, you acknowledge before that a purpose was... tertiary purpose on the part of some legislators was to teach religious doctrine. 
    Assuming I think that only a purpose that is effectuated in the statute is relevant, do you acknowledge that that purpose is effectuated in the statute?
speaker="wendell_r_bird" startTime="868.329" stopTime="892.877">
    Mr. Wendell R. Bird 
    --Absolutely not. 
    The statute itself refers to scientific evidence. 
    The affidavits, established for purposes of this appeal, that creation science consists of scientific evidence and scientific interpretations. 
    The State's Brandeis memorandum, in fact, cites 170 pages of that scientific evidence in defining creation science and its content.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="892.877" stopTime="906.002">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Does it necessarily require the teaching of a God, a personal God, as opposed to a first cause that may be quite impersonal, or a giant slug, for all we know?
speaker="wendell_r_bird" startTime="906.002" stopTime="965.456">
    Mr. Wendell R. Bird 
    Your Honor, teaching creation science does not entail, necessarily, the teaching of any of those concepts. 
    In other words, with creation science consisting of scientific evidence, such as the abrupt appearance of complex life in the fossil record, the systematic gaps between fossil categories, the mathematical improbability of evolution, the vast information content of all living forms, the genetic limits of viable change... in none of that is there any concept of a creator, and certainly no concept of Genesis. 
    That is scientific data. 
    As you'll find summarized in the Joint Appendix from our long memorandum, pages G66 to 168, 356 to 87, 457 to 90. 
    In fact, the term "creation" is used in much scientific discussion without any reference to a creator. 
    The Big Bang theory is often described as a theory of creation, without necessarily having any concept of a creator embodied in it.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="965.456" stopTime="966.575">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Well, that may or may not be so.
speaker="wendell_r_bird" startTime="966.575" stopTime="967.575">
    Mr. Wendell R. Bird 
    It's a factual issue.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="967.575" stopTime="977.114">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Either a factual issue or an issue of law to be decided by some court. 
    It depends on what creation in the statute means, doesn't it?
speaker="wendell_r_bird" startTime="977.114" stopTime="983.870">
    Mr. Wendell R. Bird 
    Yes, sir, it does.

    Eastern religions. 
    Philosophy of religion.

    And I think this Court has recognized, because of the different maturity level, the different critical thinking level of students at the upper... at the university and college level, that a far broader variety of courses of the type that you've just described would be generally permissible at the university level.

speaker="wendell_r_bird" startTime="1096.460" stopTime="1102.614">

    This would include elementary schools to the extent they're teaching anything about origins today.

    Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. 
    It's curious, or so it seems to me, that the statute is very explicit in requiring that, with respect to everything that goes on in the classroom, in the textbooks, in the libraries, and in all instructional matters, that this statute has to be complied with. 
    How in the world can that be monitored?
speaker="wendell_r_bird" startTime="1126.162" stopTime="1139.906">
    Mr. Wendell R. Bird 
    Well, Your Honor, this Court has charged public schools with keeping impermissible religious material out of the classrooms already. 
    And in terms of that monitoring, first, you mentioned textbooks. 
    This Court has upheld--
speaker="lewis_f_powell_jr" startTime="1139.906" stopTime="1141.256">
    Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. 
    You can monitor a textbook.
speaker="wendell_r_bird" startTime="1141.256" stopTime="1158.950">
    Mr. Wendell R. Bird 
    --Yes, sir. 
    Board of Education v. Allen, Mueller, and so forth. 
    This Court, in the Regan decision, made much the same point regarding the classroom teaching, particularly when we're talking about a public school teacher. 
    We don't have any issue, as in cases from the last term--
speaker="lewis_f_powell_jr" startTime="1158.950" stopTime="1161.652">
    Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. 
    Would you have to have monitors in every classroom?
speaker="wendell_r_bird" startTime="1161.652" stopTime="1258.697">
    Mr. Wendell R. Bird 
    --Your Honor, certainly not. 
    Because this Court does assume the good faith of teachers. 
    This Court has said that it will not assume bad faith of teachers. 
    Moreover, any religious material that could impermissibly enter the science classroom, based on the teaching of creation science, already could enter that classroom based on the teaching of evolution. 
    For instance, the question, who created, or who began, the evolutionary process? 
    Where did the Big Bang come from? 
    What guided the evolutionary process? 
    And it's to be presumed... certainly there's no evidence to the contrary in this case, because we haven't even been to trial yet... that teachers will not do that which is impermissible. 
    If they do, the Attorney General does have enforcement authority under the Louisiana Constitution, and has stated his intent to ensure that only scientific evidence is taught, as the statute refers to, and not that any impermissible religious material is taught, particularly Genesis, in teaching the balanced treatment. 
    That would be impermissible. 
    The definition of creation science is critical. 
    And even opponents of creation science in some cases have acknowledge that creation science is scientific material; not religious material. 
    For instance, one of the affidavits establishing the issue for purposes of summary judgment and appeal, said, by Dr. W. Scott Morrow, I'm not a creationist or a religious fundamentalist, and instead, am an evolutionist and an agnostic... our brief at page 19. 
    My conclusions are that creation science is scientific, nonreligious, and educationally worthwhile.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1258.697" stopTime="1278.241">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Mr. Bird, can I ask you, you gave an example a moment ago of a Big Bang theory to mention the evolutionary process. 
    Supposing there was a Big Bang a million years ago that created much of what we know on the Earth, but... everything except man. 
    And then after that, there was evolution to what we now know as man. 
    Would a person who believed that be a evolutionist or a creation scientist?
speaker="wendell_r_bird" startTime="1278.241" stopTime="1286.031">
    Mr. Wendell R. Bird 
    That would really depend on their own categorization. 
    Because you have identified an issue where there is a difference, even among those scientists--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1286.031" stopTime="1294.970">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Well, I mean, it seems to me some people might be a creationist within your definition at a certain point, but then believe that evolution followed that beginning moment.
speaker="wendell_r_bird" startTime="1294.970" stopTime="1295.287">
    Mr. Wendell R. Bird 
    --Yes, sir.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1295.287" stopTime="1296.905">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    And I'm just wondering how you classify that person.
speaker="wendell_r_bird" startTime="1296.905" stopTime="1307.028">
    Mr. Wendell R. Bird 
    There's certainly no question that some people would take elements of what the statute envisions as creation science and combine those with elements of evolution. 
    That's their right. 
    The fact that two--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1307.028" stopTime="1313.415">
    Justice John Paul Stevens

    Mr. Wendell R. Bird 
    --Well, Your Honor, we have taken the position that the Big Bang theory would be an evolutionary explanation of cosmic evolution, as described by Carl Sagan and others.

    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Well, can you tell me which theory... which category my example falls under?
speaker="wendell_r_bird" startTime="1338.816" stopTime="1342.701">
    Mr. Wendell R. Bird 
    Probably the evolutionary category, though some people would differ.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1342.701" stopTime="1355.409">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Well, what if the... what if I included, say, Neanderthal, and then... but say that it was a lower form of life than present man? 
    Would it still be... then would that be a creationist or an evolutionist?
speaker="wendell_r_bird" startTime="1355.409" stopTime="1374.155">
    Mr. Wendell R. Bird 
    That would probably be categorized as an evolutionist view, with the creationist scientists at trial anticipating testimony that Neanderthal man certainly existed, but that the physical evidence is that it was simply someone comparable to modern humans with bone disease, causing a bowing of the bones.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1374.155" stopTime="1381.226">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    All of your examples of people who are creation scientists would deny any evolutionary process at all?

    Mr. Wendell R. Bird 
    No, Your Honor. 
    Our expert witnesses include, of course, some evolutionists, who would anticipate testifying at trial, along the lines of Dr. Morrow, who I quoted. 
    Some would take sort of an intermediate position, saying that they're either not sure or--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1395.485" stopTime="1403.924">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Well, how can they... if they're mutually exclusive categories, how can there be an intermediate position? 
    And if there can't be, I really don't quite understand what the dividing line between the two is.
speaker="wendell_r_bird" startTime="1403.924" stopTime="1423.672">
    Mr. Wendell R. Bird 
    --Your Honor, I guess my point, to try to say it more clearly, is that many evolutionists do recognize creation science and evolution as mutually exclusive on each issue, as a logical matter. 
    Some people disagree. 
    That's an area where the scientific community does appear to disagree.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1423.672" stopTime="1428.874">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Well, but do you have a position? 
    Do the people supporting this legislation say it draws such a distinction?
speaker="wendell_r_bird" startTime="1428.874" stopTime="1436.580">
    Mr. Wendell R. Bird 
    Yes, Your Honor, we... the State has taken the position consistently that creation science and evolution do reflect two separate positions--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1436.580" stopTime="1441.883">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Mutually exclusive positions, and if there's any evolution at all, then you're in the evolutionary category?
speaker="wendell_r_bird" startTime="1441.883" stopTime="1472.067">
    Mr. Wendell R. Bird 
    --Well, if you define evolution as being macroevolutionary change, yes. 
    But creation scientists recognize the occurrence of change; microevolution, without any question. 
    So to say that change occurs certainly is not an evolutionary statement. 
    It's a statement that essentially every scientist on either side would agree to. 
    The question is whether evolution occurred from one or a few simple single-celled living forms, through fish, amphibia, reptiles, primates, and so forth.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1472.067" stopTime="1476.871">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Well, if that's the test, your answer to my question is easy. 
    The example that I gave is that you're a creationist.
speaker="wendell_r_bird" startTime="1476.871" stopTime="1480.073">
    Mr. Wendell R. Bird 
    Yes, Your Honor, I suppose so.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1480.073" stopTime="1486.560">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Even though there's a very definite process of evolution from the Neanderthal man to the present society.
speaker="wendell_r_bird" startTime="1486.560" stopTime="1489.762">
    Mr. Wendell R. Bird 
    And that's an area of disputed fact. 
    Scientists disagree--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1489.762" stopTime="1500.486">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Well, but I mean, even if one believed that, he would still be a creationist under your definition, because he doesn't believe everything started from an amoeba, or something like that.
speaker="wendell_r_bird" startTime="1500.486" stopTime="1506.890">
    Mr. Wendell R. Bird 
    --He'd certainly be taking at least many creationist assumptions and interpretations of the evidence, yes.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1506.890" stopTime="1519.782">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Well, see, the difficulty I have is when you talk about many and some is, I'm trying to decide whether they are mutually exclusive categories or not, and whether teachers who have to administer this Act fall in one camp or the other, or could they fall in both.
speaker="wendell_r_bird" startTime="1519.782" stopTime="1554.538">
    Mr. Wendell R. Bird 
    A teacher could certainly fall in both. 
    The evidence can be categorized without coercing any student to accept only one or the other. 
    Just as logical matter, the universe either always existed or came into being abruptly, the first life either came into being abruptly or evolved through a chemical evolutionary process. 
    The various living forms, the basic forms, either appeared abruptly or evolved from simple to complex. 
    In that sense, they're logical alternatives. 
    But people certainly have the right, which Louisiana schools ought to respect, to accept elements of both.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1554.538" stopTime="1560.809">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Isn't it possible that some of the appeared abruptly, and others evolved from what first appeared abruptly? 
    That's what I don't understand.
speaker="wendell_r_bird" startTime="1560.809" stopTime="1562.893">
    Mr. Wendell R. Bird 
    I'm afraid I didn't hear the end of that, Your Honor.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1562.893" stopTime="1570.214">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    I say, is it not possible that some forms of life appeared abruptly, and others evolved from those that did appear abruptly?
speaker="wendell_r_bird" startTime="1570.214" stopTime="1572.599">
    Mr. Wendell R. Bird 
    Absolutely. 
    And I guess the basic point--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1572.599" stopTime="1580.205">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    And if that's true, I don't see how you can avoid the possibility that a person could be both an evolutionist and a creation scientist.
speaker="wendell_r_bird" startTime="1580.205" stopTime="1608.505">
    Mr. Wendell R. Bird 
    --Well, many people do combine elements of both, and in that sense, fit your categorization. 
    I guess the point is that the Louisiana legislature determined that students were not receiving all of the scientific information on the subject. 
    They were receiving, in general, only that which supported evolution; and that those students were entitled to receive additional scientific information, however those students chose to categorize. 
    That's the issue in this case, when we get into the Constitutional question.

    Mr. Jay Topkis 
    Mr. Chief Justice, if the Court please: 
    Mr. Bird was complaining at some length about how the Court of Appeals ignored the legislative history. 
    I'm perfectly content to discuss the legislative history, but I'd like to take as my starting point Justice Frankfurter's dictum that when there's some uncertainty about the legislative history, it's not forbidden to look at the plain language of the statute. 
    [Laughter] 
    What's all this talk about technical terms? 
    These are not polysyllabic scientific words beginning with polymicro-something-or-another. 
    These are words that we've all heard since we were kids. 
    Creation. 
    Creation... that's a word we're all familiar with.

    Yes.

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Academic credentials. 
    Which said creation... Ph.D. in biochemistry from the University of North Carolina, M.S., St. Joseph College. 
    Creation science, he said, is a scientific model or hypothesis that attempts to account for the origins of material entities or systems in our world by means of their relatively sudden or abrupt appearance. 
    Now, that is really not the way I would be inclined to define it. 
    But I don't know. 
    I'm not a biochemist. 
    Now, here you have an affidavit that's filed in the case that says it means that. 
    How can I be sure that it doesn't mean that?

    Mr. Jay Topkis 
    Well, Your Honor, this litigation was brought in the Federal court. 
    And because that's the court to which citizens traditionally look for protection of their Constitutional liberties. 
    But going directly to your question, Dr. Morrow comes along, years after the statute is enacted, and says that to him, creation science means these buzzwords. 
    And those buzzwords come right out of Mr. Bird's lexicon. 
    He's been using them for years. 
    They're his. 
    The Louisiana legislature never heard anything about abrupt, relatively sudden, or abrupt appearance in complex form, et cetera, et cetera.

speaker="jay_topkis" startTime="1840.422" stopTime="1916.139">
    Mr. Jay Topkis 
    I am. 
    I'm talking about what the word "creation" means, according to Webster. 
    And that, it seems to me, is what in all likelihood the Louisiana legislature dealt with. 
    And what the word means, according to Webster, is, the act of bringing into existence, from nothing, the universe or the world or the living and nonliving things in it. 
    Now, the statute, of course, also uses the term "creationism". 
    And Webster defines that, too: A doctrine or theory of creation holding that matter, the various forms of life and the world were created by a transcendent God out of nothing. 
    That's what Webster's Third, published in 1981, the year this statute was adopted, gave as the definitions of these two key words. 
    Now, maybe that was a little ahead of its time. 
    Let's go to Webster's Second. 
    No great difference. 
    Webster's Second, published in '34, defines "creation": The act of creating or the fact of being created; specifically, the act of causing to exist or the fact of being brought into existence by divine power, or its equivalent. 
    Creationism--

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    What about Aristotle's view of a first cause, an unmoved mover?
speaker="jay_topkis" startTime="1922.743" stopTime="1923.293">
    Mr. Jay Topkis 
    --Yes, Your Honor.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="1923.293" stopTime="1934.967">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Would that be a creationist view? 
    I don't think Aristotle considered himself as theologian as opposed to a philosopher.
speaker="jay_topkis" startTime="1934.967" stopTime="1936.169">
    Mr. Jay Topkis 
    No, but--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="1936.169" stopTime="1937.219">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    In fact, he probably considered himself a scientist.
speaker="jay_topkis" startTime="1937.219" stopTime="1939.971">
    Mr. Jay Topkis 
    --Acquinas had a somewhat similar view.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="1939.971" stopTime="1950.393">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Yes, but I want to go back earlier. 
    [Laughter] 
    Because my next question is going to be whether you considered Aristotleanism a religion?
speaker="jay_topkis" startTime="1950.393" stopTime="1952.012">
    Mr. Jay Topkis 
    Of course not.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="1952.012" stopTime="1965.939">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Well, then, you could believe in a first cause, an unmoved mover, that may be impersonal, and has no obligation of obedience or veneration from men, and in fact, doesn't care what's happening to mankind.
speaker="jay_topkis" startTime="1965.939" stopTime="1966.672">
    Mr. Jay Topkis 
    Right.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="1966.672" stopTime="1969.557">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    And believe in creation.
speaker="jay_topkis" startTime="1969.557" stopTime="1978.896">
    Mr. Jay Topkis 
    Well, believe in creation? 
    Not when creation means creation by a divine creator. 
    That's the test. 
    And the Louisiana--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="1978.896" stopTime="1985.933">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    And I ask you, it depends on what you mean by divine. 
    If all you mean is a first cause, an impersonal mover--
speaker="jay_topkis" startTime="1985.933" stopTime="1991.320">
    Mr. Jay Topkis 
    --Divine, Your Honor, has connotations beyond, I respectfully submit.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="1991.320" stopTime="1992.756">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    --But the statute doesn't say "divine".
speaker="jay_topkis" startTime="1992.756" stopTime="1993.156">
    Mr. Jay Topkis 
    No.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="1993.156" stopTime="1993.739">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    All it says is "creation".
speaker="jay_topkis" startTime="1993.739" stopTime="2026.143">
    Mr. Jay Topkis 
    But when you look to see what "creation" means, it means "divine". 
    And, I go further, if I may, the Louisiana legislature has been perfectly clear on what words mean in Louisiana. 
    The Louisiana Civil Code, Article XIV, says that the words of a law are generally to be understood in their most usual significance, without attending so much to the nicety... niceties of grammar rules as to the general and popular use of the words.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="2026.143" stopTime="2031.631">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Is it the Louisiana legislature that determines what Louisiana statutes mean? 
    Or is the Louisiana Supreme Court?
speaker="jay_topkis" startTime="2031.631" stopTime="2040.570">
    Mr. Jay Topkis 
    It is the Louisiana legislature, Your Honor, which writes statutes, employing the common parlance--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="2040.570" stopTime="2041.387">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    We have a doctrine--
speaker="jay_topkis" startTime="2041.387" stopTime="2053.978">
    Mr. Jay Topkis 
    --and which, when courts are called on to interpret those statutes, courts, whether State, Federal or whatever, are obligated to follow and interpret those statutes in the light of the meaning of the Louisiana legislature.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="2053.978" stopTime="2078.777">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    --Mr. Topkis, we have a doctrine called the Pullman doctrine, which is succinctly described as follows: No principle has found more consistent or clear expression than that the Federal courts should not adjudicate the Constitutionality of State enactments fairly open to interpretation until the State courts have been afforded a reasonable opportunity to pass upon them.
speaker="jay_topkis" startTime="2078.777" stopTime="2080.813">
    Mr. Jay Topkis 
    Quite so, Your Honor. 
    I'm familiar with that.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="2080.813" stopTime="2088.900">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Now, does... do we have any idea what Louisiana courts thinks this phrase, creation, means in this statute?
speaker="jay_topkis" startTime="2088.900" stopTime="2099.691">
    Mr. Jay Topkis 
    We have only the very brief decision of the Louisiana Supreme Court to the effect that this statute does not offend the Louisiana Constitution. 
    That's all we've got.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2099.691" stopTime="2110.064">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Mr. Topkis, you're arguing here in support of the Fifth Circuit, not only the judgment but the rationality, I take it, that there is no secular purpose for this statute?
speaker="jay_topkis" startTime="2110.064" stopTime="2111.749">
    Mr. Jay Topkis 
    Right, Your Honor.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2111.749" stopTime="2119.189">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    But I didn't understand the Fifth Circuit to rely as heavily as you apparently do on dictionary definitions of the terms in the statute?
speaker="jay_topkis" startTime="2119.189" stopTime="2146.172">
    Mr. Jay Topkis 
    Well, I thought, as I read the Fifth Circuit opinion, that they said, everybody knows what creation and creationism is. 
    It's a basically fundamentalist point of view. 
    And I would not think that we would have much uncertainty about it, were it not for the fact that people whose objectives are plain seek to invoke familiar--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2146.172" stopTime="2166.420">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well, I thought part of the Fifth Circuit opinion could be read as saying that if there was... if the statute was passed for religious purposes, say, fairly broadly interpreted like, love thy neighbor as thyself, or something, that the statute might be bad. 
    You wouldn't go that far, would you?
speaker="jay_topkis" startTime="2166.420" stopTime="2166.936">
    Mr. Jay Topkis 
    --That the statute might be...?
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2166.936" stopTime="2171.872">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    That the statute might be unconstitutional as being an establishment of religion.
speaker="jay_topkis" startTime="2171.872" stopTime="2179.727">
    Mr. Jay Topkis 
    I would not regard love thy neighbor as thyself as a necessarily religious doctrine. 
    I would think of it as a proposition in morality.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2179.727" stopTime="2184.381">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    But supposing it's a morality subscribed to by many religious faiths.
speaker="jay_topkis" startTime="2184.381" stopTime="2207.747">
    Mr. Jay Topkis 
    Well, there are lots of propositions that are subscribed to by religious faiths, but they do not become religious, as I understand, merely by virtue of that subscription. 
    For example, most religions forbid or speak against homicide. 
    But a civil... pardon me, a criminal statute making homicide criminal is not a religious statute.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2207.747" stopTime="2215.067">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Even though, perhaps, a number of church people go down and say, we want this statute passed because it's consistent with our religious belief?
speaker="jay_topkis" startTime="2215.067" stopTime="2219.970">
    Mr. Jay Topkis 
    Even though. 
    Now--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="2219.970" stopTime="2240.182">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Mr. Topkis, can I ask you a question? 
    When the case was referred on the State Constitutional issue to the Supreme Court of Louisiana, I believe you were involved in the litigation at that point. 
    Was the Louisiana Supreme Court asked by either party to interpret the meaning of the definition of creation science? 
    I know the court did not do it, but--
speaker="jay_topkis" startTime="2240.182" stopTime="2245.270">
    Mr. Jay Topkis 
    --I do not believe so, and my colleague assures me that that's his recollection, also.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="2245.270" stopTime="2249.907">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    --So there's no request by either party for abstention to have the State court advise the parties on the meaning?
speaker="jay_topkis" startTime="2249.907" stopTime="2255.394">
    Mr. Jay Topkis 
    Neither the parties nor the Fifth Circuit; I don't believe so, Your Honor.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="2255.394" stopTime="2256.610">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Mr. Topkis--
speaker="jay_topkis" startTime="2256.610" stopTime="2256.994">
    Mr. Jay Topkis 
    Justice Scalia.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="2256.994" stopTime="2348.653">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    --this question is sort of like the Chief Justice's last question, but I think it's a little closer to this case. 
    I'm concerned about whether purpose alone would invalidate a State action, if a State action has a perfectly valid secular purpose. 
    Let's assume that there is an ancient history professor in a State high school who has been teaching that the Roman Empire did not extent to the southern shore of the Mediterranean in the 1st Century A.D.-- 
    And let's assume a group of Protestants who are concerned about that fact, inasmuch as it makes it seem that the Biblical story of the crucifixion has things a bit wrong... because of that concern, and really, no other reason... I mean, this fellow's also teaching other things that are wrong. 
    He's teaching that the Parthians came out of Egypt. 
    They don't care about that. 
    They do care that Romans were in Jerusalem in the 1st Century A.D. So they go to the principal of the school, and say, this history professor is teaching what is just falsehood. 
    I mean, everybody knows that Rome was there. 
    And the principal says, gee, you're right. 
    And he goes in and directs the teacher to teach that Rome was on the southern short of the Mediterranean in the 1st Century A.D.-- 
    Clearly a religious motivation. 
    The only reason the people were concerned about that, as opposed to the Parthians, was the fact that it contradicted their religious view. 
    Now, would it be unconstitutional for the principal to listen to them, and on the basis of that religious motivation, to make the change in the high school?
speaker="jay_topkis" startTime="2348.653" stopTime="2365.245">
    Mr. Jay Topkis 
    I wouldn't think so, Your Honor, because the principal wouldn't be acting out of religious motivation. 
    He would be acting out of the scholar's interest in truth. 
    And when for whatever reason factual error was called to his attention, he would do his best to correct it.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="2365.245" stopTime="2369.566">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    And here, do we know that the State is acting out of religious motivation?
speaker="jay_topkis" startTime="2369.566" stopTime="2373.685">
    Mr. Jay Topkis 
    By every index that we can possibly have, Your Honor, yes.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="2373.685" stopTime="2374.585">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Which is what?
speaker="jay_topkis" startTime="2374.585" stopTime="2402.537">
    Mr. Jay Topkis 
    We take a look at the vocabulary of the statute; it is religious. 
    We take a look at what the legislators said at the time they acted; it is nothing but religious. 
    We can go through this entire record without finding anybody talking about a secular purpose. 
    They talk about how terrible evolution is. 
    Why? 
    Because it's godless evolution, and what we got to do is bring God into balance with evolution.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="2402.537" stopTime="2423.534">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    So in the case I gave, if it was the school board that went to the high school principal, and the members of the school board were upset about this, as opposed to Parthia, because of their religious affiliations, then it would be bad, and you would have to leave the teacher in and continue to teach that Rome was not on the southern shore of the Mediterranean.
speaker="jay_topkis" startTime="2423.534" stopTime="2441.245">
    Mr. Jay Topkis 
    Well, again, I'm following your hypothetical, and I think that the... are you still assuming that it is the superintendent who makes the decision? 
    Because I'm responding to you that he makes it out of his quest for truth.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="2441.245" stopTime="2443.447">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    No, he's directed by the school board.
speaker="jay_topkis" startTime="2443.447" stopTime="2456.672">
    Mr. Jay Topkis 
    Yes? 
    He's directed by the school board, and they are motivated... but nonetheless, what they are doing is not teaching religion. 
    They are teaching history out of a religious motive.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="2456.672" stopTime="2477.418">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    I agree with you there. 
    And once you say that what they're doing is teaching religion, it's a different ballgame. 
    If that is motivated by a religious purpose, then I think you're quite right. 
    But that is an essential part of what you have to establish, though, isn't it? 
    Not just that a secular action is ultimately motivated by some religious concern?
speaker="jay_topkis" startTime="2477.418" stopTime="2478.620">
    Mr. Jay Topkis 
    Quite so.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="2478.620" stopTime="2479.337">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Okay, I'm with you then.
speaker="jay_topkis" startTime="2479.337" stopTime="2526.351">
    Mr. Jay Topkis 
    All right. 
    Now, I said before that this definition that Mr. Bird is so fond of, and I quote it... origin through abrupt appearance in complex form of biological life, life itself, and the physical universe... one thing we know about that collection of words is that it has never before been seen upon the face of the Earth except in Mr. Bird's briefs, and the affidavits prepared. 
    Mr. Bird is a little slender to play Tweedledum, but that's what he's trying to do. 
    He wants words to mean what he says they mean. 
    And that didn't fool Alice, and I doubt very much that it will fool this Court.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2526.351" stopTime="2549.134">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Don't overestimate us. 
    [Laughter]
speaker="jay_topkis" startTime="2549.134" stopTime="2602.268">
    Mr. Jay Topkis 
    Your Honors, I'd like now to go to another of Mr. Bird's buzzwords, academic freedom. 
    The idea of academic freedom that is advanced here is, again, unlike any previous notion of that term. 
    It's not a term; it's an incantation, as he uses it. 
    This statute calls for the very antithesis of academic freedom. 
    It says that the teacher must give balanced treatment, regardless of whether the evidence is balanced. 
    It says the teacher may teach evolution only at the price of teaching what he or she knows to be pseudoscience. 
    And the teacher may teach only the evidences for creation; none against. 
    I can't imagine anything farther from the idea of academic freedom.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="2602.268" stopTime="2612.457">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Well, now wait a minute-- 
    --Mr. Topkis, there's very little xxx in elementary schools, do you agree?

    Mr. Jay Topkis 
    Yes and no, if I may, Your Honor. 
    Yes in the sense that most elementary school teachers are autocrats. 
    I can remember my own Miss Bremner very well. 
    And but I think that the teacher is pretty free to teach what the teacher believes to be truth, even in elementary schools.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="2640.893" stopTime="2646.095">

    Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. 
    It may give the local school board a choice between two or three. 
    I agree with you that once you get into the classroom... and that'll be true under this statute... the teacher is going teach whatever she or he really thinks, despite what may be written in a textbook. 
    But the point I'm making is, it seems to me your academic freedom argument would be well directed at the college level. 
    But I question, really, whether it's relevant, particularly, as Justice Marshall indicates, at the public school level.
speaker="jay_topkis" startTime="2718.476" stopTime="2742.359">
    Mr. Jay Topkis 
    I see it's relevance, if I may, Mr. Justice Powell, only in the sense that this statute is defended as advancing academic freedom. 
    And it seems to me that when you give explicit commands... teach equally, teach for... you are not talking about academic freedom. 
    That's the entirety of my contention on the point.
speaker="lewis_f_powell_jr" startTime="2742.359" stopTime="2745.544">
    Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. 
    Perhaps it would be irrelevant to both arguments, both sides?

    Mr. Jay Topkis 
    Could be.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2746.913" stopTime="2785.538">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    What if you had a statute, Mr. Topkis, that said, we think an awful lot of teachers in the school system in this State have presented only the Protestant view of the Reformation in their medieval history classes, and so we want to give equal time to the Catholic view? 
    Do you think that that would... suppose it was passed with a purely... interest in historical truth... do you think that would raise any problems? 
    Perhaps even though a lot of Protestant religious people got behind it, or a lot of Catholic religious people got behind it?
speaker="jay_topkis" startTime="2785.538" stopTime="2801.213">
    Mr. Jay Topkis 
    So long as the purpose of the school authorities, in taking this position, was an historical purpose rather than a religious one, I couldn't quarrel with it.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2801.213" stopTime="2806.098">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    It certainly wouldn't vindicate academic freedom, in the normal sense.
speaker="jay_topkis" startTime="2806.098" stopTime="2931.012">
    Mr. Jay Topkis 
    No. 
    No, it wouldn't vindicate academic freedom. 
    But on the other hand, I would think that only... no, pardon me. 
    I would think that it would be a requisite of a teacher who professed to be indulging in or utilizing his academic freedom to give fair treatment to the history of both... I forget Your Honor's example... the Reformation and the Counter-Reformation, or whatever. 
    To pull somebody up who is, out of his own personal prejudices... or views; I'll not use the perjorative... overstressing one side of a controversy, or one aspect of history, is not to deprive him of academic freedom. 
    Academic freedom does not mean the right to teach exclusively one particular view, as I see it, at any rate. 
    I take it... I had planned to discuss the legislative history of this statute a little bit, but I rather imagine that my time is running on. 
    I think that I'll just rest with this statement. 
    There is nothing in the legislative history which speaks of a secular purpose: No sponsor of the legislature... of the legislation; no witness; nobody. 
    The one witness I love is a Ms. Pabbs Minhinit, who said: I think if you teach children that they are evolved from apes, then they will start acting like apes. 
    If we teach them possibly that they were created by an Almighty God, then they will believe that they were a creature of God and start acting like one of God's children. 
    That's what she told the Senate before the Senate voted.

    Well, or at least there is something in the legislative history that some were motivated by a desire to counteract the evolutionary subject with teaching of another subject that would have a different message.

    And maybe you're right. 
    But at least when they make that argument, there is something in the history that provides a basis for it. 
    That's what I'm asking you.
speaker="jay_topkis" startTime="2967.137" stopTime="2991.786">
    Mr. Jay Topkis 
    Yes, and what they want to do is see to it that their version of religion... they start with the premise that evolution is religious. 
    It's secular humanism. 
    It's godless. 
    And what they want to do is counter this religion... and they repeatedly call evolution a religion... and they say, let's give equal time to the other religion. 
    Well, that's not academic freedom. 
    Now--

    Mr. Jay Topkis 
    --Justice Scalia.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="2993.254" stopTime="3040.050">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    In your legislative history, and you know, I've read it, there are statements of the sort you... you quoted, including some by the sponsor of this, especially the first time around, the bill that was in a different form and didn't get passed. 
    But isn't what counts what the intent of the entire legislature was? 
    And I just... it never occurred to me that Louisiana was a State dominated by... religiously by fundamentalists. 
    And I think the statistics bear that out. 
    As far as I know, the Catholics and atheists alone... or acnostics alone... account for 56 percent of the population. 
    Never mind some other religious groups that are not necessarily fundamentalists. 
    Now, it was, after all, the entire legislature that passed the bill.
speaker="jay_topkis" startTime="3040.050" stopTime="3040.485">
    Mr. Jay Topkis 
    Right.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="3040.485" stopTime="3054.310">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Now maybe the motive of those who introduced it and were most zealous for it may have been a fundamentalist Christian motive, but can we be sure that that was the motive of the entire legislature of Louisiana in passing the bill?
speaker="jay_topkis" startTime="3054.310" stopTime="3095.120">
    Mr. Jay Topkis 
    Well, Your Honor, when we try to figure out what the legislature meant, we look first at its plain words; then at the words of the sponsors and so on; and then we listen, or we look, for anything else. 
    There isn't a single word in this history of secular interest. 
    Mr. Bird and we, at an earlier stage, in a parallel litigation, the record of which is part of this record, took 40 depositions; there's not a word in those depositions, Mr. Bird hasn't brought one forward, about secular purpose.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="3095.120" stopTime="3115.597">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    xxx balance secular purpose. 
    Now, what they're saying is-- 
    True. 
    --most of the imbalance complained of is complained of on religious grounds. 
    But isn't righting what the State legislature considered an imbalance in instruction a secular purpose; that only one side of an issue is being presented?
speaker="jay_topkis" startTime="3115.597" stopTime="3315.226">
    Mr. Jay Topkis 
    Not, Your Honor, with respect, when the complaint is, they're teaching that religion. 
    Why don't they teach my religion? 
    And that's what the legislature said. 
    And that's what the witnesses said. 
    Over and over again. 
    There's nobody coming forward and taking any other position. 
    Now, this bill was of course drafted by a theologian, or somebody versed in apologetics. 
    There's an amusing bit of evidence on that subject in the very language of the bill. 
    The bill keeps using... the Act keeps using the term "evidences" in the plural. 
    We lawyers never speak of "evidences" in the plural. 
    We speak of "evidence", the singular. 
    And I got nagged by it, and I looked it up the other day. 
    And of course the only dictionary reference to "evidences" is to Christian apologetics: the evidences for Christianity. 
    This is a matter of theological disputation. 
    And going back if I may, Mr. Justice Scalia, there wasn't offered here any affidavit from Senator Keith, or any other legislator, about what their purpose was. 
    They were apparently content, or stuck, with their record. 
    Now, again, where does this come from? 
    Let me note one unusual fact about one of those five affidavits that Mr. Bird came up with. 
    He offers an affidavit by a Dr. Terry Meith, who tells us that he's a philosopher and a theologian, and that he possesses three graduate degrees, two doctorates and a Master's. 
    He even tells us what grade point averages he got at two of the schools. 
    He got a 3.94 at one school, and a 3.97 at another school. 
    I've never seen an expert qualified precisely that way. 
    They usually settle for saying, I was Phi Beta Kappa. 
    But okay, he says 3.94 and 3.97 at two schools. 
    He omits USC. 
    Well, I don't attribute any significance to that. 
    USC I have heard is a rather difficult school, and may be he didn't do so well there. 
    I'm not going to fault him for that. 
    But the omission I do find significant is in his employment record. 
    He signed the affidavit in September 1984. 
    And he does not state where he was then employed. 
    All of the other affidavits that Mr. Bird submits do give that information. 
    And we found the explanation yesterday. 
    The affidavit's jurat reads: Lynchburg, Virginia. 
    And just on a hunch, my colleague, Mr. Harper, called Liberty University where Reverend Jerry Falwell is the Chancellor. 
    And wouldn't you know it, we got right through to Dr. Meith. 
    He's been on that faculty since 1984. 
    And apparently, was not very interested in this case, which deals so much with fundamentalist, with acknowledging where he was employed. 
    I--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="3315.226" stopTime="3321.880">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Some of the experts who provided affidavits were agnostics, at least one of them.

    Mr. Jay Topkis 
    --One of them so stated, yes, Your Honor.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="3323.232" stopTime="3363.725">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Said he was an agnostic. 
    Is there any difference in your mind between purpose of the law and motivation of those who want to get the law enacted? 
    I mean, in the example I gave you earlier where the school board directs a change in the ancient history instruction motivated by the fact that this particular error is inconsistent with their religious beliefs, although teaching it right doesn't necessarily make their religious beliefs any more credible, would you say that there they had an evil purpose, that the purpose of the change was a religious one?

    Right.

    Right.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="3377.933" stopTime="3383.203">

    Mr. Jay Topkis

    Yes?

    Mr. Wendell R. Bird 
    Thank you, Your Honor. 
    The procedural issue, the State submits, should be decisive in this case. 
    And Mr. Topkis has done a very nice job of demonstrating the factual disputes between the parties, disputes that ought to be decided on the basis of evidence at a trial. 
    It would simply subvert the purposes of the summary judgment rules to allow a court to take a leap of faith over the issue at hand to apply the tripartite test to an unknown subject. 
    If this Court chooses to rely on Constitutional grounds, however, there's a great deal of argument in support of the State's position that, we submit, should lead to a favorable conclusion: not only the Engel line of cases; not only the historical evidence; but the tripartite test itself shows the Constitutionality of this statute. 
    The purpose was stated as to advance academic freedom.

    No, no, just German... they didn't particularly like Germans and they do like French.
