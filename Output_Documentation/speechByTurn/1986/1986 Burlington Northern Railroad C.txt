    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    The other case, Burlington Northern Railroad versus Brotherhood began as a dispute over renewal of a collective bargaining agreement between a small railroad in Maine and some of its employees and shortly expanded to picketing and threats of strike activity at railroad facilities all over the country. 
    A Federal District Court then enjoined the picketing of any railroads other than those involved in the primary dispute. 
    The question we must decide is whether the prohibition of the Norris-LaGuardia Act that bars Federal Courts from issuing injunctions against secondary activity growing out of any labor dispute stripped the Federal Court of jurisdiction to issue the injunction. 
    The Court of Appeals held that District Court has no jurisdiction to enter an injunction by enforcing that statute and reversed the District Court. 
    We agree with the Court of Appeals and affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals. 
    We hold, for the reasons stated in the opinion filed by the Clerk that the Federal Court does not have jurisdiction to enjoin secondary picketing in railway labor disputes. 
    The decision is unanimous.
