    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    The other case 85-1589, Iowa Mutual Insurance Company against Laplante. 
    A Blackfeet Indian sued his employer in Tribal Court. 
    The employer's insurer sought a declaration from the Federal District Court that the insurance policy did not cover this play. 
    The District Court dismissed for the lack of subject-matter jurisdiction and the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed. 
    While we agree with much of the Ninth Circuit's reasoning, we reverse its judgment in so far as it affirmed the District Court's dismissal for lack of jurisdiction. 
    Justice Stevens has filed an opinion concurring in part and dissenting part.
