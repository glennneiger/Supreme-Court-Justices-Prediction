Shaare Tefila Congregation v. Cobb

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist

    Mr. Brannan, you may proceed when you are ready.

    Ms. Patricia A. Brannan 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    This case presents the issue, whether a complaint that alleges racially motivated discrimination and harassment against Jews may state a claim under Title 42 of the United States Code, Section 1982. 
    The complaint alleged that respondents' desecration of the synagogue of Shaare Tefila Congregation was racially motivated and hence covered by the statute. 
    The complaint further alleged that the facts that supported the allegation of racial motivation were principally the character, symbols and words that respondents themselves painted on the synagogue. 
    The complaint alleged that they painted the words, 
    "Dead Jew, Death to the Jew. " 
    They painted swastikas, and on a door the words, 
    "In, Take a Shower, Jew. " 
    They painted the garbled German words, "Toten Kamf Verband" next to a skull and crossbones. 
    The "Toten Kamf Verband" with the death head units of concentration camp guards in Nazi Germany, and the skull and crossbones was their symbol. 
    These words and symbols invoked Nazi ideology, and it was one of the principal tenets of Nazi ideology, both in Nazi Germany in the 1930s and '40s and among neo-Nazi groups in this country today that Jews are racially non-white and inferior to whites. 
    The complaint further alleged that respondents painted the words, "Ku Klux Kian", and the burning cross, the familiar symbol of the Kian. 
    Kian groups, like the Nazis, hold as one of their central tenets that Jews are racially distinct from whites and inferior. 
    The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals split on the issue as to whether this conduct stated a Section 1982 claim. 
    A majority affirmed the dismissal of the complaint, holding that because Jews are not racially distinct or non-white, this conduct does not state a 1982 claim. 
    But in dissent, Judge Wilkinson recognized that although Jews are not racially distinct from whites, when they suffer racially motivated deprivation of rights protected by the statute, they like any other group should be covered. 
    We, of course, agree that Jews are not racially distinct from whites. 
    We respectfully ask this Court to reverse the Fourth Circuit and to hold, consistent with its prior cases--

    Ms. Patricia A. Brannan 
    --We don't believe that that really adds to the argument that we are making. 
    I am reminded, in answering your question, of Justice Marshall's language in the McDonald case, that at the time of the passage of the statute in 1866, Congress probably didn't anticipate racial discrimination against whites of the sort that this Court held in McDonald to be covered. 
    But Congress had an open-ended concept of what it was covering, that there would be new groups coming to this country; new kinds of discrimination undoubtedly would arise. 
    And it was the discrimination itself that Congress focused on, not particular groups and whether they were covered. 
    That is also illustrated, we believe, in the legislative history by the repeated references to Germans and Swedes and other groups as a race who really... it just isn't thought any more that those groups are racial--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="309.746" stopTime="328.799">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    Ms. Brannan, the word "discrimination", of course, connotes treating some people differently than others, and your idea is that the statute covers any instance in which, say, a Frenchman treats a German differently than he would another Frenchman, if they are all in this country?
speaker="patricia_a_brannan" startTime="328.799" stopTime="339.006">
    Ms. Patricia A. Brannan 
    --No, Justice Rehnquist.

    Chief Justice Rehnquist

    Ms. Patricia A. Brannan 
    The only difficulty, as we have argued in our briefs, is that at all costs we would want the courts to avoid is the issue of defining race in order to determine coverage. 
    We believe that was one of the key errors of the Fourth Circuit majority, that they had a notion, a correct notion that Jews are not racially distinct from white, and they let their correct idea get in the way of dealing with this discrimination on the terms of the discriminators themselves, and that certainly we wouldn't want the lower federal courts to be analyzing, are Jews racially distinct, are Germans or Arabs or any other group racially distinct.

    What if I take a dislike to people with brown eyes, and I say that I'm just not going to deal with people with brown eyes the same way I'm going to deal with people with blue eyes.

    It could be if there were facts to show that historically, or in our society, and in the eyes of the discriminators, was a racial distinction, and the hypothetical--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="590.609" stopTime="602.908">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    How is the judge going to charge the jury? 
    What should they ask themselves, to decide whether someone with blue eyes who treats differently people with brown eyes is "discriminating"?
speaker="patricia_a_brannan" startTime="602.908" stopTime="636.831">
    Ms. Patricia A. Brannan 
    --The charge should be whether it is conduct that we understand as racial, as based on that person and their heritage and background and what they are in unchangeable ways, unlike, for instance religion, and that that should be backed up in the evidence and the plaintiff has the burden to show that it ties in historically or culturally with an understanding that is racial. 
    In the hypothetical you posed, that probably would be an unlikely result, that a plaintiff could prevail in a case like that.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="636.831" stopTime="644.345">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    But it has to have a historical background.

speaker="patricia_a_brannan" startTime="644.345" stopTime="666.269">
    Ms. Patricia A. Brannan 
    Not necessarily. 
    If there developed now, for instance, a notion that French Canadians are racially distinct and there were Kian-like groups who were out to do the sorts of things that happened at Shaare Tefila to French-Canadians, I don't think we would have to wait for some period of time but we would need to show that they view their conduct as racially motivated against those groups.

    Ms. Patricia A. Brannan

    They in fact didn't.

    Unknown Speaker

speaker="patricia_a_brannan" startTime="805.602" stopTime="814.398">
    Ms. Patricia A. Brannan 
    --Well, we think in fact that the approach is directly in line with this Court's cases, particularly the McDonald and General Building--
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="814.398" stopTime="816.659">
    Unknown Speaker 
    I asked about the legislative history.
speaker="patricia_a_brannan" startTime="816.659" stopTime="822.833">
    Ms. Patricia A. Brannan 
    --And what is supportive in the legislative history was the repeated references--
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="822.833" stopTime="856.937">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Well, there may be some support in the legislative history for treating Jews as a separate race or treating Germans as a separate race. 
    But I don't see anything in the legislative history that would make it turn on the relative sophistication of the person doing the discriminating, which you are urging. 
    The view of the discriminator... I mean, that's what gets you into a very peculiar approach here. 
    And is there anything in the legislative history to support that?
speaker="patricia_a_brannan" startTime="856.937" stopTime="876.358">
    Ms. Patricia A. Brannan 
    --Well, Justice O'Connor, we think it isn't so much the sophistication as the intent of the discriminator, and that is an issue that this Court addressed in terms of the legislative history in General Building Contractors, and held that intent is the touchstone of coverage, that a plaintiff now has to show racially discriminatory intent.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="876.358" stopTime="910.299">
    Unknown Speaker 
    But why isn't it enough if the intent is to discriminate against a race, as race was understood when the statute was enacted? 
    You are not just insisting that the intent be to discriminate against a race, but you are insisting that the intent be to discriminate against a race because it is a race, not because we have been at war with Germans for 200 years, but because Germans are a separate race. 
    Now, why do you have to add in that qualification under the statute? 
    Isn't enough that you are discriminating against a race? 
    Isn't that all the statutory language would require?
speaker="patricia_a_brannan" startTime="910.299" stopTime="924.550">
    Ms. Patricia A. Brannan 
    Yes, but the difference, I think, between the last part of what you said and what we are arguing, Justice Scalia, is the motivation of the actor must be racially discriminatory. 
    That is the thing that we are emphasizing.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="924.550" stopTime="926.641">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Why? 
    Where is that in the statute?
speaker="patricia_a_brannan" startTime="926.641" stopTime="947.945">
    Ms. Patricia A. Brannan 
    Well, basically because this Court so held in General Building Contractors and McDonald, but that has been the thing that the Court has looked to, not who the group is, who is the victim, but what the intent is as demonstrated by the acts and by statements and by the usual evidence that fact finders look at to measure intent.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="947.945" stopTime="960.944">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Do you think McDonald would have come out differently if a person just didn't like the color of the white race's skin, or of the black race's skin and was discriminating on that ground, although still discriminating against a race?
speaker="patricia_a_brannan" startTime="960.944" stopTime="971.791">
    Ms. Patricia A. Brannan 
    Well, in our society skin color is very wrapped up, of course, with issues of race and I am not sure that those two things are separable in a case such as McDonald.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="971.791" stopTime="982.989">
    Unknown Speaker 
    That's what I was wondering about. 
    What would you say if they painted swastikas on the synagogue on Lenox Avenue in the middle of Harlem? 
    There is a synagogue there.
speaker="patricia_a_brannan" startTime="982.989" stopTime="984.840">
    Ms. Patricia A. Brannan 
    Yes, Justice Marshall.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="984.840" stopTime="987.862">
    Unknown Speaker 
    And there is not a white person within ten blocks.
speaker="patricia_a_brannan" startTime="987.862" stopTime="998.330">
    Ms. Patricia A. Brannan 
    And we believe that the result would be the same, that those congregants should be covered, as we believe Shaare Tefila would be covered.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="998.330" stopTime="999.980">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Well, you couldn't do it an race, could you?
speaker="patricia_a_brannan" startTime="999.980" stopTime="1013.638">
    Ms. Patricia A. Brannan 
    Well, again swastikas on a synagogue again invoke that ideology of racial distinctness of Jews, and we think if that is part of--
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="1013.638" stopTime="1020.183">
    Unknown Speaker 
    But there are no Jews in that synagogue. 
    There are no white Jews, I would say.
speaker="patricia_a_brannan" startTime="1020.183" stopTime="1042.747">
    Ms. Patricia A. Brannan 
    --Well, we think it makes no difference whether the Jews are black or white if the racial animus is there to support the cause of action. 
    As in McDonald versus Jones, the Court hasn't weighed the color of the skin or the race of the victim but has looked to the intent of the discriminator and that the result there should be the same even if the victims are black.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="1042.747" stopTime="1058.568">
    Unknown Speaker 
    If these people had just vandalized the synagogue without painting anything, swastikas or anything like that, they had just trashed the place, would you be here?
speaker="patricia_a_brannan" startTime="1058.568" stopTime="1060.859">
    Ms. Patricia A. Brannan 
    It would be a much more difficult case.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="1060.859" stopTime="1064.852">
    Unknown Speaker 
    You would then have to have some other evidence that they did it on a racial basis?
speaker="patricia_a_brannan" startTime="1064.852" stopTime="1065.503">
    Ms. Patricia A. Brannan 
    Exactly.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="1065.503" stopTime="1079.021">
    Unknown Speaker 
    But if it turned out that they... as Justice Scalia suggested, if it turned out that as a matter of fact they knew that Jews were not a different race, they claimed that they just didn't like Jews, you wouldn't be here then?
speaker="patricia_a_brannan" startTime="1079.021" stopTime="1086.498">
    Ms. Patricia A. Brannan 
    Exactly, if there weren't some evidence. 
    Here the character of what was painted is the strongest evidence.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="1086.498" stopTime="1115.235">
    Unknown Speaker 
    And you would... in that case you wouldn't even be here if you determined or you wouldn't even be here, even arguably under the statute, claiming that at the time the statute was passed, that Jews were considered to be enough different to be covered by the statute?
speaker="patricia_a_brannan" startTime="1115.235" stopTime="1124.983">
    Ms. Patricia A. Brannan 
    We might, although I think we would be advocating, as are the respondents in the St. Francis College case--
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="1124.983" stopTime="1129.464">
    Unknown Speaker 
    You don't want to urge in this Court, I take it, that Jews are a different race?
speaker="patricia_a_brannan" startTime="1129.464" stopTime="1136.400">
    Ms. Patricia A. Brannan 
    --No, not at all, Justice White. 
    We want to urge that where the discrimination against them is racial, even though--
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="1136.400" stopTime="1143.163">
    Unknown Speaker

speaker="patricia_a_brannan" startTime="1143.162" stopTime="1154.502">
    Ms. Patricia A. Brannan 
    --There is some evidence of that, but we really don't think that is critical one way or the other to the holding, that what Congress was after and was concerned about was racial discrimination against anyone.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="1154.502" stopTime="1164.557">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Well do you think it would be error if we read the legislative history to say, Congress thought that Jews were a different race and therefore the statute covers it? 
    Would we be in error?
speaker="patricia_a_brannan" startTime="1164.557" stopTime="1211.678">
    Ms. Patricia A. Brannan 
    No, I don't, although we would certainly urge the Court to make clear that of course Jews or any other group now bringing a claim would not have to prove some racial distinctness. 
    That was really what was suggested by the Fourth Circuit majority, that there is an extra burden beyond racial motivation on the plaintiff to show that they are non-white or racially distinct, although it is unclear, racially distinct from whom. 
    That, we believe, was the crux of the error and that particular aspect of that opinion, we believe should be reversed and made clear by the Court, whether or not the Court accepts the racial motivation theory that we have put forward or the respondents' approach that is more closely tied to the meaning of race in 1866.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="1211.678" stopTime="1223.035">
    Unknown Speaker 
    And could, under your theory, these respondents have been prosecuted criminally under the criminal counterpart of these statutes?
speaker="patricia_a_brannan" startTime="1223.035" stopTime="1249.883">
    Ms. Patricia A. Brannan 
    We believe that they could. 
    In fact, they were prosecuted under state law only under the malicious destruction of property types of statutes that don't in any way address the racial motivation or the real... the civil rights violation that was the most hurtful part of the conduct. 
    It wasn't really getting the wall messed up that is offensive to the congregation.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="1249.883" stopTime="1261.630">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Ms. Brannan, you have a lot of trouble with this Screws case which says, you must have an intent to deprive somebody of a right, a specific right. 
    Remember that case?
speaker="patricia_a_brannan" startTime="1261.630" stopTime="1263.543">
    Ms. Patricia A. Brannan 
    Yes, I do, and we--
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="1263.543" stopTime="1269.156">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Well, in this you'd have it awful hard to prove that criminally, beyond a reasonable doubt.
speaker="patricia_a_brannan" startTime="1269.156" stopTime="1286.337">
    Ms. Patricia A. Brannan 
    --I think as a question of proof, there will be more, or less easy cases. 
    We think that the intent here is very clear, and that the right that was violated is the right in Section 1982 to hold property, one of the specifically enumerated rights.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="1286.337" stopTime="1306.861">
    Unknown Speaker 
    It doesn't say that the result... the man was killed. 
    Screws says it was what was in the man's mind. 
    You have to prove that he intended not only to kill but to kill in order to deny him a constitutional right. 
    Well, that would be a lot of problem in this case.
speaker="patricia_a_brannan" startTime="1306.860" stopTime="1314.855">
    Ms. Patricia A. Brannan 
    Yes, it would certainly be a question of fact. 
    But we believe at the threshold a colorable prosecution could be brought.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="1314.855" stopTime="1349.580">
    Unknown Speaker 
    If your interpretation is correct, do you think that it will eliminate or sweep out of the way some specific exceptions that were enacted in Title VIII, the Housing Act where Congress specifically exempted some, forms of possible discrimination? 
    I guess those would just be swept away by the potential for suit under this section?
speaker="patricia_a_brannan" startTime="1349.580" stopTime="1366.840">
    Ms. Patricia A. Brannan 
    Well, as in the Court's prior cases, considering the relationship of 1981 in Title VII and 1982 in Title VIII, they are separate and independent causes of action and the Court already has held that in Title VII and Title VIII, Congress did not intend to--
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="1366.840" stopTime="1379.179">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Well, certainly, your interpretation would make useless the reservations expressed in Title VIII for certain types of discriminatory conduct.
speaker="patricia_a_brannan" startTime="1379.179" stopTime="1410.779">
    Ms. Patricia A. Brannan 
    --Well, our view is that Title VIII has its restrictions and its areas of coverage, and that 1982 has its, and that they stand independently. 
    It may well be that there are cases covered under Section 1982 that would not be covered under Title VIII. 
    In fact, this is such a case. 
    We do not have a Title VIII claim because the congregation building is not a dwelling. 
    So, the two, we believe, can be on parallel tracks but each have their independent areas of coverage and exemption.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="1410.779" stopTime="1424.127">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Well, but it would open up for suit, if you are correct, various things that were reserved in Title VIII, for example the duplex housing when the owner lives in part of the duplex, and that sort of thing.
speaker="patricia_a_brannan" startTime="1424.127" stopTime="1455.138">
    Ms. Patricia A. Brannan 
    We think that is true now, Justice O'Connor, under 1982. 
    For example, if a black family is now denied housing, rental housing in a duplex, there is no reason why they cannot bring a Section 1982 case if they can prove that discrimination, you know, was against them on racial grounds. 
    It's really... we're not going any farther in that area than already the Court has established, that there are areas of coverage under Section 1982 that might be exempted.

    Ms. Patricia A. Brannan 
    Well, we view it really not as an exemption, but as reversing the Fourth Circuit's attempt to restrict by defining groups the courts think are not racially distinct from the coverage of the statute, whereas under this Court's cases, particularly General Building Contractors, the rule has been where there is racially discriminatory intent to breach one of the protected rights under the statute, there is coverage.

    Yes, but Justice O'Connor's point, I think, is that Title VIII has some meaning. 
    If you assume that what Title VIII was doing was extending to persons other than just blacks the guarantees of 1982. 
    But now, under your theory, Title VIII doesn't do anything that 1982 doesn't already do.
speaker="patricia_a_brannan" startTime="1511.135" stopTime="1546.738">
    Ms. Patricia A. Brannan 
    Well, Title VIII, as I recall, also covers religious discrimination. 
    It also covers, I believe, gender based discrimination which our theory certainly would not reach. 
    Racial motivation, we believe, will cover victims of racial motivation but in a straightforward religious discrimination case, for example, our theory would not cover plaintiffs, whereas Title VIII very well right. 
    So they do have, we believe, their independent areas of coverage and exemption, even under the approach we urge.

    Could I just explore again what you mean by racial motivation? 
    Suppose a landlord doesn't want a particular racial group, just because the landlord thinks that that racial group is sloppy, just has made the judgment that the group as a whole is sloppy. 
    Now, would that be the racial motivation?

    Ms. Patricia A. Brannan

    Ms. Patricia A. Brannan 
    Again, harking back to the legislative history a bit, what was at the heart of the Reconstruction, Congress's concern of course in the first instance was creating situations in which the newly freed slaves could function in our society. 
    But they didn't limit that protection, of course, just to blacks as the Court held in McDonald. 
    It was really a deep concern with racial motivation as being something distinct and particularly odious in our society that was at the heart of their concern.

    Unknown Speaker 
    It seems to me you are only getting at the ill-educated discriminator, right?

    Ms. Patricia A. Brannan 
    Well, perhaps, Justice Scalia, it's a question of ignorance, not education. 
    I think that there are perhaps those in much more sophisticated places with a string of degrees who may be surprised to hear a congregation arguing before the Supreme Court that Jews are not a race. 
    We believe that the error of the Fourth Circuit simply was in not applying this Court's precedents in McDonald and General Building Contractors, but adding on that extra burden an extra test for the plaintiffs. 
    One of the additional difficulties with that test is that it simply is not practicable and sensible for the district courts to be trying to figure out who is racially distinct or non-white, which are the words the Fourth Circuit used. 
    It is unclear, first of all, what the Court even meant by "racially distinct". 
    Racially distinct from whom? 
    In Sullivan and Tillman, this Court held that even whites who are the victims of racial discrimination by other whites, because those white plaintiffs have advocated the rights of blacks, have a cause of action under Sections 1981 and 1982. 
    And we believe, again, the principle that underlies that case is if the motivation is racial, it's racial because those white plaintiffs were advocating the rights of blacks, that once again there should be a cause of action even if the plaintiffs and defendants are of the same race, indisputably. 
    In terms, of course, of its language about the Jewish plaintiffs in Shaare Tefila being non-white, we think perhaps it goes without saying that it would be completely inappropriate exercise for the district courts to undertake trying to figure out who is white and non-white in some objective, anthropological or scientific test, that that simply would not be an appropriate approach for the courts to take. 
    For all of these reasons we respectfully ask this Court to reverse and to hold that all victims of racially motivated deprivations of the rights enumerated in the Civil Rights Acts of 1866 may state a cause of action under Sections 1981 and 1982.

   Argument of Deborah T. Garren
speaker="deborah_t_garren" startTime="1800.415" stopTime="1864.898">
    Ms. Deborah T. Garren 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and say it please the Court: 
    You have heard the petitioners argue that the desecration of a synagogue, what is a place of worship is covered by Section 1982, what everyone agrees is a race discrimination statute, because these defendants allegedly acted out of a completely erroneous and irrational belief that Jewish people are racially distinct. 
    I would argue that inclusion of such a religious discrimination claim within the scope of this race discrimination statute is entirely out of keeping with the purpose of the statute as originally enacted and its specific language as interpreted by this Court. 
    Likewise, and particularly importantly, determination of the coverage of Section 1982 wholly by reference to the illogical and erroneous misperceptions of discriminators is a far cry from the purpose and the language of Section 1982 as it has been interpreted by this Court.

    --Yes, ma'am, and that is what you all have done in determining that the statute is limited to rights which are racial in character and addresses an effort to achieve racial equality, with reference to people who are members of specific groups, I think. 
    And whether or not there was a general recognition in society at the time of the 39th Congress that Jews are racially distinct, it is something that has never been argued by petitioners in this case, and I think something that is not evidenced in the legislative history either. 
    And will be difficult to discern, if one attempted to go back and develop racial definitions at that time. 
    I would argue that a more appropriate approach would be to try to bring the statute into the 20th Century, and at most, in an effort to define what groups are covered, to look at whether a group... an individual as a member of a group that is commonly identified as non-white or is commonly identified as white, that is reflective, I think, of the specific language of the statute and also--

    Ms. Deborah T. Garren 
    Jewish people would have a cause of action based on discrimination because they are white, if that was their contention, but that is not their contention in this case. 
    They also do not contend that they are racially distinct from whites in any way. 
    So, I would argue that they do not fall within a group that is protected by the statute. 
    There is no evidence that they fall within such a group.

    Mrs. Garren, the problem we have in the United States... when I say a problem, it's perhaps a great asset of our country... is that we have so many different races that over a period of many years that there have been a great many intermarriages. 
    We have a heterogeneous society. 
    How would your theory fit, for example, if a white had married an Asian and their progeny, children, grandchildren, would... would they be a member of the white race or an Oriental race?

    Ms. Deborah T. Garren 
    Your Honor, I am not attempting to suggest that the Court define scientific categories of race, as has been suggested by the petitioners. 
    I think what you would do with those sorts of cases is, first of all, there are certain groups in our society that are commonly identified as non-white. 
    Those groups would be entitled to protection, and if an individual is subjected to discrimination because he is perceived to be a member of such a group, then he would be covered.

    Ms. Deborah T. Garren 
    It is a perception only of an individual's membership in a group that is commonly identified as non-white. 
    And that is something that the jury could determine, in other words, whether or not that individual was acted against because he was non-white.

    Ms. Deborah T. Garren 
    No, I think it does not, because the petitioner argues that the perceptions of the discriminator, without reference to groups, are determinative. 
    In other words, under the petitioner's argument, to take an extreme example, if a group of anti-gay people decided that homosexuals were racially different than others and discriminated against them on that basis, I think carrying the petitioners' argument to its logical conclusion, that claim would be covered by the statute. 
    The same might be true for handicapped individuals. 
    Suppose some deviant organization in our society decided that handicapped people were different racially and acted against them on that basis, I believe that claim also would be covered under the petitioners' theory for coverage of this statute. 
    So, it is something different. 
    It's an effort to bring the statute into the 20th Century and to recognize racial groups in a way with reference to society's perceptions.

    Ms. Deborah T. Garren 
    Mr. Rehmer was convicted of malicious destruction of property and was sentenced to three years, the maximum sentence for that offense. 
    Criminal restitution was available to the petitioners under Maryland law. 
    In addition, they had many common-law actions that they could have brought in the state courts. 
    Instead, they asserted them as pendent claims in the federal court, and never really, seriously wanted to pursue those state claims because they wanted to send a message to these individuals under federal civil rights law. 
    My point simply is that you can only send that message if Congress has accorded federal jurisdiction to do it, and that there is no indication that Congress intended the statute's coverage to be determined by reference to individual discriminators' illogical and irrational perceptions of race. 
    There has to be something more.

    Ms. Deborah T. Garren 
    In order to take that position, you would have to. 
    Yes, sir, I do. 
    [Laughter] 
    You would have to define the scope of the coverage of this statute, something clearly that Congress and now the courts must do, by reference to those deviant organizations' decisions about Jewish racial identity. 
    The petitioners herein do not claim a Jewish racial identity, and have never claimed a Jewish racial identity, nor did they contend that they are commonly identified as racial or non-white in any sense. 
    It's simply a matter of what the statute was intended to address. 
    It was not, I would argue, a statute to root out all forms of invidious discrimination or bigotry in our society. 
    This Court has held that it does not address sex discrimination, religious discrimination, national origin discriminations standing alone, and all of those categories would be pulled in, arguably, under the petitioners' theory.

    Ms. Deborah T. Garren 
    --Well, if one looks to the actual concern of the legislators in passing this statute, I think one would have to realize that it was passed in an effort to protect and extend the rights of the newly freed slaves. 
    And this Court has indicated, therefore, that blacks are protected, and has subsequently indicated that whites as well are protected. 
    The additional step that you must take, not in my case, I would argue, because in this case Jewish petitioners have indicated that they do not have a racial identity but in the case that follows mine, there is a need to make an effort to define race. 
    I would argue that the petitioners just throw that out the window and say, we don't need to define it; we don't need to determine what groups are protected by this statute; we'll determine the statute's coverage by reference to each individual's deviant ideas, without any reference to protected groups in our society.

    Ms. Deborah T. Garren 
    The respondents in the case that follows us have discussed some of those references. 
    I do not think there is a lot in the legislative history to that effect, nor do I think that that would represent the majority opinion of the legislators. 
    I think the primary emphasis was on protecting the rights of newly freed slaves and blacks in the South when that statute was passed. 
    It was a Reconstruction era statute. 
    And the courts have now extended it... you all have now extended it to encompass whites. 
    The question is, how one defines additional categories that it would cover, and I think it is with reference to those two categories that one defines the definition.

    But whereas here these petitioners were not without a remedy to make them whole, there isn't any need to extend a federal statute to cover any situation where a defendant acted out of a misperception.

    The state doesn't have such a statute, Your Honor. 
    However, I think the egregious nature of the conduct in this case would have been addressed by reference to punitive damages, for instance, in common-law actions; by reference to criminal restitution, by reference to sentencing. 
    And I think it was. 
    With respect to criminal sentencing, at least with respect to the individual whom I represent, he received the maximum sentence and that is an uncommon thing for malicious destruction of property in the State of Maryland. 
    That reflects an effort by the State to address the seriousness of the act. 
    Your Honor, I don't know the circumstances surrounding the others. 
    It's not part of the record and I have no way of knowing whether there's even sufficient proof to tie them in with this incident.

    Ms. Deborah T. Garren 
    What happens when... if the Court applies this misperception standard, to use a shortened term, then in essence all religious discrimination claims, national origin discrimination claims, even some sex discrimination claims might come within this race discrimination statute. 
    That is the point I am trying to make when I say, this is really religious discrimination and it's an effort to use a standard that will result in an unmanageable approach to this statute, I think, in the lower courts and one that is not consonant with the purpose of the statute as originally enacted, and with its language. 
    The problem is with the standard that the petitioners urge and the results that could accrue if that standard is applied, and I don't think in this case... it really isn't necessary that you engage in this racial definition that we have been hassling with because the petitioners indicate that they are not racially distinct, and Jewish people are not racially distinct. 
    Recognizing that, they have attempted to argue that the perceptions of the individual defendants, erroneous and irrational perceptions are what determine the coverage of a federal civil rights statute. 
    That just can't be right. 
    There is no evidence that that is what determines the coverage of this statute in the legislative history.

    --Inappropriate. 
    I think that it would be an inappropriate interpretation of the statute. 
    It would result in you having to reach back to the 1860's and determine what groups society then regarded as racially distinct, and I don't think that is a practical approach to interpreting the statute. 
    A more appropriate approach, I think, is to look to our society now and determine what groups are commonly identified as non-white, with reference to what we all recognize as racial characteristics.

    There are various groups that would fall in the non-white category. 
    This isn't an effort to get at defining what race means.

    I think it's quite conceivable that Hispanics would be a group that is commonly identified as non-white in our society. 
    Several of the lower circuit courts have held that and have approached the statute in precisely the way that I am suggesting that you approach it.

    "Moslems" is a religious term, I believe. 
    Again, it would require the courts to evaluate whether there is a common identification of that group as racially distinct, or non-white in our society.

    Ms. Deborah T. Garren 
    --I think that those groups would be included within the categories that are protected because in many instances individuals that are in those groups have dark skin, for example. 
    And there can be no doubt that if an individual is discriminated against because he is black and has dark skin, or a large number of members of that group are black and have dark skin, they would have a cause of action under this statute. 
    In conclusion, I would like to say that where, as here, there are adequate state remedies available to the petitioners, it is not necessary to stretch Section 1982 to cover every defendant's... every defendant who is motivated by an irrational and erroneous racial perception, and therefore I would ask the lower courts to uphold... this Court to uphold the lower courts' dismissal of this claim for the desecration of a synagogue under Section 1982. 
    If there are no further questions, thank you.

   Rebuttal of Patricia A. Brannan

    Ms. Patricia A. Brannan 
    May it please the Court, if I could just briefly address the issue that arose during Mrs. Garren's argument about commonness of the perception of Jews and whether this is a deviant belief, first of all, as Judge Wilkinson pointed out in dissent below, there was no record on the commonness of the belief because we were cut off on a Motion to Dismiss in which the district court didn't even consider the extra pleading material that we put in the record. 
    But secondly, that I think that some Gallup poll or test of the prevalence of the view really doesn't solve the problem. 
    The facts of this case show that this kind of conduct occurs. 
    It is not unique to Shaare Tefila, and where it occurs, regardless of the prevalence or whether we characterize it as deviant, which I hope we all would, that the harm is the same. 
    It is a harm based on racially motivated conduct and it should be redressed under Section 1982.
