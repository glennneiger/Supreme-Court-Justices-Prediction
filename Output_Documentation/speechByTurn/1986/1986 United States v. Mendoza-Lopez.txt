    We will hear argument next in No. 85-2067, United States versus Jose Mendoza-Lopez and Angel Landeros-Quinones.

    Mr. Christopher J. Wright 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the question presented is whether defendants prosecuted under 8 USC 1326 for reentering the United States following a deportation may collaterally attack the deportation proceeding in the criminal prosecution. 
    The two respondents were arrested by agents of the Immigration and Naturalization Service in October, 1984, in Nebraska. 
    At an immigration hearing in Denver with eleven other aliens they were given a list of free legal services and advised that the proceeding could be delayed if they wished to contact counsel. 
    They waived their right to counsel. 
    The immigration judge questioned each alien at the hearing. 
    Respondents both admitted that they were citizens of Mexico, that they had entered the United States unlawfully, and that they were subject to deportation. 
    The immigration judge advised both respondents that they were eligible to apply for suspension of deportation because they had been in this country more than seven years. 
    The judge explained that to qualify for suspension of deportation an applicant must show that he is of good moral character and that severe harm would be suffered by a member of the applicant's immediate family if he were deported. 
    The judge also stated that the respondents could have five days to apply for suspension of deportation. 
    Both respondents decided not to apply for suspension of deportation.

    Yes, he does, most commonly if indeed a spouse of the alien is an American citizen. 
    The immigration judge ordered that both respondents be deported. 
    He asked whether they wanted to appeal his order, whether they wanted to accept his order, or whether they wanted to reserve decision. 
    Respondents both accepted the order and waved their right to appeal. 
    They were deported to Mexico two days later.

    Respondents sought to dismiss the indictments, contending that their deportation proceeding had been conducted unlawfully. 
    The District Court first considered whether respondents could collaterally attack their deportation proceeding, noting that the circuits are split on the issue and that this Court has not decided the question. 
    It decided that collateral attack is permitted at least to the extent that the court could review the deportation proceeding prior to trial. 
    The District Court then concluded that while the immigration judge had complied with the regulation requiring that he inform respondents that they were eligible to apply for suspension of deportation, that respondents were not in a position to evaluate intelligently that option. 
    The court also found that respondent's decisions not to appeal were not considered judgments. 
    On that basis, it concluded that the hearing was fundamentally unfair and dismissed the indictments. 
    A divided Court of Appeals affirmed.

    That's correct. 
    The Court of Appeals sided with those circuits that hold 
    "that a material element of the offense prohibited by Section 1326 is a lawful deportation. " 
    The court found that this Court's decision in Lewis, where the Court held that a defendant prosecuted for being a felon in possession of a firearm may not collaterally attack their felony convictions is not analogous. 
    The Court of Appeals--

    What does it mean to assume that it is fundamentally unfair?

    I mean, suppose two FBI agents just show up and say we are federal agents, we are going to deport you, and they have no authority whatever, and they will say, we will give you a hearing right now, and they give them a quick hearing, and they decide they are going to deport them. 
    They take them to the border and deport them.

    You have to go before an immigration judge, who signs an order of deportation ordering you to be deported.

    An element of the crime is that you are deported. 
    We are conceding that the deportation hearing was conducted improperly, the specific impropriety found here was that suspension of deportation was not adequately explained to the two respondents.

    Mr. Christopher J. Wright 
    That's correct.

    Mr. Christopher J. Wright 
    Of course that could be appealed, raised on appeal to the Board of Immigration Appeals. 
    Now, your particular example, of course, the alien wouldn't raise it because the hypothetical is that they weren't told of that. 
    It is our position that the alien may still not take the self-help remedy of re-entry, that the proper course is to apply for permission to reenter, and if the alien has an argument that would justify suspension of deportation, for example, he would have an argument that would justify permission to reenter, and that is the proper course.

    Mr. Wright, there is certainly some authority that at least when you are talking about a District Court Judge, which I take it is every bit as sacrosanct as an immigration officer judgment, that if you would find actual bias on the part of the judge, that could be set aside after the judgment has become final.

    The case of Mendez cited in our brief is an example where an alien did that and we would think that in these sort of terrible hypothetical situations that the proceeding ought to be reopened, but that is what we think the course ought to be, that the deportation proceeding ought to be reopened on appeal, or that permission to reenter should be sought from the attorney general, but that it shouldn't be raised following reentry in a criminal prosecution for unlawful reentry.

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    As I understand the Court of Appeals opinion it was not based really on the finding that there were due process violations in the hearing. 
    They simply said you can collaterally attack this, and then went on to say, we think the collateral attack should be sustained here. 
    They didn't base it on any extreme denial of due process in the hearing. 
    They just say you can collaterally attack it for any number of reasons. 
    Isn't that correct? 
    That's correct, and while the District Court said fundamentally unfair here, the irregularity that he identified was failure to explain adequately the requirements of suspension of deportation. 
    Yes, and really that is all we have to decide here is whether on these facts that can be collaterally attacked.

    But you know, you just change the facts a little, you didn't tell them about appeal, they didn't have a translator there.

    An immigration judge won't allow voluntary departure unless that requirement is met.

    Two of them asked for voluntary departure.

    We think that Section 1326 is analogous to the federal statute at issue in Lewis and the federal statute that prohibits escape from federal custody.

    And we think there is no question but that Congress can prohibit unlawful entry as it has. 
    Accordingly it seems to make it even more clear that Congress can make criminal entry into the United States under certain circumstances, and that is all that Congress has done here. 
    It has made criminal... it has made unlawful entry following a deportation a felony subject to two years imprisonment. 
    It seems plain to that Congress could make it unlawful to enter the United States and subject to a felony prosecution if you had polio. 
    That is really all we think that Congress has done here. 
    The legislative history of Section 1326 makes it even more clear that it is the fact of the deportation and not its reliability that is at issue. 
    The predecessor statute contained the phrase "in pursuance of the law". 
    When Congress enacted Section 1326 in 1952, it deleted that phrase from the statute.

speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="1370.655" stopTime="1407.455">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    There is a lot to argue about. 
    Whether some other federal official acting under color of law purporting to be acting officially puts somebody on a boat, whether that is a deportation, I would think it could be called a deportation. 
    So you acknowledge that you are willing to read something into the statute. 
    You say no, it is not anything, it has to be pursuant to the legal formalities before an immigration law judge, so you are not really as virtuous in this thing not reading anything into the statute as you brief makes out. 
    It is just... the quarrel is really over just how much you are going to read into it. 
    That is all.
speaker="christopher_j_wright" startTime="1407.455" stopTime="1683.455">
    Mr. Christopher J. Wright 
    Well, I guess we give some content to the term deportation. 
    We don't think that it has to be a lawful deportation beyond those very simple requirements that I have stressed. 
    I wish I had said that in the brief. 
    I mentioned the fact that Congress deleted the phrase 1952. 
    The ACLU filed an amicus brief contending that although Congress deleted that phrase it wanted to carry forward case law authorizing collateral attack. 
    We showed in our reply brief that there was no such body of case law, but even if there were, deleting the language on which collateral attack would be based seems a most peculiar way to signal any intention to carry forward such a rule. 
    The contrary conclusion, that Congress wanted to make clear that collateral attacks were not allowed, seems to me to be a much more reasonable reading of Congress's action. 
    The dissenting judge in the Court of Appeals and the Second Circuit in its opinion in Potrella noted that Section 1105(a) makes it especially clear that collateral attack is not authorized. 
    None of the Courts of Appeals that have allowed collateral attack have considered this provision. 
    It was not clear under the 1952 Act whether deportations order could be appealed. 
    This Court held in 1955 that review was provided in the Courts of Appeals under the Administrative Procedure Act. 
    The lower courts approved other avenues for judicial review as well. 
    Congress responded in 1961 by enacting Section 1105(a), which provides that appeal from the Board of Immigration Appeals to the Courts of Appeals is the "sole and exclusive procedure" for obtaining judicial review. 
    That is an extraordinarily clear statement of Congress's intent. 
    And it ought to be given force here. 
    Furthermore, Congress provided two exceptions to its rule that appeal from the board to the Courts of Appeals is the sole and exclusive procedure, and one of those exceptions, Section 1105(a)(A)(6), which provides for pretrial review and criminal prosecutions for failure to depart from the United States following an order of deportation makes it clear that Congress was thinking about collateral attack in criminal prosecutions when it enacted Section 1105(a) and that it recognized that absent an exception Section 1105(a) would bar collateral attack on deportation proceedings in criminal prosecutions. 
    But Congress made no exception for prosecutions under Section 1326. 
    Therefore we think there is no such exception. 
    I would like to note briefly that we don't think that there is any reason to construe Section 1326 contrary to its plain language and the language of Section 1105(a) to avoid a serious constitutional question. 
    We think that those concerns were put to rest in Lewis, where the Court said that Congress could constitutionally focus on the fact of a prior proceeding and not its validity in denying a right to collateral attack. 
    This case is not meaningfully different from Lewis because the prior proceeding was administrative. 
    Collateral attack is only useful when the prior proceeding is flawed in some way, and a flawed judicial proceeding is no better than a flawed administrative proceeding, we don't think. 
    In short, the respondents were deported and pulled when they were... first they were given the right to appeal and they waived that right. 
    They were then given a form at the border telling them that they couldn't reenter the United States without obtaining the attorney general's permission, and that they would be subject to a felony prosecution if they did return. 
    We don't think that there is anything unfair about denying them the... about saying that they waived the right to appeal by waiving. 
    I would like to reserve the remainder of my time.

   Argument of Kathy Goudy
speaker="kathy_goudy" startTime="1687.235" stopTime="1762.548">
    Ms. Kathy Goudy 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court, I am here to argue that a deportation order which has not been previously reviewed in a judicial forum in any way can be looked at by a court before it becomes the predicate for a criminal conviction. 
    Such a review is permitted by the legislative history of Section 1326, the reentry after deportation statute, and it is also commensurate with the overall purpose of the Immigration and Nationalization Act. 
    It is important to allow some procedure or format for such a review to determine whether the prior adjudication was after a full and adequate hearing. 
    It is important to ensure that no gross miscarriage of justice occurred in that administrative hearing. 
    And the only way to ensure that is to allow some examination of whether the applicable constitutional, statutory, and regulatory procedures were followed by the administrative judge.

    In the facts of this case, because of the harm that was suffered by their failure to follow up on that suspension, yes, because they were... there is no further right to appeal that deportation. 
    To reenter the country they would have to get a visa. 
    They lost their meaningful time, what was it, seven years, to get the suspension of deportation. 
    Under the new Act they lost their chance for amnesty for the five years. 
    Because of the severity of the harm that occurred, yes, I do feel a gross miscarriage of justice occurred in their deportation hearing. 
    What was filed in the District Court was a request for a procedural review of some sort of the actual deportation hearing. 
    It was called alternatively a request for collateral attack, permission to bring up a collateral attack at the jury trial, and also a motion to suppress, in pursuant to Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure 12B. 
    The thrust behind it was that it is impossible to learn if there is a gross miscarriage of justice unless there is some forum established to look at the facts, and that the criminal conviction must rest upon a lawful and adequate deportation order. 
    The deportation in this order was found by the Court to be unreliable.

    If something happened which caused the judge to find them deportable when they really weren't deportable, that might be something else, but here really your only claim is, he should have told them that there was another avenue of discretionary relief that they might have pursued. 
    Maybe he should have told them that, but I find it hard to say that that renders the deportation fundamentally unfair, and that is what you are arguing here.

    Right, the fundamental unfairness was found to be severe in that they wouldn't have gone across the border if they had been allowed to apply for the discretionary relief. 
    If they wouldn't have gone across the border an appeal could have been filed under 1105(a) under any of the formats available there. 
    If they wouldn't have gone across the border, they might have their green cards today and be legal residents of the United States. 
    And that was the substantial harm that was found that made that fundamentally unfair.

    They are very hard... they would be very hard to win it. 
    I don't know the answer to that question. 
    The government's position appears to be that Section 1326 should be read as not reading in the word "lawful" into the word "deportation". 
    The language of 1326 when it uses the word "deportation" is ambiguous on its face. 
    Deportation as defined in 1252 means a lot of different things. 
    Deportation is the order to show case you are served with. 
    Deportation is the hearing you have in front of the judge in which suspension of deportation is a secondary part. 
    Deportation is the warrant that is signed after the hearing, and deportation is when you are finally placed across the border. 
    It is entirely conceivable and happens in many cases that a person is deported and still here in the United States for many years on appeal of that deportation order. 
    The legislative history of Section 1326 offers little credence to the government's position that Congress intended to allow any deportation, even an unlawful deportation, to be reviewed for its factual basis.

    The government's isn't. 
    The complete explanation would be that there were about four statutes all involving some form of criminal penalty for reentry after deportation. 
    There was one for reentry of radicals, one for reentry of prostitutes, one for reentry of procurers, and one for kind of a general reentry statute. 
    And they all got merged. 
    There was a 1950 Senate report which was about the only discussion on this statute that is available in the legislative history, and in that--

    Why do you need legislative history to tell you what it means when the statute at one time reads "deportation in pursuance of law" and then when Congress gets through amending it it no longer reads "in pursuance of law"? 
    I would think that meaning is pretty clear without any legislative history.

    Ms. Kathy Goudy 
    And the other statutes just sort of disappeared.

    Also, the "in pursuance of law"; all of them use different languages. 
    Furthermore, the "in pursuance of law" was not deleted. 
    It got moved to Section 1101(g), which also has some explanatory explanation about whether or not you are deported if you pay to go across the border or if the government pays your way across.

    The language is inapplicable... it it not inapplicable. 
    The sense is the same in the section, but the language is so completely different. 
    There were a lot of words that were deleted from there. 
    There also is absolutely no legislative history of any kind to make it... to show that Congress explicitly meant to block any form of collateral attack, and because this is a criminal statute, an explicit intent to take away an individual's right has to be found in the legislative history before it can be interpreted.

    What case of ours do you rely on for that?

    Ms. Kathy Goudy 
    I am referring in general to the rule of lenity. 
    I could obtain a case and submit it later if you wish.

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    You say this is a part of the rule of lenity that if Congress is going to make a criminal statute more severe that it previously had, it has to explicitly find that it it taking away something from a defendant or explicitly say so?
speaker="kathy_goudy" startTime="2530.508" stopTime="2604.478">
    Ms. Kathy Goudy 
    No, that is not what I meant. 
    What I meant was, is that if you are going to read negative connotations into a statute, there has to be some intent of Congress to show that those individual rights that are going to be taken away, the right to have some form of judicial review before being placed in jail, has to exist. 
    If there is question in how you can interpret a statute and it can't be resolved by looking at the legislative history, it should be resolved in favor of the defendants. 
    I would also... in conclusion what I want to state then is that what we asked for and was granted was some forum, some access to bring this hearing to the attention of a job, because how are you going to know if there was a gross miscarriage of justice unless you give a person some access in to have it reviewed? 
    A right with no enforcement provision into it is illusory. 
    Thank you. 
   
   
   
   Rebuttal of Christopher J. Wright

    Thank you, Ms. Goudy. 
    Mr. Wright, you have three minutes remaining.

    Mr. Christopher J. Wright 
    Thank you. 
    I would like to make two points. 
    One is that the immigration judge here clearly explained to respondents that they had the right to appeal or to accept his ruling or to reserve judgment. 
    The District Court said that he thought to choose not to appeal was not a considered judgment, but the tape of the proceeding clearly shows that this was more than adequately explained. 
    I would also like to make the point that under the statute at issue in Lewis, a person would not be convicted of a crime if four FBI agents hauled him into a barn and held a trial, and everyone would agree that that is not a conviction. 
    The analogous sort of deportation--

    I imagine there are some people if you asked them whether an FBI agent points a gun at you and hauls you across the border, have you been deported, I think some people might say yes.
