Texas v. New Mexico
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="0.000" stopTime="65.975">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    We will hear argument next in No. 65 Original, Texas versus New Mexico. 
    Ms. Uram, you on behalf of New Mexico, I understand, may proceed whenever you are ready.
speaker="charlotte_uram" startTime="65.975" stopTime="99.116">
    Ms. Charlotte Uram 
    That's correct. 
    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the heart of the current controversy under the Pecos River Compact lies in two issues. 
    First, whether the Court may decide the critical, the ultimate issue in this case, did man's activities in New Mexico cause all or part of the shortfall at the state line on the basis of inference or presumption?
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="99.116" stopTime="102.646">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    I take it New Mexico accepts the determination of the shortage--
speaker="charlotte_uram" startTime="102.646" stopTime="103.786">
    Ms. Charlotte Uram 
    Yes, Your Honor.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="103.786" stopTime="104.364">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    --or the shortfall?
speaker="charlotte_uram" startTime="104.364" stopTime="111.127">
    Ms. Charlotte Uram 
    The master found that there were 340,000 acre feet departure. 
    We do not take exception.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="111.127" stopTime="111.424">
    Unknown Speaker 
    So we can start there.
speaker="charlotte_uram" startTime="111.424" stopTime="216.445">
    Ms. Charlotte Uram 
    That's correct. 
    The second issue is whether the Court should order New Mexico to pay in the future water in excess of its compact obligation to make up for a shortfall from 1950 to 1983 when New Mexico's obligation was unknown. 
    As Justice White pointed out to the Court the master did recommend a 340,000 acre foot shortfall be determined here. 
    We take no exception to that. 
    What New Mexico does take exception to is that the master recommended that that entire amount of shortfall be presumed or inferred due to man's activities in New Mexico. 
    New Mexico also takes exception to the master's proposal for relief. 
    The master proposed actually four items for relief. 
    First, he proposed that there be prospective relief, and we do not take exception to that. 
    That is required under the compact. 
    But then he went on to propose, to recommend that New Mexico also be required to pay water and to pay in water for shortfalls from 1950 to 1983. 
    He recommended that New Mexico be required to pay that amount of water in a maximum time period of 13 years when the shortfalls accrued over a 34-year period. 
    And finally, he recommended that the Court order New Mexico to pay water interest at Treasury bill rates if New Mexico falls too far short.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="216.445" stopTime="218.195">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    How would that be determined?
speaker="charlotte_uram" startTime="218.195" stopTime="226.567">
    Ms. Charlotte Uram 
    He said it was to be determined according to the Treasury bill rate on the day when New Mexico is found to be--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="226.567" stopTime="230.159">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Yes, but what would the interest rate be applied to?
speaker="charlotte_uram" startTime="230.159" stopTime="238.438">
    Ms. Charlotte Uram 
    --It would be applied to the 340,000 acre foot amount, whatever had been short.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="238.438" stopTime="243.842">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    What do you do? 
    You say 10 percent of 320,000 or so many acre feet?
speaker="charlotte_uram" startTime="243.842" stopTime="247.060">
    Ms. Charlotte Uram 
    That's correct, Your Honor. 
    He established a system in which--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="247.060" stopTime="248.871">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    You mean the interest would be paid in water?
speaker="charlotte_uram" startTime="248.871" stopTime="250.074">
    Ms. Charlotte Uram 
    --The interest would be paid--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="250.074" stopTime="250.730">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Or in money?
speaker="charlotte_uram" startTime="250.730" stopTime="263.552">
    Ms. Charlotte Uram 
    --in water. 
    It would be an interest payment in water that he recommended. 
    And New Mexico takes exception to not the prospective relief but all aspects of the retroactive relief.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="263.552" stopTime="288.089">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Why do you call this retroactive relief? 
    I find that a curious terminology for this. 
    In that sense any relief in an ordinary contract claim you would consider to be retroactive relief? 
    You break a contract with me and I sue you for the breach, for the damages that I have suffered. 
    You would consider that retroactive relief?
speaker="charlotte_uram" startTime="288.089" stopTime="311.471">
    Ms. Charlotte Uram 
    No, Your Honor, we feel that this case is different, and we do use the word "retroactive" with the intention of pointing out that New Mexico's obligation, exactly what that amount of water is, is not known until man's activities are determined by this Court. 
    So at that point we will know the obligation. 
    It is as if--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="311.471" stopTime="324.544">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    You don't even say the same in a contracts case. 
    I mean, sometimes you don't know definitely what your obligation was until there is a lawsuit and the court tells you precisely what it was. 
    But you had it. 
    It was there.
speaker="charlotte_uram" startTime="324.544" stopTime="343.208">
    Ms. Charlotte Uram 
    --That may very well be, Your Honor. 
    We are not... it doesn't matter whether one calls it retroactive or something else. 
    The point is that we are being asked to pay back water for shortfalls that occurred over 34 years. 
    New Mexico did not know its obligation at that time.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="343.208" stopTime="347.737">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    But is your conclusion from that that you shouldn't have to pay it back at all?
speaker="charlotte_uram" startTime="347.737" stopTime="353.252">
    Ms. Charlotte Uram 
    That's correct, Your Honor. 
    We should not have to pay back any water under the compact.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="353.252" stopTime="377.336">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well, what good is a compact like this if, you know, you and Texas enter into an agreement that says you will only use a certain amount of water coming down the Pecos, and in fact New Mexico uses what it probably in good faith things it has a claim to but which later a master interpreting the contract says, no, you didn't have a claim to. 
    Do you say, well, we will just kiss and make up, and from now on we will obey the compact?
speaker="charlotte_uram" startTime="377.336" stopTime="381.460">
    Ms. Charlotte Uram 
    I understand the Court's difficulty. 
    But the compact is--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="381.460" stopTime="382.178">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    It is a considerable one.
speaker="charlotte_uram" startTime="382.178" stopTime="405.466">
    Ms. Charlotte Uram 
    --Well, the compact does provide relief, and the compact specifically provided this prospective relief for two reasons, and that prospective relief is real, Your Honor. 
    The foundation of the question of what good is this compact is the assumption that there is no relief unless there is relief for past water due.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="405.466" stopTime="406.168">
    Unknown Speaker 
    What is the relief?
speaker="charlotte_uram" startTime="406.168" stopTime="410.230">
    Ms. Charlotte Uram 
    The relief is future water. 
    In this case, for example--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="410.230" stopTime="416.181">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, I know, but suppose we said prospective relief is all you can get, and then New Mexico promptly doesn't deliver the water again?
speaker="charlotte_uram" startTime="416.181" stopTime="417.321">
    Ms. Charlotte Uram 
    --Well, then New Mexico--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="417.321" stopTime="420.398">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Then you are back in court, and you say only prospective relief.
speaker="charlotte_uram" startTime="420.398" stopTime="432.019">
    Ms. Charlotte Uram 
    --That may be a different point, Your Honor. 
    At that point it is possible that the court could order different relief, but at this point the compact does not permit it.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="432.019" stopTime="450.840">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    I don't see... well, with due respect, Ms. Uram, it is just like saying, if, you know, somebody's dog bites me and I try to sue and you say, well, you know, you will get relief, we will prevent him from biting you again. 
    That is not relief for the first bite. 
    You are saying here the first bite is free.
speaker="charlotte_uram" startTime="450.840" stopTime="566.356">
    Ms. Charlotte Uram 
    Let me sort out the stages, and perhaps we will see that it is not a bite. 
    There are two stages that one is concerned with under the compact. 
    The first stage is the one that the Court is now approaching. 
    What is New Mexico's obligation? 
    That is the first stage. 
    The compacting parties have specifically considered whether at that stage they should provide for retroactive relief for debit-credit accounting, and they said no. 
    They said no for two reasons. 
    The first reason is that they felt that they wanted to leave the compact flexible to accommodate change in the future, and so when they selected a method which required such complicated analysis, they said, we don't know enough about this river. 
    This is an extremely difficult river. 
    Let us leave it open in the future to change, to correction of the method, to replacement of the system to more accurately define the obligation. 
    And if we tie it to a debit-credit system it would be impossible for the parties, it will make it very difficult for the parties to make the changes that are required that should happen in the future in this dynamic compact. 
    So that was the first reason that they said when we are arriving at New Mexico's obligation in the first instance, when we are trying to define man's activities, when we are coming to that point, in that instance there will not be retroactive relief, and they had a second reason which is related to the first. 
    That second reason is that New Mexico cannot know exactly what its obligation is until the obligation is determined in light of the man's activities finding. 
    It cannot know in advance exactly what that amount of water will be. 
    So there is no wrong. 
    There is no wrong--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="566.356" stopTime="587.004">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Excuse me. 
    It doesn't have to-- 
    --That is true about a requirements contract or lots of other kinds of things that aren't in the area of interstate compact. 
    Someone agrees to take all of his requirements. 
    Now, there may be arguments what those requirements are. 
    Ultimately a court may tell that person, your requirements were different than you thought they were, but the contract would nonetheless be enforced, don't you think?
speaker="charlotte_uram" startTime="587.004" stopTime="600.875">
    Ms. Charlotte Uram 
    --Yes, and there is enforcement here, and that enforcement is prospective at this point. 
    At a later point if there is a violation of the compact which we do not have here, if there is a violation of the compact, perhaps other relief would be appropriate.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="600.875" stopTime="619.602">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    I don't really understand this point about New Mexico not knowing what... New Mexico is supposed to be pouring water into the river if the level isn't at a proper flow. 
    The requirement was very simple. 
    Don't take any water out of it by man's activities. 
    Wasn't that the sum total of the requirements imposed on New Mexico?
speaker="charlotte_uram" startTime="619.602" stopTime="666.536">
    Ms. Charlotte Uram 
    Well, the requirement is actually quite complicated, Justice Scalia. 
    It is not simple to administer and it is not simple to know. 
    That is why this litigation has taken so long. 
    It is according to the depletions as it appeared on the river in 1947. 
    That is the first step. 
    You have to determine the depletion on the river as it occurred in 1947. 
    The second step is, you have to determine by a fairly complicated inflow, outflow method the second step, the extent to which there were shortfalls. 
    And then there is the third step, which is the ultimate issue in this case, the issue that sets New Mexico's obligation, and that is to what extent did man's activities in New Mexico cause the departure.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="666.536" stopTime="681.671">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Yes, but as far as New Mexico's obligations were concerned, what obligations did New Mexico have other than not to take away from the river by man's activities any more than had been taken away by man's activities in 1947?
speaker="charlotte_uram" startTime="681.671" stopTime="687.527">
    Ms. Charlotte Uram 
    That is the obligation, but to do that you have to go through fairly complicated mathematical--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="687.527" stopTime="692.339">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    No, you don't. 
    All you have to do is conduct no additional man's activities after 1947.
speaker="charlotte_uram" startTime="692.339" stopTime="785.850">
    Ms. Charlotte Uram 
    --No, Your honor, that's not correct, because the standard is not tied to uses in New Mexico in 1947. 
    In other words, New Mexico cannot maintain all of the uses that it had on the river in 1947. 
    It is tied to depletions which had appeared on the river, and rivers, particularly this river, which is tied to two separate aquifer systems, don't show depletions right away. 
    It takes a while for the water to get there, and different rainfalls may cause different effects, and changing where a well is located may cause different effects. 
    So it is not as simple as it sounds. 
    As a factual matter it is extremely difficult to know exactly how much water you need, exactly what you need to do to remain in compliance with the standard. 
    And I would point out, Justice Scalia, in light of your concern, didn't New Mexico know and didn't New Mexico do what it needed to do, the answer is that in 1961 and '62, when this commission made findings, New Mexico believed that it was in compliance according to those commission findings, and so it did continue to administer the river according to the commission findings at that period. 
    It regulated all uses. 
    It didn't let people make new uses which would have an effect on the river. 
    It took all those steps in order to assure that it would remain in compliance with the commission findings.

    Who will benefit from the water, the increased water usage? 
    Suppose you delivered the extra 34,000 acre feet a year into Texas. 
    Is that water distributed according to a water system in Texas, priority? 
    Is that it?

    Ms. Charlotte Uram 
    I assume so, Your Honor, but the record does not provide any testimony of exactly how Texas will use the water. 
    The only testimony that was provided was one anecdotal witness, and from her testimony we can calculate that if it were applied to the land, the most acreage that it could benefit is in the 4,000 to 10,000 acre range. 
    So you would be shutting down a minimum of 112,000 acres in New Mexico to benefit a maximum--

    Whatever they are going to use it for, it is hard to believe that they wouldn't accept a certain amount of money for the water instead. 
    I mean, there is no reason you can't get out of this by paying money. 
    It is just a question of whether you are going to have to buy the water from Texas or whether the special master is going to have to figure out how much a foot acre of water is. 
    Did Texas stipulate to damages if the... or did they oppose... they want water rather than money.

    That is just what I can't believe. 
    I mean, I don't care how much water they are getting. 
    I am sure they will accept a monetary settlement for the water. 
    It may have been in Texas's economic interest to get a water judgment first and then have New Mexico bargain with Texas about how much New Mexico will pay instead of the water, but I have no reason to believe that Texas would behave so irrationally as not to... if in fact the water is worth more to you than to them, I am sure they would come to an economic adjustment in dollars.
speaker="charlotte_uram" startTime="1223.824" stopTime="1298.936">
    Ms. Charlotte Uram 
    Justice Scalia, there was an exchange that addressed the issue of monetary payment in lieu of water, and there was a letter written from counsel of the State of Texas in response to New Mexico's offer to pay water, and the response is dated October 28, 1986. 
    It is not a matter of this record but it is public knowledge and public record, and it says, 
    "Texas has considered whether any amount of money might compensate Texas for the water owed us. " 
    and then it continues, 
    "We have determined that the answer must be no. " 
    "Only payment of the debt in water will suffice to compensate Texas. " 
    "The minimum acceptable payment must be 340,100 acre feet coupled with specific guarantees of future compact compliance. " 
    We are not settling on the basis of money to compensate New Mexico for that reason. 
    But the basic question is, if there were to be any equitable relief for Texas, how would anyone know what it is to be? 
    We do not even know what the hardship might have been to Texas in all these years for lack of water.

    Ms. Charlotte Uram 
    You do look at both of those factors.

    Ms. Charlotte Uram 
    That is correct, Your Honor, but if I understand correctly, you know, the analysis on the payment for anything past due if there is to be such payment is not within the framework of a contract, because this contract, the contracting parties here specifically rejected retroactive or any kind of payback system. 
    They rejected that for reasons having to do with the way they wanted this compact to work, and those reasons are still valid. 
    So it is only if the Court goes beyond and equity intervenes that the Court... it is within that equity authority that the Court would be looking to consider any other sort of relief.

    Ms. Charlotte Uram 
    --That's correct.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="1443.181" stopTime="1451.725">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    And there was a major difference between you two states, and that question came up here twice, didn't it?
speaker="charlotte_uram" startTime="1451.725" stopTime="1559.059">
    Ms. Charlotte Uram 
    That's correct. 
    Let me turn quickly to the question of man's activities, but let me make one more point on hardship, and that is, there is no evidence of any hardship in this record to Texas. 
    The sole testimony is from one anecdotal witness, and her testimony suggests that in fact her hardships were unrelated to any activity by New Mexico. 
    On the question of the basic man's activities determination, the reason that New Mexico is before the Court on this question is that this is the first time that the man's activities issue is being decided, and it is of critical importance to us that this precedential issue be done in the way New Mexico bargained for when New Mexico entered into this compact. 
    When New Mexico agreed to this compact at the outset of the negotiations in 1943 New Mexico made it plain that because this river was so variable, and because the calculations required were so extremely difficult to do correctly, New Mexico wanted to ensure that it would never be charged for any losses which were not found due, which were not shown due to man's activities in New Mexico. 
    The problem here is that what the court, what the master heard evidence on was not man's activities in New Mexico. 
    He never heard evidence, what are man's activities in New Mexico and how do they affect the river? 
    Now, what would this hearing have looked like if he had heard such evidence? 
    Well, it would have--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="1559.059" stopTime="1560.884">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    He found that they weren't due to natural causes.
speaker="charlotte_uram" startTime="1560.884" stopTime="1561.493">
    Ms. Charlotte Uram 
    --That's correct.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="1561.493" stopTime="1569.788">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    And so you then say, well, those weren't due to natural causes, now let's have a hearing to decide what they were due to?
speaker="charlotte_uram" startTime="1569.788" stopTime="1572.959">
    Ms. Charlotte Uram 
    That's correct, because the departure--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="1572.959" stopTime="1577.785">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    What is one of the possibilities other than man if it isn't nature?
speaker="charlotte_uram" startTime="1577.785" stopTime="1583.328">
    Ms. Charlotte Uram 
    --There are unknowns, but that doesn't answer your question, Justice White, because--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="1583.328" stopTime="1585.921">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    So there is a third category, unknown?
speaker="charlotte_uram" startTime="1585.921" stopTime="1639.993">
    Ms. Charlotte Uram 
    --There is a third category but that still doesn't answer the question you raise, which is, if we have accounted for natural losses, why do we have to consider man's activities, and the reason is that the accounting for the natural losses is done on the basis, as this Court noted in 1983, of speculation about what some of those entries are to balance the books, and as this Court also noted in 1983, the inflow-outflow analysis which enables anyone to look and to make those determination does not say a thing about causes. 
    It doesn't address causes. 
    It lumps everything together. 
    So you cannot tell, as this Court noted, as Judge Brightenstein noted in his two previous reports, you cannot tell from looking at any information through the inflow-outflow method what happened in New Mexico on man's activities.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="1639.993" stopTime="1671.387">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    I thought the master conducted a hearing on this very question, Texas had a burden of proof and submitted whatever it was, Exhibit Number 79 or whatever, yes, Texas Exhibit 79, which purported to account for the loss in water, and New Mexico didn't produce anything in opposition, and the master made his decision. 
    What is the matter with that?
speaker="charlotte_uram" startTime="1671.387" stopTime="1686.616">
    Ms. Charlotte Uram 
    The thing that is wrong with it is that what the master heard at the hearing was the second stage analysis, departures and adjustments to departures. 
    In other words, he considered what was not man's activities, so he said here are the departures.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="1686.616" stopTime="1695.676">

    Ms. Charlotte Uram 
    No, that's not correct, Your Honor. 
    Both parties put on evidence as to what was not man's activities. 
    New Mexico was of the understanding that there was to be further consideration of New Mexico's position, which is that you need to have your affirmative evidence on the extent to which man's activities in New Mexico might have caused these departures.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="1715.496" stopTime="1722.932">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    If you needed that affirmative evidence, would there have been any need to compute the 1947 flow. 
    What was the purpose of that?
speaker="charlotte_uram" startTime="1722.932" stopTime="1730.851">
    Ms. Charlotte Uram 
    Because the standard against which everything is measured, you do the 1947 flow and all those computations annually.

    And the conditions.
speaker="charlotte_uram" startTime="1732.929" stopTime="1741.113">
    Ms. Charlotte Uram

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    But why? 
    I mean, if each of man's activities has to be proven, you are wasting time to go Pack and figure out what the... the whole purpose of computing the '47 flow was to see if there is any decrease from that flow, and in order... and when you find a decrease you then find what was naturally caused, and the rest is man's activities. 
    Otherwise you are going to have to show man's activities diverted so much water this year, man's activities diverted so much water the next year. 
    If that must be proven, you have wasted a whole lot of time figuring out anal the '47 flow was, haven't you?

    This particular river is so difficult, and if the rains come in at one place as opposed to another place it has a whole different effect on the river.

    You are wasting--

    Ms. Charlotte Uram 
    --New Mexico recommended in the negotiations that there be no standard but Texas wanted a standard, and so as a consequence we do have a standard, and then a further limitation to man's activities under the standard.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="1843.796" stopTime="1855.074">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Well, it seems to me the whole purpose of the standard is to figure out what the natural flow of the river was, and then you can deduct from that standard whatever natural diversions had occurred in the interim and all the rest would be man's activities.
speaker="charlotte_uram" startTime="1855.074" stopTime="1917.642">
    Ms. Charlotte Uram 
    The natural flow is not that reliable. 
    Even the master has recommended that there be a 20 percent good faith margin set on delivery to account for the variability of this river. 
    Look at the numbers in Table 2 of Texas's Exhibit 79 that is attached to our brief. 
    Variations like that do not occur on a regular river with regular uses, with regularly accounted for natural losses. 
    The losses here, the natural losses are estimated. 
    If the water, if the rain comes in, for example, Justice Scalia, at the top of the river it will still be counted in the analysis but it will never make it to the same... to the state line. 
    If it comes in toward the bottom of the river it will make it to the state line and it will be counted the same, so you will have two different consequences, and the same numbers go in, and the only difference being where does the rain fall. 
    Natural losses account for a great deal of the variation in this river. 
    Thank you. 
   
   
   
   Argument of Renea Hicks
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1917.642" stopTime="1920.719">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Thank you, Ms. Uram. 
    We will hear now from you, Mr. Hicks.
speaker="renea_hicks" startTime="1920.719" stopTime="2023.978">
    Mr. Renea Hicks 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, I think on the question of what New Mexico has termed retroactive relief, which is really giving Texas the water that it failed to deliver over all those years, the 1983 unanimous decision of this Court has already settled that question. 
    New Mexico has offered the Court no reason to revisit that decision. 
    In 1983, at the conclusion of the opinion, the Court returned the case to the special master to conclude the proceedings, which is what this special master now has done, and said determine first... there are two subsidiary questions that you need to determine. 
    First, for each year of the period in dispute, and it is 1950 to 1983, under the 1947 condition, what is the difference between the... well, what is the difference between the amount of water New Mexico is supposed to deliver under the 1947 condition and the amount it actually delivered. 
    And the second question is, to what extent were any underdeliveries under that, in the answer to that question due to man's activities. 
    The special master and the parties have spent the four years since then answering these questions, and New Mexico has asked you all now to turn that into nothing but a very expensive academic exercise that is just to train people in hydrology or something. 
    I am not sure why they want it that way. 
    This is water that Texas bargained for in the compact in 1950 or in 1949 when the compact was approved by Congress. 
    If Texas had wanted--

    Now, at the remedy stage I suppose that Texas could have tried to insist that it is our water, it has been determined that it is our water, deliver very bit of it right now in New Mexico.

speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="2082.469" stopTime="2094.277">

    Mr. Renea Hicks 
    Only to a limited extent. 
    There is a realistic geographical, geological limitation on how much can come down in one year, and in fact how much can be used in one year, I suppose. 
    If all 340,000 acre feet came down in one year, I don't think it could happen, first, and secondly, if it did you would wipe out--

    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Well, I mean, let's suppose, and this isn't your situation, I guess, but let's suppose that we have existing, preexisting uses in New Mexico and land being farmed for many generations, and dependent upon the water, and we have land in Texas which has never received the water that it says it was entitled to receive, and it has no immediate consequence of a delay in receiving the shortfall. 
    Now, is that a concern that we can be considering in determining what to do about it?

    Mr. Renea Hicks

    Mr. Renea Hicks 
    In the courts... I think the only equitable considerations that the Court can give are realistically how much time should New Mexico be given to get this water down given the circumstances in the basin, and it isn't the individual economic circumstances of the people that live along the river, because you have to remember there used to be farmers in Texas farming this land. 
    After the compact was entered the water has essentially quit flowing. 
    They still do some farming. 
    They are there and ready to come back. 
    There is testimony to that effect. 
    So any harm that the Court sees--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="2219.232" stopTime="2224.793">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Up to a maximum of 10,000 acres ready to receive it, right?

    --They are ready to receive for the past, the payback, the debt, 34,000 acre feet a year. 
    And this would be over 17 years, essentially, not over ten, as New Mexico has depicted it. 
    On top of that, it is very important to Texas, and I think it is the only way this case can ever end is that there be an injunction against New Mexico for the future to abide by the compact, a very specific injunction, and--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="2252.860" stopTime="2257.390">

    Mr. Renea Hicks 
    --It is very difficult to determine, and when you begin looking over 34 years of failure to deliver, the hearing, the evidentiary hearing which would be required and which New Mexico has waited until after the proceedings are over to ask for so that it would further delay the case, the hearing would be extremely complicated to determine what the value was in 1950 of the water they failed to deliver, the water in '51, in '52, the consequential damages not just to the Pecos River basin in Texas but to all of Texas. 
    I think there are just unbelievable difficulties in that. 
    I think--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="2304.233" stopTime="2338.472">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Of course, it doesn't really solve that problem, because in fact giving you however many hundred thousand acre feet of water in 1995 is not the same as giving you the same number in 1933. 
    It may be worth much more in 1995 than it was in 1932. 
    I mean, superficially it looks as though the fairest way is to give you the water you didn't get, but in fact when you didn't get it back in 1952 it may not have been worth nearly what it is going to be worth when you finally do get it.

    Mr. Renea Hicks 
    It is an equitable remedy, but I don't think the courts that order specific performance in contract cases, for instance, decide how long you have to pay back what you owe. 
    It is a decision that equity demands specific performance in this case because of the particularly unique resource, and that is the situation here. 
    It isn't an equitable decision to say New Mexico has 50 years to pay it back.

    As a matter of fact, that is not economically very efficient, to tell New Mexico farmers who will be able to use it after the payoff is done that they have to get out and come back 15 years later, or whenever the... 17 years later, okay, and to tell Texas farmers you can come in and farm for ten years but you've got to know you can set up this farm but after ten years there is just not going to be water for it. 
    That just isn't very efficient and I wouldn't... I frankly wouldn't favor it if I didn't think that if it is that senseless it wouldn't be economically favorable for the two of you to get together and work it out in money.

    Mr. Renea Hicks 
    I don't think the Court has a choice on that.

    Mr. Renea Hicks 
    I don't think it realistically does because I don't think anybody in New Mexico realistically expects that somebody would be kept in jail a year while we do the calculations to find out if he should be, and I just don't think that is realistic, and I think that is what New Mexico has counted on all along in this case, go be quite honest, is that they have thought that when the judiciary's back is against the wall to order relief in this, it is going to be so massive in their view, as they are going to depict it, that it is going to hurt to do it, and the court is going to see that and say let's find an easier way.

    Justice Byron R. White 
    I know, but if the payback were not in water but in money, then you would be starting out now from the point I hypothesized of 15 years later, and New Mexico would just have the obligation to pay the annual amount and if it didn't, you would have to find some way of enforcing the injunction.

    The problem with that is, it is going to delay Texas ever getting any relief by at least five years. 
    It would take five years to adjudicate this, I am convinced, and New Mexico waited until the end. 
    It would delay further for a reason that is independent of the two states in a way that would only harm Texas. 
    It would delay our relief when, on the other hand, if the Court ordered that water be repaid, then it puts for the next three years while New Mexico is getting its house in order to do the payback, it puts us in a position where each state has to begin to evaluate how much is it--

    You can consume all the money at once. 
    You can't consume... the water, the final water payment you say won't be in until 17 years.

    Is there any claim on the part of individual landowners to this money, or can Texas just plant a bunch of tree farms over around Marshall with it if they want to?

    This is... I don't know.

    Mr. Renea Hicks 
    I agree... I don't disagree with any of these speculations. 
    It is just that I don't see what standards the Court has about it.

    Mr. Renea Hicks 
    --It would be no trouble. 
    I have a fear that my paycheck won't be coming in September if the deficit continues. 
    On the question of whether there was a hearing on man's activities, which is the second crucial issue New Mexico raises, it is clear there was a hearing on man's activities. 
    It could not be clearer in the record. 
    The special master in a discussion with the attorney for New Mexico at the conclusion of all these hearings on May 21st observed to that counsel that he had told them over a year ago of how this particular exhibit, 79, the crucial exhibit, would be treated, how he viewed its working, and Exhibit 79 is kind of the end of an evolutionary process, because the parties exchanged documents, as New Mexico says in its brief, the precursors to this exhibit, for a year before the final hearing. 
    New Mexico was on notice. 
    On May 22nd of 1985 the special master entered an order that in Paragraph 7 said in November there is going to be a hearing on man's activities, and there was a hearing in November on man's activities.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="3260.522" stopTime="3287.089">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    They may have put it that way but I think their real complaint was not that there was not a hearing, but that the hearing was not one at which the master said, okay, show me what man's activities have taken out of the river. 
    Rather, the hearing was one in which he said, you show me why when you deduct all the natural diversions from the original flow everything else isn't man's activities. 
    It is really a burden of proof complaint they have, isn't it?
speaker="renea_hicks" startTime="3287.089" stopTime="3306.802">
    Mr. Renea Hicks 
    The special master's recommendations are that you find that Texas met... shouldered the burden of proof and met it, and it did. 
    There is testimony to that effect. 
    New Mexico's real complaint is that it failed to put on any evidence and it wants a second chance. 
    It had the opportunity. 
    It was on notice and it did nothing. 
    I don't know why it did nothing.

    Texas didn't shoulder the burden of proof on man's activities.
speaker="renea_hicks" startTime="3366.919" stopTime="3372.683">
    Mr. Renea Hicks 
    No. 
    Texas did... what I was going to say is, Texas did shoulder the burden of proof, notwithstanding its view that it didn't have to. 
    It shouldered the burden of proof--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="3372.683" stopTime="3379.977">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    You did it in a negative sort of way. 
    You said here are the natural causes, and everything else has to be a fortiori man's activities?
speaker="renea_hicks" startTime="3379.977" stopTime="3441.018">
    Mr. Renea Hicks 
    --That is true, and there is no other way to do it. 
    What New Mexico wants is something that is irrelevant under the compact, and that is, it wants not a generic determination of whether man's activities caused the depletions, which is what Texas did through Exhibit 79. 
    What it wants is to be able to trace each activity of man to its origin, to see if Farmer Jones when he irrigated his alfalfa crop caused X amount of depletion. 
    That is irrelevant under the compact. 
    It might be helpful to New Mexico in deciding how it wants to readjust the flows to Texas. 
    It might be helpful to determine that, but it is irrelevant to the proceeding before this Court. 
    It has nothing to do with the case. 
    That is what this problem about unknowns is. 
    It is like a sinister force or something. 
    There is no... it has to be either nature or man's activities. 
    New Mexico... Texas has proven that it is man's activities. 
    New Mexico in essence really wants to say it is this activity of man.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="3441.018" stopTime="3456.513">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    You didn't prove anything unless you proved it in the 1947 assessment, because all you came in and proved was the natural causes that you know of, but the natural causes that you know of, but the natural causes... that is nonproof.
speaker="renea_hicks" startTime="3456.513" stopTime="3457.528">
    Mr. Renea Hicks 
    That is proof.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="3457.528" stopTime="3462.947">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Suppose you hadn't put on any natural causes. 
    Then you would have proven even more man's activities, wouldn't you?
speaker="renea_hicks" startTime="3462.947" stopTime="3511.742">
    Mr. Renea Hicks 
    No, because our proof was, we have take care of every known natural cause that there is. 
    In fact, it is all based on stipulations. 
    And there is nothing left by logic except human causes, and that is not a failure of proof. 
    That is a proof. 
    It is the way a lot of things are proved. 
    And I don't think there is anything wrong with it. 
    There is no other way to ever have this compact work except that way. 
    I don't think it is at all improper. 
    On the water interest I wanted to mention that the water interest, if New Mexico fails to act in good faith as defined under the special master's recommended decree, the water interest does not run on the whole 340,100 acre feet. 
    It runs on the undelivered balance remaining, and it also never starts running until at least 12 years--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3511.742" stopTime="3520.113">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    xxx any shortfall on the 1947 condition delivery, interest doesn't run on that, does it?
speaker="renea_hicks" startTime="3520.113" stopTime="3522.753">
    Mr. Renea Hicks 
    --I am sorry, it there is any shortfall--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3522.753" stopTime="3523.846">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Let's assume--
speaker="renea_hicks" startTime="3523.846" stopTime="3562.503">
    Mr. Renea Hicks 
    --Yes, the future... for the future there is no interest running, so Texas... the equities, I think, in terms of delivery of the payback, the equities have been so fairly balanced. 
    Texas doesn't get any interest if New Mexico acts in good faith. 
    It is only a contingent interest. 
    Even if they get interest it doesn't start running until 12 years after the last adjudicated violation. 
    On top of that, New Mexico has known for at least 13 years since the litigation began that Texas is challenging what they have done, and they have taken absolutely no steps to adjust the activities along that river. 
    Their chief water authority testified that he wouldn't do it unless you all ordered him to.

    Justice Byron R. White 
    --By what percentage did the determination of the amount owed under the compact each year under the '47 condition, by how much will that increase the flow at the state line? 
    By what percentage? 
    Half? 
    How much--
speaker="renea_hicks" startTime="3582.683" stopTime="3588.260">
    Mr. Renea Hicks 
    I think the average flow is approximately 75,000 acre feet over the last 30 years, and this would increase it on an average of 10,000--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3588.260" stopTime="3590.243">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    --Yes, on 10,000 acre feet. 
    All right.
speaker="renea_hicks" startTime="3590.243" stopTime="3590.868">
    Mr. Renea Hicks 
    --So one-seventh.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3590.868" stopTime="3603.098">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    But then if you add on top of that adding 34,000 acre feet a year, 34,000 acre feet isn't far from half of the average annual flow.
speaker="renea_hicks" startTime="3603.098" stopTime="3604.489">
    Mr. Renea Hicks 
    That is true.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3604.489" stopTime="3613.688">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    You add ten onto that, so you are going to be... it is going to be quite a different river, isn't it, at the state line?
speaker="renea_hicks" startTime="3613.688" stopTime="3654.671">
    Mr. Renea Hicks 
    It should be because it would then be the river that we bargained for. 
    It wouldn't be the river as New Mexico has configured it for the last 34 years. 
    That is the reason it is so important for the Court to keep in mind that this is not an equitable apportionment case but a compact case. 
    If Texas had come before the Court in 1920, as it started to, and sought an equitable apportionment, and let's say the order had been entered that would divide the river up as we ultimately did in the compact, there wouldn't be any question right now about is it fair to New Mexico to have to pay back water it withheld. 
    What you, Justice White, are comparing the situation in the future to if they have to comply with the compact is to a situation where they weren't complying with the compact.
