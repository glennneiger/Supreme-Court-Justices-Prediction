    Mr. Albert G. Lauber, Jr. 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    The question here involves the validity of an amendment to the AFDC program that Congress enacted in 1984, a provision I shall refer to as the standard filing unit provision. 
    This amendment was one of many budget cutting steps that Congress took in that year, and it was designed to close what Congress viewed as a loophole in the AFDC eligibility scheme. 
    Under prior law, a family applying for AFDC could try to maximize its AFDC grant by excluding from the filing unit certain family members, typically children who had other sources of income, such as Social Security benefits, child support, or accountable earnings from employment. 
    This enabled the family to get the maximum AFDC grant for the members in the unit, plus keep all of the other income of the members who were left out of the unit. 
    In 1984 Congress decided to eliminate this benefit maximizing option by enacting the provision challenged here. 
    It requires that when a family applies for AFDC, all members of the family who live together must be included in the filing unit, and that the income of all those family members must be added up to figure out how needy the family is for public assistance. 
    Congress based this amendment on the belief that family members who live near the poverty level and who live together tend to share their income and expenses; and that therefore the most reliable index of the family's need for public assistance was the total income of the family members. 
    Thus, rather than simply cutting AFDC to families across the board, Congress sought to target the benefit cuts in 1984 to those families that were, because of the members separate income, less needy. 
    Now, appellees, of course, have no constitutional right to a permanently fixed level of AFDC benefits, and they therefore recognize that they could not bring a constitutional challenge to a decision by Congress simply to cut benefit levels without more. 
    What they argue, therefore, is that Congress did not really cut AFDC benefits here, but rather took property away from the children who are required to be newly included in the filing unit. 
    Appellees focus on child support income, and especially on the assignment provision enacted in 1975 which requires a mother who applies for AFDC to assign to the state any right to support that she or her child may have. 
    This provision was designed to improve collection of delinquent child support by transferring the burden of collection from the abandoned mother to the state with its greater enforcement resources. 
    Now, the assignment provision by itself works no hardship on the family, because for every dollar of support assigned to the state, one dollar of AFDC comes back to the family. 
    Moreover, a family that assigns child support also receives an extra $50 a month from the state by virtue of the child support disregard provision.

    The $200 comes to the family in a different form. 
    It doesn't come qua child support; it comes qua AFDC benefits. 
    But they get the same $200 from a different source, as it were. 
    Plus, if the state actually collects the child support, they get $50 more. 
    So the bottom line is, they have $250, although it comes from a different place, rather than $200 if they just got the child support.

    And here, the state law clearly permits the mother to assign child support in order to get AFDC for the entire family. 
    So it's clear that here state law does permit the mother, in the best interests of that child to support... to assign the support money to the state.

    The AFDC statute permits states to either include or exclude in-kind payments from income for purposes of AFDC eligibility.

    Mr. Albert G. Lauber, Jr. 
    Well, let me co-counsel respond to that. 
    I don't know all the North Carolina cases. 
    But I believe North Carolina has exercised the option not to count in-kind payments as income. 
    So the key thing under North Carolina law is whether the money comes in cash to the mother, to use at her discretion. 
    If it does not, if it comes in kind, or if it is paid to a third party by the parent, that would not count as income.

    Mr. Lauber, may I just follow up on Justice O'Connor's example of the orthodontic special need of one child for whom the support money is designated? 
    Supposing it's not done in kind, but is just the reason the judge fixed the support amount at that amount. 
    And then it goes through the AFDC and comes back to the mother. 
    Would it violate the AFDC rules for the mother to use the money for the purpose intended by the judge, in other words, giving a disproportionate share to the child for whom the support money was paid?

    Mr. Albert G. Lauber, Jr. 
    I think she probably could not. 
    I think it would be real hard to justify that. 
    But in the case of orthodonture, I'd like to point out again that the Medicaid is available to all the children in the filing unit automatically. 
    That's one benefit a child receives by virtue of the assignment, is that he then qualifies for Medicaid immediately, and that could well cover some of these medical expenses. 
    Let me get back to the Constitution. 
    There has to be some kind of constitutional problem with the statute, or it cannot be declared invalid. 
    And as I point out, the first problem with the other side's theory is, under state law, a child does not really have an absolute property right to child support. 
    What he has is a right to have the money used in his best interest. 
    State law permits, and indeed, requires the assignment of support to get AFDC for the family. 
    And state law therefore contemplates that it can be in the child's best interest to have his support money assigned to get AFDC for the family.

    Mr. Albert G. Lauber, Jr. 
    --But that would follow from any decision by Congress to include the... any kind... wouldn't have to supporting him... any kind of income of a child, in determining the need of the family. 
    If the child earned money working at MacDonald's, and he lived with the family, that money would be included as family income, and it might be better to him to live with his father, and have it not be included. 
    But I think it's inevitable if you have a family-based grant, as AFDC is, you've got to look at the income of the people who live in the family to see how needy the family is. 
    And it could be that that would give an incentive, an economic incentive, for people to live in another way. 
    But that's an inevitable consequence of this family grant provision Congress has set up. 
    The second reason we think their taking theory doesn't work is that the participation in the AFDC program is entirely voluntary. 
    If the mother does not want to assign child support, she need not take part in the AFDC program. 
    It is simply one of the many conditions for eligibility for getting public benefits.

    Ms. Catherine C. McLamb 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    The State of North Carolina administers its AFDC program in conformity with Federal law as explained by the Solicitor General and as stated in the briefs for the Appellant. 
    I would like to make two points to this Court. 
    First, the District Court below found an unconstitutional taking based upon its erroneous interpretarion of North Carolina law regarding child support. 
    Secondly, the court committed a fundamental error in ordering retroactive benefits in this case.

    They will attempt to do the exact opposite. 
    The second property right that Judge McMillan found was taken was, as he described it, the exclusive right of the child to enforce the obligation of the parent to spend child support money only on that child. 
    What our... this is simply not the law of North Carolina. 
    What our statutes read is that child support is ordered, the primary obligation is placed upon the mother and the father. 
    Child support is ordered to meet the reasonable needs of the child. 
    Then child support is paid to the custodial parent for the benefit of the child. 
    In North Carolina, the child does have the right to enforce the obligation of the mother to use child support for his or her benefit. 
    North Carolina has, by statute, passed... passed a law that deems the assignment of child support rights, the obligation to receive support, upon the acceptance of public assistance. 
    This is a statute that has been enacted in North Carolina. 
    The rationale of Judge McMillan below--

    In your hypothetical, is that the only income that is coming into that family, is $250 child support for one child? 
    In that case, the mother... it would be within the mother's discretion... these are not easy decisions, but it would be within the mother's discretion to determine what is the best interest of that child. 
    She receives child support under our statutes. 
    The statute does not read, child support shall be received to be spent to benefit that child. 
    Child support is received for the custodial parent to be used for the minor child's benefit.

    The answer is yes if she, within her discretion, determines that that would best benefit her child. 
    That, to me, is a fundamental problem with Judge McMillan's analysis in this case, because he is undermining well established law in North Carolina that the custodial parent has great flexibility in determining what is in the best interest. 
    A parent may not profit at the expense of her child. 
    If this is determined to be the case, an action may be brought on the child's behalf in order to compel the mother to act in his best interest.

   Argument of Jane R. Wettach
speaker="jane_r_wettach" startTime="1877.118" stopTime="1991.891">
    Ms. Jane R. Wettach 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the court: 
    The actual, palpable, financial loss to the plaintiff children in this case is quite apparent from the evidence. 
    The two daughters of Joyce Miles, for example, lost $95 every month of their child support. 
    Similar amounts of money were lost every month by other children in this case. 
    I think it would be helpful if we just walked through an example of how this practice actually works in North Carolina at this time. 
    For example, Joyce Miles has five children. 
    Two of them, the oldest two, are of a different father. 
    The three younger ones, they have separate fathers. 
    The two oldest girls are the beneficiaries of a $189 a month child support payment. 
    It was ordered by the state court judge, who made a decision about the reasonable needs of those children and ordered this father to pay. 
    Prior to 1984, when the rule was imposed, the mother did not receive AFDC assistance for those children; they were separated from the grant. 
    She had three younger who were not as fortunate to have a father who chose to support them, and she received $244 in AFDC for those children. 
    In October of 1984 she received a letter from the State Department of Human Resources, which said, in order to continue receiving AFDC for those children for whom you are getting it, you must add the other children to the grant, and as a part of that, you must make their support available to the state. 
    The state will take that money, keep the money; it will return $50 because there is now a $50 disregard; and we'll give you AFDC benefits.

    --Actually, I would like to take that back. 
    There was the case from which the District Court found much of its law of North Carolina, where a father sued the mother for misusing the child support he was spending, and the court said... actually dismissed the case because the father was the wrong party, and said, the child support money belongs to the children. 
    The father could only bring the suit as next friend. 
    And implicitly authorized the father to be able to sue for that reason, if there were a substantial misuse of the money by the mother, then I think that would be cognizable under state law, under trust theory.

    Ms. Jane R. Wettach 
    --No, I don't think it does. 
    I think when... when participation in the program vis-a-vis the child who is receiving child support is voluntary, the mother can certainly make the choice that the child support that she is getting is inadequate to meet those needs, and therefore, she would like to apply for AFDC, and the condition of eligibility is that she make this assignment and the state take over the responsibility of collecting that support. 
    But when this involuntariness becomes a part of it, that changes how that assignment provision works.

    Justice White 
    Yes, but the state statute permits her to do it, but it doesn't say that when she is... if she would choose, because it's not in the best interest of the child not to do it; but she can't make... that's the problem with the Federal law. 
    It deprives her of being able to voluntarily choose to apply for AFDC for that child, or not apply for AFDC for that child, because the assignment provision would end up not being in the best interest. 
    The assignment provision doesn't change anything about that... when money is paid, it is paid for the best interests of a particular child.

    When you assign your money you are allowing the state to take it in, but it gives it back when you are on the grant and you make the decision to... you use the assignment provision almost as a trade. 
    You will trade in your child support of $50, because $50 isn't adequate to meet a child's needs, so that you can get $100 in AFDC back. 
    But that... when the figures are different, when they say, assign in $100 and get $50 back, that's a very different sort of situation, and a very different sort of choice.

    It seems that it would make more sense for the Court and the Congress to determine... to make a presumption that people were obeying their court orders, in the absence of some evidence to the contrary. 
    I mean, the presumption makes sense that people obey the law, as opposed to, that people don't obey the law. 
    And if... now, of course, under AFDC law, there is an inquiry in every single case of every single applicant about what money they have in the household, and where it is. 
    They send in a monthly report every month, and they have to describe these things. 
    Of course, if there were money being spent, then there may well be accounting for that money, and that's the way it would be... really under current law, there would be that situation, where if she were actually making income available, it would be counted.

 In order to do that, rather than sending the other children away to the poor house or somewhere, I'm going to have to spend some of this support money for them. 
 Wouldn't you think that that would be considered spending that money for the benefit of the child?

    --that would have to be made on an individual basis as to what is in the best interest. 
    And perhaps somebody could prove to a court... a state court in a... in a hearing on it that it was or it wasn't in the best interest of that particular child. 
    But on its face, to take money from one child and spend it on the other child takes away from the state... state court order that says, this $200 is to be used for a particular child; it takes away from the father's expectation that he will support his children, and not be expected to offset expenditures made by the AFDC program for other children to whom he is unrelated.

    Ms. Jane R. Wettach 
    Yes, Justice O'Connor, there was one which was cited in our brief that we were aware of because it was local, and the state... it was a situation where the father was providing a certain amount of support, and he went in and said, look, this is what's happening and what happened in that case is, the state judge ordered that the family be severed for AFDC purpose, and he ordered the county to continue to pay AFDC for the other children, and allowed the father to make in-kind payments to off... so that they wouldn't be counted. 
    And there was another situation that was presented by this case where the father was paying $200 a month voluntarily without a court order. 
    When the benefits were assigned, and he went... and the county brought suit against him, they reduced the amount to $87 a month. 
    So that in fact, they... when you worked out the figures, he didn't lose that much by being on AFDC, but of course, the father was willing and able to pay much more for his support. 
    But it wouldn't have mattered. 
    His child would have stayed at the same standard of living of an AFDC family, regardless of how much the father had paid; and so the support was reduced. 
    The state has not talked too much about the remedy that was imposed. 
    But I'd like to say just a few words about that as it is presented by this case. 
    The state has mentioned in its brief that the remedy was incorrect in this case for a number of reasons. 
    We think it's quite clear from the procedural posture of this case that there was a violation of an injunction. 
    The injunction was entered in 1971, and it was clearly... it was to remedy the exact same thing that was going on in 1971 as part of the state program. 
    At that point it did not have the cloak of Federal authorization as it claims to have now. 
    But it was in fact--

    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    There's not doubt it has that, it has Federal authorization now, is there?

    --It has Federal statutory authorization under their theory of the statute.

    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    I thought your case was purely a constitutional case here, since the passage of the more recent AFDC amendment. 
    Do you still claim that it's not authorized by statute?
speaker="jane_r_wettach" startTime="3259.913" stopTime="3272.473">
    Ms. Jane R. Wettach 
    We have in our brief suggested that the statute can be read in a different way which would not cause the constitutional problems that are caused by the application as it's been given by Secretary Bowen.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="3272.473" stopTime="3275.258">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    But the District Court didn't agree with you on that point?
speaker="jane_r_wettach" startTime="3275.258" stopTime="3335.631">
    Ms. Jane R. Wettach 
    That's correct. 
    But in this case, there has... there was the same activity by the Welfare Department in 1971. 
    That activity was enjoined. 
    And in 1984, it was flouted by the state. 
    The injunction was simply ignored, and the state made a decision to proceed as it had been before 1971, and before it was enjoined. 
    The state has argued that the remedy that the lower court ordered, which was to pay back all the child support money that it had taken, and pay back any AFDC benefits which were withheld, or for families that were terminated as a result of this, would violate the Eleventh Amendment. 
    We think there is no question that it would not violate the Eleventh Amendment for a number of reasons. 
    First of all, of course, it is--

    Ms. Jane R. Wettach 
    Yes. 
    Yes, it was argued below, and it was... the theory was rejected by the lower court, and we would ask this Court to affirm on that issue as well. 
    What had been argued, and is argued here in their briefs, is that the Eleventh Amendment would bar it because this was effectively retroactive benefits. 
    The error in that position is the language of Edelman v. Jordan, which says that the date for determining prospective and retrospective relief is the date of a court-ordered obligation to act otherwise. 
    This court order was entered in 1971. 
    And from then they had to act accordingly. 
    That was a prospective order, and that was not barred in any way by the Eleventh Amendment. 
    The state's position appears to be that as soon as it violated the injunction, anything that it didn't pay was transformed into retroactive payments, and therefore, were barred by the Eleventh Amendment. 
    And we think that that position doesn't make sense, and is not consistent with this court's interpretation of the Eleventh Amendment.

 This other family over here only has $200 that's being used for the whole family.

    We think it would be quite reasonable for the Federal Government, and constitutional, to have looked at that family, looked at the AFDC recipients, and determined how much their need was actually reduced by the fact that someone else in the household may have been sharing the burden of the joint expenses. 
    This is particularly set out in our brief when we talk about an economy of scale reduction that could be made in an AFDC payment. 
    For example, if there... well, there's a chart that talks about, what's the individual's standard of need in a family. 
    And we all know that that individual goes down as the household gets larger, because you need... if you have an apartment that--

    --It's not that they're counted. 
    They're not counted at all. 
    All they're doing is, you recognize that the need of the AFDC recipients is less because they don't have to share the whole... they don't have to pay for... for example, they don't have to pay for all of the rent, or all of the utilities, the shared expenses, because there's someone else with income who is sharing. 
    So maybe there's a quarter of it that is paid by someone who is not in the unit, so they only have to pay for three-quarters of it. 
    So their need is a little bit less.

    Ms. Jane R. Wettach 
    No, I think I told you that there is a way that they can do it. 
    And they can do it in either of the two ways we suggested. 
    Actually, they can do it by an economy of scale reduction of the AFDC recipients, or they can do it by an individual analysis of what is going on in a family, and if money is actually being transferred, they might count it. 
    Let's take an example where there are three people in a household. 
    The child support child gets $100, the other two get $200 in AFDC. 
    The mother uses all the money the same. 
    Their need is the same. 
    To say... then there's no transfer, and that's when Congress can't take it into account. 
    But to say that these two need a little less because there's a person outside the unit who is also contributing is reasonable, and Congress could cut in that matter. 
    And we think that's constitutional, and we would have no complaints with that. 
    If there are no further questions.
