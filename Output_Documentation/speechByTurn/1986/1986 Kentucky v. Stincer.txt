Kentucky v. Stincer
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="0.000" stopTime="11.539">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Mrs. Warren, you may proceed whenever you're ready.
speaker="penny_r_warren" startTime="11.539" stopTime="146.327">
    Ms. Penny R. Warren 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    This case arises from the conviction of Stincer by a jury for first degree oral sodomy of two girls ages seven and eight. 
    Both girls and a four year old boy testified at trial in Stincer's presence. 
    All three described how he blindfolded them with socks and said he was feeding them a pickle. 
    The question in the case, whether he was denied his right of confrontation arises from an in chambers preliminary hearing in which the judge determined whether or not the children were competent to testify. 
    Stincer asked to personally attend that hearing. 
    His request was denied. 
    But counsel was present. 
    On appeal, the Kentucky Supreme Court held that Stincer had an absolute right to be present at the competency hearing. 
    From the Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution and Section 11, of the Kentucky Constitution confrontation clauses. 
    This Court granted Kentucky's request for review. 
    It is our position that the state court erroneously extended the right of confrontation in the Sixth Amendment to a non-adversarial preliminary hearing and that Stincer fails to meet the threshold requirements of due process for a right of presence under that clause. 
    We also believe that the state court erred by refusing to consider whether the alleged claims were harmless. 
    It's first necessary to consider the nature of a competency hearing in Kentucky and in most other jurisdictions. 
    At this competency exam of the two girls that is in issue, it's a very limited hearing with a very limited purpose. 
    There are no facts of the case discussed. 
    Guilt or innocence is not an issue. 
    There are only a dozen or so general questions. 
    How old are you? 
    Where do you live? 
    Where do you go to school? 
    Where do you go to Sunday School? 
    Do you know your teacher's names? 
    The test is whether the children understand the difference between a truth and a lie, the obligation to tell the truth, and whether they are sufficiently intelligent to recall and relate past facts.

    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    Mrs. Warren, you refer to this as a preliminary hearing?
speaker="penny_r_warren" startTime="150.196" stopTime="151.662">
    Ms. Penny R. Warren 
    Yes, Your Honor.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="151.662" stopTime="162.170">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    I take it from the way you describe it. 
    It isn't the sort of preliminary hearing that one had in Arizona xxx where it's to decide whether you should be bound over for trial.

    No, Your Honor, I meant preliminary only in that--

    Pre-trial.

    Pre-trial.
speaker="penny_r_warren" startTime="169.943" stopTime="183.184">
    Ms. Penny R. Warren 
    Pre-trial. 
    Respondent has challenged the term pre-trial although he used it in describing it in a state court, in that the jury was sworn. 
    But an initial determination, if you will, of the children's xxx.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="183.184" stopTime="186.002">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    And it could happen before the trial, it could happen during the trial. 
    The judge holds--
speaker="penny_r_warren" startTime="186.002" stopTime="265.655">
    Ms. Penny R. Warren 
    During trial. 
    Anytime. 
    It typically is a couple of weeks before, a couple of days before. 
    In this instance it was before any evidence was received at all. 
    But, after the jury was sworn in a short recess and motion practice beginning the case. 
    In the competency hearing, the children are not witnesses. 
    They are potential witnesses, but if they're declared incompetent, certainly they would never be a witness. 
    They're not witnesses in the sense of the Sixth Amendment right of confrontation. 
    Nor, is their testimony against him, as the Confrontation Clause requires when it begins to attach. 
    The decision is a very limited one for the trial court. 
    It is, really a substitute for an oath, if you will, for an adult. 
    Counsel was present and in this case allowed to question the children after the court concluded its questions. 
    At trial, Stincer was present. 
    The children were present when they testified. 
    He was able to communicate with counsel. 
    The trial court placed no restrictions on his opportunity to cross examine. 
    At that point, his full right of confrontation was satisfied. 
    When it did attach, no new or different information came out at trial when he was asking many of the same competency questions.

    Your Honor, if the defendant is representing himself, then clearly he has a right to counsel and there would need to be a balancing of interests and a special showing of necessity. 
    To preclude him at that point would be a violation of his right to represent himself.

    There are a number of cases that say when the child is young enough, or when the defense challenges competency there will be a competency determination outside the presence of the jury. 
    So, unlike the federal rules there's not an absolute presumption of competency where the child does go into the court room and is challenged there for the first time.

    Your Honor, there are a number of remedies for that concern and we acknowledge that a defendant may have certain facts. 
    Most of those facts, however, do go to the question of honesty rather than the question of competency. 
    Just as he could not challenge an adult, because that adult had lied in the past, or you know, and preclude an adult from taking the oath, then a child cannot be challenged on pure honesty. 
    That's the question before the trier of fact and that's when his confrontation right fully protects him. 
    If there are questions that he wishes for the court to ask, again, those can be submitted to counsel in advance, if you like qualifying or validating questions. 
    There also are opportunities to move in limine for the trial court to ask only general questions to which everyone would know the answer. 
    And some of those kinds of questions were asked in this case. 
    Do you know who Jesus is?

    The video tape statute in Kentucky applies to testimony. 
    I think there's a question of whether it would apply to this kind of proceeding. 
    Then if a video were used certainly the concern of this state of the trauma to the child from the defendant's present would be minimized. 
    However, video taping is not available throughout the state by any stretch of the imagination, much less in a number of other jurisdictions. 
    I would also note that to the extent the argument is that he may know certain facts that he may wish to raise and challenge the child's answers, that almost suggests a stranger, then, would have no reason to be there. 
    He wouldn't know those facts and would not have a right to be present. 
    We don't think that xxx.

 At the trial, under your view, could the defendant and his lawyer ask to go over the same ground that was gone over in the competency hearing? 
 Ask the same questions.

    --Those questions are typically asked. 
    They were asked here by the prosecutor initially. 
    Just partly even if for no other reason, to calm the child down. 
    They are easy questions, you know, what is your birth date? 
    What is your age? 
    But they are giving the jury some indication of this child's level of intelligence. 
    What is the harm of doing it twice, if I understand your question, or of doing it earlier. 
    The child is going to confront the defendant at trial. 
    The evidence is that additional confrontations, and the greatest fear of a victim, and particularly a child sex abuse victim, is confronting that defendant, that additional confrontations compound that potential trauma to the child and particularly when you're in the close proximity of judge's chambers, the defendant is sitting a few inches away, if you will. 
    There is the judge, the prosecutor, the defense attorney, the defendant and the court reporter, and one very small child.

    Ms. Penny R. Warren 
    It is important, but no different than many other important decisions, such as the Grand Jury decision to indict, or the witness's decision in a lineup, that this is the person. 
    That does not necessarily extend the right of confrontation to this proceeding. 
    The appellate decision that the conviction would be reversed also is a very important decision and outcome determinative. 
    But that does not carry with it the safeguards for an adversary proceeding. 
    This is not an adversary proceeding. 
    Counsel would like to make it into one. 
    Perhaps even have compulsory process of witnesses and question this child in advance. 
    But just as this Court said in Watkins v. Souders, that counsel has no right through due process to question an identification witness prior to trial, and to cross examine that identification witness on suggestiveness; it is our position that where there is no reasonable relation to the opportunity to defend, there is no right of presence in these cases. 
    Should this Court decide that there is a right of presence, then of course, there would be a need to balance the competing interests of the defendant and the state. 
    I've discussed very briefly Stincer's interests. 
    They are primarily that incremental contribution that he might make above and beyond that of counsel and above and beyond that which he might make at trial, an incremental contribution he might make to the reliability by being present at the competency hearing. 
    He says, you know, he may know when the child is not telling the truth and we appreciate that. 
    And, it might be helpful to him, but just as in Pennsylvania v. Ritchey, it would have been helpful to him to personally examine the documents there. 
    That does not grant the right of confrontation or due process, the right of presence. 
    His rights are protected at trial. 
    The best evidence of his lack of contribution is what happened at trial. 
    Nothing different at all came out and there was never any challenge either at the conclusion of the hearing or at trial or on appeal as to the competency of these two witnesses. 
    In terms of Kentucky's interest it is to provide that maximum possible psychological shelter for a child victim consistent with the constitution. 
    And again, we are concerned with the protection of defendant's rights. 
    The nature of the crime, typically a trusted adult, there are often threats. 
    The greatest fear of the child is facing the abuser again. 
    Common sense tells us that child will be frightened. 
    And each additional confrontation will frighten that child more. 
    It is our position that how the child is treated initially may well affect the outcome. 
    In this case, the first child as she went into the competency hearing and defendant was excluded, after a few question said, I'm not afraid anymore. 
    Me and my sister were afraid about who would come up here, but I'm not afraid anymore. 
    The child was in an atmosphere in which she wasn't confronted by the defendant and began to calm down. 
    Then later during the trial, potentially because of many reasons she again said she was scared. 
    She was scared of everyone there. 
    If you will, this is a narrowly tailored and a well calculated procedure to minimize the damage to the child while fully preserving the defendant's constitutional rights. 
    And we--

    The very issue in that case was whether the right of confrontation under the Kentucky Constitution is more strict than under the Sixth Amendment and the court rejected that claim and said they are basically the same. 
    There is no authority for holding the Kentucky Constitution is more strict.

   Argument of Mark A. Posnansky
speaker="mark_a_posnansky" startTime="1548.215" stopTime="1628.501">
    Mr. Mark A. Posnansky 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    Though it is not articulated specifically anywhere in the constitution, the right to be present at ones own trial is one of the most fundamental of all the rights that we have in our society. 
    And it has been held to be an implicit part of the right of confrontation in the case of Illinois v. Allen. 
    And, it has been held to be implicit in the right of due process in the case of Snyder v. Massachusetts. 
    By excluding the defendant from this important, critical hearing which the Supreme Court of Kentucky deemed critical, this important right, the right to be present was violated, which resulted in a denial of confrontation, denial of due process and also a denial of the right to effective assistance of counsel. 
    This Court has held that we must, at all times, be alert to factors which can undermine the fairness of the fact-finding process. 
    This was brought out in Estelle v. Williams. 
    In this case, what was done directly undermined the fairness of the fact-finding process. 
    That being the fact of whether these witnesses were competent.

    Mr. Posnansky, the constitutional right is the right to confront the witnesses against him. 
    The right of a defendant to confront the witnesses against him and I presume that means to confront him when they are testifying against him. 
    It certainly doesn't mean he has a right to confront them whenever he wants to come to their house and confront them or anything.

    Mr. Mark A. Posnansky 
    Well, the Kentucky Supreme Court in their decisions regarding child competency use the term that when the competency of an infant is challenged the procedure is that the court will conduct, the duty of the trial court is to carefully examine the witness in order to ascertain whether he or she is sufficiently intelligent to observe, recollect and narrate the facts and has the moral sense of obligation to speak the truth. 
    The court uses the term "the witness". 
    We submit that in this situation, the judge is acting as a trier of fact. 
    And there is a right of confrontation. 
    This is a witness who is providing live testimony, live testimony to the trier of fact on a very critical factor in the case. 
    I don't think that this--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="1729.267" stopTime="1744.560">

    The factor though is whether the child shall be or shall not be a witness. 
    And, if and when it's determined that the child shall be a witness, there is time enough to confront the witness. 
    But up until that point you don't know that the child is going to be a witness against your client.

    Mr. Mark A. Posnansky 
    --There isn't time to confront the witness. 
    That is the only time to confront the witness on the issue of competency. 
    We disagree with Mrs. Warren's assertion that confronting the child in front of the jury is sufficient in that situation. 
    That's a separate proceeding. 
    The competency proceeding occurs once. 
    The purpose of determining competency occurs one time in front of the trier of fact. 
    At that time, the issue is the admissibility of the evidence. 
    The admissibility of the testimony. 
    Not the credibility. 
    Credibility is in front of the jury. 
    Before that we're talking about admissibility. 
    That is the only time when the defendant has the opportunity to confront these witnesses, we submit, when the issue is competency. 
    That is the only time. 
    If it later comes out that the child appears to be incompetent the defendant would have to make another motion at that time.

    But it, it can be raised, Your Honor, but it's very impractical to expect that in that situation, that the judge is going to declare, after a witness has given live testimony in front of the jury on these very important, inflammatory points, that he's going to strike the testimony of that witness. 
    We submit that in that situation and most times a mistrial would be the only possible relief. 
    And it is impractical to expect the judges are going to do that.

    Mr. Mark A. Posnansky 
    I believe that that's possible that they could go that way. 
    There is, at the present time, case law which I have just alluded to and that is the procedure under Kentucky law. 
    But, I don't think that there would be any bar to going, to doing away with the hearing as such as some other states have done. 
    But, I would like to point out that this Court has held that when a state elects to opt for a certain procedure, even though that procedure may not be federally, constitutionally required, that due process applies under Ebbits v. Lucy. 
    This Court held even though a state may opt for a certain procedure that's not constitutionally required if they elect to utilize that procedure, which is what Kentucky has done, due process applies. 
    In this case, the prosecutor was given the right to question the witness, the children, at the competency hearing. 
    The prosecutor was allowed to question them. 
    He was allowed to argue that they're competent.

    Mr. Mark A. Posnansky 
    --I know of no cases where a due process violation has occurred where a person has been kept out of the court room, where witnesses are testifying, where a harmless error analysis has been made. 
    I think it is fundamentally unfair in that situation to require the defendant to show on the record precisely what he would have done to change the outcome of the competency hearing. 
    Some errors are so clear and to try to precisely point to the prejudice is impossible. 
    In right to presence cases, that is inherently a problem. 
    We don't know precisely what he would have brought out. 
    In terms of harmless error, we do know that the children showed very marginal competency later when they testified in front of the jury. 
    The basic unfairness of the whole procedure was that this man was denied confrontation at the competency hearing and he was later given an inadequate opportunity in front of the jury.

    Mr. Mark A. Posnansky 
    --In that situation, Your Honor, I think that there are alternative remedies available short of absolutely barring the defendant. 
    I don't believe that simply because the children would be afraid, the defendant could be totally excluded. 
    That's why we now have statutes such as the Closed Circuit Television, which we have in Kentucky. 
    I disagree with Mrs. Warren. 
    There is nothing in that statute to indicate that it would not apply to this situation. 
    The Closed Circuit Television has been upheld; the constitutionality of that has been upheld in Kentucky. 
    There are other alternatives available short of totally excluding the defendant. 
    The brief of the American Civil Liberties Union, amicus brief, talks about some of the alternatives: a mirror, closed circuit television, an intercom system. 
    What is so fundamental is that the defendant have an opportunity to consult with his attorney. 
    Now, if it can be shown that the defendant has done something to warrant his exclusion, such as the Illinois v Allen rationale, then I think he can constitutionally be excluded. 
    But I think the court should then utilize some alternative means, if possible, so that he can at least consult with his attorney and know what is going on in that competency hearing. 
    And I want to point out that in this case, there was no factual finding whatsoever by anyone that the defendant was going to frighten those children, that they were frightened of him. 
    The judge merely said at the beginning of the hearing, 
    "I think, we have to exclude the defendant at this point. " 
    no finding whatsoever by the court. 
    We would submit that the confrontation clearly applies at the hearing. 
    These are witnesses testifying before the trier of fact on a critical phase of this trial. 
    As to the due process... also I would like to point out again--

    Mr. Mark A. Posnansky 
    No, Sir. 
    I also want to stress again that it is no answer to the problem that the defendant was given the opportunity to cross examine the witnesses in front of the jury. 
    It's a separate proceeding. 
    Competency goes to admissibility and in front of the jury it goes to credibility. 
    I don't believe that this Court would hold that a person could be excluded from a suppression hearing on the issue of suppressing evidence where a live witness is testifying. 
    That is also in front of the trier of fact, the judge.

    You say before the jury, it goes only to credibility; that's not what I understood Mrs. Warren to say. 
    I understood that at the trial if it should appear on the basis of the examination by counsel for the defendant that the infant is not competent, at that point the infant would be excused and the jury instructed to disregard whatever testimony had preceded. 
    Now, that doesn't go to credibility, that goes to competency.

    Mr. Mark A. Posnansky 
    It happened in this case as to the little boy, yes it did. 
    But, the important point on the competency hearing versus the testimony in front of the trial is that when the jury is present the testimony being given in front of the jury as to the jury goes to credibility. 
    The jury has no opportunity to exclude a witness' testimony based on competency. 
    That is something for the judge. 
    Furthermore, I want to point out, and there have been cases that have discussed this and it's in the brief, that it is fundamentally unfair to expect the defendant to go into these other extraneous facts in front of the jury again. 
    Competency encompasses a whole range of things such as: everything in the child's background can be related to competency, in addition to the facts of the particular case. 
    And it is impractical and it is unfair, we submit, to expect the defendant to have to go into it in front of the jury and he has to do this because he wasn't present at the competency hearing.

speaker="mark_a_posnansky" startTime="2734.768" stopTime="3120.416">
    Mr. Mark A. Posnansky 
    I believe that is the federal practice, Your Honor. 
    But, in this case Kentucky has a competency hearing for the purpose of determining competency and it is at that point that the defendant's constitutional right applies, and his due process right applies. 
    And at that point, he has the opportunity to assist. 
    And it is a practical problem. 
    It is a major, practical problem to expect the defendant to have to go into that again in front of the jury and risk alienating the jury, which I submit and there's case law discusses this, would happen in most cases to have to go into these other facts which are unrelated to the charge. 
    Certainly we also submit that there is a clear due process issue involved in this case. 
    Under Snyder v. Massachusetts the defendant has the right to be present wherever his presence bears a relation reasonably substantial to the fullness of his opportunity to defend against the charges. 
    Plainly in this case, as I've mentioned, the defendant is frequently the person, the only person who knows things about the child's background. 
    Kentucky has a two part test for competency, the intelligence to observe, recollect and narrate the facts. 
    All kind of factors can go toward the intelligence of the child, toward the ability to remember and recollect the facts. 
    There may be specific instances in the child's background which the defendant is aware of which directly show that he doesn't have the ability to recollect the facts or the answers he's giving at the competency hearing are not true. 
    The other part of the test concerns the ability to, the sacred obligation to tell the truth. 
    If the defendant is aware of many instances in the background of the child where he has repeatedly exhibited a pattern of untruthfulness it's very possible to show that he really doesn't understand the difference between truth and falsity. 
    These are specific things the defendant can do and I would point out that in a case such as this, in most cases of this type, child sex abuse cases, the defendant is well-acquainted with the family and the victims as he was in this case and he is in the position to know these facts. 
    Counsel is not in the position to know them. 
    We can't expect the prosecutor to bring out these kind of things. 
    It's the defendant and only the defendant who is in a position to know these things and the only way for him to be able to assist at the level of competency is to bring these, is for him to be present at the competency hearing and for him to have the opportunity to consult with counsel. 
    I've also raised the issue of effective assistance of counsel in the brief. 
    We would submit that plainly the action of the court in excluding the defendant also relates to the issue of effective assistance of counsel. 
    This Court has held that any time a procedure of the court which interferes in certain ways with the ability of counsel to make independent decisions about how to conduct the defense, when that occurs a violation of the right to effective assistance of counsel has taken place under Strickland v. Washington. 
    That's precisely what happened in this case. 
    The action of the trial court resulted in an ability on the part of defense counsel to make independent decisions concerning cross examination and concerning lines of inquiry at the competency hearing. 
    This is like the Geders v. United States case out of this Court which limited the access of the attorney to the defendant. 
    In this case their limiting the access of the attorney to the defendant again. 
    And they're making it, we submit, impractically difficult if not impossible for the counsel to do their job under that situation. 
    As to the issue of harmless error, we submit that this type of violation should not be subject to a harmless error analysis. 
    This represents a core confrontation violation. 
    This is not like Snyder v. Massachusetts. 
    It's not like other cases which don't involve live witnesses. 
    Snyder v. Massachusetts involved a jury view. 
    This is live witnesses testifying before the trier of fact and it's an impractical if not impossible standard to be able to specifically show the prejudice. 
    But this Court has never held where a person has been excluded, where live testimony has been given, that they need to show precisely the prejudice. 
    The prejudice is clear in this case and it's even more clear when you consider the very marginal competency level of these witnesses that they later demonstrated at trial. 
    It's just basically unfair in this case for the defendant to have been excluded from the competency hearing and then not accorded the opportunity for effective cross examination because the witnesses may very well have been incompetent when they testified in front of the jury. 
    Furthermore, as to the issue of harmless error, in Russia v. Spain, this Court held that the error was harmless, was subject to a harmless error analysis. 
    But again, that did not concern the defendant being absent during the testimony of live witnesses. 
    That only concerned an ex parte communication between a judge and a juror regarding a fear the juror had as to one of the witnesses in the case. 
    There are no cases, I submit, where this Court has held it's harmless error to exclude the defendant where live testimony is being given.

    In conclusion, I would like to strenuously urge, in fact, implore this Court not to substantially weaken both the confrontation and the due process clauses by holding that the defendant can be excluded without any showing of cause from a procedure where witnesses are testifying before the trier of fact.

 I suppose you would take the same position if in some states competency was decided by, not by the trier of fact, but by a magistrate or just some separate person?

    Mr. Mark A. Posnansky 
    As to that issue. 
    The crime that was charged in this case was unquestionably a most heinous crime, a reprehensible crime and I don't want to minimize that in any respect. 
    But, the right to be present at one's own trial is a right that is given to both the guilty and to the innocent. 
    And, while there is no doubt that this issue, the issue of child sex abuse, is a most serious issue facing us today, there is also no doubt--

    Justice White 
    Well, I take it you think the right to be present is just broader than confrontation? 
    That the confrontation clause is really not the measure of the right.

    Mr. Mark A. Posnansky 
    --It is broader; due process is certainly involved. 
    The due process right goes to the ability of the defendant to contribute to his own defense as opposed to just confront the witnesses. 
    To contribute, to suggest lines of inquiry to his attorney, to substantially and meaningfully contribute to his own defense. 
    Things that he can personally do. 
    And it's also clearly involved in that right as well. 
    There were alternative methods and there are alternative methods available short of simply excluding the defendant from being present and there was no showing in this case that the defendant was a threat to these children or that the children perceived him to be a threat. 
    There are many different things that a court can do if the children are so afraid that they can't testify. 
    I do not believe that by this Court holding that a defendant has the right to be present at the competency hearing that it would in any way weaken the ability of the states to prosecute child sex abuse cases. 
    We have closed circuit television now. 
    We can have an intercom system. 
    There are many alternatives available so that the defendant can at least assist his attorney, can at least hear the testimony of the children, consult with his attorney and have some input into a very critical phase of the trial proceedings. 
    Thank you very much.

   Rebuttal of Penny R. Warren

    Ms. Penny R. Warren 
    Your Honor, one very brief clarification. 
    In terms of the facts of the case being explored in a competency hearing, at page 86 of the Joint Appendix in the opinion in this case, Justice Stevenson chastises the Circuit Court for going into the facts of the case and we believe that message is very clear. 
    It will not be done in the future. 
    Unless the Court has any further questions, we would ask the Court to reverse the Kentucky Supreme Court and hold that neither Stincer's right to be present under due process, nor confrontation was denied in this case.
