Booth v. Maryland

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    We will hear arguments this afternoon in No. 86-5020, John Booth against Maryland. 
    You may proceed whenever you're ready, Mr. Burns.
speaker="george_e_burns_jr" startTime="76.231" stopTime="172.711">
    Mr. George E. Burns, Jr. 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    The issue in this case is whether the State of Maryland may constitutionally execute a defendant based on a public opinion poll. 
    This Court has repeatedly... most recently in this term in California versus Brown... said there are two relevant considerations in a capital sentencing. 
    First, the defendant's background. 
    Obviously that's not at issue in victim impact statements. 
    The second thing are the circumstances of the crime. 
    The circumstances of the crime, of course, in a normal way are also not involved. 
    There's no contention that the victims who testified were at the crime scene, were involved with the crime, but that the crime was instituted against them as opposed to the actual victims. 
    The State, however, argues that this is still part of the circumstances of the crime. 
    The argument really comes down to no more than saying, 
    "If I cast a pebble into the ocean, the ripples just go on forever. " 
    The problem with that, I think, is not only has it never been used as a basis for criminal sentencing, it's probably not even a good basis for tort law. 
    The implications are simply staggering, because I think it's fair to say that each and every one of us is offended by violent crime. 
    That being the case, there's no reason every citizen who is offended by this shouldn't come in and express that view. 
    Indeed, we might have an 800 number linked up to the courtroom. 
    People could call in. 
    More specifically, lawyers and judges who are involved in these cases are certainly offended by the facts that they have to deal with, the crime that they have to deal with. 
    It would seem that it would be fair to call them in as also--

    What exactly was introduced in evidence here, Mr. Burns?
speaker="george_e_burns_jr" startTime="175.496" stopTime="215.820">
    Mr. George E. Burns, Jr. 
    --Here we have the testimony of, or the statements of the immediate family; that is, the mother... excuse me, son, daughter of the victims... the actual victims. 
    I use the victims in two words... two ways. 
    "Victims" obviously meaning the murder victims, victims as included in this case included those people, family members, who obviously were upset by the crime, as anyone would be, but were not present in any way at the crime, and at whom the crime was not actually aimed at. 
    So that was what we had in this case. 
    That is the complaint. 
    The State, in short--

    Mr. George E. Burns, Jr. 
    --Well, I think it would be relevant in a slightly different way, Justice Scalia. 
    In that circumstances it is a crime. 
    The crime does become more horrible, if it were not just the wife, if it were just a citizen that had to stand here and watch this. 
    I do think that is aggravating that you put someone through that. 
    So I think it is an aggravating circumstance of the crime, as opposed to someone who is not present at the crime. 
    So I agree... My answer is: yes, but perhaps for a slightly different reason than you suggest.

    Mr. George E. Burns, Jr. 
    If that's true, Your Honor, we eliminate reasons for foreseeability, because I think in Your Honor's hypothetical, we do have the foreseeability problem. 
    If I point a gun in a bank and shoot it, I surely am aware that anyone there may be injured. 
    I am not likely to be aware that the victim that gets hit, for example, has a loving family and children as opposed to a victim who may be hated by everyone. 
    That's very unlikely that I'm going to be aware of that. 
    And I would agree, Justice Scalia, if we have a case, for example, of someone saying, 
    "I'm very fond of Mr. Smith. " 
    "I've liked Mr. Smith for ten years, but I hate his family. " 
    "I'm going to get even with his family by killing Mr. Smith. " 
    Well, in that case I would agree that the circumstance of the crime is precisely that. 
    But the ordinary situation is, there certainly may be all these ripple effects, but it really has nothing to do with the blackness of the soul of the defendant, because the defendant isn't aware, and in most instances, to put it bluntly, is indifferent to all these things.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="387.534" stopTime="415.851">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    But why is the blackness of the soul of the defendant, as you and Justice Scalia have been saying, the only thing that the State may produce evidence about? 
    Certainly our cases have given the broadest latitude to the defendant, to show anything in the defendant's background that may make the jury have a feel for and be sympathetic to him. 
    Why can't the State at the same time be entitled to make the victim human and make the family human, to get across to the jury just what the impact of this act was?
speaker="george_e_burns_jr" startTime="415.851" stopTime="424.373">
    Mr. George E. Burns, Jr. 
    Well, Chief Justice, I think one clear thing is presumably the defendant's background is relevant, why he's here. 
    The victim--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="424.373" stopTime="427.092">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    This Court has said it was relevant.
speaker="george_e_burns_jr" startTime="427.092" stopTime="428.175">
    Mr. George E. Burns, Jr. 
    --Yes, in the past.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="428.175" stopTime="430.877">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    And presumably this Court could say the victims were relevant.
speaker="george_e_burns_jr" startTime="430.877" stopTime="431.477">
    Mr. George E. Burns, Jr. 
    This Court could--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="431.477" stopTime="435.347">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    So the question is: What reason supporting one doesn't support the other?
speaker="george_e_burns_jr" startTime="435.347" stopTime="472.071">
    Mr. George E. Burns, Jr. 
    --I think one question is: Does it have an effect on why this individual committed this particular crime? 
    Certainly defendant's background does. 
    Does it have any effect on the crime, for example, if one sees two people that both look like they're from Skid Row, shoots one. 
    It turns out he's a Skid Row person, and no one much cares. 
    He shoots another person, and it turns out this person was actually a renowned surgeon, and he happened to be dressed that way. 
    And, indeed, probably a thousand lives will be lost because he'll be unable to be the surgeon in those cases.

    Mr. George E. Burns, Jr. 
    That's the question, Your Honor. 
    But I think the difficulty is if we open this and prevent scope of society arguments is, again, we're not really focusing on culpability of the defendant. 
    It's hard for the defendant to be... judge his culpability in light of what not only he does not know in many cases, but could not conceivably know. 
    So that we have... and I think this goes to the arbitrary factor. 
    We have two defendants who have both acted in a horrible way, society would agree. 
    One, purely by fortuitous circumstances, has caused all these additional harms, not because he's worse or better than the other defendant, but simply by chance. 
    I think it's difficult to see how that cannot have an arbitrary result, because we're not looking at what this criminal did, what he deliberately caused to be done, but merely fortuitous circumstances of again the ripple effect for society.

    In that circumstances, both of them knew, or should have known, the consequences.

    Mr. George E. Burns, Jr. 
    The difficulty, Justice Scalia, is that I think we're going to have to simply change what we've said about criminal law for at least the last 200 years. 
    Culpability has been the hallmark of criminal law, unlike tort law, because again we're punishing people for their bad acts, what they consciously are doing, not what other circumstances may, quite beyond their acts, cause. 
    If you're trying to use this... and I suppose deterrence is a factor in all of criminal law... if you're trying to deter someone, you may deter someone by saying, 
    "If this happens, if you do this and you kill someone, we're going to punish you in this way. " 
    It's hard to deter someone by simply saying, 
    "Well, if after the fact we decide that there may have been ripple effects, that this person had a caring family as opposed to an uncaring family-- "

    Mr. George E. Burns, Jr. 
    Well, I think that... if I may... leads us to a second problem. 
    The State has attempted to link that up by saying: It goes to retribution. 
    And certainly there are opinions by Justices of this Court talking about retribution in capital punishment. 
    However, those opinions are dealing with the question of whether there should be capital punishment or not, not the procedures to carry out retribution. 
    And I think the point is significant. 
    For example, if the State is right, and all I have to show is that this procedure is consistent with retribution, then it's obvious that defendant should be tortured during sentencing. 
    It's difficult to think of anything that could better serve retribution. 
    Or if one doesn't like that, one could at least bound, gag and chain him during it. 
    Again, it serves as retribution. 
    The point is: Retribution has a legitimate basis, if one accepts it, in deciding whether or not we apply the ultimate punishment, but it doesn't help at all to say, "Is the procedure fair", because it would seem to me that the less fair the procedure, the greater retribution. 
    If one uses that argument, it militates in favor of having the most unfair procedure. 
    And I think this may be an example. 
    If not the most unfair procedure, certainly an unfair one in this particular case.

    Mr. George E. Burns, Jr. 
    --Again, I can't say that I'm completely familiar with every other statute, other than Maryland's, but I believe those are again to be tied-- 
    For example, if you put a bomb in this building, surely one knows that the chances of killing more than one person are very, very great. 
    And again I think that is easy to tie to foreseeability, as opposed to the situation where no one can possibly foresee. 
    So I'm learning my answer, because I'm not terribly familiar with all these statutes, but I think you can distinguish them in that way. 
    A word perhaps should be said about, in passing, the state's use of authority. 
    The State, not unreasonably, has combed the country for those cases which best support its position--

    Mr. George E. Burns, Jr. 
    I don't think so, Justice O'Connor. 
    And I think there are several perhaps additional problems with this, because not only are we talking about leaving these victims, we're also talking about a very personalized thing. 
    For example, let's suppose that there are two murders. 
    And in one case... They both have loving families. 
    But some people, their grief just as intense, would prefer not to participate, would prefer not to be involved in this. 
    They want certainly justice, but they also want to not be involved. 
    So they're not going to have much in the victim impact statement. 
    They may say, 
    "No, we're not going to be involved. " 
    The other case, the people may... Their grief may take the opposite view. 
    But once again here, not only do we have fortuitous circumstances in where there are family members, but it turns on the specific reaction of the family members, rather than the actual victim or the defendant.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="947.226" stopTime="969.841">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    Well, Mr. Burns, hasn't tort law for a long time distinguished between intentional torts and negligent torts in this respect, that with respect to intentional torts, you take the consequences as you find them, and you're responsible for even fairly unforeseeable consequences. 
    It's just in the negligence areas that the foreseeability question comes in.
speaker="george_e_burns_jr" startTime="969.841" stopTime="972.960">
    Mr. George E. Burns, Jr. 
    I certainly agree, Mr. Chief Justice, there's a difference.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="972.960" stopTime="984.951">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    So that an intentional killer is really not in a position as applying traditional tort laws to complain that he killed someone who had a far more bereaved family than the next person.
speaker="george_e_burns_jr" startTime="984.951" stopTime="1012.002">
    Mr. George E. Burns, Jr. 
    Mr. Chief Justice, I certainly agree with you that the family could successfully sue the killer. 
    I have no difficulty with that whatsoever. 
    I think in our brief we make clear, one of the early divisions between tort law and criminal law was just that, is to take the victim as you find the situation. 
    And the idea, obviously, of tort law is to put people, make people whole to the extent you can. 
    Obviously, realistically in this case, you can't; but to the extent that you can. 
    And so I'm certainly not suggesting that you couldn't sue in tort, but--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1012.002" stopTime="1020.691">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    But you're insisting that there's a foreseeable... a principle of foreseeability here that should somehow limit your client's criminal liability.

    Mr. George E. Burns, Jr. 
    --Yes, Your Honor.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1021.074" stopTime="1026.428">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    I'm suggesting that that... that there's a very good analogy from tort law that suggests that isn't the case.
speaker="george_e_burns_jr" startTime="1026.428" stopTime="1043.320">
    Mr. George E. Burns, Jr. 
    Well, I suggest, Your Honor, that that obviously this Court can do as it will, but I think to do that, we're going to have to substitute tort law for criminal law. 
    Criminal law has never been built on that basis. 
    And I think the reason Mr. Chief Justice has to draw all the the analogy from tort law is precisely that. 
    It's not criminal law.

    By agreement of all the parties, the preferred... the options given the Defense in this case were, you can have live or statements. 
    By agreements, they thought it was less prejudicial than you had the statements.

    But I can't honestly say, obviously, that's because of the procedure. 
    It was because the procedure that the parties agreed that it would be less prejudicial than for statements.

    As I pointed out, Justice Powell, in this case, all the parties... well, obviously, defense didn't want any Victim Impact Statement. 
    The response was, 
    "Well, is... would you prefer us to have live victims or the Statement? " 
    And I think defense counsel made that choice. 
    Obviously, if they would have come, I see no reason why they could not be cross-examined in that circumstance.

   Argument of Charles O. Monk, II
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1305.521" stopTime="1313.210">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Thank you, Mr. Burns. 
    We'll hear now from you Mr. Monk.
speaker="charles_o_monk_ii" startTime="1313.210" stopTime="1481.720">
    Mr. Charles O. Monk, II 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    The issue in this case is whether victim impact evidence can be introduced at the sentencing phase of a capital case consistent with the Eighth Amendment. 
    We believe that it can under Maryland's carefully devised capital sentencing process. 
    The Maryland General Assembly has chosen to include victim impact evidence in the death penalty process. 
    In doing so, however, Maryland has not undermined the substantial safeguards of its process that guide the discretion of the sentencer and insure that the death penalty is not imposed in an arbitrary or capricious manner. 
    In fact, I suggest that Maryland's bifurcated death penalty procedure contains many more procedural safeguards than other sentencing procedures already approved by this Court. 
    Maryland has ten limited circumstances where the death penalty may be appropriate. 
    With the exception of a person that contracts for murder, only a principal in the first degree, that is, one that actually commits the murder or kills the victim, is subject to capital punishment in Maryland. 
    The aggravated murderers, where the death penalty can be imposed, include such things as victim... as the victim was a law enforcement officer. 
    And let me stop here, Justice Scalia. 
    In Maryland, the defendant would not have to know that the victim was a law enforcement officer. 
    It would be sufficient that the... that the victim was a law enforcement officer on duty to constitute an aggravated circumstance under the Maryland Statute. 
    Another... another example of the aggravated circumstances required by the Maryland Statute is that the victim was taken or attempted to be taken in the course of a kidnapping or abduction. 
    In this case, the aggravating circumstance is that the defendant committed the murder while committing robbery. 
    Under Maryland's death penalty law, if no aggravating circumstance is found, then life imprisonment is the sentence. 
    However, if one or more aggravating circumstances are found to exist and the standard is beyond a reasonable doubt, then we shift to mitigating circumstances for consideration. 
    In addition to Stat. 7, statutorily defined mitigating circumstances, Maryland also permits the defendant wide discretion to present other facts in mitigation. 
    Mitigating circumstances under the Maryland procedure must only be proved by a preponderance of the evidence. 
    A single mitigating circumstance is sufficient under the Maryland procedure to outweigh whatever aggravating circumstances are found and indicate that life sentence is appropriate. 
    In this case, the jury found and noted on the verdict sheet under the open-ended-other-facts category that the defendant's family environment, child neglect, and lack of strong father image were mitigating factors. 
    I think this is important because it indicates that the jury was, in fact, listening to the evidence and understanding what the defendant was presenting.

 And it appears to me that the Victim Impact Law was, perhaps, passed later and is kind of an add-on, and that the form has never been adjusted to reflect how the jury is to use it. 
 And, indeed, in this case it was just the subject of argument by the Prosecutor, I suppose, after the Statement had been admitted. 
 And I'm concerned about what you see about the kind of guidance that would meet Federal constitutional standards in a death-sentencing scheme is required for the use of victim impact statements.

    Mr. Charles O. Monk, II 
    Justice O'Connor, I would agree with you that there is no place on the form for the jury directly to consider victim impact evidence. 
    But I disagree with you that is not clearly a part of the process. 
    The Maryland Court of Appeals in this case, I think, addressed exactly your concern when it said the victim impact evidence reflects the gravity or aggravating circumstances of the crime. 
    There's no place on the form, I might say, for a description of the heinous nature of the crime, the fact that the Bronsteins were bound and gagged and stabbed numerous times. 
    There's no place on the form for the jury to look at that evidence either.

    Mr. Charles O. Monk, II 
    Well, I suggest to you, Justice O'Connor, that the process, what the jury was supposed to do in this case and I think was Maryland's process calls for, is that once the jury finds the threshold of an aggravated murder, that it was committed in the case in connection with a robbery, then they take into consideration the circumstances of the crime, the victim impact, the defendant's criminal record, in considering the aggravating quality of the crime, and then weigh that against the mitigating circumstances presented by the defendant.

    Well, I think there could be an instruction if there was not a request for such an instruction in this case. 
    There was an instruction, however that say... that said that you weigh... that gave... the suggestions to the jury about what an aggravating circumstance meant and what a mitigating circumstance meant.

    Mr. Charles O. Monk, II 
    That's right. 
    The Statute... the General Assembly has defined what evidence is admissible in a capital case. 
    And among that list is a pre-sentence report including the Victim Impact Statement. 
    And that's how it comes into the process. 
    The pre-sentence report details the criminal history of the defendant and some relevant information about his background.

    Justice Stevens 
    General Monk, can I ask you a question? 
    In your response to Justice O'Connor prompt, you described the Statement, 
    "It reflects the aggravated nature of the crime. " 
    or something like that.
speaker="charles_o_monk_ii" startTime="1838.180" stopTime="1838.865">

    That's correct.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1838.865" stopTime="1855.725">
    Justice Stevens 
    Do you think it would be permissible for the State Statute to provide that if a victim leaves surviving two or three children, that shall be considered an aggravating circumstance, a statutory aggravating circumstance justifying the death penalty might not otherwise be justified?
speaker="charles_o_monk_ii" startTime="1855.725" stopTime="1871.137">
    Mr. Charles O. Monk, II 
    Well, I think in the same vein that I think it's permissible that we decide that the commission of... or murder of a police officer in the course of his duties: If the General Assembly were to decide that, I think it's possible that that could be considered a statutory aggravating circumstance. 
    I don't think that's--

    Justice Stevens 
    And you think it would be constitutional to do that is what I am asking.

    Mr. Charles O. Monk, II

    Justice Stevens 
    No, I understand. 
    Although one could argue that the effect of it is pretty much the same because it... I suppose it could... this bit of evidence could make the difference between the jury finding a man... imposing the death sentence and not doing so. 
    That must be the very purpose of it. 
    Indeed, I don't understand what you've done here if... why it is... why it should not be excluded as totally irrelevant evidence unless it is an aggravating circumstance. 
    What does it bear upon unless it bears upon aggravation?
speaker="charles_o_monk_ii" startTime="1903.422" stopTime="1910.945">
    Mr. Charles O. Monk, II 
    Justice Scalia, indeed, that's what the Maryland Court of Appeals said. 
    They said this evidence reflects the gravity of the crime and the aggravating quality of the crime--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1910.945" stopTime="1918.950">
    Justice Stevens 
    So it is an aggravating circumstance established by a separate statute. 
    It is just not listed in the other Statute that lists all the aggravating circumstances?
speaker="charles_o_monk_ii" startTime="1918.950" stopTime="1933.710">
    Mr. Charles O. Monk, II 
    --That's right. 
    But in a sense, we're playing a bit of a word game here because aggravating circumstances within the meaning of the Maryland Statutes are thresholds which have to be crossed before you become death eligible. 
    And it's... it is not that. 
    And that's important to understand.

speaker="charles_o_monk_ii" startTime="2046.145" stopTime="2295.657">
    Mr. Charles O. Monk, II 
    I would like to say a few more words about the Maryland statutory scheme itself because I think once the Court understands the scheme and understands the safeguards built into the scheme, they will understand why the introduction of this evidence was not arbitrary or create an arbitrary or capricious result. 
    Under the Maryland law, whenever the death penalty is imposed, the decision is subject to immediate review and direct review by the Maryland Court of Appeals. 
    In addition, the trial Judge must submit a report to the Court of Appeals detailing information about the defendant, the conduct of the trial, and a recommendation by the trial Judge as to whether imposition of the sentence of death is justified. 
    Now let me say, the defendant has a choice in Maryland. 
    He can choose the jury or he can choose the trial judge at the sentencing phase of the process. 
    And the jury's decision is binding if he chooses the jury. 
    In reviewing the case, the Court of Appeals is specifically required under Maryland Statute to determine whether the sentence of death was imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor. 
    In this case, the Court of Appeals concluded that the introduction of the victim impact evidence did not present an arbitrary factor. 
    As a final consideration, the Court of Appeals undertakes a proportionality review to determine whether the sentence is excessive or disproportionate to the penalty imposed in a similar case, considering both the crime and the defendant. 
    It is, I suggest to you, in the face of this carefully devised statutory scheme, that Petitioner would have this Court rule that victim impact evidence cannot be introduced consistent with the Eighth Amendment. 
    We submit to do so would be improper extension of the Eighth Amendment jurisprudence of this Court. 
    It has long been recognized that retribution is a valid rationale for the death penalty. 
    In non-capital cases, it is typical in assessing a punishment to be imposed to consider the impact of the crime upon the victim. 
    As Justice Marshall noted earlier, Maryland just suffered through a savings and loan crisis. 
    When we came to the point of sentencing the criminals involved in the savings and loan crisis, certainly the impact of their crimes on the State of Maryland was a relevant consideration and was appropriately taken into consideration by the Court. 
    And I don't think it offended the Eighth Amendment in any way, shape, or form to do so. 
    Indeed, we recognize in our system of legal process, to paraphrase the words of Justice Stewart in Gregg, that channeling the instinct for retribution through the administration of criminal justice is essential in an ordered society that asks its citizens to rely upon legal processes rather than self-help to vindicate their wrongs. 
    Consequently, it is entirely consistent with this long-recognized precept of criminal justice that Maryland provide the sentencer in capital cases with a victim impact information that can be used in considering what retribution should be exacted as a consequence of the defendant's conduct. 
    Significantly the Maryland Court of Appeals in this case held that there is a reasonable nexus between the impact of the crime upon the victim's family and the facts and circumstances surrounding the crime, especially as I said before, as to the gravity or aggravating quality of the offense. 
    Thus, the Maryland Court appropriately gives deference to the Maryland statutory scheme and holds that victim impact evidence is admissible simply as another circumstance of the crime. 
    It is not, and let me emphasize this, indeed it cannot be, under the Maryland law, a call for the death penalty. 
    This is not private vengeance. 
    Instead, it simply provides additional probative information that the sentencer can use in weighing the aggravating nature of the crime against whatever mitigating circumstances it has found. 
    The introduction of this victim impact evidence is not as Petitioner suggests "wholly arbitrary". 
    Under the Maryland statutory scheme, it must be admitted in every case whether it is traumatic or inconsequential. 
    In this regard, it is no more arbitrary than the crime itself.

    It helped illuminate the fact that the crime was particularly heinous and that it caused severe harm. 
    And that was weighed against the mitigating circumstances proffered by the defendant.

    Let me just say which... that takes me to my next point which is foreseeability. 
    I think foreseeability is an important... an important question here. 
    And I agree with Justice Rehnquist that I think there is a distinction on the defendant's direction... direct acts... on his knowing act is what's at issue. 
    It is quite clear that the defendant knows, I believe, or should have known, when he takes another person's life, that the family of the victim will suffer greatly as a consequence of his conduct even if he doesn't know who the family is. 
    He knows that the person... it's reasonable to assume that he knows the person has a family, and they're going to suffer as a result of his wanton act.

    Mr. Charles O. Monk, II 
    Well, Justice Stevens, I think that goes back to my earlier point that I... and I think it's a legislative judgment that Maryland has made that there's a role to play for victim impact evidence when we get to that final stage, after we have determined that this is an aggravated murder, and we have met all the other prerequisites of principal in the first degree and so forth, when we get to the weighing of the moral judgment, the Maryland General Assembly has said, Why can't we have a limited introduction of the impact of the crime upon the victim? 
    Personalize... personalize the facts from the victim's side when the jury makes that moral judgment of weighing--

    Mr. Charles O. Monk, II 
    Well, I think reasonable minds could differ on whether they could or they couldn't. 
    The trial Judge didn't think so. 
    The Maryland Court of Appeals also decided that they... that they were not necessary to do so. 
    I'm not going to say that anybody looking at this automatically would say, 
    "Gee, I... maybe this goes too far. " 
    I think the question before this Court is not whether a few of these statements are beyond what they should have been under the Maryland Statute or not, but whether this evidence comes in at all under the Eighth Amendment. 
    And I think Maryland has found a way to include it within the process without making the process arbitrary or capricious.

    Mr. Charles O. Monk, II 
    No, it could not as far as I can see, Justice Powell. 
    I was speaking about the foreseeability of this, and let me just finally make my points on that. 
    Indeed, if you... if we accept the premise that the defendant knows or should have known that there's a family to be harmed when he commits the murder, then as the sentencer judges his moral capacity, it is called upon to recognize whether he felt any concern or remorse for the harm caused to the victim and the victim's family. 
    In this case, the evidence showed the defendant was particularly callous to the grave harm he caused others when he described to his cohorts that they should pay no mind to the brutally murdered bodies of Mr. and Mrs. Bronstein when they returned to the house to ransack and steal more property. 
    He, obviously, was totally unconcerned that the Bronstein family would suffer greatly from his brutal acts. 
    He was simply concerned about taking their property without getting caught. 
    Nevertheless, I suggest to you that it was or should have been completely foreseeable to Booth, especially considering he lived two houses down the street, that the family would suffer greatly as a direct result of his conduct. 
    Consequently, it is not at all unfair to require that the sentencer consider victim impact evidence in making a moral judgment regarding Booth's crimes. 
    One other point that I want to respond to that the Petitioner has made is the emotional impact of this evidence. 
    Petitioner claims that victim impact evidence is so emotionally charged as to introduce an arbitrary factor that will disrupt the exercise of the guided discretion of the sentencer. 
    Victim impact evidence may well be emotional. 
    However, by itself, this should not be a problem of constitutional dimension. 
    First, the trial court can instruct the jury upon the use of victim impact evidence, although as I have said here, he was not requested to do so. 
    Secondly--

    Mr. George E. Burns, Jr. 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court: 
    Initially, one technical problem: The State, very confidently, has said the Maryland Statute doesn't matter whether you know it's a police officer or not. 
    The Court of Appeals has disagreed with that in a case cited by the State and in the briefs... I won't give you the cite... the Court of Appeals did think it mattered-- 
    So I don't think that it supports the State's position whatsoever. 
    Also,--

    Mr. George E. Burns, Jr. 
    Lodowski versus State just cites in the State's brief... it's 302 Md. 691. 
    So that has been decided in a contrary way. 
    I think it was intriguing that the State took the position that, to Justice Stevens' question, that you could have an aggravating factor that a defendant had children, three children presumably. 
    Well, if that's true, I think you can go a step farther. 
    And under this theory is, for example, we could say, it's an aggravating factor if you have four, not it you have two. 
    Or perhaps, if we thought it was a good idea that people didn't have children and wanted to control our population, presumably the State could under those circumstances say, then it's only an aggravating factor if there are no children. 
    In short, I think what the State's done is point out the completely arbitrary nature of these things that have really nothing to do with the crime itself.

    I have no control over whether he does. 
    As the State pointed out, the defendant in this case, probably in any case, is unconcerned. 
    That may be callous, but it also doesn't show evil heart in that, I want to punish this person's children; I want to make his family... it may be that I would introduce evidence that maybe the defendant would say to someone, 
    "I committed this crime; perhaps, I shouldn't have, but I really hope that he had no family and no children. "

    Mr. George E. Burns, Jr. 
    As I pointed out, Justice Scalia, if we accept that, if we accept that, then I think it becomes reasonable to weigh is, who is this victim in the community? 
    Was he the surgeon that's going to save a thousand lives? 
    Or was he the drug dealer who, perhaps, was going to eliminate lives? 
    Are we going to have a system that's going to turn on: Some lives are worth giving more protection to than others, because that's really what it comes down to. 
    It isn't that the defendant's chooses to kill the surgeon as opposed to the drug dealer. 
    It happens that way. 
    And the question is: Is the society... are we, as a society, prepared at this point to say, 
    "Well, some victims, we really don't care that much about, so we wouldn't consider capital punishment. " 
    "There are other victims that we care a great deal about because they had nice families. " 
    as opposed to the person, for example, who is a very unpleasant person and has impatient heirs. 
    Presumably in the logic of the thing, the probation officer should come in and say, 
    "This is favorable. " 
    "You should never give death to this person because he was a terrible person; his heirs are happy; the impact is good. "
