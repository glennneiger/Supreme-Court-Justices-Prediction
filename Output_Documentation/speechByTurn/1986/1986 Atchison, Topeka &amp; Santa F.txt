    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    This case also comes to us from the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. 
    The respondent is a car man employed by the petitioner railroad. 
    He brought an action under the Federal Employers' Liability Act alleging that the railroad had condoned his harassment by his supervisor and fellow employees. 
    That the harassment had resulted in his suffering a severe emotional breakdown. 
    The District Court dismissed the complaint holding that the injury arose out of a workplace dispute, which was subject to mandatory arbitration under the Railway Labor Act, and therefore the FELA action could not be maintained. 
    The Court of Appeals reversed holding that the dispute did not turn on the collective barganing agreement and was therefore was not subject to arbitration. 
    The court also took the opportunity to state at some length that claims were intentional infliction of emotional distress are cognoscible under the FELA. 
    We agree with the Ninth Circuit in so far as it held that the RLA does not bar respondent's action under the Federal Employers' Liability Act. 
    However because the record of the case is not sufficiently developed at this stage yet to make it appropriate to address the question whether an FELA action is available for the type of emotional injury that respondent alleged. 
    We do not address that issue. 
    Our opinion is unanimous.
