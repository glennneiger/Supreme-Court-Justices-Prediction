Rivera v. Minnich

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    We will hear arguments next in No. 86-98, Gregory L. Rivera versus Jean Marie Minnich. 
    Mr. Campbell, you may proceed whenever you are ready.
speaker="william_watt_campbell" startTime="49.199" stopTime="199.341">
    Mr. William Watt Campbell 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the issue in this case is whether a man can be determined to be the father of an illegitimate child with the associated stigma and impact on himself and his family by the same quality of proof as is used in the ordinary civil case. 
    The paternity case is not like an ordinary civil case about money, as my opponents would have you believe. 
    A paternity case is not like a collection case or a slip and fall case. 
    If you look at the effects of the judgment entered and the parties involved, you will see the difference. 
    First of all, this judgment is enforced by jail. 
    This is not a judgment which is enforced just against the debtor's property, but it is enforced against him. 
    Once the order is entered, the court monitors his address and his employment for the remainder of the effect of that order. 
    There is a wage attachment provision, and this is a provision that does not exist in any other civil judgments in Pennsylvania. 
    Week to week, paycheck to paycheck, the effect of this judgment is felt. 
    There is no relief in bankruptcy. 
    The defendant loses the freedom to change his employment based on a court's perception of his earning capacity. 
    He can't go from a salaried position to self-employment. 
    He can't bankrupt out of this judgment, but none of these deal with the most important effect of this judgment. 
    This judgment makes a permanent decision as to who is the father of this child. 
    The parties involved... I will get back to that. 
    The parties involved are entirely different. 
    Plaintiff's interest, as my opponents concede, is purely economic, getting money. 
    But the child has what has been termed in Little versus Streeter as a compelling interest in the accuracy of the determination and so does the defendant. 
    The government weighs in heavily on the side of the plaintiff in every support and paternity case, not just the welfare cases, as here, but through the 4D program, this plaintiff and all plaintiffs in support actions have been afforded postponed and reduced filing fees, streamlined pleading systems, subsidized costs of prosecution, and there are two examples in this case which are of particular interest. 
    In this case the government provided the plaintiff with an attorney and the government flew in the blood test expert for the trial at no cost to the plaintiff.

    Mr. William Watt Campbell 
    No. 
    No, sir. 
    And finally, with reference to the difference in the nature of the parties in a civil action, the child, who is the one who is supposed to be the beneficiary of the money, and the one who bears the effect of the decision of paternity, is not even a party. 
    This welfare support case was begun under government compulsion. 
    Jean Marie Minnich was required to name a father and cooperate in a prosecution of someone in order to get welfare benefits, so these cases aren't just like the ordinary money case. 
    It may start as a case seeking money, but where paternity is at issue the defendant's freedom of personal choice in family matters is implicated. 
    Now, this Court has dealt with this freedom of choice most usually in terms of an existing family unit, but for two reasons, logically and otherwise, that freedom must include the freedom not to become a parent by a judicial determination. 
    Furthermore, whatever the merits of the ultimate issue of abortion, in Roe versus Wade this Court recognized the freedom of someone, in that case a pregnant woman, not to continue to term, not to become a parent because--

    Our society does not take the label of father lightly.

    Mr. William Watt Campbell 
    Justice Scalia, it is correct that a lot of those expectations cannot be enforced, but legally enforceable expectations aren't the only considerations that have been taken into account. 
    In Santosky versus Kramer, the Court considered many interests of parents which are not judicially enforceable. 
    You cannot make a parent raise their children morally or make sure they go to school after high school if that is appropriate for them, but still the court considered the role of a parent as our society, as our society expects, and not... the Court doesn't just look to money. 
    The other family matters which are implicated in a paternity case are, as I have said, the harm of an unwanted relationship, and the harm of this judicially determined relationship on an existing family. 
    In this case my client is married and has a child of that marriage. 
    Through this determination he can be labeled as an adulterer. 
    The Pennsylvania Supreme Court in considering the state law noted that he would have a responsibility for the health, wealth, and education of the child, which may go beyond legally enforceable money considerations. 
    Most important, perhaps, is that this is a final and irreversible determination of who this child's father is, and for the child there are interests in terms of determining what is the heritage of the child, what is the medical and genetic history, and finally the emotional and psychological impact. 
    It defies common sense and common experience to try to tell this Court that saying someone is the father will only result in the payment of money. 
    That child is going to have someone identified to them as the father. 
    That is why the child has that compelling interest in the accuracy. 
    It will have lifelong consequences far beyond any $20 per week.

    Mr. William Watt Campbell 
    Absolutely not, Justice Scalia. 
    The preponderance standard says that if you look at the evidence and you decide that the plaintiff has proved her claim more likely than not by weight to the slightest degree then you must find in favor of the plaintiff. 
    You have said they would find against even though they believed it. 
    That is not right. 
    The clear and convincing standard would tell them you may find him to be the father if you are clearly convinced of the truth of her claim, and let's look at the kinds of evidence that is used in paternity cases to make this claim. 
    The blood tests. 
    In this case the blood test results were 18 to 1, 94.6 percent. 
    Now, what this means is that if I walked out of the Lancaster County Courthouse, turned down Duke Street, and picked up 19 Hispanic males at random, one of them could be the father, and if I went further and picked up 38, there could be two of them. 
    In a group of 57 Hispanic males just in that town alone there could be three biologically possible fathers. 
    This statistical evidence is very difficult to understand for lawyers. 
    I suggest it is much more difficult for juries. 
    That is why, as Chief Justice Rehnquist pointed out in Mills, the traditional evidence becomes more important. 
    When we look at that evidence, that--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="646.739" stopTime="663.559">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    Is the blood test evidence that you have just described, is that admissible no matter how little probative it may be of the defendant's paternity? 
    I mean, is it like a drunken driving statute where you have to have a certain minimum before it is admissible?
speaker="william_watt_campbell" startTime="663.559" stopTime="675.680">
    Mr. William Watt Campbell 
    --No, Chief Justice Rehnquist.

    94.6 percent, which only means that 94.6 percent of Hispanic males aren't the father, 5.4 percent could biologically be the father, and as this AMA-ABA report that everybody talks about, all the opinions of this Court discussing blood tests have cited this, as they point out, there are a lot of statistical assumptions in this case which raise possible due process issues, and I submit that this is one such issue. 
    The third kind of evidence, something that was done in this case and something that according to my research can be done around the country, the plaintiff was permitted to bring my client up in front of the jury, put the baby and the mother next to him, and ask the jury to look to see if they could see a resemblance.

    Mr. William Watt Campbell 
    I think it is. 
    Whenever there is... a burden of proof can... a burden of proof may be set by the legislature but as each of the burden of proof cases here have said, only within the confines of the due process clause. 
    I suggest they didn't think about it when they took it from a criminal prosecution to a civil prosecution and I was unable to locate any legislative history whatsoever on the point. 
    Now, my opponents say that this case just reduces to money and urge the Court only to see the dollar sign in this paternity order. 
    They distinguish Santosky as protecting a family unit, and that this just concerns one person. 
    Constitutionally there is just as much at stake here as there was in Santosky because Santosky was not written to protect Ozzie and Harriet. 
    Santosky was written to protect John and Annie Santosky, who were two people whose children had already been taken away from them based on allegations and some preliminary findings of abuse and neglect. 
    What this Court protected was general concept of parenting, what it is to be a parent, and what it is to be a parent is just as much at stake in a paternity case as it is in a termination case. 
    To say otherwise would diminish society's expectation of what is it to be a father. 
    I ask this Court to caution the factfinder to proceed in these cases with great deliberation and to use the clear and convincing standard. 
    I will reserve my remaining time. 
   
   
   
   Argument of Mary Louise Barton
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1004.939" stopTime="1008.954">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Thank you, Mr. Campbell. 
    We will hear now from you, Ms. Barton.
speaker="mary_louise_barton" startTime="1008.954" stopTime="1037.240">
    Ms. Mary Louise Barton 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the interest of the states in family matters has well been respected by the court in both theory and precedent. 
    As to the evidentiary standard in a paternity proceeding &lt;forty-one&gt; [= 41] states have seen fit to choose the preponderant standard of evidence to prove paternity.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1037.240" stopTime="1038.568">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    How many states, Ms. Barton?
speaker="mary_louise_barton" startTime="1038.568" stopTime="1482.000">
    Ms. Mary Louise Barton 
    Forty-one, Mr. Chief Justice. 
    This Court is required to correct clear constitutional violations in state statutes in order to ensure constitutional fairness. 
    An analysis of the due process clause as it relates to the preponderant standard of proof in a paternity proceeding demonstrates that there is no clear constitutional violation in the state's choice of this particular evidentiary standard. 
    Furthermore, the preponderance standard of the evidence in this context assures fairness to all the parties. 
    Appellant's main contention is that his rights are the same as the parents in Santosky versus Kramer. 
    Appellant argues that his lack of parental ties are as deserving of the sane constitutional protection at those parents who had formed a parent-child relationship with their children. 
    This is incorrect as a general proposition, Fully developed familial relationships involving the assumption of parental duties with mutual love and affection are entitled to a significantly greater level of due process protection than the inchoate relationship at issue in this case. 
    No court can impose a parent-child relationship. 
    The only thing a court can impose is a support order, and that would mean monetary support. 
    Practically, the interests at stake in a paternity suit are economic on the parts of all the parties. 
    To distinguish Santosky from the case at bar, in Santosky the court was clearly speaking about, as I have already stated, an already established familial relationship with mutual love and affection and a day to day caretaking role on the part of the parents with their children. 
    In Santosky the state was pitted against the parents. 
    The state came in with both feet upon those parents, I will grant you that, In this case, I submit that these interests deal with private parties. 
    The state is there to facilitate. 
    The state is there to give a mother an attorney should she need one, if she is on welfare. 
    The state in Pennsylvania is also there to give an indigent father an attorney via the public defender system, As far as the HLA blood tests, no one any more since Little versus Streeter is denied that opportunity to be heard. 
    Anyone in the United States can get HLA blood tests regardless of their financial or their economic status. 
    The liberty interest at stake in Santosky, as this Court said, could be extinguished forever as a result of this termination proceeding. 
    Here there is no liberty interest at stake. 
    Here there are no familial ties. 
    The only interests at stake are economic. 
    In Santosky the Court said the child will lose the right of support and maintenance from their parents forever upon the termination of parental rights. 
    So what the Court did was, they raised the standard in order to prevent this, in order to protect the child's interests. 
    What the appellant is asking you to do here, they are asking for the child to lose the rights to support and maintenance forever, and they are asking you to raise the standard to cause this result. 
    I submit to you that that result would be unfair and inapposite to what Santosky holds. 
    In Santosky the Court balances the parents' and the child's interests against the state. 
    It decided that the parents' and the child's interests were served by a higher standard. 
    In this case the parents, the father in particular, comes in as an adversary to the child. 
    The Court is asked to balance these interests as adversaries. 
    In Santosky for the majority of the Court the issue was familial bonds. 
    For the dissent in Santosky, the issue was the safety of the child. 
    I submit that the concerns of both the majority and the dissent in Santosky were for the child. 
    I would ask this Court to take this case on those terms as well and to consider the child's interests as you did in Santosky. 
    The issue in this case, I will repeat, is the monetary support. 
    In Santoksy the issue was imprecise substantive standards which left determinations open to the subjective values of one particular judge. 
    In Santosky you mentioned the issues of cultural bias because most of these parents happened to come from poor economic statuses. 
    You mentioned the issue of... there were other issues that you mentioned, the state being able to form the case from the very beginning against the parents and how you as a Court felt that was unfair. 
    In this case the decision is left to either one judge or to a jury of 12. 
    In this particular case the decision was left to a jury of 12. 
    It as civil proceeding. 
    We did not need to have a unanimous decision. 
    However, we did. 
    The HLAs were provided. 
    That is not an imprecise substantive standard, That is empirical medical evidence which is based on the evidence as it comes into the case. 
    Another important issue in Santosky was this Court's concern that the significant prospect of an erroneous termination existed. 
    I submit that in this case there is a small prospect of an erroneous decision due to the medical advancements that we have made in genetic testing, and one of those tests happens to be the HLAs. 
    I would also like to distinguish Little versus Streeter because I feel that is a very important case when it comes to our case here. 
    You used the word, this Court used the word "compelling interests" of both the father and the child in Little versus Streeter, and I believe that the interests were in the accuracy of the determination. 
    I submit that your decision to allow the HLAs to have them accessible to everyone involved cleared up the problem, and I submit it is just one piece of the problem in this case. 
    The HLAs provide empirical scientific evidence they reduce an erroneous determination greatly. 
    There is no longer one person's word against another. 
    If the red blood cell tests are run and the man is excluded, the state does not even bring any kind of a paternity suit. 
    No suit is filed. 
    If the HLAs are then run, if the man is not excluded by the red blood cell tests an HLA test is run and then the father would be included to a greater percent.

    In this 18 to 1 and 19 to 1 findings, is that considered a high probability as these things run, or medium, or what?

    Ms. Mary Louise Barton 
    Your Honor, I hesitate to answer that question. 
    I have seen them based on different genetic factors to be very high if the parties involved have very rare genetic characteristics. 
    In this case evidently the genetic characteristics were not all that rare. 
    I also understand that because the mother was a white Caucasian and the father was of Hispanic dissent that the statistical tables that were used did not allow the PhDs that figure out the statistical results to come up with as high perhaps a standard as they might have had there been two white people involved or two black people involved or something like that, Your Honor. 
    In Little versus Streeter I submit that the father, the putative father was denied due process. 
    I think it was a horrendous denial of due process. 
    The odds were stacked against that father. 
    That is not the facts here, I submit. 
    The facts here, as far as fairness in procedure, this father as well as the mother and child were given the right to a hearing before a domestic relations hearing officer at which time paternity could be acknowledged or denied if paternity was denied the HLA blood tests become a standard procedure then. 
    They are automatically ordered. 
    The parties appear for HLA blood tests. 
    After the HLA blood tests are returned the father has another hearing before a domestic relations hearing officer, an officer of the court. 
    At that time once again he may deny or acknowledge. 
    If he continues to deny after the HLA blood tests have included him to a large percentage he has the choice of a jury trial or a bench trial. 
    That choice may be made by the mother as well. 
    She could have opted for a jury or bench trial as well. 
    Also at that time, of course, the public defender system exists for the father to use, and I represent the district attorney's office. 
    The district attorney's office exists for the mother to use. 
    I submit that as far as fairness of procedure both sides are given exactly the same procedural safeguards. 
    I will restate it. 
    The issue in Streeter was accuracy, and I believe that your decision was absolutely correct. 
    I also believe that the burden of proof as Justice Scalia mentioned earlier does not make a decision more accurate. 
    I believe what it does, it shifts the risks of an erroneous decision. 
    In this case the appellant asks you to shift the risk to the child. 
    I submit that that is fundamentally unfair to the children. 
    The issue then is whether the preponderant standard fairly allocates the risk of an erroneous factfinding between the parties.

    Justice Scalia, in my... if I understand it correctly, when the fundamental liberty interests, of course, are at stake then it is a private party versus the state and then, of course, in all fairness the risk should be shifted more towards the state so that an individual cannot be deprived of what is a fundamental liberty interest. 
    In this case I submit that the risk will be shifted to the child, and that is illogical and unjust.

    I believe that's correct, because I believe the women, the mothers that are not on welfare are then of the next socioeconomic level where they cannot afford to have an attorney. 
    Therefore paternity suits on behalf of their children are never brought.

    Ms. Mary Louise Barton 
    Yes. 
    I do know if this will help at all that when they do transplants, kidney transplants, that they rely on these HLA tests, so I do know that they are very reliable as far as genetic markers go. 
    As far as the probability of paternity goes I can't explain that to you. 
    I apologize. 
    The issue then is whether the preponderance standard fairly allocates the risk of an erroneous factfinding between the parties. 
    The answer is yes. 
    The interests of the father are economic. 
    The interests of the child are economic. 
    The interests of the mother are economic. 
    The interests are therefore of equivalent constitutional significance. 
    The mandate for placing a greater burden on one party stems from the recognition that the other party has a constitutionally protected interest of greater import at stake. 
    The mandate therefore is negated. 
    The interests are of equal significance and are the same. 
    Since the interests are the same how would the due process clause have the risk of error allocated? 
    A higher burden of proof serves no useful constitutional purpose. 
    Any advantage accorded to one party by changing the standard of proof imposes a corresponding disadvantage on the other parties, in this case the child and the mother and the state somewhat. 
    This would accomplish only this. 
    It will visit the condemnation of the parent--

    Ms. Barton, I probably shouldn't interrupt you because I have another mathematical question. 
    You argue from the fact that the interests are equal and therefore you should have a 51 percent standard. 
    Supposing I thought the interests of the child were greater, therefore I suppose less than preponderance would be enough to justify prevailing because you want the child to win in as many cases as possible.

    Ms. Mary Louise Barton 
    And if I may borrow a quote from one of this Court's cases, if you would shift the risk to the child, all it would accomplish would be to visit the condemnation of the parents' irresponsible liaison upon the child. 
    This result is illogical and unjust. 
    Moreover, placing this standard of proof disability upon the child is contrary to the basic concept of our system that legal burdens should bear some relationship to the individual responsibility for wrongdoing.

    Ms. Mary Louise Barton 
    I think Webber. 
    Webber. 
    There is no principle basis for contending that the child is better served by decreasing the risk of erroneous findings of paternity at the cost of increasing the risk of erroneous findings of nonpaternity. 
    I will go through again, the appellant has been afforded generous process by the State of Pennsylvania, and I went through those before. 
    I think they are important enough that perhaps I should reiterate. 
    The Rules of Civil Procedure require that appellant receive proper notice upon the filing of a paternity suit. 
    He is afforded a hearing. 
    He is afforded the right to counsel. 
    He is afforded the right to a public defender should he be indigent. 
    He is afforded the right to blood tests. 
    He is afforded the right to a bench or a jury trial and then 12 of his peers would sit to hear the evidence. 
    He is afforded full appellate review as this case well demonstrates. 
    Appellant therefore is afforded the essence of due process, the opportunity to be heard at a meaningful time and in a meaningful way. 
    The suit is comparable to a negligence suit. 
    The bottom line is monetary. 
    The parties here are more private that state. 
    In fact, not all paternity suits have state involvement. 
    Only those in which the child is on welfare have state involvement. 
    Some would argue, as appellant has, that the state is putting pressure on the mother to put the finger on someone. 
    Perhaps that is how some people view it. 
    I submit, however, a fairer way to view it is, the state is watching out for the child's best interests. 
    In some instances the child and mother may assume somewhat of an adversarial role. 
    The mother may still care for the father and not wish to jeopardize that relationship. 
    The father may be paying some voluntary support and the mother may not wish to jeopardize that support. 
    The mother may be very young and intimidated by the legal proceeding or the legal system, precluding her from taking any steps to establish the civil legal relationship between the child and the father. 
    Furthermore, the state does have a responsibility to the taxpayers of the state to recoup some of the money that is being used to support a child that is born out of wedlock. 
    I would therefore ask that for the state of Pennsylvania that this Court affirm the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania and hold that the preponderance of evidence standard of proof chosen by Pennsylvania and 41 other states to be used in paternity suits does not violate the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution.

    Thank you, Ms. Barton.

   Rebuttal of William Watt Campbell
speaker="william_watt_campbell" startTime="2421.015" stopTime="2498.780">
    Mr. William Watt Campbell 
    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 
    A few brief remarks in rebuttal. 
    First of all, the quote from Webber was very nice, but what is at question here is not an irresponsible liaison. 
    The question is, did it ever happen, and did it result in a parent. 
    So those cases have nothing to do with this case. 
    Those cases and the adoption cases involve people who say they are the father and the children's rights and the fathers' rights. 
    That has nothing to do with the determining whether or not someone actually is the father of a child. 
    Chief Justice Rehnquist, you asked whether an 18 to 1 odds was a low likelihood or a high likelihood or what could it be, and as I pointed out there is no statute saying below a certain result you can't admit the results, but in the AMA-ABA study which I believe this Court is familiar with due to the numerous times it has been cited there is a table showing degrees of likelihood, and starting with practically proved, extremely likely, very likely, and in the 90 to 95 percent range, which is where the 18 to 1 falls, it says likely. 
    I think the Court should be aware of that.

    Mr. William Watt Campbell 
    That's right, but in this case, just another example of why there is tough evidence in this case, in this case I tried to show that Gregg's, my client's brother, had opportunity and access to have sex... this was one of the contentions we were trying to show... that he had sex with her, so he could be the father, and as indicated in the reporter cases and could have been in this case, blood test results don't mean anything else if somebody else had sex with the woman who was related.
