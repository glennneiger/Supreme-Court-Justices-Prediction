speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="0.000" stopTime="17.084">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    I have the judgments of the Court to announce in two cases No. 85-303, Missouri against Blair, No. 85-1656 Lynaugh against Petty. 
    In each of these cases the writ of certiorari is dismissed as improvidently granted.
