    v. Ardith McPherson. 
    Mr. Lee, you may begin whenever you're ready.

    Mr. Billy E. Lee 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court, chronologically developing our case, on January 12, 1981, Constable Rankin, who represents one of the eight constable precincts in Harris County appointed a new deputy, Ardith McPherson. 
    It is county procedure for a new county employee to be on a 90-day probation period at which the employee and the employer may look each over to determine whether they wish to extend beyond 20 days and go into indeterminate employment there. 
    The employment period that began on January 12, 1981, would have ended on April 12, 1981. 
    We had a short circuit occur though in that occasion. 
    President Roosevelt... not... President Reagan was sworn in on January 20 of-- 
    [Laughter] 
    Either one. 
    Thank you. 
    --on January 20th of 1981. 
    And just a few blocks away from this courthouse now on March 30th of 1981, he was a victim of an assassination attempt. 
    That will be six years from next Monday, and this case goes on and on. 
    At the constables' office, business was going on as usual. 
    His new deputy, Ardith McPherson, had been assigned primarily in her initial period as a computer operator. 
    Let me explain one thing about our constables office. 
    Our downtown constable is Walter Rankin. 
    The other seven constables are scattered all over the county by population groupings there. 
    But they are not around the downtown courthouse complex, which has about five court buildings there that generate all of the court process, the majority of the court process that goes out to the other precincts for service. 
    The new system which we call JIMS... Justice Information Management System... all of the process throughout the county comes into Constable Rankin's office, and it is put onto computers which plays back in 16 justice of the peace courts scattered over the county, 8 constables offices scattered over the county, the district clerk's office and the county clerk's office both across the street from him, as well as juvenile information goes on these same computers there. 
    So that any officer, court or law enforcement who is wanting to know at any particular moment the status of service of process in any of these cases can punch it up on the computer and have the answer right there before him as to what attempts have been made on service, what service has been completed, what service has been rejected because of bad addresses. 
    Anyway, the information is readily available throughout the county, based upon the input by Constable Rankin's office in the first instance before he sends the process out to other officers. 
    Now, when Constable Rankin appointed Ardith McPherson his deputy, he did this under a statute in Texas that says that all of the constable's employees are deputies. 
    He is not authorized to employ clerks, people to answer the telephone, people to do the typing. 
    Everybody that he employs is a deputy constable.

    It's going to have to be a far out estimate, Your Honor.

speaker="billy_e_lee" startTime="481.586" stopTime="523.836">
    Mr. Billy E. Lee 
    All right. 
    Under our Texas law, the constable employed her. 
    She is a deputy constable, in spite of the fact that all she does is punch in information on her computer. 
    If she did not do that part of the constable's duties, he himself would have to take his time and punch in that information there because that assignment was made for him to handle these computer inputs in the first instance there. 
    So one of his deputies, Ms. McPherson, was doing the constable's duties to the extent that she was just punching in information.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="523.836" stopTime="534.036">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    I guess it's a lucky thing then that the constable is not himself responsible for keeping the courthouse clean, which could have been the case. 
    I mean, you--

    Mr. Billy E. Lee 
    Which could have been the case, yes, sir. 
    That is right, because he would then--

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    --Then your argument would indeed extend to the man who swept the floor; right?

    Mr. Billy E. Lee 
    --He would have employed a deputy who swept the floor unless there were some changes in the law that authorized him to employ the floor sweepers.

    Yes, sir.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="553.075" stopTime="554.199">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    --because that man had the name of deputy?
speaker="billy_e_lee" startTime="554.199" stopTime="639.885">
    Mr. Billy E. Lee 
    That's right. 
    All right. 
    Now, we have a constitutional oath in Texas that every officer elected must take, and every officer appointed must take, and Deputy McPherson took this oath that says that she will uphold the office of deputy constable, and that she will uphold and support the Constitution and laws of the United States and of the State of Texas. 
    Now, only the constable was elected. 
    In the metropolitan area that is Harris County, which has about 20 percent of the entire population of the state of Texas in our county lines, the constable himself cannot possibly do all of the duties that the legislature has placed upon him by statute to do. 
    For one thing, at the time of this case we had about 160,000 pieces of process come through his office for channeling out to the other constables.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="639.885" stopTime="643.321">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Mr. Lee, is this process, is it civil; is it criminal; is it both?
speaker="billy_e_lee" startTime="643.321" stopTime="782.423">
    Mr. Billy E. Lee 
    It is both, Your Honor. 
    It is generally civil process, because his office is the incoming mailbox for all of the other 253 counties in Texas, and for counties and courts outside of the state, that send process into Harris County. 
    It is the originator, the square one there that makes all of the rest of the... and he has more computer agents, I would say, in his one office than all of the other seven constables put together there. 
    But that does not mean that he does all of the work there. 
    He just is the initial inputter. 
    But because of the greater litigation area in his precinct there, he probably handles about 25 percent of all of the service process, and the other seven handle 75 percent of it. 
    All right. 
    Now, this court and other courts throughout the state and the nation have consistently taken the viewpoint that the constable is an officer of the court. 
    He is a law enforcement officer. 
    In Texas we have a Code of Criminal Procedure that says that he is a conservator of the peace, that he is charged with suppressing crime. 
    Now in this particular instance when the radio in the computer room announced that an attempt was made to assassinate President Reagan, it apparently has failed, and he is being pushed into a car and leaving the scene. 
    And--

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Mr. Lee, was this lady fired because of what she said or because of what she believed? 
    Do we know that? 
    I mean, suppose when she was called in by the constable and asked whether she had said that, she said, "Yes, I said it".

speaker="billy_e_lee" startTime="805.835" stopTime="806.491">
    Mr. Billy E. Lee 
    Yes, sir.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="806.491" stopTime="827.298">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Do we know whether she would have been fired? 
    I mean, conceivably you might fire her anyway I mean, he might have said, 
    "Well, you know, you shouldn't talk like that, whether you mean it or not. " 
    "I don't want that kind of talk in my law enforcement agency, whether you mean it or not. " 
    "It shows poor judgment, and you're fired. " 
    Was that the basis for his dismissal?
speaker="billy_e_lee" startTime="827.298" stopTime="843.808">
    Mr. Billy E. Lee 
    Your Honor, I would say not, based upon two trials that we have been through in the District Court. 
    In the District Court, Captain LeVrier heard Ardith McPherson say that--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="843.808" stopTime="845.120">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    --she really meant it?
speaker="billy_e_lee" startTime="845.120" stopTime="880.733">
    Mr. Billy E. Lee 
    --No. 
    He asked her that. 
    He said that if they tried for the President again, she hoped next time they got him. 
    And he went over to her, and he said, "You don't really mean that". 
    She said, 
    "Yes, I do mean it. " 
    So then through channels that information was carried to Constable Rankin who called her into his office with Captain LeVrier there, and he asked her, he said, 
    "I have herd of a statement that you have just made. " 
    "Did you make that statement? " 
    She said yes, she did mean it, and--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="880.733" stopTime="883.232">

    Mr. Glen D. Nager 
    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 
    May it please the Court, this Court has noted on more than one occasion that the State's interests as an employer in regulating the expressive activities of its employees differs quite significantly from those it possesses in connection with regulation of the speech of the citizenry in general. 
    The Court has upheld various restrictions on the expressive activities of public employees, restrictions that could not have been applied to the citizenry in general. 
    For example, in Snepp versus United States, this Court upheld the right of the CIA to screen its employees' publications, a system of prior restraint which simply could not have been applied to the citizenry in general.

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Mr. Nager, that's what we have here, a firing because of what she said, not because of the kind of person she was; right? 
    It wasn't that 
    "I don't want somebody here who hopes that the President will get assassinated the next time successfully. " 
    but rather, 
    "I don't want somebody who says that kind of thing. "
speaker="glen_d_nager" startTime="1057.122" stopTime="1062.480">
    Mr. Glen D. Nager 
    The short answer is yes, although I'm not quite sure you can separate them out--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="1062.480" stopTime="1063.947">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    We can.
speaker="glen_d_nager" startTime="1063.947" stopTime="1090.859">
    Mr. Glen D. Nager 
    --by what the constable said. 
    In fact, as we read the record, he terminated her for expressing her approval of the violation of a serious criminal law; that is, he did fire her for what she said. 
    I'm not quite sure there's another way she could have said the same thing, that he could have just fired her for the manner of her expression. 
    But we do think he did fire her for the substance of what she said; that is, that if they go for him again, I hope they get him.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1090.859" stopTime="1097.139">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Is there reason to think she would have been fired if she had said that, but then it turned out that she didn't mean it?
speaker="glen_d_nager" startTime="1097.139" stopTime="1103.277">
    Mr. Glen D. Nager 
    The record doesn't reflect what Constable Rankin's thinking was on that subject, Justice Rehnquist.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="1103.277" stopTime="1106.089">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    It was important to him. 
    He asked her that, didn't he?
speaker="glen_d_nager" startTime="1106.089" stopTime="1174.173">
    Mr. Glen D. Nager 
    Yes, he did, which shows that he was trying to find out whether or not she was an individual who indeed believed that it was okay to assassinate... attempt to assassinate the President, to violate criminal laws. 
    Now, we think that this Court's decision emphasized two things in public employees' speech cases. 
    The first is that the Government's interest as an employer differ from those it has when it acts in its capacity as a sovereign. 
    And, in addition, employment-related sanctions, while placing a burden on First Amendment rights to be sure, are a much lesser burden than general criminal or civil sanctions. 
    Thus, the court has upheld the right of the Government to place reasonable restrictions on the expressive activities of public employees, in order to promote substantial governmental interests. 
    And we think that this is precisely such a case. 
    Respondent in this case was an employee of a law enforcement agency, and she expressed her approval and desire for an assassination of the President. 
    The law enforcement agency for which she worked is by definition committed to the enforcement of criminal laws.

    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Would the result be different in some other kind of public officer, Mr. Nager? 
    Let's say the clerk's office as opposed to the constable's?
speaker="glen_d_nager" startTime="1183.826" stopTime="1187.309">
    Mr. Glen D. Nager 
    The clerk's office of the court system of Harris County?

    Yeah, where papers are filed.
speaker="glen_d_nager" startTime="1188.465" stopTime="1221.425">
    Mr. Glen D. Nager 
    We believe the answer would be the same, Justice O'Connor, although the twist on the theory would be slightly different. 
    Here, the constable's office is a law enforcement agency; and the expressive activity is directly inconsistent with the principal function of that office. 
    That is, it is a law enforcement agency. 
    The clerk's office would not be, quote, a law enforcement agency. 
    But it does have an interest in having employees who won't engage in expressive activity inconsistent with its function. 
    And when an employee--

    Mr. Glen D. Nager 
    --When an employee expresses approval of a violation of a serious criminal law, that is indicative of the type of expressive activity that that employee will engage in as regards to the function of the agency with which she is employed. 
    So while we recognize it's a more difficult case, it's not a case that the Court has to decide today.

    It is correct... it is correct that this statement was made in an office. 
    It was made after an announcement on the radio that there had been an attempt on the President's life. 
    Her comment was overheard by a deputy... by a senior deputy constable who asked her if she meant it. 
    By her testimony, all she did was smile at him. 
    By his testimony, she said she meant it.

    Mr. Glen D. Nager 
    I certainly cannot. 
    Once again, we think that the government interest here is in promoting public respect for and understanding of the law. 
    Let me point out that the Court of Appeals understood that in this case. 
    It said that a government agency is entitled to employ only those individuals who have no serious reservations about the mission of the agency. 
    And it also said that a law enforcement agency is entitled to carry out its mission through officers who do not favor political assassination. 
    But the Court of Appeals said that for some reason, because she performed ministerial duties, that the Government had no interest in discharging her. 
    We suggest that that just misunderstands the governmental interest here. 
    The governmental interest here does not relate to the particular duties that she was performing. 
    Rather, it extends beyond them. 
    It extends to every employee of the agency, because it extends to the core function of the agency; that is, of enforcing the law, of promoting respect for the law, teaching the public about the law. 
    Her speech demeans that, undermines it, and is inconsistent with the function that the agency is attempting to perform. 
    In our brief we gave--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="1640.532" stopTime="1644.125">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    If she were an employee in the Interior Department, that would be okay then; right?

    Mr. Glen D. Nager 
    Now, as I tried to... in response to Justice O'Connor's question... say, although we think it would be a different case, we would be willing to defend it on the theory that by expressing approval of such a serious act as a violation of a criminal law as approval of murder, that, in fact, that would be an indicator that a public employer could use to acknowledge and determine that this employee of the Interior Department is not one who would carry out to the best of his or her abilities the functions of the Interior Department.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1688.139" stopTime="1699.590">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    May I ask another question? 
    We started out with President Roosevelt. 
    I remember that there was an assassination attempt on him. 
    Supposing four years later, an employee said, 
    "I think the country would be better off if they had gotten him? "
speaker="glen_d_nager" startTime="1699.590" stopTime="1720.112">
    Mr. Glen D. Nager 
    That's a good question, and I think it will point out, hopefully, a good part of our answer is that the issue is: Does the expressive activity indicate that that employee is one who will act inconsistently with the function of the agency today, such that if the statement could be reasonably understood--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1720.112" stopTime="1725.422">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    That the employee would act... You think this is a suggestion that this person would try to kill the President?

    Mr. Glen D. Nager 
    We did not at all suggest that this individual was making any threat on the life of the President or that she was actively encouraging anyone. 
    All we're suggesting is: The question is whether or not her speech can be reasonably understood as expressing approval of an illegal act--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1745.495" stopTime="1753.853">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    You're changing the hypothetical a little. 
    "Not only do I think the government... the country would be better off if they had gotten him four years ago, but I've thought about it a great deal, and I really wish they had hit him. "

    Mr. Glen D. Nager 
    --We think that... I'd have to say that we would think that she could be discharged for that. 
    Let me point out... before my time is up... that while we made this argument in our brief about what the governmental interest is here, in 70 pages of briefing by Respondent and their amicus, there is not anything which answers this argument, that this is the governmental interest that the constable testified he was trying to promote and that, in fact, it is a reasonable judgment for the public employer to discharge an employee for engaging in this type of expressive activity.

    Mr. Glen D. Nager 
    --Right. 
    And what we're suggesting is--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="1808.331" stopTime="1816.923">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    And there was this low-level employee, the Court of Appeals said to balances... that she should be able to make this kind of a political speech.
speaker="glen_d_nager" startTime="1816.923" stopTime="1894.349">
    Mr. Glen D. Nager 
    --And we're suggesting that this is, (a), not an appropriate inquiry for the court to be making, that that is something in the discretion of the employer, the employer could take into account in determining whether to reprimand her or discharge her, or whatever. 
    But the employer is, in fact, promoting the government's interests when, no matter what level the employee is at, the employee engages in expressive activity that is inconsistent with the message that the agency is supposed to be sending to the public. 
    That any employee of the EEOC, for example, who expresses her approval of acts of employment discrimination undermines the EEOC's efforts to teach the public and to get the public to appreciate the importance of complying with the employment discrimination laws. 
    That any employee of the Internal Revenue Service who expresses approval of tax fraud or tax evasion or noncompliance is undermining the IRS's efforts to get the public to understand the importance of voluntarily complying with laws. 
    Our legal order is one that depends critically on the public appreciating and voluntarily complying with the law and of respecting the law. 
    When the law enforcement agency itself... any of its employees starts expressing their approval for the violations of those laws, it undermines the agency's ability to accomplish the function with which it is assigned. 
    Unless the Court has further questions. 
   
   
   
   Argument of Lloyd N. Cutler
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1894.349" stopTime="1897.926">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Thank you, Mr. Nager. 
    We'll hear now from you, Mr. Cutler.
speaker="lloyd_n_cutler" startTime="1897.926" stopTime="1983.175">
    Mr. Lloyd N. Cutler 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court. 
    It's common grounds in this case that Mrs. McPherson's remarks were not among the classes of speech which can constitutionally be branded as illegal. 
    They were not libelous or obscene or fighting words or a threat of or an incitement to assassination or the violent overthrow of the government. 
    There are really two disputed issues. 
    The first is whether these remarks were on a serious matter of public concern and, therefore, on the highest rung of the ladder of First Amendment values. 
    The second is whether the balancing test of the Pickering/Connick line of cases, which both sides accept for weighing the speech of public employees. 
    Mrs. McPherson's right to speak is outweighed by the governmental interests in the efficiency of the public service. 
    Under the Connick test we accept that for the Fifth Circuit's views to be upheld in this Court, we must prevail on both of those issues. 
    I'd like to turn first--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="1983.175" stopTime="1998.185">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    For instance, if a newspaperman heard about this statement and interviewed her on television and said,

    You wouldn't think she could be fired then?

    Mr. Lloyd N. Cutler 
    Well, that was not what she said. 
    I don't think that's close to what she said, Justice White. 
    Perhaps that gets to the question of whether she was addressing an issue of public concern. 
    And I take it, although the Solicitor General at one point seems to dispute this, there is no doubt that the context in form and content of her remarks are something that this Court will judge for itself, because this is a mixed question of constitutional law and fact in a First Amendment case.

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    That the desirability of assassinating the President is a matter of public concern?
speaker="lloyd_n_cutler" startTime="2119.080" stopTime="2257.795">
    Mr. Lloyd N. Cutler 
    Not the desirability of assassinating the President, but expressing a disapproval of the President's comments in terms as strong and as ill-advised as, 
    "If they try it again, I hope they get him. " 
    that that is a comment, and it's the only way it can be understood is as a comment on the President's policies. 
    It happened to be that the conversation occurred at the very moment after the first news of the attempt which, under the first report, was unsuccessful. 
    I think it's perfectly clear that if she had been in a discussion of the President's policies, the Administration's policies, the day before, she never would have uttered that comment. 
    If it had been weeks later, it's most unlikely that she would have uttered that comment. 
    It was a comment that was simply evoked by the circumstances, the shock of the report which everybody feels. 
    And once she heard that, she used that figure of speech in expressing her disapproval. 
    When you make an examination of what she actually said, as... and this is undisputed testimony... she begins by saying, after this first news, 
    "It must have been a black who did it. " 
    to her colleague at the next desk to whom she has since been married. 
    She then says... she makes comments about the President's policies on food stamps, on CETA, on public welfare programs; and her colleague at the next desk agrees with her. 
    And then she says... and that happens to be at the very moment when Captain LeVrier is walking up... 
    "The next time they try it, I hope they get him. " 
    In its context, there isn't the slightest question that that remark is a remark in the course of a discussion of the political... of Administration policies, and that the reference to 
    "if they try it again, I hope they get him. " 
    was clearly something evoked by the emotion of the moment.

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    You could fire an employee, I take it, who constantly uses profanity, vulgar, obscene language around the office, but not... or arguably not, you'd have to meet a different... a substantially different burden, if he only uses that language in the course of his political discussions?
speaker="lloyd_n_cutler" startTime="2295.939" stopTime="2313.744">
    Mr. Lloyd N. Cutler 
    Well, if he uses obscene language, you said, I believe, Justice Scalia, commonly or regularly that might affect employee morale or efficiency, it might well be someone who went around even in the context of a political discussion--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="2313.744" stopTime="2330.487">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    You're applying the test. 
    All I'm asking you is whether it's a different test. 
    We have to apply one test to vulgarity, obscenity, profanity when it's just used generally. 
    But a totally different test... and we have to see if it's outweighed by some governmental interest... if that's used in the course of a political discussion.
speaker="lloyd_n_cutler" startTime="2330.487" stopTime="2343.779">
    Mr. Lloyd N. Cutler 
    --If it is part of a discussion on a political issue or meant to be an expression on a political expression, it has to be weighed. 
    It may turn out to be obscene, in which case it can be banned.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="2343.779" stopTime="2362.509">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Why is that? 
    I mean, part of my problem is: I don't understand how broad the definition of the discussion has to be. 
    Why can't we just look at this one sentence? 
    Do we have to expand it to look at the whole conversation? 
    I don't know--
speaker="lloyd_n_cutler" startTime="2362.509" stopTime="2370.195">
    Mr. Lloyd N. Cutler 
    Well, we're now in the context, I take it, of can this discussion be prohibited or punished? 
    Or are you speaking solely of public employees?
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="2370.195" stopTime="2379.566">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    --No. 
    I'm talking about whether for purposes of deciding whether this was a part of a statement on a matter for public concern--
speaker="lloyd_n_cutler" startTime="2379.566" stopTime="2380.145">
    Mr. Lloyd N. Cutler 
    --not a political issue.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="2380.145" stopTime="2386.268">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    --we have to look at the whole preceding ten minutes of her conversation or we can't just look at the single sentence?
speaker="lloyd_n_cutler" startTime="2386.268" stopTime="2388.346">
    Mr. Lloyd N. Cutler 
    I think you have to look at the--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="2388.346" stopTime="2395.968">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    If you look at the single sentence, you would acknowledge, I hope, that it is not a matter of public concern, that we don't debate on whether the President should be assassinated or not.
speaker="lloyd_n_cutler" startTime="2395.968" stopTime="2401.889">
    Mr. Lloyd N. Cutler 
    --We certainly don't debate on whether the President should be assassinated, and I deplore myself any such statement.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="2401.889" stopTime="2403.356">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    So if we would only look at one sentence--
speaker="lloyd_n_cutler" startTime="2403.356" stopTime="2431.035">
    Mr. Lloyd N. Cutler 
    A statement, 
    "If they try it again, I hope they get him. " 
    is clearly, by any standard, an expression of her disapproval of the individual. 
    It is not a general endorsement of violence, assassination or anything like that. 
    It's an extreme, immoderate, foolish, excessive comment about a matter of public concern; namely, the policies of that individual.

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist

    And it happens all the time.

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist

    "I think all sorts of people should be assassinated, and I think President Reagan should be assassinated? "
speaker="lloyd_n_cutler" startTime="2442.891" stopTime="2446.452">
    Mr. Lloyd N. Cutler 
    Yes, I do think there is.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2446.452" stopTime="2447.279">

    Where--

    Mr. Lloyd N. Cutler 
    If you're still on the issue of whether this is a matter of public concern, it is clearly something, number one, that cannot legally be punished or prohibited. 
    And, number two, if it is with reference to an individual, and there were many similar statements, no doubt at the time of the attempt on Governor George Wallace, at the time of the successful assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, at the time when Jack Ruby shot Lee Harvey Oswald, there were many, many people--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="2480.891" stopTime="2481.845">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    --Many of which were meant.
speaker="lloyd_n_cutler" startTime="2481.845" stopTime="2482.423">

    --Huh?
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="2482.423" stopTime="2484.499">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Many of which were meant literally.
speaker="lloyd_n_cutler" startTime="2484.499" stopTime="2500.260">
    Mr. Lloyd N. Cutler 
    It may have been meant, but they were expressions, not, "We're all for assassination". 
    They were expressions of how that individual thought about the policies or the actions of the victim. 
    That's what they were.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2500.260" stopTime="2504.899">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well, then that takes it out of the context of favoring assassination?
speaker="lloyd_n_cutler" startTime="2504.899" stopTime="2512.975">
    Mr. Lloyd N. Cutler 
    I do believe it takes it out of the context of favoring assassination as such. 
    I would remind you also--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="2512.975" stopTime="2520.021">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Is what you're saying that anybody who favors assassinating someone is disapproving that person? 
    I mean, I'll stipulate that. 
    But doesn't that--
speaker="lloyd_n_cutler" startTime="2520.021" stopTime="2521.160">
    Mr. Lloyd N. Cutler 
    --That's right.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="2521.160" stopTime="2531.984">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    --But the two aren't coextensive. 
    I mean, you can disapprove of someone without favoring that person's assassination.
speaker="lloyd_n_cutler" startTime="2531.984" stopTime="2538.341">
    Mr. Lloyd N. Cutler 
    Of course you can. 
    It is an excessive, immoderate way of making a political statement is what it is.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="2538.341" stopTime="2539.170">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    No. 
    It's--
speaker="lloyd_n_cutler" startTime="2539.170" stopTime="2540.449">
    Mr. Lloyd N. Cutler 
    And it cannot be--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="2540.449" stopTime="2544.230">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    --It isn't a political statement, if you want the person's assassination.
speaker="lloyd_n_cutler" startTime="2544.230" stopTime="2594.587">
    Mr. Lloyd N. Cutler 
    --Well, certainly in the context here, it was a political statement. 
    I believe you began this line of questioning by inquiring, 
    "Do we have to look at all the sentences? " 
    In Claiborne Hardware there was a reference in the long impassioned speech by Mr. Evers, the boycott organizer, in which he said that 
    "If we catch you in those stores which are to be boycotted, we'll break your necks; and there won't be any white policemen around in the middle of the night to help you. " 
    But because it was in the middle of a long impassioned speech, the bulk of which was about promoting the success of the boycott, it was held... just as the remarks in the Watts case were held... to be political hyperbole.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2594.587" stopTime="2610.567">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Yes. 
    But there was no finding there that the statement was actually meant and was seriously made. 
    Here I think you have to face up to the fact that the Court of Appeals sustained the District Court's finding--
speaker="lloyd_n_cutler" startTime="2610.567" stopTime="2611.161">
    Mr. Lloyd N. Cutler 
    There was no finding--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2611.161" stopTime="2615.611">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    --and interpreted it that she really meant it, and that she really wished the President would be killed.
speaker="lloyd_n_cutler" startTime="2615.611" stopTime="2637.196">
    Mr. Lloyd N. Cutler 
    --She was expressing at most a hope that if it happened again... she was not urging assassination, she was not threatening it herself most certainly... she was stating her opposition to the President's policies in this extreme and immoderate form, 
    "If they try it again, I hope they get him. "
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2637.196" stopTime="2647.005">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well, the Court of Appeals said that the record supports the District Court's conclusion that McPherson expressed an actual wish for the assassination of the President.
speaker="lloyd_n_cutler" startTime="2647.005" stopTime="2668.871">
    Mr. Lloyd N. Cutler 
    That is correct. 
    But in the very next sentence, as I mentioned, Justice Rehnquist... I think it's the very next paragraph... the Court of Appeals says, in suggesting that that finding is an arguendo finding, that whether she was expressing opposition to the President's policies or an actual wish for his assassination, her remarks--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2668.871" stopTime="2681.100">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, we judge the case as though she really meant it and she really had the wish. 
    The Court of Appeals said even if she really wished it, the First Amendment protects her.
speaker="lloyd_n_cutler" startTime="2681.100" stopTime="2683.647">
    Mr. Lloyd N. Cutler 
    --Well, there's no question that--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2683.647" stopTime="2683.912">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Isn't that right?
speaker="lloyd_n_cutler" startTime="2683.912" stopTime="2693.519">
    Mr. Lloyd N. Cutler 
    --That is right. 
    There's no question that the First Amendment protects it from the standpoint of enjoining--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2693.519" stopTime="2695.222">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Protected her from being fired?
speaker="lloyd_n_cutler" startTime="2695.222" stopTime="2700.735">
    Mr. Lloyd N. Cutler 
    --That gets us to the Pickering/Connick balancing test, I think.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="2700.735" stopTime="2707.279">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    We don't have to go that far, that she intended to kill the President?
speaker="lloyd_n_cutler" startTime="2707.279" stopTime="2805.555">
    Mr. Lloyd N. Cutler 
    I don't believe you have to... I think it is clear this was political hyperbole, and you are obliged, I think, to examine it yourself. 
    It was the fourth or fifth sentence in a series that began, as I said, 
    "It must have been a black who did it. " 
    A discussion of the President's policies, which she and her neighbor at the next desk disapproved, and then this extreme final sentence which happens to be the one that was overheard. 
    May I continue, if I can, with the balancing test issue which I think really is the most important issue? 
    We think that Mrs. McPherson's firing cannot be justified under the Pickering/Connick test. 
    And in asking you to weigh this, bear in mind that there are some 15 million public employees. 
    That's approximately 15 percent of the work force. 
    It's our best guess there are some 5 million law enforcement employees, of whom perhaps one million... that's a figure we know more solidly... are in the criminal justice system. 
    It was not... I hope I have carried you that... properly understood as political hyperbole as in Watts, where the statement, as you'll recall, was... by someone opposed to the draft. 
    "If they put a rifle in my hands, the first man I hope to get in my sights is LBJ. "
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2805.555" stopTime="2807.445">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Do you think Watts is still good law?
speaker="lloyd_n_cutler" startTime="2807.445" stopTime="2873.107">
    Mr. Lloyd N. Cutler 
    I would hope Watts is still good law, Justice. 
    I believe it still is, and I believe that's conceded by the government, at least which concedes you could not criminalize this statement. 
    It regards Watts simply as a construction of the statute about threats to the President, but I think an examination of the opinion would clearly show it's on constitutional grounds. 
    It was not as in Connick one remark on a matter of public concern among many other remarks which were about the affairs of the office. 
    It was a private, rather than a public, remark. 
    She didn't stand up on a table and make this remark. 
    She didn't have a poster behind her desk or anything like that. 
    That, as you held in the Givhan case, the fact that it was private, does not take it out of the category of comment on a matter of public concern. 
    Most public speech in this country is private.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="2873.107" stopTime="2878.668">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Well, it wasn't really private. 
    I mean, she may have thought it was private, but that was part of--
speaker="lloyd_n_cutler" startTime="2878.668" stopTime="2881.838">
    Mr. Lloyd N. Cutler 
    It happened to get overheard by one person; that's quite right.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="2881.838" stopTime="2888.008">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    --By Captain LeVrier, who was offended by it, and it might have offended other co-workers. 
    I mean, that shows some--
speaker="lloyd_n_cutler" startTime="2888.008" stopTime="3014.028">
    Mr. Lloyd N. Cutler 
    That's what I... I believe I'll show in a moment, Justice Scalia, she was not fired on the ground that it offended anyone else, or that it affected discipline or morale in the office. 
    It was the constable's loss of confidence in her that was his basis for firing her, and as I'll try to get to in a moment in response to your earlier question to Mr. Lee, it was based more on her beliefs than anything else. 
    In Connick's words it was "speech as a citizen", and not as an employee. 
    The fact that it occurred in the workplace was certainly not a matter of deliberate choice on her part. 
    All of us, when we heard that news, were frozen in place wherever we were and whatever emotional response we had to the event was going to come out wherever we were. 
    It was not intended to, and it did not cause, what Connick called a mini-insurrection in the office. 
    It was private. 
    It wasn't meant to be overheard. 
    It wasn't voicing a grievance as an employee, but a grievance as a citizen. 
    Constable Rankin conceded that it had no effect on office efficiency or discipline, and the Coiurt of Appeals found that. 
    It had nothing to do with office business or the personnel or the mission of the office. 
    There was no other reason for the finding... for the firing on which a court could have relied, as in the Mt. 
    Healthy case. 
    And Rankin conceded that this was the reason. 
    And what he said was, 
    "I did not base my action on whether the work was interrupted or not. " 
    "I based my statement... my action, on a statement that was made to me direct. " 
    "Right then was when I lost confidence in her. " 
    That's at page 86, I think, of the Joint Appendix.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="3014.028" stopTime="3028.927">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    --Well, if you rely on that, then you are conceding that she reaffirmed in the discussion with Rankin, not only that she had said it, but that she meant it, because that's what that testimony refers to? 
    "I said it, and I meant it. "
speaker="lloyd_n_cutler" startTime="3028.927" stopTime="3039.033">
    Mr. Lloyd N. Cutler 
    What the District Court found is by word or deed... The District Court never found, as I think Justice O'Connor pointed out earlier, that she said, "Yes, I meant it".
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="3039.033" stopTime="3042.111">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    No.

speaker="lloyd_n_cutler" startTime="3042.111" stopTime="3042.580">
    Mr. Lloyd N. Cutler 
    That's his testimony.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="3042.580" stopTime="3043.142">

    --That's his testimony.
speaker="lloyd_n_cutler" startTime="3043.142" stopTime="3043.626">

    That's right.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="3043.626" stopTime="3046.282">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    If you rely on it, you have to accept it for the good and the bad.
speaker="lloyd_n_cutler" startTime="3046.282" stopTime="3107.479">
    Mr. Lloyd N. Cutler 
    I rely on it to... Well, the District Court made its findings. 
    I don't think it's important whether she said, "Yes, I mean it", or not. 
    And we do have a finding below that by word or deed, she meant it. 
    I ask you: Looking at the conversation in context, though, to conclude that even if she meant it, it was still political hyperbole of the type which Mr. Evers in the Claiborne Hardware case... where I don't believe, and I was in that case... there was any issue as to whether he meant it, other than as political hyperbole. 
    The critical point there was: It was part of a much larger speech, and that no violent acts occurred after the speech was made. 
    So that a finding of intimidation in the lower courts... unlawful intimidation was not justified. 
    The fact that the constable's office is a law enforcement agency, rather than some other place of public employment, we don't think changes the balance here.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="3107.479" stopTime="3158.584">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Mr. Cutler, this was a probationary employee. 
    Do you suppose there's any reason at all why the employer of a probationary employee could not determine that the employer would keep as employees in the office only people the employer could trust and had confidence in, that they would be sensible people who could deal properly with the public in a public office, and then judge... make that judgment on the basis of perfectly protected speech, but conclude the fact that the person thinks the way the employee thinks and says what she says indicates to me that person doesn't merit a permanent job? 
    What's the matter with that?
speaker="lloyd_n_cutler" startTime="3158.584" stopTime="3205.363">
    Mr. Lloyd N. Cutler 
    Well, to begin with, Perry against Sindermann holds even for employees lacking tenure... I believe that's a teacher's case... that there is an economic expectation even for probationary employees. 
    But, in addition, to allow all of the supervisors of public employees in the country a broad discretion to fire people, even probationary people, based on their speech on a matter of public concern is giving a very wide discretion. 
    There are considerable doubts about any statute... let us say a modern version of the Alien and Sedition--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="3205.363" stopTime="3226.572">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    My question is whether speech on a matter of public concern can evidence character traits of the employee that would justify the employer from saying, 
    "I don't think this person merits permanent employment. " 
    Do you think that can't be done in the public sector?
speaker="lloyd_n_cutler" startTime="3226.572" stopTime="3324.160">
    Mr. Lloyd N. Cutler 
    --I would say, Justice O'Connor, that it is a very dangerous power to grant just on the distinction between the probationary employee and the employee or this person, let us say, a month later after her probationary status was over. 
    Any form of government sanction, based on judgments about the beliefs of an employee, at the very least ought to be supported by statutes and rules, as Professor Bickel said. 
    The only thing that saved the Civil Service rules in Arnett against Kennedy was a long period of interpretation and regulations so that employees knew what to expect, for to allow all the supervisors in the country to decide on the basis of speech on a matter of public concern, 
    "I don't like the President, I disapprove of his policies. " 
    to go get somebody else, I should think would be a very dangerous thing. 
    You have ruled several times in Elrod against Burns, in Branti against Finkel, where you had public employees who were not on probationary status. 
    You had a deputy sheriff in Elrod. 
    You had a public defender in Branti. 
    You said in neither case could they be fired on the basis of their political beliefs.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="3324.160" stopTime="3343.246">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Can they be fired because they exhibit character traits and an inability to reason adequately to serve in the job of public employment, even though that judgment is made in part by speech that could be protected?
speaker="lloyd_n_cutler" startTime="3343.246" stopTime="3376.342">
    Mr. Lloyd N. Cutler 
    If it is made on the basis of their suitability to hold the particular job that they are doing, I would say yes. 
    If this same remark had been made... let us say by an FBI employee in Justice White's case on television, I would say yes, that person could be fired.

    I think the last points I would like to make are that the Solicitor General's professionalism test and the constable's test of losing confidence are not constitutionally adequate justifications for firing, based on speech relating to matters of public concern. 
    And I would submit to you that no statute containing that sort of a vague standard, "whenever the supervisor loses confidence", or finds that in his judgment the employee is unprofessional would be sustained as to a matter of speech on a subject of public concern. 
    Suppose that you had a new alien and sedition law which was limited to the 15 million public employees, or even the 5 million law enforcement employees. 
    And the only sanction for speaking ill of the President or the Government or bringing them into disrepute was loss of job. 
    Could a statute like that possibly be sustained today? 
    I would submit to you, in New York Times against Sullivan at least that it could not. 
    Approving Mrs. McPherson's discharge, it seems to us, opens up an Orwellian prospect of standardless firing by supervisors for speech on matters of public concern, for political expressions and even beliefs. 
    We think it would go far beyond any First Amendment case that you have ever decided, even those written under the stress of the war and the McArthur era. 
    And even those cases where you sustained a restriction on speech and belief, almost all of them were based on some statute or regulation passed by the majority of some Legislature in setting some standard, rather than on the discretion, without any regulation at all, of hundreds or thousands of supervisors.
