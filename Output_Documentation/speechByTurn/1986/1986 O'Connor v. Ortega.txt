    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    This case comes to us on certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. 
    The respondent, psychiatrist, was an employee of a State Hospital in California, and had primary responsibility for training positions in the psychiatric residency program. 
    Hospital officials became concerned about possible improprieties in his management of the program. 
    Particularly with respect to his acquisition of a computer and charges against him concerning sexual harassment of female hospital employees and inappropriate disciplinary action against the resident. 
    While he was on the administrative leave pending investigation of the charges, hospital officials allegedly, in order to inventory and secure state property, searched his office and seized his personal items from his desk and file cabinets that were used then in administrative proceedings resulting in his discharge. 
    Respondent filed an action against the hospital officials in Federal District Court under Section 1983 alleging that the search of his office violated the Fourth Amendment. 
    The District Court granted summary judgment for the hospital officials, concluding that the search was proper because there was a need to secure state property in the office. 
    The Court of Appeals reversed in part concluding that the respondent had a reasonable expectation of privacy in his office, and that the search violated the Fourth Amendment. 
    The Court of Appeals remanded the case to the District Court for determination of damages. 
    In an opinion file today, we reverse the partial summary judgment of the Court of Appeals, and remand the case for further proceedings. 
    We recognize that searches and seizures by government employers or supervisors of the private property of their employees are subject to Fourth Amendment restraints. 
    Majority of the Court finds on the facts of this case that Dr. Ortega had a reasonable expectation of privacy in his office. 
    That does not end the inquiry however, because it still must be determined by the courts below whether the search at issue complied with the requirements of the Fourth Amendment. 
    We hold that the standard to be applied in the context of a search by a government employer of an employee's office desk or file cabinet for a work related purpose, is one of reasonable most under all of the circumstances. 
    We reject the application of a warrant requirement or a probable cause standard in this context. 
    The opinion is joined by only four members of the Court. 
    Justice Scalia has filed an opinion concurring in the judgment; Justice Blackman has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justices Brennan, Marshall and Stevens have joined.
