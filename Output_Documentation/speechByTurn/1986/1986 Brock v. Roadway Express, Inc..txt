Brock v. Roadway Express, Inc.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="0.000" stopTime="78.838">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    The last case Brock versus Roadway Express Incorporated is in appeal from the judgment of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia. 
    Which court held unconstitutional Section 405 of the Surface Transportation Assistance Act. 
    We hold today that the Act does not deprive the employer of due process by failing to require the full evidentiary hearing before the temporary reinstatement is ordered. 
    So long as the employee is given an opportunity to respond to the Secretary's evidence and the prompt postreinstatement hearing is available. 
    We therefore affirm in part and reverse in part. 
    Justice Blackmun, Justice Powell and Justice O'Connor have joined this opinion; Justice Brennan has filed an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part; Justice Stevens has filed an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part in which the Chief Justice and Justice Scalia join; Justice Steven has filed an opinion dissenting in part.
