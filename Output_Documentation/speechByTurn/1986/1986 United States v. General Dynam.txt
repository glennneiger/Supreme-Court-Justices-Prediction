    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    In No. 85-1385, the US versus General Dynamics comes to us from the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. 
    The Court of Appeals there held that an accrual-basis taxpayer, that provided medical benefit to its employees could deduct an estimate of its obligation to pay the medical care obtained during the last quarter of the year. 
    Claims to which had not yet been filed has over close of the tax year. 
    In an opinion filed with the Clerk today, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals. 
    Justice O'Connor has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justice Blackmun and Justice Stevens have joined.
