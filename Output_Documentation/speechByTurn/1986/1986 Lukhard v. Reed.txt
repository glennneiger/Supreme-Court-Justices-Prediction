    We will hear arguments next in No. 85-1358, Lukhard against Reed. 
    Mr. Czelusta, you may proceed whenever you are ready.
speaker="thomas_j_czelusta" startTime="59.639" stopTime="183.102">
    Mr. Thomas J. Czelusta 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the question before the Court this morning is whether a state can require a recipient of AFDC benefits who receives a personal injury award to use at least a portion of that award for future living expenses in lieu of receiving AFDC benefits. 
    The question arises out of the enactment of an amendment to the Social Security Act by Congress in 1981 as a result of the Omnibus Reconciliation Act, and that statute is now commonly referred to as the lump sum rule. 
    Essentially what that statute provides is that when a recipient of AFDC receives an amount of income in a month which when added together with all the other income available to that family in that month exceeds the state's standard of need, then the family must be disqualified from AFDC benefits for a period of time. 
    That period is determined by adding all that income together, dividing by the state's standard of need, and the resulting quotient is the number of months of disqualification. 
    Congress in the statute uses the word "income" but does not define it. 
    The Secretary, in enacting regulations in 1981 and '82 did not define the term but rather continued the long-standing federal policy of allowing states to treat personal injury rewards as income but did not require them to do so. 
    On March 18th of 1986 the Secretary enacted a rule which now defines lump sum income and requires states to include personal injury awards as income subject to the rule save to the extent that the funds are earmarked and used for a purpose for which they are intended, such as medical expenses or legal fees.

    Mr. Thomas J. Czelusta 
    Under current policy the medical expenses and any other directly related expense is deducted at the front end when determining the disqualification period.

speaker="thomas_j_czelusta" startTime="206.199" stopTime="226.446">
    Mr. Thomas J. Czelusta 
    In 1984 Congress amended the statute to allow states greater flexibility to shorten the period of ineligibility, and we have done that. 
    Future medical expenses and a number of other situations, if somebody steals the money, or a family member absconds with the money, or if the--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="226.446" stopTime="236.320">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Yes, how about that situation? 
    There was one of those examples given in this case of a family member who left the family and took the money along. 
    Now what happens?

    Mr. Thomas J. Czelusta 
    --If that case had occurred after the 1984 amendment to the Act that person would not have been disqualified at all.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="244.308" stopTime="249.610">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    But this particular family is disqualified because it occurred before the adoption of the rule?
speaker="thomas_j_czelusta" startTime="249.610" stopTime="249.993">
    Mr. Thomas J. Czelusta 
    Yes.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="249.993" stopTime="250.545">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Is that it?
speaker="thomas_j_czelusta" startTime="250.545" stopTime="457.763">
    Mr. Thomas J. Czelusta 
    Yes. 
    Virginia believes that the Secretary's determination that personal injury awards could be income subject to the lump sum rule and now must be is entitled to the deference of this Court. 
    Whether or not this Court gives deference to the Secretary's determination, however, the petitioner believes that Virginia's inclusion of personal injury awards as income subject to the lump sum rule is a reasonable interpretation of the statute and is consistent with the intent of Congress. 
    In Heckler v. Turner, this Court had before it a case involving a statute enacted by the OBRA Congress involving AFDC and the meaning of the word "income". 
    This Court looked at the language of the statute, its legislative history, the administrative background against which the OBRA Congress worked, and the goals and objectives sought to be achieved. 
    In that case this Court determined that Congress did embark upon a new course which in that case was emphasizing work requirements over financial incentives. 
    We believe that if this Court examines the language of the lump sum statute, its legislative history, the goals and objectives sought to be achieved, and the administrative background against which the Congress worked, it will lead the Court to the conclusion that Congress indeed intended to embark upon a new course with the lump sum rule, and that Virginia has correctly identified that course. 
    Both Congress and the administration articulated a number of goals and objectives sought to be achieved by enactment of the rule. 
    They sought to restrain the growth of government spending. 
    They sought to redirect benefits to those who are without income or resources with which to support themselves, and to reduce or eliminate benefits for those who had money with which to support themselves. 
    Congress and the administration sought to promote responsible budgeting and encourage personal responsibility, but of particular concern to both Congress and the administration was that the prior treatment of large sums of money had, in the words of the Senate Finance Committee, 
    "the perverse effect of encouraging recipients to spend money quickly in order to regain or retain eligibility. " 
    Prior to OBRA, a recipient who received a large sum of money could have been disqualified for the month that the money was received, but thereafter to the extent that any was left it was treated as a resource, and as soon as it was spent down to the state's allowable resource limit, then the person could immediately regain eligibility. 
    Inclusion of personal injury awards as income subject to the lump sum rule achieves every one of these goals and objectives. 
    The funds remaining in the hands of a recipient after deduction for the directly related expenses by and large represents pain and suffering, loss of earnings, loss of earning capacity, and in some cases future medical expenses, but it is money. 
    It is available to be spent. 
    It can be spent over a period of time, carefully, on essential needs such as food, clothing, and shelter, or it can be spent very quickly on consumer goods.

    What kind of receipts wouldn't be treated as income?

    Mr. Thomas J. Czelusta 
    If someone owns the house and they sell the house, we would treat the funds that came from the sale of that house as a resource.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="481.843" stopTime="492.250">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    So that there would be an incentive in order to bring the resources down to the level at which the person can requalify to spend that money as quickly as possible.

    Mr. Thomas J. Czelusta 
    Yes. 
    But in those instances we feel that a person does have to have a place to live, so that if they sell their home they are going to in all likelihood replace it.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="505.391" stopTime="516.263">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Now, that would only be a problem if you sell a home. 
    I mean, if you are selling, let's say, a vacation home that would already be counted as a resource anyway.

    That would be counted as income subject to the lump sum rule.

    Land itself is a resource.

    Mr. Thomas J. Czelusta 
    Yes. 
    We believe that Congress did not intend to obliterate the distinction between income and resources. 
    They still did use the word "income", and in other parts of the statute they still use the word "resources". 
    I would point out one thing, Justice Blackmun, that our resource level at the time this suit was brought was $600. 
    Now it has been raised to $1,000. 
    So when we are talking about a piece of land it has got to be either a very, very small interest in a piece of land or a very poor piece of land to begin with.

    To be sure that Congress used the word "income" and did not define it, respondents maintain that the word "income" should be interpreted according to its plain and ordinary meaning. 
    The word, however, just simply does not have a singular plain and ordinary meaning. 
    It is rather a concept within which there are different definitions depending upon the context in which the word is used and the result intended to be achieved. 
    Indeed, if a plain and ordinary definition exists at all, it is a broad one which includes all that comes in, and represents an increase in an individual's economic power, and in fact this is the judgment of the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals in Watkins versus Blenzinger. 
    We believe if the Court examines the purposes and goals to be achieved through the rule and its legislative history the Court will conclude that Congress intended the word "income" to be a broad one. 
    The administration in proposing the rule to Congress repeatedly described the rule in terms of a large sum of money and gave us such examples, inheritances, insurance settlements, and retroactive Social Security benefits. 
    Congressional documents, both staff and committee, repeatedly describe it in similar terms. 
    The statute that was enacted by Congress was enacted virtually identically to that proposed to it by the administration. 
    It expressed no disagreement with it and made no exceptions to it. 
    We believe that if Congress intended to restrict the definition of income it could have very easily done so.

    Mr. Glen D. Nager 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, as counsel for petitioners noted, this case presents a question concerning the meaning of the term AFDC part of the Social Security Act. 
    Specifically, the question is whether the Secretary is reasonably determined that states may treat and how should treat personal injury or workers' compensation awards as income--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="1054.857" stopTime="1068.101">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Mr. Nager, it has already been discussed this morning that for a good many years the Department left it up to the states to decide whether to treat it as income or a resource.
speaker="glen_d_nager" startTime="1068.101" stopTime="1069.234">
    Mr. Glen D. Nager

    Now, why the change?
speaker="glen_d_nager" startTime="1070.417" stopTime="1112.028">
    Mr. Glen D. Nager 
    The change arises out of the Secretary's examination of the purposes Congress was trying to promote in amending the statute in 1981. 
    If I might back up a little, prior to 1981, when there was no lump sum rule, whether a nonrecurring receipt in the form of a personal injury award or a worker's compensation award was characterized as a resource or as income did not have a significant effect because however it was characterized in the second month it would be characterized as a resource, and if the assistance unit still had the money from the award they would be ineligible for benefits under the resource--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="1112.028" stopTime="1116.748">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Yes, but if they had spent it that was all right, and the government, the Secretary left it up to the states--
speaker="glen_d_nager" startTime="1116.748" stopTime="1117.282">
    Mr. Glen D. Nager 
    --Right, and the--

    Mr. Glen D. Nager 
    --Yes. 
    Justice O'Connor, the rationale for leaving it up to the states prior to 1981 arises out of two elements. 
    The first element is, the practical effect was, these are not recurring events, they are single time events, and so we were only talking about one month's worth of benefits, and secondly, the Court... we would ask the Court to keep in mind that the AFDC statute is one that this Court has termed based on cooperative federalism. 
    It is a statute that states participate in at their option, and when they choose to participate they in fact provide part of the money. 
    They administer the program on a day to day basis, and the statute is replete with options given to the states in making decisions about how the program should be run, most importantly setting the level of need and the level of benefits--

    Mr. Glen D. Nager 
    --No, Justice O'Connor, the Secretary's position is not that the statute mandates the personal injury awards and workers' compensation awards be treated as income. 
    Rather, the purposes behind the lump sum rule specifically that Congress was concerned with cutting the cost of the program, encouraging large payments of money to be budgeted, are furthered by treating workers' compensation awards and personal injury awards as income and thus that facilitates what Congress was trying to achieve in amending the statute in--

    Mr. Glen D. Nager 
    --It is a exercise of the Secretary's delegated authority under the statute to interpret the statute. 
    Congress in 42 USC 1302 delegated rulemaking power to the Secretary and throughout the AFDC part of the statute instructs that the Secretary will interpret the provisions of the statute and be responsible for administering them. 
    In that capacity the Secretary prior to 1981 determined that the purposes of the statute would be furthered by leaving this particular type of monetary receipt to the option of the states as to whether or not it should be treated as income or as resources, and after 1981 examined the pattern of the states' response to the 1981 amendment and the purposes that Congress was trying to further in the 1981 amendments and thus in 1984 issued the notice of rulemaking proposing that personal injury and workers' compensation awards and other similar types of nonrecurring lump sum receipts would be treated as income.

    I would think so, and all you are saying is, it was no big deal before '81. 
    It wasn't necessary to interpret it one way or another. 
    It didn't make a whole lot of difference, and the Secretary had other things to do. 
    It became very important later to know just what the interpretation of this was, and then he came up with this... that's what I thought had happened, anyway.
speaker="glen_d_nager" startTime="1310.871" stopTime="1394.794">
    Mr. Glen D. Nager 
    I couldn't have put it more succinctly. 
    The Secretary believes that his interpretation is reasonable. 
    By looking at the language and the legislative history of the statute the states get no guidance as to whether or not these items should be treated as income or as resources. 
    It is common ground among the parties that the statute does not define the term "income" and does not state either in specific terms or in general terms whether or not personal injury and worker's compensation awards should be treated as resources or income. 
    Respondents have not been able to point to anything in the legislative history which shows that Congress intended to exclude these types of payments from the income calculation, and so what we have is a classic case of where Congress has created the general framework, mandated that the states shall take into account any income and resources, and then not define the term, left the interstices of the statute to be filled in by those who administer the statute, in this case the Secretary and the states. 
    In doing that, the Secretary, guided by what is left available to him, which is the purposes Congress was trying to promote, has on a case by case basis looked at the receipts that a family can receive and determined in his judgment whether or not those were the types of receipts that Congress intended to have included in the income calculation as to whether or not they would further the purposes of the statute.

    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Mr. Nager, now, under the food stamp program, which also is designed to help these same people, these things aren't treated as income, these personal injury awards.
speaker="glen_d_nager" startTime="1405.935" stopTime="1635.852">
    Mr. Glen D. Nager 
    Justice O'Connor, I quibble with your premise that these programs are designed to help the same people. 
    In fact, the food stamp program is available to a broader group of people. 
    The AFDC statute is really designed as a statute of last resort, and I can give two reasons for that, at least two examples of why that is true. 
    First of all, food stamps are in kind benefits. 
    The only thing the recipient can do with them is get food with them, whereas the AFDC program is a cash grant statute, and Congress has defined the group of people eligible in the AFDC program more narrowly than the group of individuals eligible for food stamps in the food stamp program. 
    In addition, as we pointed out in our brief, the food stamp program has a rather all-inclusive definition of income and then has an express exclusion for personal injury and worker's compensation awards, and that express exclusion is absent in the AFDC part of the statute. 
    The Court of Appeals gave three reasons for refusing to defer to the Secretary in this case. 
    Its first reason was that it equated the concept of income with profit or gain. 
    It said that profit or gain is the plain and ordinary meaning of the term "income", and thus the Secretary has adopted an unreasonable interpretation of the statute. 
    We pointed out in our brief one can look at a variety of dictionary and sources, and we looked at the ones the respondents pointed out, and the term "income" is defined in various ways, profit or gain, gross receipts. 
    In fact, in this Court's decision in Heckler versus Turner there are several references to the term "income" as being a broader concept than the narrower term "earned income", and in fact in several places refer to income as meaning gross receipts. 
    The second reason the Court of Appeals gave for treating personal injury... for refusing to defer to the Secretary was that the Court of Appeals looked to other statutes. 
    The food stamp statute that Justice O'Connor has pointed out and the Internal Revenue Code, and in those statutes Congress has excluded by express provision personal injury or worker's compensation awards. 
    The Court might have looked at the SSI program where Congress has defined the term SSI program to include personal injury awards. 
    We just don't think that the interpretation of the AFDC program can be controlled by the decisions Congress has made in other statutes. 
    Rather, we have to look at the purposes and provisions of the AFDC statute, and as counsel for petitioner has noted and which I would briefly summarize, the purposes of the AFDC statute are promoted by treating worker's compensation and personal injury awards as income. 
    Now, the final reason that the Court of Appeals gave for refusing to defer to the Secretary was, it found inequitable that the Secretary allowed the state to treat personal injury awards as income, and yet casualty losses as resources, and said that that violated the Secretary's own equitable treatment regulation. 
    The Secretary has resisted that throughout the litigation, because since the Secretary gave the option to the states to treat personal injury awards or worker's compensation awards as either income or resources, the state was merely acting pursuant to an option that the Secretary gave the states, and the Secretary does not believe that when a state acts pursuant to an option given by the Secretary that the state can be violating the Secretary's own equitable treatment regulation at the same time. 
    Thus we would ask that the judgment of the court below be reversed. 
    Unless the Court has further questions. 
   
   
   
   Argument of Jill A. Hanken
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1635.852" stopTime="1639.901">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Thank you, Mr. Nager. 
    We will hear now from you, Ms. Hanken.
speaker="jill_a_hanken" startTime="1639.901" stopTime="1689.168">
    Ms. Jill A. Hanken 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, Virginia and the Secretary of HHS reject the fundamental concept in our common law that a personal injury award only makes the victim whole. 
    It does not enrich. 
    There is no gain. 
    But Virginia treats a personal injury award as income, and as a result parents and children who are the victims of accidents are disqualified from the AFDC program. 
    Because Virginia's standard of need is so low, even modest awards result in disqualifications of months or years. 
    For example, a $2,000 award paid to a mother with two children in Richmond will disqualify the family for more than six months.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="1689.168" stopTime="1710.247">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    The family has money to buy their necessities during that six months, right? 
    Why is that unusual? 
    If you regard this as a statute to help people who don't have money, not a statute to replace a person's arm if he is unfortunate enough to lose it, the fact is that the person has the money, regardless of how the money was come by, right?
speaker="jill_a_hanken" startTime="1710.247" stopTime="1728.043">
    Ms. Jill A. Hanken 
    It is true that the person has money, but the purpose of that money is to compensate the individual for the injuries that have been suffered, and the problem is that the regulations make no provisions for the family to use the money for the purpose that it is intended.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="1728.043" stopTime="1756.895">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Let's assume an individual gets a multi-million dollar personal injury award, multi-million dollar. 
    The person is a millionaire now. 
    Your contention here is that it is somehow contrary to the purpose of AFDC if the state did not continue to pay this millionaire AFDC every month because of the manner in which that money was acquired? 
    That doesn't strike me as obvious.
speaker="jill_a_hanken" startTime="1756.895" stopTime="1876.573">
    Ms. Jill A. Hanken 
    Congress did not intend for multi-million dollar personal injury award that is compensatory to be treated under the lump sum rule. 
    As a resource that money would disqualify the family for many months... would disqualify the family for as long as they still had the money, and they would have to spend the money, and the agency would look to see how the money was expended to make sure that there was fair value received in return for the expenditures. 
    And only when the family had $1,000 left could they return to the program and receive AFDC benefits. 
    In reality, our clients have not received multi-million dollar payments. 
    They have received personal injury awards of $1,000. 
    A disabled father received $10,000 after being struck by a car. 
    And the rule is not intended to apply as broadly as you say. 
    The lump sum rule was a very small part of the OBRA amendments. 
    Of $1 billion that was to be cut from the AFDC program, the lump sum rule was expected to save just $5 millions, and only 5,000 families of the three and a half million families receiving AFDC were to be disqualified from the program. 
    The fact that Virginia is applying this rule too broadly can be seen in these numbers because Virginia only has 1.6 percent of the ADC case load nationwide. 
    Thus under Congressional estimates only 80 families would have been disqualified under this rule if implemented as Congress intended. 
    Instead, the District Court found that 400 families a year have been disqualified under Virginia's rules, five times the amount... the number of people who are expected to be disqualified under the provision, and the reason that so many people have been disqualified under this--

    Although they are not compensatory.

    They are not compensatory at all, and therefore could be properly used by the family for future subsistence living expenses.
speaker="lewis_f_powell_jr" startTime="2030.470" stopTime="2035.024">
    Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. 
    But you would call them, such damages income?
speaker="jill_a_hanken" startTime="2035.024" stopTime="2130.152">
    Ms. Jill A. Hanken 
    Yes. 
    Yes, Your Honor. 
    But as Justice White mentioned earlier, there is an obvious definition of income. 
    As this Court has found when looking for a common sense definition of income, there is a requirement of gain or profit, and that is the definition that has been consistently followed by this Court and has been referred to as the obvious or the natural meaning of income. 
    The definition of income that is used in common speech, and of course in looking at 602(a)(17) we must look at the natural and common sense definitions of the words used by Congress. 
    Congress did not intend to apply the rule to all payments of money. 
    Even the Secretary still says that if a house is sold, and certainly a large amount of money is received in return for that, the money is a resource, and the money can be spent in any way the family needs to, and spend it down, and requalify for benefits under the program. 
    The system here creates an inequity between persons who receive personal injury awards and people who receive property damage payments. 
    To this day Virginia still treats as a resource money paid for property damage. 
    So if a car or refrigerator is either sold or damaged, the money paid in return is a resource.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="2130.152" stopTime="2140.439">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    They are not allowed to do that, though, are they? 
    I thought that the federal rule now would not permit that, but Virginia just hasn't gotten around to revising its rules to conform to the federal rule.
speaker="jill_a_hanken" startTime="2140.439" stopTime="2145.926">
    Ms. Jill A. Hanken 
    That is true if the new federal regulation is valid.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="2145.926" stopTime="2156.251">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Well, okay, but your argument assumes that the federal regulation is valid. 
    So that inequity does not exist under what the Secretary is arguing for here.
speaker="jill_a_hanken" startTime="2156.251" stopTime="2215.439">
    Ms. Jill A. Hanken 
    Even under the new regulation there still is an inequity because if the car refrigerator is damaged and money is paid in return, the family can replace the car or refrigerator and return to the program. 
    But the person who receives a personal injury award has no opportunity to use that award for the purpose it is intended. 
    Let's look at a pain and suffering award. 
    The family cannot make any expenditure to ease pain and suffering. 
    The parent can't buy toys for the sick child. 
    The family cannot buy a television for the bedridden person. 
    You couldn't weatherize your house to make it warmer. 
    Mr. Long couldn't buy a used car to help him travel after his injury. 
    The family can't set aside any funds for future burial expenses, which is allowed by Congress in the statute as a way to prepare for the future.

speaker="jill_a_hanken" startTime="2221.759" stopTime="2299.443">
    Ms. Jill A. Hanken 
    Your Honor, any medical expenses paid with the award would be deducted from the lump sum amount and the length of disqualification could be shortened. 
    The problem, though, with that is, when the family receives the award they are told that you are ineligible for this program for months or years into the future. 
    And the family may not even get the medical care they need because they know they have to let the money last. 
    And the other problem is, some future medical expenses may be needed beyond the disqualification period after the money is already gone, so the family doesn't have the ability to even get the kind of medical attention that they require as a result of the injuries, and in that respect they can't use the award for the purposes that it was intended, and have no ability to ease their pain and suffering to make their lives more comfortable or better. 
    Some of the injured persons may want to go to additional educational courses or training.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="2299.443" stopTime="2338.934">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    There may also be a lot of people who can't get on the AFDC rolls right now because the level to quality is too low. 
    And more of those people might be allowed on if the kind of benefits that are paid to those who are on are reduced to some extent. 
    I mean, there are hardships on both sides. 
    We are talking about an absolute amount of money that has to be distributed somehow, and the Secretary has said, these people have money. 
    We can't replace the arm or the leg or whatever is lost. 
    This is a program to give people money who don't have it. 
    These people have money. 
    Now, there are others in the program who don't have money.

    There is no evidence in our record that any state was using an option, and in fact the documents referred to by the Secretary and Virginia are all post-OBRA documents discussing an option, and even if there was an option just by the pure definition when your house burns down or is sold, the money is a replacement. 
    The money... the nature of the resource does not change. 
    The money is a resource. 
    And the same is true when a body is injured. 
    Our bodies are priceless commodities, and money that is paid in substitution for our bodies is compensatory.

    Ms. Jill A. Hanken

    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    No, but it is certainly true, though, that a person who has a substantial salary gets a bigger settlement than a person who has a lower salary, even though the injury is precisely the same, so that it certainly must be part of the settlement figures as well as the awards made by juries and judges.

    Ms. Jill A. Hanken 
    Yes. 
    The Secretary has consistently been shifting its position, keeps changing his mind what the scope of the lump sum rule is. 
    His latest interpretation, which is found in Footnote 4 of his reply brief, demonstrates the extreme to which the Secretary has gone in interpreting this rule. 
    Now the Secretary says that a house or a car is sold, that the money received in return is a resource, but if the home is burned in a fire or the car is wrecked in an accident, that money is income, and the rationale given by the Secretary even though in his proposed new regulations and his final regulations adopted in March in the preamble he said that there could not be any rationale for distinguishing between large payments of money, he is still distinguishing between large payments of money, and now the house which is sold is a resource, but if it is damaged it is income. 
    This makes no sense. 
    It is illogical and it is irrational. 
    It doesn't have anything to do with the definitions of income and resources in the Social Security Act, and it doesn't have anything to do with what Congress intended in adopting the new income rule in 1981. 
    To put a greater value on homes or cars than on our own health and well-being is illogical.

    I don't know that that is so. 
    My point is, don't you acknowledge that the Secretary has to have some authority to give some meaning to income? 
    It isn't self-evident what... even if you say this particular item you think is self-evident, is it your contention that the word "income" is a word that the Secretary has no authority to interpret because it is self-evident what it means?
speaker="jill_a_hanken" startTime="2735.340" stopTime="2745.862">

    No, but the Secretary does not have the ability or the authority to interpret the word "income" in a way that is contrary to what Congress intended.

    Ms. Jill A. Hanken 
    And by using the historical definition of income, accumulated benefits, retroactive Social Security payments, which has always been treated as income... throughout all of the documents of HHS that has always been viewed as income... that would alone have been enough to take care of the $5 million savings and the 5,000 families across the country. 
    It is very common for families on AFDC to receive a retroactive Social Security benefit when a child's parent becomes disabled or dies and survivors' benefits or disability benefits are paid, and this as the core concern of Congress in 1981, and by sweeping more and more items into the definition of income and interpreting the rules in the illogical ways that the Secretary is, they are just going too far. 
    The parents and children in this case have already suffered the indignity of an injury caused by another. 
    The policies add insult to their injuries by terminating their sole source of support for months into the future, long after the money is gone. 
    The policies urged by Virginia and the Secretary make it impossible for the family to use the personal injury award for the purposes intended. 
    They can't use the money to ease their pain and suffering nor to set aside funds for future needs. 
    The policy amounts to a disincentive for the victims of wrongdoing to seek redress. 
    Here only the tort fees are benefits, because the families, knowing that the money is going to have to be used for subsistence income support, will simply not file these cases. 
    The rule is very harsh. 
    As I have said, our standards of need are so low that disqualifications of months and years are not uncommon when a lump sum payment of money is received. 
    Our standards are sadly out of date, and they recognize only half of what a family needs to live. 
    So this makes it essential that the rule is limited to the scope envisioned by Congress. 
    They use the word 602(a)(7)(b) of the Social Security Act. 
    This means that Congress affirmed that a family does not have to relinquish all of its goods of value in order to receive AFDC benefits. 
    Throughout this litigation, for the five years since OBRA was enacted, both the Secretary and Virginia have not treated all payments of money as lump sum income. 
    They have recognized that when money represents a resource it should be treated as a resource, and the Secretary still says that as far as selling a resource goes, that the money is a resource and could be spent as the family chooses, as the family needs to. 
    The family does not have to purchase another house. 
    Instead, the family could purchase... put a down payment on a house and buy a car, or put aside money in a savings account, purchase burial contracts, and reallocate resources in the way that they see fit for their family.

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Ms. Hanken, you surprised me earlier because it was not my understanding when you said that the practice among the states as far as you know when OBRA was enacted was uniformly to treat these things as resources rather than income. 
    The reason I had the opposite impression was a passage which I found in the Secretary's brief which says that the practice among the states was varied in 1981, and he gives a citation for that. 
    Now, I didn't go back and look up the citation. 
    Did you? 
    And is it wrong?

    You don't need testimony on that, do you.

    It is essential that the rule here is limited to the scope envisioned by Congress.

    Ms. Jill A. Hanken 
    Your Honor, I don't take the position that all states' practices were uniform. 
    I am saying that I don't know, that in Virginia in a lump sum payment was compared to the resource level except for a lump sum that represented accumulated gain. 
    And that was Virginia's pre-OBRA policy.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="3158.179" stopTime="3186.782">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Did you contest the Solicitor General's statement in your reply brief that practice among the states was varied? 
    I mean, the reason I ask is, that is an important point to me, and it seems to me that you should make your argument at a point were the SG has an opportunity to respond to it, not in oral argument after he has made his presentation and has no opportunity. 
    It leaves me unable to decide the issue on the basis of what is in front of us.
speaker="jill_a_hanken" startTime="3186.782" stopTime="3210.731">
    Ms. Jill A. Hanken 
    Well, even if the practices of states was varied, and it is true that prior to 1981 the distinction between income and resources, while separate and different, it was not nearly as important as the distinction today in terms of how the two are treated. 
    In 1981--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="3210.731" stopTime="3218.135">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    No, but you make a point that the Congress presumptively knew what the practices were, and if they were different the presumption cuts one way and if they are the same it cuts the other way.
speaker="jill_a_hanken" startTime="3218.135" stopTime="3325.939">
    Ms. Jill A. Hanken 
    --Well, the one thing that Congress knew is that the only consistent definition of income was accumulated benefits, the retroactive Social Security awards, and that has been the definition of income for many years by HHS, and that was the concern of Congress in adopting this new income rule. 
    But it was not supposed to apply to all payments of money. 
    It never has, according to Virginia and the Secretary's policies, and it still doesn't, even under the Secretary's new rule, which was promulgated, adopted in its final form after Virginia's petition for certiorari was filed in a form that was much different than the proposed regulation. 
    They are trying to assist themselves in this litigation through their regulatory powers, and are virtually eliminating the distinction between income and resources in the AFDC program which has been in place for decades and which Congress did not change in 1981. 
    Congress did change the treatment of income and did lower the allowable resource level, but it did not change the definitions of those terms, so the Court should give those terms their common sense definitions, and when you do so, personal injury awards will not fall into the income category. 
    Instead, personal injury awards will be what they are, compensatory for injuries suffered. 
    Every penny of the award represents an actual loss. 
    There is no gain. 
    We urge you to affirm the judgment of the Fourth Circuit.
