Florida v. Thomas

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    The second case which I have to announce is No. 00-391, Florida against Thomas. 
    Here, a respondent Robert Thomas got out of his car in the driveway of a home where police were investigating drug sales and encountered an officer at the rear of his car. 
    The officer arrested Thomas on an outstanding warrant, took him inside the house and searched the car finding drugs. 
    The Trial Court suppressed the evidence. 
    The Court of Appeals of Florida reversed saying the search was valid under our decision in a case called New York against Belton where we held that an officer who makes the lawful custodial arrest of a car’s occupant may search the car’s passenger compartment incident to that arrest. 
    The Supreme Court of Florida in turn reversed that court saying that, Belton is limited to situations where the officer initiates conduct with the vehicle’s occupant while the person is still in the vehicle. 
    The Court remanded the case to the Trial Court to decide whether the search was valid under another of our cases called Chimel against California. 
    We granted certiorari to determine whether Belton is subject to the limits that the Supreme Court of Florida imposed. 
    But because we find that Court’s judgment is not final, we dismiss the writ of certiorari for want of jurisdiction in a unanimous opinion filed with the Clerk today. 
    We are authorized by statute to review final judgments of State Courts. 
    In four categories of cases set out in Cox Broadcasting Company against Cohn, we have treated State Court judgments as final for jurisdictional purposes although further proceeding will take place in State Court. 
    But none of these categories fits the judgment of the Florida Supreme Court and much as Justice Souter just said about Tax Law, the law of jurisdiction of final judgments is not terribly easy to explain orally and no more interesting to hear probably. 
    So, I will leave you with the idea which is true, that we therefore dismiss the writ of certiorari for want of jurisdiction.
