    Justice Clarence Thomas 
    This case comes to us on a writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. 
    While Kevin Murphy was incarcerated in state prison, he learned that a fellow inmate had been charged with assaulting a correctional officer. 
    Murphy decided to assist the inmate with his defense and sent him a letter to this effect. 
    The prison intercepted this letter in accordance with prison policy. 
    Based on the letter’s content, the prison sanctioned Murphy for violating prison rules prohibiting insolence and interfering with due process hearings. 
    Murphy sought relief under Section 1983 alleging violation of the First Amendment including the right to provide legal assistance to other inmates. 
    The District Court rejected this claim but the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed. 
    According to the Court of Appeals prisoner’s have a First Amendment right to give legal assistance to other inmates, the effect of this holding is that prisoner correspondence containing legal advice is entitle to more constitutional protection then prisoner correspondence not containing such advice. 
    In an opinion filed with the Clerk today we reverse and remand. 
    In Turner v. Safley this Court set a unitary standard for reviewing prisoners’ constitutional claims. 
    Under this test a prison regulation impinging on inmates’ constitutional rights is valid if it is reasonably related to legitimate penological interests. 
    Turner does not permit an increase in constitutional protection when a prisoner’s communication includes legal advice. 
    The value of a communication is not relevant to Turner analysis which concerns only the relationship between the assorted penological interest and the prison regulation. 
    Justice Ginsburg has filed a concurring opinion.
