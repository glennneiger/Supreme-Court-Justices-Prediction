    Justice Clarence Thomas 
    I have the opinion in the United States versus Oakland Cannabis Buyers Cooperative. 
    This case comes to us on a writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. 
    Respondent Oakland Cannabis Buyers Cooperative was organized to distribute marijuana to qualified patients for medical purposes. 
    The United States sought to enjoin the Cooperative’s efforts under the Controlled Substances Act, which prohibits the manufacture and distribution of certain drugs including marijuana. 
    The District Court granted the Government’s request for a preliminary injunction. 
    The Court then rejected the Cooperative’s motion to modify the injunction to permit distributions that are medically necessary. 
    The Cooperative appealed and the Ninth Circuit reversed the District Court’s ruling on the motion to modify the injunction. 
    According to the Ninth Circuit, medical necessity is a legally cognizable defense to the statute’s prescriptions. 
    The Ninth Circuit also concluded that the District Court could have issued an injunction more limited in scope than the Controlled Substances Act, and thus instructed the District Court to consider the criteria for the medical necessity exception. 
    In an opinion filed with the Clerk today, we reverse and remand. 
    We hold that there was no medical necessity exception to the Controlled Substances Act’s prohibition on manufacturing and distributing marijuana. 
    Under any conception of legal necessity, the defense cannot succeed when the legislature itself has made a determination of values. 
    Here the Act reflects a determination that marijuana has no medical benefits meriting an exception. 
    Whereas, other drugs can be dispensed and prescribed for medical use, the same is not true for marijuana, which according to the Act, has no currently accepted medical use. 
    The Ninth Circuit erred in instructing the District Court to consider the criteria for medical necessity exception when fashioning the injunction. 
    Although District Courts that are properly acting as courts of equity generally have discretion in designing relief. 
    They cannot ignore Congress’ judgment expressed explicitly in legislation. 
    Justice Stevens has filed an opinion concurring in the judgment, which Justices Souter and Ginsburg have joined. 
    Justice Breyer took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.
