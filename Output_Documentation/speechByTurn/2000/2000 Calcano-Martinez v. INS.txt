    Mr. Lucas Guttentag 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    The jurisdictional issue presented in this case is whether a legal ruling by the Attorney General on a pure question of law compelling the deportation of long-time legal permanent residents is reviewable in any court. 
    Never in our country's history has an alien been subject to deportation without the judicial branch determining the legal validity of the administrative deportation order. 
    We submit that the Constitution does not permit denying judicial scrutiny of the Attorney General's ruling, and that the statute did not deprive this Court and the district court and the courts of appeals of considering the pure question of law presented in this case.

    Mr. Lucas Guttentag 
    Well, Your Honor, the question is whether the final order of deportation was properly entered and, under this Court's case law...
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="119.301" stopTime="133.252">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    It was properly entered if all of the qualifications for deportation existed. 
    Your complaint is that the Attorney General did not exercise his discretion to let your client stay in the country nonetheless.

    Mr. Lucas Guttentag 
    No, Your Honor, we disagree with that, respectfully.

    Mr. Lucas Guttentag 
    Yes. 
    In all those cases, Your Honor, the question was whether a final order of deportation, and whether the discretionary element that's... on which the final order is contingent was reviewable in court, and the way the Immigration Act is...

    Mr. Lucas Guttentag 
    Yes, but the IIRIRA has not changed that element, Your Honor. 
    Under the Immigration Act, both before and after, there is a two-part process for issuing a final order of deportation. 
    There's the question of deportability, and that's the question of whether a person falls within the grounds enumerated in the statute.

    We do concede that, Your Honor.

    Mr. Lucas Guttentag 
    Well, that's a construction of the statute, Your Honor, that the Government's offered. 
    We don't dispute that, although we come to that conclusion for different reasons, but the question is whether the final order of deportation itself is reviewable, and the final order cannot be entered... and I believe the Government will concede this, Your Honor...

    It is as an exercise of discretion, and it's in tune with what I think is the current climate in the legislature. 
    You just answered Justice Souter that you would not challenge an exercise of discretion.
speaker="lucas_guttentag" startTime="348.450" stopTime="391.835">
    Mr. Lucas Guttentag 
    Your Honor, we believe that the question of a categorical denial raises a different issue, and whether that's permissible or not, raises a distinct question. 
    But just to be clear, the Attorney General has not done that in this case. 
    What the Attorney General has said is that he lacks the legal authority to exercise discretion, on a pure question of interpreting the statute that Congress has divested him of the legal authority to consider applications for discretionary relief. 
    We do not believe that the Attorney General, if he interpreted this statute correctly, would adopt a categorical rule. 
    There's no reason to believe that. 
    He has determined that he lacks any discretionary authority. 
    How he exercises that authority would be a separate and distinct question.

    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    Suppose there's a case in which it's conceded that the Attorney General has discretionary authority.

    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    Because it seems to me that may be important under the interpretation of the statute. 
    It seems to me you can argue that where, as in your case, the alien requests the Attorney General to exercise the Attorney General's discretion, there is no final order of deportability until he does so.
speaker="lucas_guttentag" startTime="445.333" stopTime="460.239">
    Mr. Lucas Guttentag 
    Well, we certainly agree that there's not a legally valid final order of deportation. 
    There was an order issued by the Board of Immigration Appeals, so in that sense there's a piece of paper that constitutes a final order, but we agree that there's not a legally valid final order.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="460.239" stopTime="467.502">

    Mr. Lucas Guttentag 
    The (a)(2)... well, we believe there's a final order for purposes of seeking judicial review of the BIA's decision. 
    We do believe that that constitutes a final order. 
    We believe that it is not a legally valid final order because of the Attorney General's ruling.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="489.218" stopTime="494.252">

    Mr. Lucas Guttentag 
    Well, Your Honor, we believe that the statute, the (a)(2)(C) does not apply to bar review of this claim. 
    What the... we believe that the provision barring review does not apply. 
    Whether it's because it doesn't constitute a final order within the meaning of the statute as intended, because there's a legal error underlying the adjudication, or whether there is a final order but it's reviewable nonetheless for that legal... because it lacks legal validity, either way there's review of that determination.

    Mr. Lucas Guttentag 
    We would certainly accept that interpretation, Your Honor, if removable is not the term that normally appears in the Immigration Act, because the technical term would be deportable.

    Mr. Lucas Guttentag 
    No. 
    We would... I... Your Honor, we believe that it's very difficult to interpret this statute, that...

    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    Well, under my submission, and frankly I don't think this works, because the statute is pretty awkward and because of what you've already said about removal, but under... if there was some merit to this interpretation and it could be adopted to avoid the constitutional problem, then the review wouldn't even be by habeas, it would be just under the review mechanisms of the statute.

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    May I suggest that the reason you didn't make that argument is that it's not a very good one, because there is more than one section which excludes the judicial review that you're seeking. 
    Not all of them contain that phrase, who is removable. 
    Subsection (g), entitled, Exclusive Jurisdiction, does not use the term. 
    It says, except as provided in this section, and notwithstanding any other provision of law, no court shall have jurisdiction to hear any cause or claim by or on behalf of any alien arising from the decision or action by the Attorney General to commence proceedings, adjudicate cases, or execute removal orders against any alien under this Act.

    Mr. Lucas Guttentag 
    But Your Honor, we don't... that language does not preclude review of our claim, because what 242(g) does is place all review in the court of appeals, and we agree that review can be in the court of appeals. 
    We have no... our construction of the statute permits that, because we agree that the final order of removal is reviewable in the court of appeals. 
    The only provision that bars review of that order in the court of appeals is (a)(2)(C).

    Let me ask this, if who is removable, if that embraces the requirement that the Attorney General first have exercised his discretion, why doesn't it also, under that kind of a reading, embrace the requirement that he actually committed a criminal offense covered in section 1182(a)(2)? 
    I mean, if you're going to read removable, who is removable that broadly, that is to say that any defect in the proceedings which rendered the order of removal invalid causes him not to be removable, you simply open up the whole statute. 
    You say any defect which causes him not to be removable takes him out of (a)(2)(C).

    That's a pure legal question. 
    The Attorney General has determined that they're not eligible. 
    The question of eligibility for that relief was decided by a legal ruling of the Attorney General that... and that determines whether or not it was a properly entered final order of removal.

    Mr. Lucas Guttentag 
    No, absolutely not, Your Honor. 
    That's a determination that's made in the criminal procedure, and when that certified conviction is brought before the immigration judge, that's dispositive on the question of whether or not there's a disqualifying conviction. 
    But then the question is whether that conviction constitutes a deportable offense within the meaning of the Immigration Act, and that's a question that the Government agrees is reviewable and, as I indicated, that the question of whether or not the final order of removal was properly entered must be reviewable as well, and if there's been a failure to allow the person to apply for the discretionary relief for which they are entitled by statute, then that cannot be a legally valid order of removal, and again I...

    Justice David H. Souter 
    But the one difference, then, that has been made, that as I understand it that you concede, is that on your view, once it is determined that the Attorney General did apply the statute that authorizes discretion, that would be the end of the review. 
    There could not be a further step in which you say, the refusal to exercise it in favor of my client was an abuse of discretion. 
    You concede that, I take it?

    Okay.
speaker="lucas_guttentag" startTime="1150.778" stopTime="1245.804">
    Mr. Lucas Guttentag 
    We believe that Congress did significantly restrict the scope of judicial review of final orders issued against so-called criminal aliens. 
    We recognize that. 
    Our contention is only that the core review that has always existed and that has never been prohibited as to questions of law and as to the legal validity of the deportation order, that that issue must remain reviewable; that there's never been a time during the entire period when review was severely curtailed under the finality provisions that we detail in our brief at some length; that there was a long period of time when there was no review of orders of deportation except in habeas corpus proceedings, and what this Court repeatedly recognized is that that scope of review is extremely narrow, but it does encompass a question of the legal validity of the order, and questions of the construction of the Immigration Act, and that's what's at issue here. 
    The Attorney General has construed the Immigration Act to say that our clients are not eligible to apply for the exercise of discretion to which the statute entitles them. 
    That question must be reviewable in a court to determine whether the Attorney General improperly excluded an entire class of people from eligibility for discretionary relief, and this Court's decision in Foti and in Chadha and in other cases recognized that the final order is contingent on the issuance... the adjudication of discretionary relief, and that means two questions. 
    One is...

    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy

    Mr. Lucas Guttentag 
    Your Honor, if there is no legally issued adjudication, then I suppose it's accurate to say there's no legally valid order, and so therefore there isn't a final order.

    Mr. Lucas Guttentag 
    Yes, Your Honor.

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist

    Mr. Lucas Guttentag 
    No, Your Honor, we're not, and we're certainly not intending to. 
    We believe that there's ambiguity in the statute, given the severe constitutional questions that would be raised if there were no review at all of this pure question of law, the Attorney General's decision, and that ambiguity can come from the term, removable. 
    We set forth in our brief the reason why we think the term, review, is not sufficiently clear to bar the scope of inquiry that's always been available to review a final order.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1385.584" stopTime="1390.618">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    So you're got three different ambiguities in one sentence that you've focused on?

    Mr. Lucas Guttentag 
    We think there are many ambiguities. 
    I believe the Government as well is finding ambiguities in this statute. 
    It is a statute that seeks to limit the role of the courts, and our contention is that it can do that, but it cannot preclude the courts from reviewing and determining the legal validity of the order, and that that is a question that is, whether there are legal... in this case, that is a question of whether there is a legal eligibility determination. 
    We think the Accardi case is very significant in this respect, because in the Accardi case, this Court confronted the question of the scope of habeas corpus inquiry to review a final order of deportation. 
    It was a case of an alien who was admittedly deportable, there was no issue about that, and claimed that he had not gotten a lawful exercise of discretion because the Attorney General had refused to exercise his discretion, as was required. 
    In this case... and the Court held that that was reviewable in habeas corpus during the period when the review was as restricted as it could possibly be, the year after this Court said in the Heikkila case that the only review that was available was that which was constitutionally required. 
    Now, this claim is even more fundamental.

    Mr. Lucas Guttentag 
    May I point out what the dissent said in Accardi, Your Honor, which is that it specifically objected to the Court's exercise of jurisdiction on the ground that habeas corpus did not encompass the claim raised in that case, and it objected to the exercise of jurisdiction on precisely the same grounds that the Government argues here, that a person is deportable, that it concerns discretionary relief. 
    And the Court rejected that, and exercised discretion, and said there's a fundamental difference between reviewing the exercise of discretion and reviewing the refusal to exercise discretion, and this is a case about the refusal to exercise discretion based on the Attorney General's legal ruling that an entire class of individuals is not eligible for relief. 
    And it's our... our only challenge is to that determination by the Attorney General, that his legal determination as to who is eligible to apply and who is not is legally incorrect, and we believe that claim must be reviewable in a court. 
    It can be the court of appeals, and we set forth why we believe that is entirely possible and appropriate, but it must be reviewable in a court. 
    I'd like to save... 
   
   
   
   Argument of Edwin S. Kneedler
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1591.412" stopTime="1595.331">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Very well, Mr. Guttentag. 
    Mr. Kneedler, we'll hear from you.
speaker="edwin_s_kneedler" startTime="1595.331" stopTime="1715.703">
    Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    In 1996, in two separate statutes, Congress fundamentally restructured the Nation's immigration laws. 
    There are amendments of general applicability, and also ones specifically dealing with criminal aliens to ensure that criminal aliens were expeditiously removed from the United States. 
    Briefly, the three amendments of general applicability that are most relevant to these two cases this morning are Congress's elimination of deportation and exclusion proceedings, and replacing them with a single proceeding called removal. 
    Secondly, Congress repealed the prior 1182(c) under which petitioners here seek relief, and replaced it with a new proceeding, or form of discretionary relief called cancellation of removal, and third, Congress reenacted, or enacted a new judicial review provision which channeled judicial review, if it's to be had at all, to the courts of appeals. 
    The two amendments specifically dealing with criminal aliens that are relevant here is that Congress not only repealed the prior 1182(c), but rendered aggravated felons and in some cases other criminal aliens altogether ineligible for cancellation of removal, and secondly, Congress provided in section 1252(a)(2)(C) of the Act that no court, which includes both the court of appeals and the district court, shall have jurisdiction to remove... to review an order of removal entered against an alien who had committed one of the specified criminal offenses. 
    The theory was that an alien, just like a citizen, would have full access to the courts to contest the criminal conviction in the criminal proceedings, both direct review and collateral attack, but once that was done, the validity of the conviction was established, and therefore, with respect to access to the courts, there was really no further need to test the central basis on which the alien was to be removed.

    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    Could you just remind me, what happens if a collateral attack is underway and the Justice Department institutes deportation proceedings?

    Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler 
    Unless and until the criminal conviction was set aside, it would be a conviction on which the removal order could be based.

    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    Suppose there were a very strong showing of deficiency in the conviction, a Brady violation, Gideon violation, would the collateral review court have the authority to stay the deportation?

    Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler 
    I wouldn't think that would be true, but I think typically what would happen is the immigration judge would stay the removal proceedings.

    Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler

speaker="edwin_s_kneedler" startTime="1784.190" stopTime="1843.095">
    Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler 
    Right. 
    There is... if the claim was... if the alien was in a position that the substantive ground for removal may be invalid, and that's... not the eligibility for discretionary relief, but the substantive ground of removal may be invalid because there's an ongoing collateral attack, then I... my assumption is that some court... first of all, I think the immigration court would stop it, or the BIA could prevent the proceedings from going forward, either one, or the Attorney General, but failing that, I'm confident that some court would probably have review. 
    I'm not sure whether... perhaps the collateral review court, although I'm not sure why that would be so, because it could be a State collateral proceeding that the alien was trying to have his conviction, State court conviction set aside in, and I wouldn't think that court would have any authority to enjoin a removal under Federal immigration law, so it may be that the alien could apply to the district director and perhaps...

    this suggestion, because Justice Kennedy poses a case that, you know, right on the brink of deciding that he's going to have his earlier conviction set aside. 
    What if he's just filed his habeas corpus petition in State court, and it's going to... on the docket, and it's going to sit there for 3 years before it's decided? 
    Would the immigration judge have authority to say, I think I want to wait to see what happens in that case?
speaker="edwin_s_kneedler" startTime="1868.980" stopTime="1872.817">
    Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler 
    Sure. 
    The immigration judge would have the authority to stay the proceedings. 
    That was the answer that I...

    Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler 
    thought I was giving. 
    But the more fundamental point is, the alien wouldn't be removed until there was a final order of removal entered against him by the BIA. 
    If at that point the alien was saying, wait a minute, I'm seeking to have my criminal conviction set aside, don't execute the order of removal, while there may be an invalidity here, the alien could seek a stay of removal in the court of appeals, could move to reopen the proceedings...

    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy

    Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler 
    There's a fundamental difference between the case I think you were positing and this one. 
    That case had to do with the substantive ground for removability. 
    In other words, is the person removable for having committed an aggravated felony? 
    Here, the question is quite different. 
    As counsel for petitioners has said, petitioners concede that they are removable. 
    The only question here is whether the Attorney General properly denied...

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    They don't concede that they're removable any more. 
    They concede that they are removable but for the fact that the Attorney General didn't take the final step of exercising his discretion. 
    What's your response to that argument?

    Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler

    No, but they're saying the last step is the exercise... they're saying, the statute that invests him with discretion still applies to my case. 
    He's not applying that statute. 
    He is categorically refusing to exercise discretion because he says he doesn't have it, and he's wrong.

    Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler 
    Right. 
    If I could just give two responses to that. 
    The preclusion of review under 1252(a)(2)(C), which was set out at 106(a) of our certiorari petition, it refers to an alien who is removable by reason of having committed a criminal offense covered in certain sections of the Act. 
    The word removable doesn't stand alone there. 
    It is removable by reason of having committed an offense. 
    It is identifying the aliens who...
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="2042.530" stopTime="2054.829">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    But under your reading the statute is the same as if who is removable isn't even there. 
    There's kind of a missing pronoun. 
    It's awkward. 
    But you give no effect to who is removable.
speaker="edwin_s_kneedler" startTime="2054.829" stopTime="2058.793">
    Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler 
    Well, I think this would only...
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="2058.793" stopTime="2070.681">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    Because your position is, there's a final order of removal against an alien by reason of having committed a criminal offense. 
    That's your position, so under your position the who is removable has no force.
speaker="edwin_s_kneedler" startTime="2070.681" stopTime="2081.251">
    Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler 
    Well, it's identifying the subset of aliens against whom a final order has been entered, to whom this preclusion of review applies, and it's...
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="2081.251" stopTime="2123.604">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    Oh, but the statute identifies them by reference to what may be done to them. 
    I mean, I think I'm bothered by the same thing that Justice Kennedy is getting at. 
    The word removable refers not merely to their alien status, and not merely to their conviction. 
    It refers necessarily to a statute which makes them removable, and if, as you concede, they can challenge the alien status, they can challenge the fact of the conviction, why, by a parity of reasoning, may they not also challenge the fact that the statute that the Attorney General is operating under doesn't make them removable until discretion has been exercised? 
    How do you draw that line?

    That is governed by the preceding paragraph, 1252(a)(2)(B) on the same page, which independently bars any judgment regarding the granting of relief under certain specified sections, or any other decision that is vested in the discretion of the Attorney General, so that category of decisions that are... that petitioners are conceding is not even addressed by this provision. 
    This provision must mean something else, and we think it quite clearly encompasses denial of discretionary relief by the Attorney General, whether that denial is based on an exercise of discretion or the Attorney General's determination that Congress has not conferred on him the power to exercise discretion. 
    In either event, the alien has been denied relief that Congress has specified is discretionary, and as that...

    What Justice Kennedy started out with, I thought, was that their claim here is, there is a section of a new statute, and that section doesn't apply, because it isn't retroactive. 
    Now, that's like saying, this Court doesn't have jurisdiction to adjudicate a claim under that section because it doesn't apply. 
    Now, maybe they're right, maybe they're wrong, but it sounds as if they're making a claim that is a claim of jurisdiction, or very similar to one, and how do you distinguish that very basic claim that there is no jurisdiction because there is no applicable law from the claims that you admit you could hear, which include, I am not the alien, I am not removable... you say in your brief they could hear whether the alien is removable, whether the ground of removal is one which precludes judicial review, whether the statute is unconstitutional, and whether the proceeding is fundamentally unfair. 
    All of those, you say, could be heard under this statute...

    Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler 
    Well, The Attorney General certainly has jurisdiction to decide whether to grant discretionary relief. 
    The Attorney General can decide that on a variety of factors, including the Attorney General's understanding of the statute, just as a discretionary determination to exercise prosecutorial discretion not to bring an administrative proceeding that was before this Court in Food and Nutrition Workers you could decide, the agency could decide not to bring the case because they didn't think the equities warranted it, or because of an interpretation of the statute. 
    That interpretation may be wrong, but when something... when Congress intends to vest something in the discretion of an administrative officer, that includes legal issues that may bear on the exercise of discretion...

    No, what Congress has done is vest in the Attorney General of the United States the responsibility for interpreting and administering the immigration laws, and in section 1103, that this Court relied upon in the Ageri-Ageri case, this Court said that the Attorney General's interpretation of the immigration laws is controlling. 
    Congress... in other words, what Congress did with respect to the question at issue here was to vest the final determination whether to grant discretionary relief in the Attorney General, whether that is based on an interpretation of the statute, or the exercise of discretion, or sometimes a combination of the two.

    Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler 
    Well, in Accardi, as Justice Scalia pointed out, it's difficult to figure out exactly on what basis jurisdiction was exercised in Accardi. 
    The Supreme Court... this Court...
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="2400.720" stopTime="2411.660">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    True, it didn't spell it out, but if you look at Heikkila and Accardi together, there's some indication of support for the position of your opposing counsel.
speaker="edwin_s_kneedler" startTime="2411.660" stopTime="2583.015">
    Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler 
    Well, one thing to bear in mind is that the petitioner in Accardi argued the case in terms of a due process violation. 
    What was alleged there was that the Attorney General had engaged in prejudgment and had deliberately subverted an administrative scheme for adjudicating discretionary applications, and the petitioner argued that that was a violation of due process. 
    Now, this Court subsequently has said in the University of Missouri, in 435 U.S., that Accardi did not state a rule of constitutional law binding on the States, so in light of subsequent understandings of what Accardi stood for, it would seem odd that if it didn't state a fundamental rule of constitutional law that is binding on the States, that it would nonetheless be the sort of thing that Congress would be compelled to provide judicial review of under the immigration laws. 
    I wanted to respond to two statutory questions, and then perhaps explore this point further. 
    Petitioners have relied on the Foti and Chadha cases with respect to the final order of removal being contingent upon the exercise of discretion, in those cases suspension of deportation. 
    That... the Court explored that, though, solely for purposes of deciding which court would, as a statutory matter, have jurisdiction over the particular claim there, and what the Court said is, sensibly it only... it makes sense for suspension of deportation claims to be heard in the courts of appeals because the Attorney General has chosen to adjudicate applications for suspension of deportation together with the substantive basis for deportation in one single proceeding. 
    But the Court made pretty clear in Foti that the Attorney General was not required to do that, and it would have been equally consistent with the Act for the Attorney General to determine whether to grant relief to particular aliens outside of the affirmative removal proceeding as a matter of discretion, maybe on a sort of certiorari jurisdiction to the Attorney General to decide at the close of the case whether to do that or not, and that remains the case under the current law. 
    Nothing in the Act requires that the Attorney General adjudicate an application for 1182(c) relief, or for cancellation of removal before entering a final order of removal. 
    The regulations provide that method of adjudication, but nothing in the Act does, and the question, I think, for purposes of whether judicial review is compelled is whether there is a statutory right, because after all, Congress has plenary power over immigration, over the jurisdiction of the lower Federal courts, and broad power over the fashioning of the writ of habeas corpus, as this Court said in Felker, and Congress could legitimately decide if there is not a statutory right to have an application for cancellation or 1182(c) relief adjudicated in a particular...

    It's a power of dispensation. 
    It is a power of the Attorney General to relieve an alien of the admitted consequences of an order of removal, to lift the consequence of removal and allow the alien to remain here.

    And Congress enacted IIRIRA against the background of great frustration with the inability of the system to remove criminal aliens from the United States, and because of the potential for criminal aliens to tie up the courts in trying to stave off the removal.

    Congress... as we point out in our brief, the one thing that is clear from the legislative background of the passage of IIRIRA and AEDPA is that Congress wanted to expeditiously remove criminal aliens from the United States, and it regarded the entry of the judgment of conviction as a sufficient ground for doing so.

    Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler 
    Well, this is a statute... again, looking at the statute, in which Congress has given the power to the Attorney General, but unlike, for example, the asylum provision, the asylum provision says in section 208, the Attorney General shall establish a procedure for aliens to file applications for asylum, meaning that the Attorney General has to at least be in a position to receive an application and do something with it. 
    There is no such provision in this Act that requires the Attorney General to receive and consider a particular application for relief from deportation, just as there is nothing to require the President to actually entertain and pass upon an application for a pardon, and this Court said in Jay v. Boyd that this relief is to be regarded much as the application for a pardon to the President of the United States. 
    One final point I want to make clear is that, whatever else may be true with respect to judicial review, the court of appeals was certainly wrong to say that judicial review would be in the district court. 
    It would stand this Act on its head to suggest that criminal aliens whom Congress wanted to remove from the country with particular emphasis would be able to go to the district courts, get a level of review there, go to the court of appeals, and then perhaps to this Court.

    The Government says that those cases came out that way simply because the Attorney General had, as a discretionary matter, decided to determine the discretionary element together with the merits determination, so as a matter of fact, it happened to have been preceding the order of deportation, but that there was no legal requirement that that be the case.

    Mr. Lucas Guttentag 
    There continues to be the case that the regulations require that, Your Honor. 
    There's no doubt about that, that the regulations require the immigration judge to adjudicate an application for relief. 
    That, in and of itself, is a duty. 
    Secondly, the cases do say that the final order is contingent on the determination, and this is not about the exercise...

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Do you have a regulation number for that, or...
speaker="lucas_guttentag" startTime="3507.919" stopTime="3657.930">
    Mr. Lucas Guttentag 
    It's 212... it was 212e(b)(2), I believe, and it's currently also the regulation governing the current version of that, which is the cancellation of removal, and I'd be happy to provide it at the next case, if that's... that that final order... and I don't believe the Government would actually contend that under the statute as it's currently implemented, and as it has been since 1917, and under the regulations that govern, that a final order could be entered with the immigration judge or the Board of Immigration Appeals and the Attorney General simply say, I refuse to adjudicate your application for relief. 
    If the Attorney General determines that the individual is not legally eligible, then so be it, but that claim is reviewable. 
    If the Attorney General exercises discretion, then that is not reviewable, and we concede that. 
    The... what the... what this Court has said about the pardon analogy to the discretionary decision goes to the exercise of discretion. 
    That's very clear from the Jay v. Boyd case. 
    It's clear from the Yang case, Your Honor, where the exercise of discretion is not reviewable, but the question of whether the Attorney General has properly construed who is eligible, the Attorney General in this case has said that an entire class of individuals is ineligible because I determined that, Congress instructed me to apply this law retroactively. 
    Whether the statute applies retroactively or not is a question that the courts must decide. 
    That's what Landgraf said, and it's for Congress to legislate clearly and specifically what the temporal scope of the statute is, and that's not for the Attorney General to determine. 
    I also, in regard to the particular provision governing the review of discretionary decisions that Mr. Kneedler referred to, that refers to particular determinations there in the... that are in the discretion of the Attorney General. 
    For example, asylum claims remain reviewable, so it's clear that the preclusion provision here still would do a significant amount of work, and as far as the definition of what constitute... of what removable means, that definition does not specifically apply to the term in section 1252, in the judicial review provision. 
    It is a definition, but it does not specifically apply to what we have at issue here. 
    And finally, in terms of the Government arguing that the Attorney General could simply decide to deny any exercise of discretion, that is the Chennary principle, that the decision of the Attorney General must be, correct or not...
