    Mr. Phillips.

    Mr. Carter G. Phillips 
    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court-- 
    The central flaw in the jurisdictional and the enforceability of holdings in the court of appeals in this case is the manifest hostility that court demonstrated towards arbitration. 
    The view reflected in those holdings is, to use a phrase that this court used in similar circumstances, quote, far out of step with this Court's endorsement over the past 15 years of arbitration as an effective and an efficient method of dispute resolution of Federal statutory claims.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="98.489" stopTime="114.780">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    I can understand your characterization of the second holding that way about the possibility that the arbitration might entail costs, but the jurisdictional holding, do you think that manifests a hostility to arbitration?
speaker="carter_g_phillips" startTime="114.780" stopTime="137.256">
    Mr. Carter G. Phillips 
    I do, Mr. Chief Justice, largely because it's reasonably clear that had the Court treated that order as an interlocutory order, then this matter would have gone immediately to arbitration, and the arbitration process would have been allowed to go forward. 
    By treating it as a final judgment, as the Court did, it then undertook to review the merits of arbitrability--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="137.256" stopTime="173.191">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Well, Mr. Phillips, there was a crucial difference here. The Court purported to dismiss all the claims. 
    It didn't just enter a stay order, as would typically be the case. 
    It said everything else is dismissed, and I take it that would mean then that the statute of limitations might run before the case ever got back, or something like that, and isn't there a real difference between the entry of a stay order pending the arbitration versus a dismissal?
speaker="carter_g_phillips" startTime="173.191" stopTime="179.865">
    Mr. Carter G. Phillips 
    --There is no question, Justice O'Connor, that this case would have and probably should have been dealt with as a stay order.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="179.865" stopTime="180.105">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Yes.
speaker="carter_g_phillips" startTime="180.105" stopTime="192.204">
    Mr. Carter G. Phillips 
    Section 3 of the Federal Arbitration Act quite plainly states that the Court shall enter a stay. In this context I think he did this to clear his docket, although that was not specifically our request. 
    That was his decision.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="192.204" stopTime="241.109">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Well, why is that wrong, Mr. Phillips, if what the district judge says is, gee, there's nothing before me, I think every single issue in this case belongs in the arbitral forum, so I'm going to dismiss, and I look at section 3. 
    What I see that as telling me is, don't move forward. 
    It's not stay versus dismissal, but it's stay versus letting the case continue. 
    Why should a district judge who says, there's nothing to come back to me, this is not a case where some issues are to be referred to other... to the arbitral forum, and then there are other issues that I'll decide after the arbitration. 
    Why isn't it perfectly proper for a district judge to say, there's nothing here for me to decide, everything is for the arbitrator?
speaker="carter_g_phillips" startTime="241.109" stopTime="254.757">
    Mr. Carter G. Phillips 
    Well, I think at the end of the day this is still an embedded proceeding, and even though he ultimately dismisses everything, it is certainly available to come back to him at the end of the arbitration and have these issues reviewed, and it would certainly be much easier--
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="254.757" stopTime="255.437">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    What issues?
speaker="carter_g_phillips" startTime="255.437" stopTime="255.842">
    Mr. Carter G. Phillips 
    --as a matter of judicial--
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="255.842" stopTime="289.302">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    What issues? In this case, as I understand it, I understand the formal distinction. 
    This is the plaintiff consumer suing rather than an action to order arbitration, but it seems to me even if you're right that the district judge should have stayed, what in fact happened was the district judge dismissed, total, case gone, and that seems to me as final a judgment as there could be. 
    You could argue, he shouldn't have done that.
speaker="carter_g_phillips" startTime="289.302" stopTime="289.593">
    Mr. Carter G. Phillips 
    --Right.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="289.593" stopTime="309.992">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Just like erroneously entering summary judgment, we don't say it isn't the final judgment. 
    Judge says, I award summary judgment to defendant. 
    Plaintiff says, gee, judge, you shouldn't have done that, but it doesn't make the judgment any less final that the judge maybe should have done something other than dismiss.
speaker="carter_g_phillips" startTime="309.992" stopTime="320.719">
    Mr. Carter G. Phillips 
    Well, if you take it to the flip side, though, Justice Ginsburg, what happens in the situation where you deny summary judgment but style it as formally a final judgment, even though it in fact isn't a final--
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="320.719" stopTime="335.897">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    It doesn't matter how you style it. You've got something before you. 
    You've held onto something. 
    It doesn't matter what label you pin to it. 
    If a district judge disassociates itself from the case, that's the classic definition of a final judgment.
speaker="carter_g_phillips" startTime="335.897" stopTime="336.241">
    Mr. Carter G. Phillips 
    --Well, I--
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="336.241" stopTime="344.290">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    This district judge says, out. 
    This case isn't here any more, gone, as distinguished from, I'm entering an interlocutory order. 
    It's not what's--
speaker="carter_g_phillips" startTime="344.290" stopTime="378.995">
    Mr. Carter G. Phillips 
    --Clearly that's not what the judge did here, and the question is, what should an appellate court do when it's presented with this particular problem, and my answer to you is to recognize that the dismissal in this context was an inappropriate way to proceed, treat it as a stay, and therefore conclude that it was not appropriate to go beyond that, and entertain the question of arbitrability, because to do that is to create a new class of problems under section 16 that otherwise wouldn't exist. 
    We know that if it's a true independent action and you order something to arbitration, then there's an appeal on that--
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="378.995" stopTime="379.866">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    --But when you say treat it as--
speaker="carter_g_phillips" startTime="379.866" stopTime="380.587">
    Mr. Carter G. Phillips 
    --but that's the only case like that.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="380.587" stopTime="436.288">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    --When you say treat it as, you're already saying... this district judge says, dismissed. 
    Treat it as, district judge, your wrong, you should not have dismissed, we have to review and reverse at least that much to say, you should not have dismissed the case, you should have stayed it. 
    So I could see if you're right about that, that the proper result here is always stay, never dismiss, then the court of appeals says, this judge was wrong in dismissing, we certainly have to review that, that's as final as it could be, and on the merits of that decision to dismiss, just as we would do with a summary judgment, we say, district judge, you're wrong, you had no authority to dismiss, you should have stayed. 
    I don't know that courts of appeals treat dismissals that are wrong as if the judge had not dismissed.
speaker="carter_g_phillips" startTime="436.288" stopTime="495.493">
    Mr. Carter G. Phillips 
    Well, the ultimate question, it seems to me, Justice Ginsburg, is going to be whether you treat form or substance in this context as the most important, because it's pretty clear to me that while the judge did, in fact, formally dismiss the action, what was both required under section 3 of the Federal Arbitration Act and what we asked for him to do was to stay this. 
    This is the plaintiff's choice of forum. 
    There's no reason the case couldn't have stayed there. 
    We can respond directly to the Chief Justice's and Justice O'Connor's concerns about judicial administration by retaining the case under those circumstances, and we can fulfill the overall purposes of the Federal Arbitration Act appellate review standards by insisting that matters, when all doubts are... you know, when you can resolve all doubts in favor of making sure they go to arbitration, rather than go through what we are today, which is having adjudicated this issue at three different levels of the Federal court system over 5 years, tens of thousands of dollars, and we're no closer today to resolving the merits of this dispute over the 15 charge and whether that's a finance charge or not--
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="495.493" stopTime="502.403">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    Sure, but if you lose this case it won't take another 5 years and another case, because everybody will know pretty much where we stand.

    Mr. Carter G. Phillips

    Justice David H. Souter 
    I mean, the problem of the long litigation here is that you've got an unresolved question.

    Mr. Carter G. Phillips 
    --There's no question about that, Justice Souter.

    You--

    Mr. Carter G. Phillips 
    What we need is an answer.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="511.873" stopTime="567.518">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    --You said the... we should see this as a choice of form versus substance. 
    Haven't we got a form versus substance problem, in effect, whichever way we go? 
    I understand your form and substance argument here, but if we follow the embedded independent distinction we've got a form and substance problem, too, and it seems to me that if we follow the embedded independent distinction we are in effect going to be leaving it up to a matter of pleading in a great many instances as to what the appealability may be, and let me just throw out the suggestion that we might be better off to let district judges, in effect, make the form substance distinction and decide the appealability question than leave it to parties who are pleading to make that distinction for us.
speaker="carter_g_phillips" startTime="567.518" stopTime="603.561">
    Mr. Carter G. Phillips 
    I think where we ought to look for the appropriate legal standard is the statutory scheme, and I think Congress clearly incorporated embedded versus independent into the subcomponents of section 16. 
    They clearly recognize there are independent proceedings and there are embedded proceedings, and it has specific rules about how appeals ought to be followed in that course. 
    So to be sure, there may be some potential for manipulation by the parties, but I don't know of much evidence to reflect that that's any kind of a problem, and Congress essentially bought into that distinction in 1988 when it adopted the statute in the form that it did.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="603.561" stopTime="636.462">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Well, it did set forth specific rules, but it certainly didn't adopt the embedded nonembedded criterion as a test for anything else, and the word it used for appealability was a classic word that has nothing to do with embedded versus nonembedded. 
    I mean, if that's what they meant by final, you know, final decision, they should have said something else. 
    It's a very strange word to use to convey embedded versus nonembedded.
speaker="carter_g_phillips" startTime="636.462" stopTime="678.070">
    Mr. Carter G. Phillips 
    To be sure, Congress could have been clearer here, and I think what the Court said in Cortez Byrd last term applies equally here, that enlightenment is not going to come from parsing the language of this particular statute. 
    At the end of the day what we know is that the final decision language in section 16(a)(3) covers the classic situation involving an independent proceeding. 
    Whether it should be extended beyond that to a new class of claims that will interfere with the implementation of the goals of arbitration is the issue before this Court. 
    I find it difficult to get passionate about this because I believe Justice Souter is right, at the end of the day what really matters is that we have a rule. 
    Once we have a rule, the rest of us will presumably--

    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    What did they mean--

    Mr. Carter G. Phillips 
    --be able to line up behind that rule.
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="678.070" stopTime="712.369">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    --What did the... the only... I'm totally puzzled, frankly, by this statute, and I did notice the only people who seem to understand it, because I guess they wrote it, was the judicial conference, and they put in the legislative history that it would allow appeals from final judgments, including the final judgment in an action to compel arbitration, or a final action dismissing an action in deference to arbitration, so I didn't see that last... what could that last statement mean, other than this case?
speaker="carter_g_phillips" startTime="712.369" stopTime="720.546">
    Mr. Carter G. Phillips 
    I think that last statement could be read directly to apply to this case. Whether or not it was meant, and whether Congress adopted that, I've no idea.
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="720.546" stopTime="727.176">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    I mean, it's not a... an obvious thing that you would want to allow an appeal in this kind of a case.

    Exactly.

    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    May I ask a question, to be sure I get it in before the hour goes by, on question 2. Do you think there are... let's assume you're dead right, that the arbitration clause does not have to specify the costs in detail and so forth. 
    Now, are there cases, and I'm wondering in... take care of this one... in which an arbitration clause could be so one sided that it's not enforceable? 
    This clause, as I read it, preserves the company's right to judicial remedy. 
    It says the arbitration clause shall not interfere with their right to use the judicial process to secure relief, but it does interfere with the other side's right. 
    Now, I don't know whether that's sufficiently one sided to raise a question or not, but are there clauses that are so one sided that it might not be enforceable?
speaker="carter_g_phillips" startTime="905.838" stopTime="969.596">
    Mr. Carter G. Phillips 
    --There may well be. 
    My... let me answer the first part which is that we know... is that... is the particular imbalance in this clause sufficient to render this unenforceable. 
    I don't... I don't understand the other side to have argued that. 
    If they did argue it below, they... clearly that was rejected because the district court analyzed and dealt with all of the unconscionability issues, so I don't think that issue's on the table. 
    With respect... I mean, is it possible to have an arbitration clause that says in order to get entry into arbitration you... you know, the plaintiff would have to file a million dollars, I think obviously a clause like that would be unenforceable under those circumstances because it would interfere with the ultimate enforcement of the statutory right, and that is one of the conditions of allowing arbitration of general statutory claims, and I don't have any problem with that. 
    The problem is that if you have a clause like the one we have in this case, which is silent on these issues, the clear presumption, then, must be that you would favor arbitration. 
    You would not assume all of the costs are going to be extreme or excessive.

    They're going to not go to an arbitration if they're gong to face the possibility, which they never face in court... in court, they don't have to pay the judge. 
    Arbitrators sometimes charge a lot of money per hour of their time, so unless the contract says, or unless the court reads into the contract that the seller in this case, or the finance company, the employer in that case, pays at least for the judge, then this would be an unconscionable arrangement. 
    You can't require the consumer or the employee to pay the judge, and that has to be clear.

    Mr. Carter G. Phillips 
    --I think that the decision of the court in Cole is completely premature for this Court to entertain at this point in time, because we don't know what kinds of costs we're talking about. 
    In the record before the D.C. Circuit in Cole, they had some evidence about what they thought the costs would be, given the nature of those claims. 
    Here, we have no evidence like that. 
    Is it possible in a particular case that the court could declare something unenforceable because the costs are too great?

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well, but--

    As I say, yes, I think you could but--

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    --Mr. Phillips, supposing that, unlike the case here, the person objecting to arbitration had made a significant showing in the district court, not going to arbitration but saying, look, here are some figures from past arbitrations; we think this is going to be just like this one; the party who wanted to go to arbitration doesn't contradict that; the district court says yes, these kind of costs are going to be incurred in the arbitration, and therefore it's unconscionable. 
    I don't see why the... that party should have to go to arbitration if they can make a persuasive showing to the court.
speaker="carter_g_phillips" startTime="1169.104" stopTime="1217.847">
    Mr. Carter G. Phillips 
    --I don't disagree with that, Mr. Chief Justice. 
    I think that you have either of two ways to try to prove up your case, either through discovery, which she had a full and fair opportunity to do, and didn't present any evidence with respect to that, or, assuming that there's going to be doubts... and I think all doubts, again, ought to be resolved in favor of pushing toward arbitration in order to ascertain this. 
    Remember, if you read the American Arbitration Association's amicus brief it says that they consistently waive their filing fees, they often reduce arbitrator's fees, and we know... and it's the reason why I think it makes much more sense for the court to entertain these issues after an arbitration rather than before an arbitration... is that we may find out at the end of the day, if the plaintiff prevails, that all of those costs go back to her, and so she's really out of pocket nothing except for the marginal costs during the pendency of the proceedings.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1217.847" stopTime="1239.756">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    But supposing the arbitration, say, goes on for a week, and the arbitrator's time is consumed, and the plaintiff's, and the defendant's, and then it turns out that a court is going to find the arrangements were unconscionable, that the plaintiff was required to put up thousands of dollars, or the party objecting, and so you've basically spun your wheels in the arbitration proceeding.

    Mr. Carter G. Phillips 
    Well, hopefully that wouldn't happen, obviously, and you wouldn't expect it to happen very often, but again I don't disagree with you, Mr. Chief Justice. 
    If what you're saying is, should the plaintiff have an opportunity to prove unconscionability at the outset of the process, I don't have any problem with that, assuming she does more than what she did here, which was to say, I'm not going to arbitration, I'm not going to do anything, I'm simply going to put in a study from the AAA which may or may not apply to the circumstances of this case. 
    I'm not even going to ask Green Tree whether or not they're willing to pay for the fees in the circumstances a la what the D.C. Circuit required in the Cole case.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="1274.272" stopTime="1301.171">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Well, she had other reasons, too, and one the Eleventh Circuit didn't deal with because they didn't have to, and that is, she said, I don't have to go to arbitration because under the Truth in Lending Act I have a right to make this a class action and I'm not going to get the class action. 
    The Eleventh Circuit, as I understand it, said we're not going to address that issue because we've already decided she has to have security that she's not going to have to pay for the arbitrator under any circumstances.

    Mr. Carter G. Phillips

    The Eleventh Circuit didn't address it at all. 
    It said, that's a question we leave open. 
    We don't have to get to it on our theory of the case. 
    Our theory of the case is that the party seeking arbitration has to pay the arbitrator, period.

    Right.

    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    So we... so at least I feel that the class that question, whether there could be arbitration at all because of the class action provision of the Truth in Lending Act, we can't address that in this proceeding because it hasn't been aired below.
speaker="carter_g_phillips" startTime="1354.407" stopTime="1408.284">
    Mr. Carter G. Phillips 
    Well, Justice Ginsburg, you know as well as I do that it's largely a matter of the court's discretion what alternative grounds which are asserted by a party in litigation to defend a judgment the court will entertain. 
    They have raised a class action issue. 
    We have responded to the class action issue. 
    The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit in a recent decision in Johnson, which we filed a supplemental brief on, has exhaustively analyzed the class action issue, and the bottom line is there is nothing in TILA that is any more pro class action than there was in the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, which this Court held in Gilmer did not prevent enforceability of the arbitration clause in that context and, indeed, TILA has provisions that clearly envision providing significant opportunities for plaintiffs to recover in these kinds of cases. 
    There are statutory damages provisions that give significant moneys even without showing of injury--
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="1408.284" stopTime="1410.629">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    The... you're saying there's enough in here--
speaker="carter_g_phillips" startTime="1410.629" stopTime="1410.807">
    Mr. Carter G. Phillips 
    --and there are attorney's fees and reasonable costs.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="1410.807" stopTime="1448.598">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    --for us to deal with the class action issue, but you've mentioned Gilmer more than once, and one of the things about Gilmer that struck me is that the securities industry said, unlike what you're saying... you say, wait and see. 
    Let's see what the arbitrator does. 
    We're not going to tell you one way or the other. 
    The securities industry said, we pay for the judge, and so that was out of the case. 
    When Gilmer came to this Court it was presented with a situation where the employee was not going to have to pay the cost of the arbitrator because the party seeking arbitration, the securities industry, said, what... don't worry about that. 
    We pay the arbitrator.
speaker="carter_g_phillips" startTime="1448.598" stopTime="1491.254">
    Mr. Carter G. Phillips 
    But the problem with the situation is that you don't presume, in the face of silence, that there's going to be a problem with going to arbitration. 
    This Court has said consistently for 15 years, in interpreting the relationship between the Federal Arbitration Act and Federal statutes, that we presume they should go to arbitration and, if there are gaps, we assume that the arbitrator will provide for them and we know, as this case comes to the Court at this point based on both what was in the record below and what the amici briefs have shown, is that this does not need to be an expensive enterprise. 
    It may not cost her anything with respect to either filing fees or arbitrator's fees.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="1491.254" stopTime="1497.102">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    In taking this position you have to be saying the D.C. Circuit not only was premature, but it was just wrong.
speaker="carter_g_phillips" startTime="1497.102" stopTime="1497.618">
    Mr. Carter G. Phillips 
    No.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="1497.618" stopTime="1521.335">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Because as I read the D.C. Circuit they said, to make this contract fair and enforceable, it must be not the arbitrator's decision, it must be, as a matter of law, that the party seeking arbitration pays for the arbitrator, as a matter of law, not for the individual arbitrator to decide in each arbitration.
speaker="carter_g_phillips" startTime="1521.335" stopTime="1572.309">
    Mr. Carter G. Phillips 
    I am troubled, Justice Ginsburg, by the idea that you would adopt a rule judicially that, as a matter of law, one party must always front the costs regardless of the circumstances of the particular case, and I agree with you, to that extent I think the D.C. Circuit's opinion is overbroad. 
    I don't know whether it would necessarily be applied as broadly as the language seems to suggest, but what I do know is that the problems inherent in that kind of a rule, which has not been tested particularly, are such that it's completely premature for this Court to go down that path. 
    Where this Court ought to focus is, what was before the district judge when that court decided to send it to arbitration, and what was before that judge at that time was, silence, which you construe favorably to arbitration and therefore send the matter to arbitration with no further judicial review.

    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Did your client makes its position on this issue known to the district court, what the... how the costs would be allocated and so forth, or did they just say, we'll fight it out when we get to the arbitrator?

speaker="carter_g_phillips" startTime="1586.170" stopTime="1618.438">
    Mr. Carter G. Phillips 
    Well, the issue came up in a motion to reconsider, Justice Stevens. 
    That was the first time they suggested that these costs were excessive. 
    They did raise the class action earlier in the process, but they didn't raise the question of costs specifically and, frankly, even in the Eleventh Circuit the cost question was more of a second thought than it was a primary portion or focus of the attention of the court. 
    If you're asking me, would we pay those costs in most cases, I can tell you that I know that Green Tree does pay those costs in a lot of instances, but that's the whole point. 
    The plaintiff has the obligation--

    Even if they--

    Mr. Carter G. Phillips 
    Even if we didn't lose. 
    We front the costs at a minimum, and oftentimes we can't get those costs back. 
    If there are no questions, further questions, I'd reserve the balance of my time. 
   
   
   
   Argument of Joseph M. Sellers
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1629.575" stopTime="1630.689">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Very well, Mr. Phillips. 
    Mr. Sellers, we'll hear from you.
speaker="joseph_m_sellers" startTime="1629.575" stopTime="1675.102">
    Mr. Joseph M. Sellers 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court-- 
    I am happy to address the first issue briefly, and then turn to the second issue, second question. 
    Very importantly, the Federal Arbitration Act did not divest the district courts of discretion to dismiss cases, as the district judge did here, as opposed to staying a case. 
    Therefore, the district court had that discretion, exercised the discretion and, as Justice Ginsburg observed, I think once the decision was made to dismiss with prejudice there was nothing else left for the Court to do, and that satisfied the classic standard of finality that made it subject to immediate appellate review.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="1675.102" stopTime="1703.026">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    But Mr. Sellers, if you took the position that I thought Mr. Phillips... he will straighten us out on it... was embracing at this argument, although not in his brief, that Alabama... the amici, The Housing Institute took, they said, yeah, you could say this was a dismissal in the final judgment, but the Eleventh Circuit should say, district judge, you're wrong, because you don't have any authority to dismiss. 
    You must stay, because section 3 says must stay.
speaker="joseph_m_sellers" startTime="1703.026" stopTime="1740.389">
    Mr. Joseph M. Sellers 
    Actually, Justice Ginsburg, I don't think that's a fair reading of the Federal Arbitration Act. Section 3 says you must stay, but there's nothing inconsistent about section 3, as the majority of the circuit courts have recognized, and ultimate dismissal. 
    Section 3 was designed to ensure that there would be no further pursuit of the merits of the action, that that would be the end of the litigation of the action in that court until the arbitration concluded. 
    There's nothing improper, however, about a dismissal following that and, by the way, if I might just add, Green Tree did ask to dismiss this case. 
    They--
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="1740.389" stopTime="1741.345">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    They alternately--
speaker="joseph_m_sellers" startTime="1741.345" stopTime="1741.613">
    Mr. Joseph M. Sellers 
    --requested--
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="1741.613" stopTime="1742.359">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    --Alternately they--
speaker="joseph_m_sellers" startTime="1742.359" stopTime="1766.194">
    Mr. Joseph M. Sellers 
    --Alternately, that's correct, and the district court, if nothing else in responding to Green Tree's request for relief, was properly... acted properly in granting that request. 
    But even if Green Tree had not requested the dismissal, there's nothing impermissible about a dismissal. 
    Again, I must add, I don't think the Federal Arbitration Act in any respect divested the district courts of a fundamental aspect of the discretion--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1766.194" stopTime="1770.771">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    --Well, even if there is something improper about a dismissal, it's nonetheless a dismissal--
speaker="joseph_m_sellers" startTime="1770.771" stopTime="1771.907">
    Mr. Joseph M. Sellers 
    --That's correct, Your Honor.

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist

speaker="joseph_m_sellers" startTime="1778.155" stopTime="1784.508">
    Mr. Joseph M. Sellers

    Mr. Joseph M. Sellers 
    Correct, and I think that's consistent with the way Congress would have viewed it in 1925, when it was originally put in place. 
    May I turn to the second issue that I understand is also of central concern to the Court. 
    I think that Mr. Phillips, in using a hypothetical, or responding to a hypothetical of the Court, illustrates the problem with costs, and the reason why the circuit court was correct in holding the agreement unenforceable because of the risk of the imposition of large costs. 
    The example given, well, suppose the plaintiff was expected to put up 1 million in costs, or, if we can be a little more realistic, suppose the cost of arbitration were 5,000 dollars, just the initial arbitration specific costs, the costs of filing, the cost of the arbitrator, because he or she's setting aside a day or two to come out, they want to check in advance, which often happens, suppose that they have to rent a room, suppose there's a stenographer, and they want all that payment up front.

    I might add that Green Tree, during the course of this litigation, was asked... was... there was litigation over the issue of costs both at the district court and the court of appeals. 
    Green Tree was asked at oral argument, as is apparent from the appeal... from the opinion from the Eleventh Circuit about the costs, and it was unprepared to say that there were specific costs, or, as Mr. Phillips has now allowed, that they might very well allow costs in the outset.

    Then it says, the opinion on top of page 18(a) says, Green Tree also asserted at oral argument the arbitrator may apportion the fees of the arbitration in his award, but that provides no guarantee that a consumer successfully arbitrating under this clause will not be saddled with a prohibitive cost order, and it goes on.

    It would cause her to go forward in pursuit of a claim of very limited economic value on the possibility at the end... let's suppose that the fair way in the mind of the arbitrator was to split the costs, regardless of outcome. 
    Each side bears its own... bears half the cost of the arbitration, and if the arbitration was 5,000 dollars, and her share was 2,500 dollars, she might very well not go forward under those circumstances.
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="2492.116" stopTime="2492.948">

    --Then that wouldn't be very fair, would it?
speaker="joseph_m_sellers" startTime="2492.116" stopTime="2629.113">
    Mr. Joseph M. Sellers 
    No, I don't think it would be, but that might be in the eye of the arbitrator, the result that is awarded, and we won't know that unless it's determined or ascertainable at the beginning. 
    We don't take the position that the costs have to be set forth specifically in the arbitration agreement, but that they be ascertainable, and in fact the American Arbitration Association last year adopted new rules pursuant to a consumer protocol which set forth the provision that a maximum of 125 must be borne by the consumer and the rest would be borne by the company for smaller claims. 
    That is a... had this agreement simply said, we will follow that kind of rule, or refer to it an outside source of that kind of rule, that would have been fine. 
    But complete silence. 
    It was even silent as to whether there were costs. 
    There was not even an indication that somebody who went forward with an arbitration would have to bear costs. 
    She'd have to be... have to know that, and have confidence that in going forward there would be a reasonable... there'd be an expectation of an allocation that is fair, whatever that means. 
    We submit that that kind of uncertainty creates a disincentive to go forward and enforce the rights under the Truth in Lending Act that this Court in Mitsubishi and in Gilmer made clear is the basis either to decline to enforce the agreement altogether or, as was asked about the Cole decision... if I may address it for a moment. 
    We understand there's a split in the circuits as to whether, under section 4 of the Federal Arbitration Act, there is any authority that the district courts have to insert provisions into an agreement to have it conform with the law as they view it. 
    Whether or not that authority exists, ultimately the outcome ought to be that the district court should tell the parties, I won't permit this to go forward unless you spell out costs or give the party against whom the arbitration agreement is being enforced the opportunity to be assured that they're not going to bear costs beyond those that would be... they would ordinarily expect if they went forward in court. 
    That is the forum that they chose. 
    If the... if judicial and arbitral forums are to be comparable, you can't impose on one party costs well in excess, or create the risk that they would bear those costs--

speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="2760.794" stopTime="2778.258">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    All right, then couldn't the court in this instance have said, look, we have a silent contract here. 
    Alabama tells us to use customer usage. 
    By that, they mean customer usage that will make the provision valid if it exists, and here is a body that does that, and so we assume something like that will be.
speaker="joseph_m_sellers" startTime="2778.258" stopTime="2842.942">
    Mr. Joseph M. Sellers 
    Yes, I think the district court had that authority, and could and should have exercised some additional authority in telling the parties at that juncture, before it sent them off to arbitration, I am concerned about the silence on costs. 
    I believe... I want to give effect to this agreement. 
    I believe that's the intention of the parties. 
    But I am also concerned about the potential imposition of excessive costs. 
    In Alabama there's a customer usage provision, and I want to establish, before I send this off to arbitration, or have a initial conference with the arbitrator to determine at no expense to the parties what cost is going to be assessed, and how it's going to be allocated, and at that point go forward and arbitrate. 
    That would satisfy us. 
    But it's got to be done at the outset, not at the end, because at that point you bear the costs, you're stuck with them, or, as in the case of Ms. Randolph, you're so deterred by the possibility of excessive costs that you won't go forward, and that's the prospective waiver of the TILA claims that this Court has expressed concern if it were to arise.

I want to enforce this agreement, and I understand you both agree to it, but we need to spell out these costs.

    Mr. Joseph M. Sellers 
    --No, not in those words, but yes, insofar as we are... forgive me for... I feel a need to explain my answer. 
    Yes, insofar as we argued to the Eleventh Circuit that there... they had an option that was other than simply to invalidate the agreement in its entirety, that the cost had to be established up front.

    Unknown Speaker 
    And no--
speaker="joseph_m_sellers" startTime="2960.238" stopTime="3168.021">
    Mr. Joseph M. Sellers 
    No, I didn't present the options in the way I've just presented to the Court today, but I think that it's reasonable to infer that if the district court regarded itself as lacking authority to pencil in anything as the Cole court allowed in the D.C. Circuit. 
    That's clear, and it is also clear that there was issue about the cost presented to the district court, and about their being excessive, and the record was developed. 
    Whether it was sufficient on the costs in that case or not to satisfy the court, I think we may have a difference of opinion, but I think it's fair to say that the issue of costs was raised early, and it was raised several times. 
    It was not a last minute concern, and it was raised to the court of appeals in the same fashion. 
    And if I might add, if I can turn for just a moment to the class action issue, which I understand was not decided by the court of appeals, because it apparently didn't feel it needed to reach the issue, but I think at least I want to make clear that much the same kind of approach we advanced here could be taken with respect to the class action issue. 
    Ms. Randolph has taken the position here that, not that class actions under Truth in Lending Act are always exempt from arbitration. 
    Any time a lawyer styles a case as a class action it's exempt from arbitration. 
    That is not the position that we've taken here. 
    The position is likewise, the agreement was silent on class actions. 
    The district court viewed it as silence meant it's excluded. 
    That's the end of the discussion, even though the district court expressed some sympathy for Ms. Randolph's concerns about aggregating small consumer claims in the absence of that, the parties being left with no recourse, and I submit that once again the district court could have and should have been able to say to the parties, I see also that Ms. Randolph has styled this case as a class action. 
    I believe that the Truth in Lending Act, while the language of the statute itself contemplates class actions, but more importantly, Congress made it clear, echoing the views of the Federal Reserve Board, that there was great importance attached to the enforcement of the statute through class actions. 
    And the district judge could have said and should have said, I think that the view... I don't know whether you intend to include class actions here, although Green Tree had already made its position clear by opposing class certification, that it presumably didn't want it and may very well have hoped that it would never see another class action again and these kinds of boiler plate agreements. 
    But that I'm going to send this to arbitration, but I want you to understand that I regard... the district court says this, I regard class action to be an option, either left to the arbitrator to determine whether to certify the class, or for the district court itself to determine whether to certify the class, and then, upon review at the end, to satisfy itself that the interests of absent class members have been adequately protected. 
    I think the district court viewed its role in a way that was much too passive for the circumstances of the Federal Arbitration Act, but we do not take the position, and I want to be very clear about it, that we do not take the position that all TILA claims should be exempt from arbitration, or even all TILA class actions should be exempt from arbitration, nor that the district court was without recourse to have the parties put in place some assurances about cost, or to actually insert a provision about cost, as the Cole court seems to have contemplated.

    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    --Well, why should the district court do that? 
    I mean, if you're right, why not say, we construe the contract against the drafter, the drafter didn't put it in, so the contract is no good?
speaker="joseph_m_sellers" startTime="3177.532" stopTime="3209.180">
    Mr. Joseph M. Sellers 
    Well, certainly Mastrobuono allows for that possibility, this Court's decision in Mastrobuono. 
    We also recognize, however, that there's a strong policy favoring the enforcement of appropriate arbitration agreements, and all we are saying here is that either there has to be, as the Eleventh Circuit did, a conclusion that the agreement is not enforceable, or the district courts could have some discretion to ensure that the parties put in place at the outset, not at the end of the arbitration process, but at the outset, mechanisms to ensure that these kinds of protections--
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="3209.180" stopTime="3241.483">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    The class... I don't... the class action issue seems harder to get a hold of to me at the moment because it's... seems like a pure State law issue. 
    They're interpreting the contract, and they simply interpret the contract, perhaps wrongly, so that the class action in this case, in this contract, is not excluded from the arbitration. 
    The other questions, of course, are also State law questions, but they basically are questions of State law that are made Federal because of the policy of the arbitration act, contrary to hostility by the State law.
speaker="joseph_m_sellers" startTime="3241.483" stopTime="3249.250">
    Mr. Joseph M. Sellers 
    --Justice Breyer, it would be... might be State law, but the district court treated... interpreted the question in the context of section 4 of the Federal Arbitration Act.
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="3249.250" stopTime="3250.384">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    The class action--
speaker="joseph_m_sellers" startTime="3250.384" stopTime="3280.161">
    Mr. Joseph M. Sellers 
    The class action issue. 
    It never got to the question of whether class certification was warranted under State law. 
    It stopped at the issue of, it's silent, therefore I have no discretion to consider it, and then expressed some sympathy for the plaintiff's view that class action might be appropriate here, but I have no authority to interpret this silent... this agreement that was silent on this as permitting class actions. 
    That, I think, is a view of its role, the district court's role that is too passive, given this statute. 
    Unless there are any further questions, I'll-- 
   
   
   
   Rebuttal of Carter G. Phillips
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="3280.161" stopTime="3282.179">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    --Thank you, Mr. Sellers. 
    Mr. Phillips, you have 4 minutes remaining.
speaker="carter_g_phillips" startTime="3282.179" stopTime="3362.758">
    Mr. Carter G. Phillips 
    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 
    Unless you have further questions on the jurisdictional issue, I'm going to focus on the question of enforceability. 
    It was only at the very tail end of Mr. Sellers' remarks that he identifies the fact that there is a national policy favoring arbitration, and I don't think we should lose sight of the fact that in this context there was a voluntarily entered into arbitration clause that ought to be enforced under these circumstances, and there are no guarantees, when you go down arbitration as opposed to litigation. 
    We are in a situation now where we have litigated this issue in three different jurisdictions and levels of this court. 
    I don't think anybody going in anticipated any of those costs, and certainly no one is in a position to give a guarantee that any process of dispute resolution is going to be cost free or have cost constraints and, indeed, the plaintiff never asked the district court for any of the specifics that counsel has identified in the context of this particular case. 
    What she said is, plaintiff does not have the resources to arbitrate, notwithstanding her agreement. 
    Therefore, plaintiff's only option is to forego any claims against this company. 
    That is the sum and substance of her position with respect to costs, not some kind of more restrained action, and that's why the district court rejected the notion--
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="3362.758" stopTime="3364.647">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    What about the notion that she wanted to have--
speaker="carter_g_phillips" startTime="3364.647" stopTime="3364.841">
    Mr. Carter G. Phillips 
    --that those costs were unconscionable.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="3364.841" stopTime="3362.758">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    --discovery into what the arbitration proceeding would be, and why couldn't one assume that that discovery would inevitably involve issues about the costs of arbitration?
speaker="carter_g_phillips" startTime="3362.758" stopTime="3381.621">
    Mr. Carter G. Phillips 
    There's no problem with seeking discovery. 
    The question is, did she--
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="3381.621" stopTime="3384.903">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    But I thought that she was told she couldn't have discovery in the district court.
speaker="carter_g_phillips" startTime="3384.903" stopTime="3421.807">
    Mr. Carter G. Phillips 
    --It's not in the record in this case. 
    She sought some discovery. 
    She didn't seek additional discovery. 
    Those are reasonable choices litigants make every day, and the point is, it's certainly not appropriate for this Court in a case in which the Eleventh Circuit quite clearly handled all of this as a matter of law. 
    The Chief Justice is absolutely right. 
    You read 17(a) and 18(a) and it says, presume everything adverse to the lender in this case, and only then can you come to the conclusion that this arbitration clause should be enforced. 
    That's clearly wrong, as an approach to this particular case, and that's the judgment that ought to be reversed. 
    The rest of these issues I think legitimately ought to be considered somewhere down the line.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="3421.807" stopTime="3422.592">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Including whether--
speaker="carter_g_phillips" startTime="3422.592" stopTime="3435.283">
    Mr. Carter G. Phillips 
    But Cole and reasonableness and unconscionability are questions that need to be resolved in a framework that is fundamentally different from a litigant who throws up her hands and says, I'm not going to participate in this particular process.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="3435.283" stopTime="3472.495">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    --But you are asking us to reject the D.C. Circuit solution. 
    That is, in contrast to the Eleventh Circuit that said, no arbitration, you can have your suit in court, the D.C. Circuit said, you must go to arbitration but we're going to relieve the party resisting arbitration, relieve her of the anxiety of thinking she's going to have to pay costs by telling her that's a term of law that we... not asking the district court to do it, the court of appeals saying we write that into the contract. 
    What is... you said it was premature. 
    Is it wrong?
speaker="carter_g_phillips" startTime="3472.495" stopTime="3513.104">
    Mr. Carter G. Phillips 
    It may be wrong, if we have the right facts. 
    I think it is a mistake to say categorically that the lender will always pay the fees, regardless of the circumstances in a particular case. 
    Now, you know, if the case came up in the right context, I could well imagine the court might adopt a view like that. 
    I could also imagine it might adopt the dissenting opinion in Cole and say, no, it still requires more of a case by case analysis in order to properly balance the interests of both sides, but the clear thing you shouldn't do is reject sending this case to arbitration on a record where the plaintiff had a full and fair opportunity and chose simply to say she's not going to play in that particular ball park. 
    If there are no other questions, thank you, Your Honor.
