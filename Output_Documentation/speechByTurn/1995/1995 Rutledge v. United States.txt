Rutledge v. United States

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    We'll hear argument now in Number 94-8769, Tommy L. Rutledge v. United States. 
    Mr. Levenstam.
speaker="barry_levenstam" startTime="10.578" stopTime="36.985">
    Mr. Barry Levenstam 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    This case presents the question of what limits the Double Jeopardy Clause places upon the punishment to be imposed upon a defendant found guilty of violating 21 U.S.C. section 848, the continuing criminal enterprise statute, and section 846, the drug conspiracy statute, where the same conduct constitutes the conspiracy and the in concert element of section 848.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="36.985" stopTime="47.003">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    Is it the Double Jeopardy Clause in the constitutional sense, or simply a concept that's somewhat like Double Jeopardy when we're interpreting congressional intent?
speaker="barry_levenstam" startTime="47.003" stopTime="63.582">
    Mr. Barry Levenstam 
    The Court's analysis has incorporated the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Constitution historically. 
    There have been cases decided without reference to that, and then there have been a number of cases which rely on the Double Jeopardy Clause.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="63.582" stopTime="77.844">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    But do all parties concede, or at least do you agree that if Congress wanted multiple or cumulative punishments set for the two crimes, that they could constitutionally enact a provision that would secure that objective?
speaker="barry_levenstam" startTime="77.844" stopTime="84.497">
    Mr. Barry Levenstam 
    Yes, Your Honor. 
    Under Missouri v. Hunter and a long line of cases from this Court, that is clearly the case.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="84.497" stopTime="89.221">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    So then we're really talking about what Congress intended, rather than double jeopardy, are we not?
speaker="barry_levenstam" startTime="89.221" stopTime="96.825">
    Mr. Barry Levenstam 
    Well, the... what Congress intended in the multiple punishments context defines the parameters of the double jeopardy protection.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="96.825" stopTime="108.091">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Which really means there isn't any constitutional question involved, if Congress can provide whatever it wants, and double jeopardy accordingly recedes whatever Congress has provided.
speaker="barry_levenstam" startTime="108.091" stopTime="146.296">
    Mr. Barry Levenstam 
    Well, double jeopardy does not impose limitations on Congress, it's true. 
    It's been analyzed to impose limitations upon the courts in imposing Congress' will. 
    Whether it's actually necessary, given the presence of the Due Process Clause, or even the body of the Constitution, relative authority granted under Article I or Article III, insofar as my client is concerned, he would be as happy to have one of these convictions vacated under any of those rubrics, but historically, looking at the cases, they have analyzed these situations under the double Jeopardy Clause.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="146.296" stopTime="150.340">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    But then if we're concerned with Congress' intent--
speaker="barry_levenstam" startTime="150.340" stopTime="150.991">
    Mr. Barry Levenstam 
    Yes.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="150.991" stopTime="169.732">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    --as you agree, then why would Congress intend to put the prosecutor at risk of having no conviction... let's say the CCE conviction gets wiped out on appeal... if the conspiracy conviction has not been entered? 
    Why would we attribute such a will to Congress?
speaker="barry_levenstam" startTime="169.732" stopTime="266.497">
    Mr. Barry Levenstam 
    I don't think you should attribute such a will to Congress, and I don't believe that that is what would happen. 
    Our suggestion as to what should happen in a situation, it's clear under this Court's decision in Ball that the prosecutor is entitled to charge both, to present evidence as to both, to put both before the jury, and the Court is entitled to accept a verdict back from the jury with respect to both. 
    If the jury comes back and enters guilty verdicts with respect to both, our position is that it would be incumbent upon the district court to enter a vacatur with respect to one or the other in that court's discretion, and then when the entire case goes up on appeal, and we would assume that the defendant, having been found guilty, would take an appeal, both the guilty verdict, the judgment entered upon the conviction... for instance, the CCE... and the vacatur that the district court entered on the conspiracy would be before the appellate court. 
    It would be incumbent upon the defendant to argue with respect to both of those counts everything that he has, because the appellate court, having jurisdiction over the entire case and all the orders therein because the appeal is from a final appeal, if it determined that the CCE count should be reversed based on some element of CCE or some aspect of the case pertaining to an element that distinguishes it from the underlying conspiracy, the appellate court would have the authority to reverse the vacatur on double jeopardy grounds at the same time.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="266.497" stopTime="270.969">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    How would that work if there is no judgment entered on the conspiracy count?
speaker="barry_levenstam" startTime="270.969" stopTime="290.601">
    Mr. Barry Levenstam 
    Well, there would be a final judgment entered in the case, and in the line on the judgment form it would say, jury verdict vacated with respect to the conspiracy, and then the court, the appellate court could simply reverse the vacation of that, and remand to the district court.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="290.601" stopTime="297.846">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    The Government would have to appeal that, though, to get the vacatur reversed, wouldn't it? 
    I mean, the defendant isn't going to say, reverse the vacatur.
speaker="barry_levenstam" startTime="297.846" stopTime="308.863">
    Mr. Barry Levenstam 
    Well, the defendant won't say that. 
    It's my understanding that a final appeal, because all orders merge in the final judgment order, the court would have the authority to--
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="308.863" stopTime="317.729">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Well, merge... you've just used a word that the Second Circuit... what you describe seems to be what the Second Circuit's position is, and yet in your brief you reject that.
speaker="barry_levenstam" startTime="317.729" stopTime="342.265">
    Mr. Barry Levenstam 
    --Well, I reject that because the Second Circuit's approach involves entering judgments of conviction on two counts when we believe under the Ball decision that judgments of conviction should be entered under only one of the counts. 
    That, we believe, is Congress' intent, and that, we believe, is backed up by the force of the Double Jeopardy Clause.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="342.265" stopTime="360.698">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    But isn't this all just formalism if your end result is that the court on appeal could reinstate the verdict on the conspiracy count in the event that the CCE conviction were reversed on a ground peculiar to that charge?
speaker="barry_levenstam" startTime="360.698" stopTime="393.517">
    Mr. Barry Levenstam 
    Perhaps it may appear to be formalism from the standpoint of the court, but from the standpoint of the defendant who has a double jeopardy interest here, he will have stood trial in public, perhaps in his community, and under the Second Circuit means of addressing this issue, he will have the additional stigma which the Court mentioned in Ball of having two judgments of conviction entered, really upon one offense.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="393.517" stopTime="399.243">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Why is-- 
    --And you think the vacatur erases, washes off that stigma? 
    This is not formalism?

    Yes.

    He's walking around in the community with two convictions instead of one conviction and a conviction plus vacatur. 
    That's the difference.

    Justice David H. Souter 
    Why is there any additional stigma when the second offense is essentially a lesser included... I mean, he's already got all the stigma he can get from the first one.

    Mr. Barry Levenstam 
    I was simply going to say, under Congress' definition, based on our position, there has been only one offense here. 
    The lesser included is not to be punished separately. 
    It's not to be taken as a separate offense.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="486.248" stopTime="499.016">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    A district court order that the lesser offense be simply suspended, he would suspend entering judgment, I don't think that would work, because then you couldn't have both appeals.

    Mr. Barry Levenstam 
    My concern with the suspension, and why I respectfully suggest that the vacatur is a more satisfactory solution, is because suspending the count sort of leaves it out somewhere in Never Never Land.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="512.924" stopTime="514.347">

    Sort of like a springing use.

    Well, what do we do in the present case?
speaker="barry_levenstam" startTime="519.682" stopTime="528.498">
    Mr. Barry Levenstam 
    Our request with respect to this would be that you remand to the district court with the direction that one of the two convictions be vacated.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="528.498" stopTime="532.279">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Be vacated. 
    Which one?

    Mr. Barry Levenstam 
    That would be up to the district court.
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="535.991" stopTime="581.433">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    But what... I mean, how is it supposed to work? 
    That's what I can't figure out in this case. 
    The judge gets a piece of paper, and the piece of paper says, judgment on 846, then there's a blank or something. 
    I mean, normally he'd fill in, convicted, all right. 
    Then 848, he'd fill in judgment of conviction. 
    It's this piece of paper called a judgment, and in your opinion, how should it read? 
    After all, I mean, it sounds very technical and very formal. 
    If he puts the wrong one and then on appeal the other one's reversed, or something, you know, and what happens when one party thinks that they are lesser included and the other doesn't? 
    I mean, isn't the simplest thing just say, judge, fill in both, convicted. 
    Do that. 
    Just fill it both in, convicted--

    Well, both--

    All right.

    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    Fine, so I'd enter judgment, 848 convicted, okay, and I enter judgment on 846, I say, strike it out. 
    Do I say, acquitted? 
    What do I... I don't put acquitted.

    Now what happens?
speaker="barry_levenstam" startTime="638.712" stopTime="649.881">
    Mr. Barry Levenstam 
    Well, the appellate court then would say that because the Government did not satisfy the requirements to establish a CCE, and there is no CCE conviction--

    Then the court of appeals can say the decision, given that there is no longer a conviction under the continuing criminal enterprise statute, there is no longer a double jeopardy bar, and so we reverse the vacatur order, and we remand to the--

    Yes, but the... not all of the errors might have been the basis for the decision. 
    Let's assume that on the continuing criminal enterprise count some element other than the conspiracy element was found to be insufficiently supported by evidence, and the court says, that's enough, we reverse. 
    Then we get back to the position that you posit. 
    The other conviction, the conspiracy conviction is brought forward.

speaker="barry_levenstam" startTime="879.068" stopTime="889.487">
    Mr. Barry Levenstam 
    Well, that's true, but I will want to appeal because the conspiracy claim is a true, lesser-included offense.

    And you will raise every issue, but in my example the appellate court says, we find one ground of error. 
    We don't have to get into the question of the sufficiency of evidence on conspiracy. 
    That's difficult. 
    So we're going to decide it on the ground of the clear error, and so you will have done everything you're supposed to do, but because the court decided on the ground that it did, you will still have the conspiracy issue before you, and you're going to appeal it, aren't you?

    If you say that it doesn't have to be a retrial on the conspiracy, why have two appeals instead of just one? 
    As long as there's not going to be additional collateral consequences, as Justice Breyer indicated, doesn't it make entire sense to let the whole case go up to the court of appeals and just ensure that there will be no more than one punishment?

    Mr. Barry Levenstam 
    --Justice Souter, you're absolutely correct with respect to a situation other than the one that is in our case, where the Seventh Circuit has affirmed concurrent sentences... concurrent judgments, separate judgments and separate concurrent sentences. 
    In our case, there was never a vacation of either offense, and so the argument to this point has been talking about preferred approach to take, but has not really addressed what's happened in our case. 
    In our case, the Seventh Circuit affirmed separate convictions and affirmed concurrent sentences. 
    I will--

    The lesser included offense, the jury has a choice of one or the other. 
    Here, the Government is entitled to require a jury verdict on both.
speaker="barry_levenstam" startTime="1368.570" stopTime="1455.037">
    Mr. Barry Levenstam 
    The same was true with respect to the... I... with respect to the two firearms statutes involved. 
    They were separate offenses. 
    They were both submitted. 
    This Court held specifically that both could be submitted to the jury. 
    The verdicts could be returned. 
    Nevertheless, it was clear that the possession statute was a lesser included of the receipt statute, and this Court, in examining the statutory history, the legislative... the statutory structure and the legislative history, came to the conclusion that Congress did not intend to cumulate punishment, and based upon that conclusion said, because of the collateral consequences issue, that you could not enter cumulative sentences even if they're concurrent. 
    The same situation presented itself in United States v. Gattis, which is... was a bank robbery case, and the jury returned verdicts under 2113(a), 2113(b), and 2113(d), and this Court, in its footnote, said, well, obviously, you're going to have to vacate the separate convictions and the concurrent sentences for all but the 2113(d). 
    So I think within the Federal system... perhaps it was unfortunate I even interjected my State, but within the Federal system, it is not unusual to submit lesser included and the greater offense at the same time.

    Mr. Barry Levenstam 
    Because in order to receive you have to possess, but in order to possess, you do not have to receive, and the... Chief Justice Burger in writing that case noted in a footnote that one way of doing that would be to... for the person who possesses the gun to manufacture it. 
    You know, the zap gun situation. 
    But there is a much more frequent occurrence that distinguishes those two statutes, and that is, somebody who is not a felon goes out, buys a gun... it happens all the time... commits a felony, is convicted, and upon his release returns home to his gun collection. 
    Now, every one of those guns is illegally possessed, but not one of them was illegally received, and so there you have... that is the situation. 
    It's a virtually identical situation here where there is a lesser included offense.

    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    What actually is your objection to what I take is the SG's position on our piece of paper called judgment in the district court? 
    The district court would write, 846, conviction, 848, conviction, and then between the two he'd write the words, 846 is included as part of the, or something like that. 
    Now, that's... or merged into, I don't know. 
    He writes some extra words between those two pieces of paper, and that would signal to everybody... lawyers see the word conviction, they know they have to appeal, so they'd have a signal, appeal both, and the words in between those two things would apparently make clear to everybody, we'd hope, with an opinion of this Court, that the collateral consequences don't apply.

    If he's able to have the CCE conviction... since the district court under petitioner's position may only enter judgment on the CCE offense, if, on appeal, he's able to have that conviction overturned, the defendant will obtain the possibility of going free notwithstanding that he's committed the drug conspiracy offense, that he's been validly charged of that offense before a jury--

    Mr. James A. Feldman 
    The basis of the normal way of treating things, as you mentioned, is that it's assumed that when Congress puts aggravating factors of a given offense in this particular statute, that Congress only wants one conviction, and in fact the way it's normally submitted to the jury. 
    The jury's told to first consider the greater, and then only if it finds the defendant not guilty of that should it go down and consider each of the others, and that, due to long practice, and the way things have been done, it's assumed that when Congress defines--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1803.424" stopTime="1823.456">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    But the reason it hasn't been done here is, there's been a debate of very realistic arguments on both sides as to whether these are, in fact, entirely separate offenses, what did Congress intend, that if we assume what everybody's been assuming in the argument up to now, that you lose on that issue, then wouldn't it make sense to just put it in the same pattern? 
    Of course, I understand you don't want to concede that, but--
speaker="james_a_feldman" startTime="1823.456" stopTime="1848.351">
    Mr. James A. Feldman 
    --Well, I mean, I don't think so, because I think that the question is what Congress intended, and where Congress defined statutes in two distinct sections of statutes, and moreover, where it takes an offense like CCE, which is really dramatically different from an underlying conspiracy, which involves the defendant obtaining substantial income, acting in concert with five or more people, and committing a series of violations, when it takes that kind of statute--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1848.351" stopTime="1851.794">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    --Yes, because that's just like a murder is more serious than an assault, too.

    Mr. James A. Feldman

    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Isn't it first up to us to decide what Congress' intent was, and if we agree with you, why, then they're totally separate, but if we disagree with you, then why does it make any difference that they're in separate statutes rather than in one?

    The plurality in that case stated that Congress didn't intend a greater prison term to be imposed or a greater fine. 
    They didn't intend that kind of pyramiding of punishments, or consecutive punishments to be imposed on the defendant.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="1976.339" stopTime="1982.603">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    And the plurality in Jeffers assumed without deciding that there was a lesser included offense.
speaker="james_a_feldman" startTime="1982.603" stopTime="2018.017">
    Mr. James A. Feldman 
    That's correct, but they still went on, and we're basic... we are submitting this case to the Court, and willing to accept the same assumption that the Court adopted in Jeffers, and that is, we can assume they are a greater and lesser included offense, but there still remains the question of what Congress intended. 
    Jeffers stands for the proposition... at least, the plurality opinion in Jeffers... that Congress intended not to impose a greater prison term or a more substantial fine, but Jeffers didn't address the question of whether this modicum of additional punishment that's caused merely by the entry of a judgment and a concurrent sentence, whether that was something that Congress would have imposed.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="2018.017" stopTime="2023.640">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    --we should decide whether this is a lesser included offense or not.
speaker="james_a_feldman" startTime="2023.640" stopTime="2093.114">
    Mr. James A. Feldman 
    The Court could decide that in this case. 
    It would be our submission that it's not a lesser included offense because the CCE offense doesn't require... although it may be satisfied by proof of a classic conspiracy, the in concert with element doesn't require proof of a conspiracy. 
    It only requires that the defendant act together with a number of other people to organize an enterprise, but it doesn't require that the other people who are involved with the defendant necessarily know the criminal goals, or the full criminal goals, of the enterprise. 
    If a defendant, for example, organizes a business to transport merchandise from some country where drugs are prevalent to the United States, and does so in a fairly... a shady and unusual way, there may be other people who join with him possibly even thinking it's an innocent enterprise, or possibly not, but who don't know that in every one of those shipments is a large amount of cocaine. 
    In that kind of a case, we think it's reasonable to say that the defendant acted in concert with the other five individuals even though they may... they couldn't all be found guilty of conspiracy. 
    For that reason... and this was an argument also that we submitted in Jefferson the Court didn't reach. 
    For that reason, we don't think that it's a classic relationship of greater and lesser included offenses.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="2093.114" stopTime="2095.056">
    Justice John Paul Stevens

    --No, I don't think that's right. 
    You don't look at whether, on the facts of a particular case, whether the defendant was not only guilty of the conspiracy but also the CCE, just... what you look at is whether under the statute it's possible to be guilty of the CCE without being guilty of the conspiracy, and it's our position, because of the example I just gave, that that is possible, that if the court had to reach the question--

    Mr. James A. Feldman

    The Court specifically said it I think two or three times in the course of its opinion, and... actually, the Court didn't have an opinion in Jeffers. 
    I should correct myself. 
    There was only the plurality opinion that even proceeded along this line of reasoning. 
    Justice White wrote an opinion in which he said they were not greater or lesser included offenses, and therefore any kind of accumulation of punishment would have been permissible in his view, and I--

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    It seems to me it's a very, very fine congressional intent you're asking us to posit.

    It seems to me you look at the statute and see what the statute reasonably means, but you say there's one class... we can discern a congressional intent not to pyramid punishments, however, to cumulate convictions. 
    So there are three categories of statutes. 
    You can cumulate both, and then, category two, you can pyramid punishments but not convictions, and category three, you can't pyramid either one, and we're to discern this refined congressional intent statute by statute.

    Mr. James A. Feldman

    Well, I think the one goes with the other. 
    I think when Congress doesn't intend to pyramid punishments, it doesn't intend to pyramid convictions, either. 
    That's my point. 
    I think it's a very refined congressional intent to allow the double punishment but not allow the double conviction, or vice versa--

    Life is too short. 
    We can't figure all of this out. 
    I mean, if it's... the two are cumulated or not, and if they're cumulated, you can neither punish twice nor you can convict twice. 
    That makes a lot of sense to me.
speaker="james_a_feldman" startTime="2322.134" stopTime="2374.799">
    Mr. James A. Feldman 
    Well, as a practical matter, the notion of punishment that's involved here is a fairly involved, refined notion of punishment. 
    I mean, merely having the piece of paper say that you got convicted of both crimes and concurrent sentences, in this case concurrent life sentences, don't really impose the kind of disability on a defendant that the separate... that an additional term of years in prison, or an additional fine would have imposed. 
    And when you're working with such refined notions of punishment, I think it's important to also try to figure out how... whether the Congress wouldn't have wanted that kind of refined notion of punishment to get in the way of what is truly one of its primary goals, which is seeing to it that a defendant who is... who commits and is convicted of both section 846 conspiracy and a section 848 CCE, that that defendant receives the punishment that Congress intended for both offenses, regardless of some fluke of later judicial procedure.

    But the... Ball had a fairly unique circumstance, which was, you had two statutes of receiving and possessing a firearm by a felon. 
    The Court basically treated them as if they were really two ways of committing the same offense. 
    As the Court said in its opinion, there's one evil that Congress was legislating against there and, in fact, a year after the decision in Ball, Congress in fact took the two statutes, which really by happenstance were just codified separately, and combined them into what... what's now 18 U.S.C. 922(h).

    But Mr. Feldman, Chief Justice Burger said, twice in that opinion said the criminal conviction itself, and not just the sentence, is punishment, and he stated that...

speaker="james_a_feldman" startTime="2439.841" stopTime="2489.753">
    Mr. James A. Feldman 
    I agree, and again we don't disagree, or we're not asking the Court to... our position doesn't require disagreeing with that holding. 
    It's only that it does perhaps suggest that there should be a recognition that the kind of punishment that's imposed merely... especially in a case like this merely by the entry of an extra judgment and a concurrent sentence is not the kind of punishment is not... is one that Congress would have intended to avoid the problem that was being addressed during petitioner's argument, which is the possibility that defendant is going to gain a windfall and not receive a prison sentence for a drug conspiracy that he committed. 
    I would also add that it's even less of a punishment than it was in Ball. 
    Now, at the time of Ball, there was parole in the Federal system. 
    There is no parole, and one of the things that Chief Justice Burger referred to was the possibility that the extra conviction could have an effect on a parole decision.

    The court just made a mistake.

    But if it were clear that Tinder would apply in that situation, the Government's primary interest here is in seeing to it that a defendant who's convicted of both, under both statutes receives the punishment that Congress intended for both.

    Nonetheless, Tinder has been taken by the lower courts to mean that. 
    I think the Seventh Circuit's approach is the simplest way of achieving the result of making sure that the defendant who commits both offenses receives the punishment that Congress intended for both. 
    Now, the Second Circuit's approach is another way of encompassing the same objective, and although it's... the Seventh... under the Second, if the Court disagrees with our submission that Congress didn't intend, and believes that Congress didn't intend separate convictions and concurrent sentences, the appropriate thing to do would be to deal with the case like the Second Circuit does, which is to enter one judgment of conviction, and make it clear on the judgment that a single conviction is being entered for violation of the two statutes, and a single sentence is being entered.

    That's correct, and the Court stated that the relationship between those two offenses is a very complex relationship, and it cannot be simply analogized to the greater... that of greater and lesser included offenses. 
    Near the end of its opinion, it cited the Jeffers case once, but the point of that citation and what it said about Jeffers was simply, we are not dealing today with an issue of dealing with a conspiracy offense based on the same agreement. 
    We're dealing with the relationship between an individual criminal predicate offense, which can be one of any number that can be a predicate for CCE and the CCE offense itself, and the Court held in that case that not only could defendant be separately punished, defendant could be separately prosecuted for those two. 
    But I don't... I think really the only relevance of Garrett is that it recognized that that wasn't the issue that it was dealing with in that... the Court was dealing with in that case. 
    As I was saying, the Second Circuit's approach doesn't... has no possible consequences that would enure to the defendant's detriment. 
    There's only one conviction. 
    There's only one sentence, and under this Court's decision in Ball, there's nothing wrong with a judgment of conviction that was entered the way the Second Circuit does. 
    Since that... the Second Circuit's approach would also make it clear that the defendant has to bring all of his issues to the appellate court in the very first appeal of the conviction, and since--

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    You think it's a lesser punishment to say I was... I have two convictions of two crimes, than to say I have one conviction of two crimes? 
    I mean, it seems to me the court that said in Ball that two convictions are punishment, you know, is cumulative punishment would also say that a conviction of two crimes is cumulative punishment, don't you?
speaker="james_a_feldman" startTime="2745.202" stopTime="2772.979">
    Mr. James A. Feldman 
    --I don't think so, because I think that Ball was concerned not just with the very abstract question of counting of crimes, but the possible consequences that could flow to the defendant from two convictions, and those consequences can't flow. 
    In other words, Ball can't flow from merely the entry of a single conviction. 
    Ball didn't hold that the entry of two convictions, if it had no collateral consequences whatsoever, would still, just as a matter of stigma, constitute punishment that has to be dealt with.

    Mr. James A. Feldman 
    Yes, I guess I would think it's stigmatically neutral, I think, and particularly in the context of these statutes, where the CCE offense is really one of the most serious ones in the Federal criminal law. 
    the fact that a defendant was also... was convicted of a single conviction, convicted once of violating CCE and a drug conspiracy statute I don't think carries any additional stigma.

    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    Could you help me with something very, very basic? 
    Assume no knowledge on my part... very basic. 
    What happens in the absolute ordinary case in the Federal courts where you have crime A, and everyone agrees that crime A is a lesser included offense of crime B? 
    Now, how do you instruct the jury? 
    You instruct the jury... you instruct the jury in the ordinary Hornbook basic case that they can convict of both, or do you tell the jury you can convict of A only if you acquit of B?

    Mr. James A. Feldman 
    It's... the latter is the ordinary way of doing it. 
    Where the two--

    Mr. James A. Feldman 
    In the normal... the normal course, in the normal course or a statute that defines greater and lesser degrees of a single offense, committing an offense and then committing the same offense with a gun, or something like that, I think that that's the way Congress intended things to work.

    It's that the defendant... the jury necessarily found that the defendant committed all of the elements of that offense, and then what the issue in the court of appeals is, some element that doesn't have to do with that offense, so in a very real sense, the jury has convicted him of a crime and the jury has found him guilty of all of the elements of the offense, and I think the proposition is that having done that, there's no reason why the court of appeals... generally what's done is in orders, it remands in orders to the district court to enter judgment on the lesser included offense.

    What's the significance of the $50 here?

    Mr. Barry Levenstam 
    --Well, under this Court's per curiam decision in Ray, there really are no longer concurrent sentences in the Federal system, because each judgment of conviction carries with it a separate $50 assessment.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="3312.472" stopTime="3320.958">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    So the $50, at least in your view, is punishment. 
    It's not some administratively neutral user fee for being sentenced, or something like that?

    Mr. Barry Levenstam 
    Yes. 
    Statute 3013 says it's to be collected as if it were a criminal fine, and this Court's decision in Ray clearly indicated that this was not a... there were no longer concurrent sentences in the Federal system. 
    With respect to Jeffers, while the Court was willing to assume for that cases the status of the conspiracy as a lesser included, what it did not assume, and the question it specifically answered was, would it call the critical inquiry whether Congress intended to punish these two statutes separately, and the answer there was no, and that answer was not only shared by the four members of the plurality, but I believe my reading, if you look at footnote 5 of Justice Stevens' concurrence, he said there were two punishments imposed unconstitutionally as well, so eight justices there, regardless of the lesser included issue, said specifically Congress did not intend to punish violations of 846 and 848 separately.
