    Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace 
    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    The provision of the 1984 cable act that the court of appeals invalidated in this case, section 533(b) of title 47, addresses the special capacity for anticompetitive conduct by local telephone companies in providing cable television programming services. 
    That capacity stems from the telephone companies' established situation as regulated monopolies, and it is important to an understanding of the premises on which the commission and Congress have acted over the past 25 years not to elide too quickly over what it has meant for these companies to be regulated monopolies. 
    They have in the first place been given exclusive franchises. 
    The Virginia statutory provision involved in this case is set forth in footnote 17 of the district court's opinion on page 77a of our appendix to the petition, which protected them against competition in providing the telephone services regulated on the basis of recovery of costs and return of capital type of rate regulation still the predominant and historically the only form of rate regulation to which they've been subject in providing telephone service. 
    They've been granted rights of way sometimes with the exercise of the power of eminent domain to construct poles and conduits and their expenses in doing so have been included as part of their rate base, so at the advent of modern cable television, when it was replacing the old community antenna systems, they had not only the capacity to provide wire service throughout the communities they served, they had the wires in place to virtually every residence and a capacity through their Government-sponsored regulated monopolies to stifle the development of any other competition in the provision of cable television services. 
    I don't mean to suggest that any of this was in any way improper. 
    Obviously, this served an important public interest on the part of the local governments in assuring that telephone service would be available throughout their communities at a reasonable cost. 
    But the situation with which the commission and Congress have been concerned is that not just through their legitimate use of the advantage that they had were they in a position to stifle the development of others in providing these services, but they also would have the capacity incentive to use unfair competitive methods.

    Mr. Wallace, if we're going to get into history, wasn't it proposed to Congress and rejected early in the history of cable to prevent cable from becoming a monopoly by making the cable owners common carriers only and preventing them from programming, which would have made cable much more open to any kind of programming not within the control of a single monopolist?

    Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace 
    --Well, we were... the concern at the outset with the 1970 commission study and regulations that were then adopted by Congress was that the telephone companies were in a position to preempt the entry of any other players into this at all. 
    They were allowed to enter into this business but not in their own service areas where they had these artificial advantages as monopolists. 
    The whole idea was to bring other players in, with the telephone companies among those standing in the wings as potential competitors. 
    We're talking about a longer view than... the idea was, the motivating animation of this was that otherwise no one else would ever get into it, or there was a great danger of that.

    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    --How does that work? 
    That is, the thing I couldn't... the... in trying to understand this, the point that you seem to be making now, which was the point that I thought was the strongest for your side, was contained in Professor Owen's reply affidavit, where I think he agreed with Professor Kahn that really this problem of cross-subsidy, which seems to me your only rationale, doesn't really exist in respect to cross-subsidizing programming. 
    I.e., the programming, you can't easily hide the cost of programming in the cost of your telephone service. 
    I mean, it's not very likely a regulator would think, right, the cost of producing Cecil B. DeMille's The Ten Commandments was part of the cost of picking up the phone. 
    They're pretty easily separable. 
    It's the communication part. 
    Then he says, but they wouldn't have the incentive to do it, to do this cross-subsidy on communication, unless they're allowed to go into programming, and then he stops, and that's the part I didn't understand. 
    That is, why? 
    Why? 
    What do you mean, the incentive? 
    Why is there... if you could make extra money by doing the cross-subsidizing of the two kinds of communication, why wouldn't you do it, irrespective of whether you're in programming? 
    What does programming add to the incentive?
speaker="lawrence_g_wallace" startTime="648.238" stopTime="672.595">
    Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace 
    They're not prohibited from being in programming in the sense of making a movie or a series undertaking through investment or activities in places where these things are made to make them for marketing to others.

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    It seems to me it's been very unconcerned with all sorts of risks in this whole area, and suddenly it's picked out this one. 
    I'm just telling you I don't understand the argument. 
    I don't understand how it's supposed to work. 
    The telephone company charges me or you let's say $50, just like district cable, okay? 
    Now, if it can in fact really charge an additional $5 on my telephone bill because it's somehow hidden, the regulator doesn't understand that this optic fiber which is necessary for the cablevision part isn't really necessary for the telephone part, but you fool them, so they could get $50 from me for the cable, and they push $5 on my telephone bill. 
    My question is, if they're so smart and can do that and fool everybody, why don't they do it, and if, in fact, they do do it, what is being in the programming editing part got to do with it? 
    Professor Owen says that, well, if they go into the programming editing part they'll have greater incentive to do it.

    $5 is $5.

    What has the editing part got to do with this?

    Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace

    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    You mean, they're going to hide Cecil B. DeMille's Ten Commandments, which is their editing thing, and the regulators are so stupid that they're going to think that that programming business which has no common cost is really part of your telephone service? 
    That would be pretty stupid regulating.

    Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace 
    I'm talking about marketing something to their same customers over their telephone wires the way the cable television market did to their customers, and what I'm saying is--
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="949.772" stopTime="949.962">
    Unknown Speaker 
    --So it's a common cost.
speaker="lawrence_g_wallace" startTime="949.962" stopTime="963.473">
    Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace 
    --why they don't do it without having undertaken that, why they don't hide the same $5, as you put it, of expenses is because they don't have the expenses to hide.
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="963.473" stopTime="977.233">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    So then you're making a common cost argument, and the problem with your common cost argument is all the affidavits in this, I think, even Professor Owen I think in the reply, concedes that Kahn is right that there aren't common costs.
speaker="lawrence_g_wallace" startTime="977.233" stopTime="1010.626">
    Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace 
    Well, I've mentioned a number of categories of common costs that would be difficult to allocate, and our case doesn't rest entirely on cross-subsidization. 
    There is also the problem of discriminatory self preference in handling the facilities being used for their own benefit as well as for the benefit of others who are competing with them.
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="1010.626" stopTime="1038.392">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    So that's an argument that basically says we, Congress, would prefer to have a monopolist, the cable company, exist today because then maybe, if the telephone company runs another line into your house, it will let three or four people use that line, but if, in fact, we don't have this statute, what it will do is only one person so will use the line, namely the phone company itself.

    It seems to me, Mr. Wallace, that in the First Amendment area, where I think this case is taking us, a standard list, or very amorphous waiver scheme, is quite inconsistent with our precedents. 
    I'm thinking of the police commissioner that has this open-ended discretion to allow you to parade or not, and it seems to me that in a sense your waiver argument almost makes your case weaker from a First Amendment standpoint.

    Yes, that because of both technological changes and changes in the nature of the industry, where the cable companies have developed from a fledgling industry to one well-established, competition can now be made a reality in this industry by... and the new video dial tone system which in trial runs has been running 200 channels and can easily be doubled that and more provides opportunities to introduce several competitors. 
    And part... while there was reluctance in the initial work of the commission on dial tone to permit the telephone companies to go beyond being carriers for programming for others, they've recognized in this report and order that both in order to preserve the constitutionality of the statute and to give the companies an incentive to make the heavy investment that you need to make dial tone, video dial tone a reality, that they should be allowed to participate, but not to the exclusion of other participants.

    Justice David H. Souter 
    Well, does it boil down to this, Mr. Wallace, that in areas in nonrural areas where there is present cable competition, we can assume, you're suggesting to us, that the commission in fact will allow the phone companies into the business. 
    Where there is no competition, we can assume, I take it, that they won't allow them into the business. 
    Is that what it boils down to?

    The important bites are that they cannot acquire an existing cable company.

    But if the bite is going to be the justification, you're going to have a statute extraordinarily broader than anything necessary to accomplish that particular justification.

    Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace 
    --Well, that's only... and the rest of the bite is that they have to comply with the regulations that the commission is to adopt to safeguard against cross-subsidization and discriminatory self-preference and use of the video dial tone system itself.

    Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace 
    --The waiver allowing entry is a judgment made. 
    It's a trade-off judgment often made by regulators and/or by Congress, or the commission acting pursuant to congressional authority, of how much risk is to be accepted in order to accomplish offsetting public benefits. 
    Obviously, there would be less risk of cross-subsidization, virtually no risk if they weren't allowed to participate, or a much lessened risk at the very least, but a judgment has to be made by someone as an industry evolves of when it is that the risk that remains is going to be outweighed by offsetting public benefits. 
    That traditionally has not been the role of the courts in our system to make that calibration and decide when a change in the regulatory regime is ripe and should be made.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1762.680" stopTime="1780.050">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    May I ask you another question that kind of runs through my mind? 
    Let's assume for the moment that the statute was perfectly constitutional and was enacted. 
    If that premise is accepted, do you think the situation could change in such a way that it would thereafter become unconstitutional?
speaker="lawrence_g_wallace" startTime="1780.050" stopTime="1816.987">
    Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace 
    Yes. 
    It could happen, and perhaps we were approaching that, and under the stimulus of the litigation that has been brought, the commission has now taken initiatives that make the waiver policy as applied more responsive to the changes that have occurred, but this was always something that they had authority to do.

    Well, I'm talking... I don't mean on its face, and we're dealing here with a facial challenge.

    Mr. Laurence H. Tribe 
    Well, I think as in Baker v.

    Mr. Laurence H. Tribe 
    No. 
    I think that would be inappropriate, Justice Stevens, because the test established in this Court's decisions in Coors, Edenfield, and Turner and Ibanez basically asks does the law, as we have it, materially advance, even under intermediate scrutiny, the alleged goal? 
    Is there a real harm, does this really solve it, and the fact that at one time there might have been a problem that it might have solved would be interesting history.

    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    --Yes.
speaker="laurence_h_tribe" startTime="2155.041" stopTime="2266.235">
    Mr. Laurence H. Tribe 
    Well, let me... I think to get away from the question whether we can hypothesize any world in which the statute could have a constitutional application, it would be useful to focus on what the statute actually does, because some of what Mr. Wallace described about the statute when he said that it's sort of about ownership and so forth I think really has nothing to do with this statute. 
    And let me just focus on the fact that, as Justice O'Connor suggested, the statue as designed rather perversely targets one thing and one thing only, and that is speech. 
    It is not a law against cross-subsidization. 
    It is not a law that says, for example, when there is no competition, then we will let them in, because (b)(3) itself is an exception for that. 
    That is, this law deals directly with the editing function. 
    It's true the prohibition was included in a part of the statute called ownership restrictions, but there's no dispute that this statute allows a telephone company to own video programs, to invest in companies that generate or require them, like Time-Warner, to own physical cable facilities such as Bell Atlantic does in Washington, D.C.-- 
    The one function this law prohibits any telephone company from participating in is the editorial function of deciding which video programming channels to carry... is it going to be Disney, the Learning Channel, Discovery, Playboy +/? 
    how the programs are going to be arranged, which to provide in preset time slots, which to provide on demand. 
    That's the way it's been interpreted. 
    That's the way it's been enforced.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2266.235" stopTime="2275.331">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    You say editing, Mr. Tribe. 
    You don't mean the actual making of an individual show, but the choice between ones that have already been made.
speaker="laurence_h_tribe" startTime="2275.331" stopTime="2295.536">
    Mr. Laurence H. Tribe 
    That's right, although it would certainly prohibit... I mean, if we wanted, for example, not only to choose the shows, but wanted in addition to engage in a more active editorial function, that would also be prohibited if this was going to be provided directly to our customers. 
    Now, that--

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Is that very likely that--

    --Not likely, no.

    Mr. Laurence H. Tribe 
    Well, I would never predict, but that's not likely, I think. 
    The point, however, is that as this Court has repeatedly held in the Preferred opinion recently, in... and Hurley and Turner, the function of deciding what to show and when is a core First Amendment function, and in saying that that is what telephone companies cannot provide to their subscribers, they can provide video transport, they can't provide the editorial function, the law is a complete misfire in terms of any objective it could ever have achieved even in 1970.

    That would be the--
speaker="laurence_h_tribe" startTime="2392.909" stopTime="2498.552">
    Mr. Laurence H. Tribe 
    --Well, the point I guess is, first of all, in response to your earlier question, is there anything in the record suggesting that Congress theorized along these lines, there isn't. 
    But secondly, the notion that by keeping a competitor like the telephone companies out you might somehow achieve something in the very long run is really quite irrational. 
    That is, the second... their whole theory is that because there can be cross-subsidy of video transport, and because here you've got a captive market, the ratepayers, and we can pad the bills here and engage in predatory pricing, that this is a particularly dangerous editor, somehow, to let in. 
    But in response to your question, it's always puzzled me as well. 
    How exactly does it work? 
    Why does editing somehow change it? 
    Money is money. 
    If they can monopolize the video transport they'd be doing it today. 
    NCTA in its briefs points out that they have unique incentives to do that now because they think the telephone companies are afraid of the cable companies, so this law has nothing to do with the problem of taking a particularly powerful speaker and gagging him in order to prevent him from engaging in predatory abuses that will in the long run stifle diversity, because it doesn't eliminate the one thing that speaker could do, provide video transport that provides the alleged source of danger. 
    They in their briefs at various points say that it serves that function because the video transport market is regulated in price, but the video... but the cable market isn't, and so you want to go into an unregulated market, but of course that's problematic, because it's false.

    That is to say, what we have here really is classical economic regulation, and it happens to be economic regulation in an area where people are providing, like newspapers and other things, they are providing communication services which does involve... but is suddenly this whole big economic area to be turned over to courts? 
    Because we're going to retreat from giving Congress quite a lot of discretion when it tries to deal with the structure of industries, and we're going to use the First Amendment... other people in history have used other amendments to sort of go into economic regulation in great depth.

    Certainly the... if there were a rule of general applicability like the one in Lorain Journal or the one in Associated Press v. United States, and it incidentally, somebody argued, restricted expressive opportunity, we would not be arguing here for some version of strict scrutiny, although even under the O'Brien test there's intermediate scrutiny. 
    Rules about the structure of an industry, about who may own what, are really quite different. 
    The NCCB case deals with that in the case of broadcasters and newspapers. 
    This isn't even a rule about who may own what. 
    It's a rule about who may edit. 
    It's not even, as in Turner, a must-carry rule. 
    It's a may-not-edit rule.

speaker="laurence_h_tribe" startTime="2622.562" stopTime="2681.283">
    Mr. Laurence H. Tribe 
    Well, first of all, I think the most important thing, Justice Breyer, is to ask whether something is simply economic regulation, an argument that the Government made below but has abandoned, or whether this really has a significant enough impact on speech that it is a First Amendment problem in a genuine sense. 
    In this case we're way beyond that. 
    We're way beyond that along at least two dimensions, because this law I think shouldn't be categorized with a merely economic regulation that just happens to touch this industry. 
    It directly takes aim at a core speech function deciding what the mix of information shall be and what's available over important medium. 
    It doesn't do that as the incidental result of a general law of applicability, a law about camping like the law in CCNV, or a law about using or destroying Government property, like the laws in Albertini.

    As we become more and more a speech-intensive, speech-creative, speech-obsessed society, it seems to me we're going to have more and more cases where you tell us that a software manufacturer, or the manufacturer of a video screen, is engaged in speech, and I have to say that although you're right, this is directed at a very much of a what we now know as to be a core speech activity, the Government's interest here primarily, it seems to me, is an economic one.

    Mr. Laurence H. Tribe 
    Certainly. 
    I think, Justice Kennedy, that as issues of speech, intellectual property and telecommunications in cases this Court will hear... Lotus v. Borland... in cases the Court has already heard, Turner, and in this case, come crashing upon the judiciary, it will be important, in addition to worrying about where we're all headed, to keep our eyes gazed on rather fixed stars of this constitutional constellation. 
    One of them, surely... and this Court, I guess your concurring opinion in Simon &amp; Schuster made it clear, has helped establish it... is that you apply strict scrutiny when a law directly and demonstrably aims at speech and only speech and demonstrably reduces its quantity, even if it's not content-based. 
    Buckley v. Valeo was like that. 
    FCC v, NCCB was like that, Meyer v. Grant--

    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Mr. Tribe, this raises a question that has been troubling me. 
    Supposes that Congress recognized the problem you describe but they still thought the concerns that motivated the statute are still valid, which they may or may not be, and they enacted a statute based on a parallel to the banking regulation, and they said, we don't want the telephone companies to take undue risks with their capital and so forth, and so they basically said telephone companies cannot engage in any business except what they do now, period.
speaker="laurence_h_tribe" startTime="2819.578" stopTime="2841.693">
    Mr. Laurence H. Tribe 
    --Right. 
    I think the State, as part of its franchising authority, might have the power to say you, a corporation, are a creature of the State, this is a condition. 
    But even though Mr. Wallace spoke about the telephone companies as though somehow they're all franchised, and he almost made it sound as though they're all franchised by the national Government so it could impose this condition, it's important--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="2841.693" stopTime="2846.057">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Well, suppose the national Government decided to franchise all these phone companies, they could do... I mean, theoretically, it could happen.

    Mr. Laurence H. Tribe 
    --I suppose given the reach... I don't know how far Lopez will end up going, but this sounds like commerce, and it does seem to me that if the Government says as a precondition of going into a particular business, you've got to agree to stick to business, you can't go out and become a speaker or an editor--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="2863.649" stopTime="2868.264">

    Mr. Laurence H. Tribe 
    --I don't really think so. 
    I don't think so, Justice Stevens, because I think political incentives would be very different. 
    It's very much easier for Congress to pass a law that does not really make a general structural proposition but says there's a certain function, namely editing speech, that some speakers cannot perform. 
    If you look at this law, not only does it take aim at speech and nothing but speech, and in that sense misfire completely, it doesn't hit its target, but it is in fact content-based. 
    It seems--

    Mr. Laurence H. Tribe 
    No, and it... as it explained in Turner, the reason it didn't is because the electromagnetic spectrum is a unique and scarce resource, and problems of physical interference allow the national Government to license it, and the Court has said consistently from NCCB through Turner that the standards applicable to rules that say who may and who may not hold a broadcast license, and if you hold a broadcast license what else may you own, do not apply to the cable industry or to anybody else.

    --Sure.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="2965.026" stopTime="2985.941">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    If we had a regime where the FCC said, fine, you can do all this, but we want you to disclose... we're going to have good accounting rules, and we want you to disclose fully, and could the answer be, well, the disclosure is related to our speech, so we're not subject to--

    Mr. Laurence H. Tribe 
    Oh, I doubt that, Justice Ginsburg.

National Federation of the Blind, even though I think maybe Justice Scalia had a problem with some of the disclosure rules, those were upheld. 
    All kinds of rules designed to protect the public from abuses, trying to shift costs to fool regulators, not aimed at speech, and they're content-neutral, and they don't demonstrably restrict the amount of speech, and therefore they're not subject to special speech scrutiny.

    Incidentally and indirectly, yes, but if it affects the press indirectly only, it's subject to intermediate O'Brien scrutiny, and if it's part of a law of general applicability, as opposed to a restriction on the manner of speech, then I think, as Justice Scalia pointed out in Barnes, this Court really has not used O'Brien to strike down a law of general applicability that doesn't take aim at an expressive activity.

    We're not interested in cement companies.

    --from prices, or whatever.
speaker="laurence_h_tribe" startTime="3075.379" stopTime="3183.557">
    Mr. Laurence H. Tribe 
    Well, I think as you said in the Turner opinion, Justice Kennedy, the fact that the industry definition happens to focus on an aspect of the media doesn't in itself trigger strict scrutiny, and we've not made that argument. 
    What does trigger strict scrutiny here, and I do want to underscore that this law failed any level of scrutiny, including intermediate, and I hope to get back to it, but since you're talking about the future of the First Amendment, I think an important principle to establish would be that just calling a law economic regulation doesn't allow you to fail to look at what it actually says. 
    That is, this law says telephone companies may not directly provide, in the sense of edit, video programming, and it defines video programming as programming generally considered comparable to that provided by a television broadcast station. 
    The Government in its brief says, oh, this is just a matter of mechanical definition. 
    It's a matter of defining the mode, the method by which a message is disseminated. 
    That is not true. 
    That is true of the way the cable act that this Court reviewed in Turner defines things like cable service. 
    That's not true of this definition. 
    Indeed, the FCC itself in its video dial tone order made very clear that the line that this law draws between the video... the video impulses that may be provided by the telephone companies and those that may not within the universe of cable service is a line that, for example, does not distinguish between one-way and two-way transmissions, interactive television shows, two-way, they can't provide them--
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="3183.557" stopTime="3260.299">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    Mr. Tribe, would your argument be different if Congress had made findings at the time it passed this statute and the findings said, in substance, this. 
    We are passing the statute for purposes... for an economic regulatory purpose. 
    Our principal concern is, in fact, with cross-subsidization. 
    We find that it can occur... we find that the greatest danger of its occurrence will be in those situations in which the cable companies are engaging in the editorial function as you have designed it. 
    We find that that danger will exist primarily only in those instances in which cable... the companies are engaging... the telephone companies, rather, are engaging in the editorial function with respect to the same kind of programming that is going on over cable generally, what you have referred to as the video program, and therefore we're going to adopt this reference to video simply as an effective way of getting to the heart of our economic objective. 
    Would your argument for a level of scrutiny be different if we had that on the record?
speaker="laurence_h_tribe" startTime="3260.299" stopTime="3277.860">
    Mr. Laurence H. Tribe 
    --No, Justice Souter. 
    My principal argument would be that, as this Court has often recognized, it is dangerous to make the level of scrutiny depend, except when you absolutely have to, on an inquiry into why Congress acted. 
    The face of the law should be the primary test.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="3277.860" stopTime="3364.993">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    Then in any case in which you can make this kind of facial argument, you in effect are saying, we are precluded from the consideration that sort of animated Justice Kennedy's question of trying to, in effect, divide the universe between what may be legitimate economic regulation with an incidental effect and the rest of the speech regulatory universe. 
    Justice Souter, I think it would be salutary in terms of the First Amendment purposes to put... to remind the legislative branch that it may not abridge speech. 
    It may not use speech categories, content categories, as shorthand for other things. 
    Even if the only level of scrutiny were intermediate, as in Turner, the mere existence of elaborate findings, which certainly the 1992 act contained and this act does not, didn't suddenly mean that the fire power of the First Amendment receded. 
    This Court looked closely at, and instructed the lower court on remand to look closely, at whether, for example, the finding that the broadcast industry was in terrible danger and would be driven out unless this must-carry obligation was imposed, was in fact justifiable. 
    So the nub of your argument is you can't use speech as a surrogate for other regulatory objectives just as they were saying yesterday you can't use race as a surrogate for other--
speaker="laurence_h_tribe" startTime="3364.993" stopTime="3383.004">
    Mr. Laurence H. Tribe 
    Certainly you can't use the content of speech, that speech, like race, like religion, is a matter of special sensitivity, and that content-based rules do not have to be merely a mask for some illicit objective on the part of Congress before they trigger a strict scrutiny.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="3383.004" stopTime="3393.882">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    --But if--

    Mr. Laurence H. Tribe 
    It would certainly be less invidious in terms of a content line if it said they can't carry or transport signals of a certain megahertz frequency, just defined it in a technical way. 
    I think it would at that point not be subject to strict scrutiny, although if one could show, as I think is plain here, that they are foreclosing an important medium of communication... maybe not the same one as in Ladue, putting stuff on your house, but the most important medium today to a large set of speakers... it would certainly not be appropriate to subject it to the reduced level of scrutiny that some merely economic regulations get.

    No, but what about--

    Mr. Laurence H. Tribe 
    Well, we might have a... we certainly would have a different case, but the way the statute is... you say just the way the statute is drafted. 
    A lot turns on a word here or there, the word not, the word speech. 
    This statute is written in a way that guarantees it will misfire. 
    Look at Coors, for example. 
    One could have said, well, there's a general problem with people drinking it up too much, and if they had not had those puzzling exceptions the statute might have been okay, and certainly alcohol is a matter of social concern. 
    But no, this Court looked closely, said that these exceptions don't make sense, the law doesn't fit, it subjected it to intermediate scrutiny, and struck it down because of just the way it was written.

    Mr. Laurence H. Tribe

    Mr. Laurence H. Tribe 
    It might... no, well, there's a difference, Justice Stevens. 
    If, as Justice O'Connor suggested, they actually prohibited video transport, there would at least be a prayer that they would achieve something. 
    This law has no such hope. 
    It's a lot like Justice Frankfurter said in Butler v. Michigan, when he was dealing with a very broad law designed to keep adults from reading material... children from reading material, and then they said the adults can't see it, either. 
    He said, this isn't just a case of... I guess it was burning the house to roast the pig. 
    It's a case where the pig lives somewhere else altogether. 
    [Laughter] 
    That's what's going on here. 
    It's not just that they are overshooting by a mile, they're shooting at the wrong target, and they're choosing speech and they're defining it by its content, and I couldn't imagine a--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="3546.441" stopTime="3553.995">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Mr. Tribe, why do you say it's not content-neutral? 
    I think there's some room for debate on that point.
speaker="laurence_h_tribe" startTime="3553.995" stopTime="3594.804">
    Mr. Laurence H. Tribe 
    --Well, I suppose, Justice O'Connor, it depends on what one means by content-neutral. 
    That is, one could have said that the line in Discovery Network between newspapers and commercial pamphlets is not an ideological line, and so it's content-neutral, but the Court said no, you have to examine the content to tell whether the law applies. 
    So that's one test. 
    I think when you suggested in Ladue how important it is to have a bright line test for what is and what isn't content-neutral, I think one bright line test I could suggest is, if you can't tell whether the speech is prohibited without subjectively evaluating its content, then it's not content-neutral.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="3594.804" stopTime="3601.930">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Let me just interrupt for a second. 
    You mean you have to subjectively evaluate a transmission to determine whether it's video programming?
speaker="laurence_h_tribe" startTime="3601.930" stopTime="3638.544">
    Mr. Laurence H. Tribe 
    Absolutely. 
    The FCC has said we have to look at the mix of textual and nontextual material. 
    The mere inclusion of video text, even though that makes it a little different from what was around in 1984, doesn't prevent it from being video programming. 
    They said that interactive two-way television, though it wasn't available in 1984, that's video programming. 
    They said that a lot of one-way stuff like stock quote transmission, and news services, even with pictures, they're not video programming. 
    They don't look like I Love Lucy. 
    It seems to me that nothing could be more manifestly content-based.

    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Why... why-- 
    --But you're saying that if you did define it by using the number of megacycles or megahertz, or whatever you do, to define the kind of picture that you normally associated with a television program, that would be all right.

    Mr. Laurence H. Tribe 
    Well, it would depend on what law it was part of, and... but that would not... that would certainly prevent it from being content-based. 
    This law, I think, fairly speaking, is content-based, but in any event it is a direct ban on speech.

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Isn't the purpose of the content-based requirement, or a higher hurdle, that we don't want the Government to be imposing its biases against certain contents, against certain subject matters, upon the citizenry, but where the content-based nature is really based upon reference to a third party, like the Government says you can't produce any programming that he produces, the Government doesn't care what he produces. 
    The Government is not imposing its view of subject matter desirability.

    Well,... no, no. 
    If you mentioned Monet, yes, but anything... Monet's still alive, or it's Picasso and he's still in one of his earlier periods, so you don't know what he's going to turn out to be like. 
    You just say, you can't paint anything that competes with Picasso.

    Mr. Laurence H. Tribe 
    --We have... I think the real answer probably is intellectual property and copyright. 
    That is, there is in that context a competing constitutional provision. 
    There are circumstances in which people can be given property-like interests whose contour does depend on content, but I don't think the fact that that's true with respect to intellectual property means that the Government should generally be able to target content.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="3755.225" stopTime="3762.862">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    The Government isn't determining the content, and it seems to me here the Government is essentially saying in a lot of words, don't compete with cable.

    Mr. Laurence H. Tribe 
    --Well-- 
    [Laughter] 
    One way--
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="3789.179" stopTime="3791.229">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    --The one question on the standard is--
speaker="laurence_h_tribe" startTime="3791.229" stopTime="3791.370">
    Mr. Laurence H. Tribe 
    --Yes.
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="3791.370" stopTime="3825.911">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    --you're saying strict scrutiny, but if you applied strict scrutiny to this thing, then wouldn't you have had to say, ab initio... you know, Congress made a bet initially, we may have monopolists here, and it may turn into AT&amp;T Western Electric, and we don't know there will be independent cable companies, and Western Electric and AT&amp;T is a legitimate concern, just substitute the editor of cable for the words Western Electric. 
    And why couldn't Congress pass a statute like that without being 100 percent certain, just 80 or 60 percent concerned that such a thing would happen?
speaker="laurence_h_tribe" startTime="3825.911" stopTime="3956.119">
    Mr. Laurence H. Tribe 
    I think in the cable act, Justice Breyer, Congress did very much that. 
    It said, look, we've got this monopolist. 
    It then defined cable service in a neutral way, and it imposed certain obligations that didn't reduce the amount of speech. 
    Here, instead, whether or not you think the definition is content-based... and I don't know that you need to write an opinion about that because it so obviously flunks intermediate scrutiny. 
    That is, even if you assume for a moment that you could come up with some answer to your question about how it is that they have more incentive to cross-subsidize as a result of this law, the on-balance judgment made by all of the expert agencies in the Government from 1987 to 1992 and then embodied in the video dial tone order, is that this is massively counterproductive in terms of the competitive objective. 
    I mean, the conclusion, I think, that was in your 1987 article tentatively, they adopted it and went full fire with it. 
    They said that it's virtually hallucinatory to think that the telephone companies could enter this market with massive cable incumbents, win market power through this scheme of predatory pricing, and knock out those huge companies, and that on balance the law, even if you grant that regulators are so stupid that they would miss everything, that on balance the law is responsible for this massive monopoly we now have, as Justice Scalia suggested, that the law, in fact, costs consumers billions of dollars in competitive benefits. 
    Now, if you wanted to look at the big picture, one thing you surely want to say is that the Government is not entitled to say that, because speech is important and speech-related industries are important, we are entitled to have a law sustained that on the undisputed record in this case eliminates something like 99 percent of the speech that telephone companies could provide in video programming form, allowed to have it sustained on the basis of wild speculations, where all of the evidence, unlike Florida Bar where there was this--

    It's hard to explain why Congress doesn't repeal it, then.

    Mr. Laurence H. Tribe 
    --Well, they did, not in a bill that the President has yet signed, but if you're going to look at post enactment history this past summer, by huge majorities, both the House and the Senate said, of course this is counterproductive. 
    That wasn't even one of the serious debates.

    Mr. Laurence H. Tribe 
    Yes.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="3986.873" stopTime="4011.349">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    --about this standard, and it's a concern to me that you are arguing vigorously for the top standard, the strictest scrutiny, this is content-based. 
    Suppose the Government said, we're going to let you video, get into the game, anything you want to do except you may not have... you may not video anything about family planning. 
    Now--
speaker="laurence_h_tribe" startTime="4011.349" stopTime="4011.847">
    Mr. Laurence H. Tribe 
    That, of course--
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="4011.847" stopTime="4013.479">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    --wouldn't you want to reserve something higher?

    Mr. Laurence H. Tribe 
    --Something higher.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="4013.720" stopTime="4016.121">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    So then would we have to have super strict--
speaker="laurence_h_tribe" startTime="4016.121" stopTime="4076.682">
    Mr. Laurence H. Tribe 
    Per se invalidity I would want to reserve for that. 
    I would want to say that there are some bans on speech that no justification could sustain, but it's only an accident of the half-hour I think that a lot of time we spent on content-based. 
    Remember the fundamental point, this law doesn't fit at all. 
    It's not only not narrowly tailored, it's completely untailored to any legitimate governmental objective. 
    If the Court ruled, as it did in Edenfield and Ibanez, and Turner, and Coors, this law is a lot worse than any of those. 
    It is positively counterproductive, and this Third Report and Order, which is sort of like Gertrude Stein's Oakland... I mean, you look at it and there's no there there... it doesn't promise anything. 
    It just says, you know, now that we have this case, we want to be speech friendly. 
    Maybe we'll do something if you give us a chance. 
    But as Justice Kennedy suggested, what they promised to do, you know, makes me worry a little bit, because it's to exercise a blank check authority over speech, and that's--

   Rebuttal of Lawrence G. Wallace
speaker="lawrence_g_wallace" startTime="4080.454" stopTime="4211.020">
    Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace 
    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 
    The time, place, and manner cases in this Court, the model intermediate scrutiny cases often have involved direct restraints on speech, as such Heffron v. Krishna Consciousness, Ward v. Rock Against Racism, Taxpayers for Vincent are all examples of that, and as long as there were other opportunities, as we have shown here, content-neutral regulation for a nonspeech purpose, they met intermediate scrutiny. 
    Now, we're not talking about the remote future when we're talking about video dial tone with the capacity to carry three, four, or five providers and not just the telephone company. 
    We have already had in place in DeKalb County, Georgia, in Fairfax and Arlington Counties, Virginia, model trial runs of it in which there have been about 200 channels and the phone company was restricted to 50 percent or less as the provider of programming, the others having to be leased out, and a more permanent one is to begin soon in Dover, New Jersey, a small community, where all of the programming will be provided by others than the telephone company because the regulations are not yet in place that will permit the telephone company to participate. 
    What is really at stake in many of the contentions being made here is the contention that the phone company should have autonomy over all its lines to be the sole user or to control who can use it, a form of asking for what Solicitor General Fried used to call Lochnerizing the First Amendment--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="4211.020" stopTime="4238.411">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    I don't think he's saying that. 
    You know, I was worried about that, too, but I asked the question whether you could keep the phone company out of the business of video programming, and he said that's a totally different question. 
    That's not what you've done here if you say you have to be a common carrier, and if you're a common carrier you cannot do any video programming, any... you know, you can't do what cable does. 
    If it was structural like that, he says that's a different case.

    Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace
