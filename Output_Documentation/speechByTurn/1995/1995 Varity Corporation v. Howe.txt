    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    This is basically an ERISA case in which a group of employees said that the employer had tricked them out of their benefits. 
    The way this trick worked was that the employer had a lot of losing assets in different corporations and his idea was to transfer them all into one sub-corporation which then might go bankrupt and all his bad debts would be gotten rid off. 
    One set of bad debts were the promises that he made to his employees to pay their medical benefits but in order to make the transfer, he had to get their consent, and what he did was have people tell that the set of stories about how marvelous this new corporation would be which according to the employees in the court was all untrue. 
    They shifted, the corporation went bankrupt, they lost their non-pension benefits and they brought suit. 
    Now, that was the very bad activity on the employer’s part, but the issue before use as whether or not it violated ERISA, the Employment Retirement Income Security Act, and to answer that question, we have to deal with three legal questions. 
    The first is, Was the employer, when he made all these statements to the employees about how marvelous this corporation would be, speaking his capacity as employer or speaking in his capacity as the fiduciary under ERISA. 
    We decided that after looking at all of the records that in fact, he was speaking in relevant part in his capacity as ERISA fiduciary, so that so far is under the Act. 
    The second part question was, whether or not this activity, namely telling a lot of false stories, violated his fiduciary duty under ERISA, and we have concluded that it did violate a fiduciary duty. 
    And the third which is even more technical was, whether or not the employees could bring a lawsuit under a particular provision of ERISA that allowed people participant in programs to obtain an appropriate equitable relief to redress violations of ERISA. 
    Now you would have thought that answer would obviously be yes because that is what the language said but it was not that clear because of other cases in their Court and because of other sections of the Act that suggested only a plan to bring a lawsuit under that provision rather employees themselves. 
    Well after going through it, we concluded that this provision in fact did allow employees themselves also to bring suit for violation for fiduciary obligations. though we do not think that holding opens ERISA to all kinds of lawsuits for fiduciary violations for all kinds of activities because of certain limiting principles that we have written into the opinion. 
    Therefore we affirm the Lower Court's decision that the employees could bring this lawsuit. 
    Justice Thomas has filed a dissenting opinion which Justice O’Connor and Justice Scalia have joined.
