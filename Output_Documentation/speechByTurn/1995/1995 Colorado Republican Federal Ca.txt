    We'll hear argument now in Number 95-489, the Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Committee v. Federal Election Commission. 
    Mr. Baran. 
    Is that correct pronunciation?

    Mr. Baran.

    Mr. Jan W. Baran 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court: 
    The Colorado Republican Party, like any party, has a lot to say about issues and candidates, but when it starts talking about congressional issues and congressional candidates it becomes subject to a Federal law that limits that type of core political speech. 
    From the inception of this case, the Colorado Republican Party has asked that this Federal law, section 441a(d)(3), be declared unconstitutional because it needlessly prevents our speech, speech that we are ready, willing, and able to engage in. 
    The FEC has also accused my client of violating this statute by virtue of financing a radio advertisement known as Wirth Facts Number 1. 
    The FEC would like my client punished for this alleged violation. 
    Thus, this case presents two important issues to the Court. 
    The first issue was alluded to in this Court's opinion in Buckley v. Valeo 20 years ago. 
    At issue is, does the First Amendment permit Congress to limit a political party's speech, including speech that contains express advocacy in support of the party's own candidates? 
    If this Court upholds such a limit, then the second issue is raised, which is, are political parties entitled, at the very least, to clear guidance as to which of its speech is subject to a spending limit and which speech is not?

    Justice O'Connor 
    Well, Mr. Baran, I thought there was another possible question here, which is whether the statute as presently drafted covers this expenditure at all. 
    One could... this was an advertisement, as I understand it, paid for by the Colorado political committee at a time when there was no Republican nominee for the Senate and, indeed, not officially a Democratic nominee, and one could read 441a(d) as not covering that at all. 
    Now, what if we think that's the situation? 
    Do we reach some constitutional issue, or can we just say, gee, the statute doesn't cover it, and we'll postpone those bigger issues for an occasion when it does?

    Mr. Jan W. Baran 
    --Yes, there are limits. 
    They were imposed on parties in the 1976 amendments. 
    There is a $5,000 annual limit on any individual or political committee contribution to my client, the State party. 
    There is a category of national party committees that have a higher limit, $20,000. 
    All of those contributions from any individual are further subject to an annual $25,000 limit, so if, in the hypothetical case that's been advanced in some of the briefs, an individual contributed $20,000 to a national party committee, that individual may not contribute more than $5,000 additional dollars through the rest of the year for all political purposes relating to Federal elections.

    It does remain under your theory that... you say the political party is unique. 
    In response to Justice Scalia's question, it's different from a PAC because you nominate candidates. 
    Suppose four or five PAC's put up a candidate in a primary and backed that candidate for the party, and maybe the institutional party leaders might prefer someone else. 
    Why couldn't it be said that they are nominating a candidate? 
    I'm not... I'd like you to just explore for me a little bit more this distinction you make between the party on the one hand and the PAC on the other, because you see, where your reasoning would take us, it could very well be that we'd have to strike down the limits on spending by PAC's as well.

    Mr. Jan W. Baran 
    I don't believe that is the case, Justice Kennedy. 
    A political party is separately defined. 
    It has to meet separate criteria legally. 
    Not only in the Federal Election Campaign Act, but under virtually every State law, there are provisions that specify what a party is, and a party obviously has to have some continuity, and it must have some demonstration of support. 
    It must have nominated candidates, which candidates then have attracted some level of voter support and, in fact, if that doesn't happen, the parties either as a practical matter go out of existence, or under virtually every State law, whoever they nominate do not automatically qualify for the ballot, so there is an entire statutory body of law at both the Federal and State level that deals with parties differently. 
    And that difference is accountable for the fact that, unlike any other group, they join together, they call themselves something, they select their members to run for office, and they present them to the public. 
    And what this statute does is, it says, well, once you have done all that, and you want to tell not just the public but you want to even tell party members why they should support the candidates you have nominated, the Federal law says you can only do it up to a limit, and thereafter you have to stop--
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="1197.188" stopTime="1214.029">

    But maybe it should work the other way. 
    If the party has all those attributes of what we can loosely call a State actor, perhaps it should be subject to more restrictions, quite properly so, than a group of citizens who form a PAC.

    Mr. Jan W. Baran 
    Well, each group is going to have to be evaluated in terms of how they relate to the compelling Government interest that is being advanced to justify what everyone has to acknowledge is a restriction on our speech, and to that extent, is the relationship of a political party in terms of its activities different than that of a PAC, is it different from that of a corporation or a union or an individual contributor? 
    And our position is that the answer has to be yes, it clearly is different, and why is because their whole purpose for being is to engage in political activity, to advance a common philosophy, and to nominate candidates who necessarily are part of the party. 
    They're party members, and we present them. 
    Now, what the statute then does is says, well, unlike even corporations, unlike unions, unlike any other association in America, when it comes to communicating on political issues with your own members, you become subject to this limit and, in addition, if you start communicating--

    Mr. Jan W. Baran 
    --I believe that we are. 
    In fact, we would be better off if we called ourselves a union and called every member of the Republican Party a union member. 
    Then we would be able to spend unlimited, undisclosed amounts of money in our partisan communications with our members and then, in addition, we could then, as a union party, create a political action commission... committee which in addition can then raise voluntary donations to fund those political activities which may include unlimited independent expenditures. 
    What I have just described is speech activity that is provided to that element of unions or corporations with respect to their stockholders and management, but comes subject to this limit. 
    Nobody else is in the predicament where they have no alternative, legally, to some form of unlimited partisan expression, either with their core constituency of members or with respect to the public in general, as would be the case with independent expenditures.

   Argument of Drew S. Days, III
speaker="drew_s_days_iii" startTime="1473.367" stopTime="1551.089">
    Mr. Drew S. Days, III 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    I wanted to take a few minutes to just clarify the scheme that's at work here under the campaign act. 
    Under the act, an expenditure is defined as something that's extended for purposes of influencing an election, and expenditures are considered coordinated expenditures where a political party is concerned, and if they are coordinated expenditures, then they are viewed as contributions, which would then be covered by the contribution limits and the doctrines that this Court has announced. 
    The petitioners have accepted this scheme, and accepted that their expenditures should be viewed as coordinated expenditures, so they've accepted this as a theoretical matter. 
    But I would like to point out also that on this record there's evidence of actual coordinated expenditures. 
    The party chairman in this case admitted that even though there wasn't a Republican candidate at the time, that he was coordinating with all three Republican candidates, and certainly the Federal Election Commission has held for some years--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1551.089" stopTime="1560.295">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    If there was no candidate... you say there was no candidate nominated, but the party chairman was coordinating with all three candidates.
speaker="drew_s_days_iii" startTime="1560.295" stopTime="1561.114">
    Mr. Drew S. Days, III 
    --That's right.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1561.114" stopTime="1562.867">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    You mean putative candidates, or--
speaker="drew_s_days_iii" startTime="1562.867" stopTime="1571.873">
    Mr. Drew S. Days, III 
    No, they were candidates for the nomination of the party to run for the Senate against the already declared Democratic candidate.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1571.873" stopTime="1578.726">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    --So the Republican Party in power had not nominated anyone, but several people were angling, or seeking the nomination.
speaker="drew_s_days_iii" startTime="1578.726" stopTime="1635.116">
    Mr. Drew S. Days, III 
    That's correct, and the Federal Election Commission has pointed out that there's nothing in the act that requires that there have been a nominee selected before this principle applies. 
    The statute itself refers to candidates, it does not refer to nominees, and there are parts of the statute where the Congress has used nominee when it intended to make that point. 
    That's not the case in this particular situation. 
    So we're... in analyzing this particular situation, faced with a coordinated expenditure that is a contribution, it's a form of contribution, it strikes us that the petitioners have refused to accept, Justice Ginsburg, the distinction that this Court has drawn for many, many years, since Buckley, between limiting contributions and limiting expenditures. 
    As this Court has said, there's a fundamental constitutional difference between--

    Mr. Drew S. Days, III 
    My reading of that, given what the Federal Election Commission has done up to this point, is that that would not be viewed as covered by this particular provision. 
    The fact that Wirth might at some point become a candidate does not mean that the party can't comment on issues that affect his discharging of his responsibilities as a representative of Colorado, or a district in Colorado in the United States House of Representatives.

    Mr. Drew S. Days, III 
    Well, Justice Ginsburg, I don't know whether there's any precise temporal point, but one can imagine an ad run by the party with respect to Tim Wirth that says, we disagree with Tim Wirth's position and by the way, he's likely to run for the Senate and therefore we want you to know about this. 
    It seems to me that the inclusion, even though it might be out of the structure of the election framework, would nevertheless be focused on an election, and that's one of the things that's important about this particular ad, Wirth Facts Number 1. 
    It not only talks about Tim Wirth's positions with respect to defense and the balanced budget, it makes specific reference to the fact that he's running for the Senate. 
    It struck the Commission that this was not a difference in degree, but a difference in kind insofar as the act was concerned.

    Mr. Drew S. Days, III 
    --Yes, but I think, Justice O'Connor, what the Federal Election Commission has done in interpreting the act has 1) concluded that any expenditures are coordinated expenditures and are contributions, and then what we have in 4a(d)(3) is really an authorization for the parties to spend more money than any other entity can, or it could under the regular provisions of the act. 
    That is, in this case, it could have spent $100,000, the Republican Party, the petitioners, but decided not to do that, so the contribution limit is one that has to be evaluated using the principles that this Court has announced in Buckley and other cases, and what we are arguing is that Congress' limitation on contributions by political parties is consistent with that norm. 
    Although parties and candidates may share some agreement, there's no reason to think that if, as the petitioners want, there would be unlimited contributions made by the party, that that might not stimulate corruption, or at least the appearance of corruption. 
    And secondly, if this were an open spigot, so to speak, there might be room for evasion of the individual limits, as this Court was concerned about in Buckley, with respect to the--

    But if you ask people on the street what do you mean when you say the general election campaign has started, I think you would say, a lot of people would say, well, it's when the two major parties have chosen their candidates.

    --Yes, I think that's correct, and I mentioned the point that it mentions candidates, not nominees. 
    I wanted to turn, if I may, to the point that was made about whether this Court has to reach the constitutional issue. 
    It strikes us that what the petitioners are presenting if, indeed, they win on the view that 4a(d)(3), 441a(d)(3) should not apply is highly theoretical. 
    This is a political party committee that has never shown an inclination to spend as much money as the statute allows. 
    Indeed, it's turned back the money on each instance in which it's given that money, so it strikes us that the Court would not have to reach the constitutional issue, and as was suggested by you, Justice O'Connor, wait for another day to resolve this larger issue of its constitutionality.

    Yes. 
    I think that we would then turn to 441a(a), which is the basic statutory provision with respect to contributions and therefore, even if 441a(d)(3) or a(d) were out of the picture, we would nevertheless, if this were a coordinated contribution, have to go back to the central statute.

    Mr. Drew S. Days, III 
    But going to this question of corruption, the Court has never concluded, nor did Congress, that for example, family members would be likely to seek undue influence with their own family members but nevertheless upheld the limitation on contributions by family members to their own sons and daughters and wives and husbands. 
    So the point is not necessarily that there would be actual corruption, but the appearance of corruption, and I think that the... what the statute reflects and what this Court's decisions reflect is that there is a significant corruptive potential in large amounts of money. 
    That is--

    Mr. Jan W. Baran 
    I'm too sensitive to perhaps the jargon of some, and I don't mean you, Justice Souter, that, you know, having clout is a pejorative term, and it does allow them to say more and hopefully to have more persuasive effect. 
    I would point out that with respect to this assertion that this spending is highly theoretical, the record is fairly clear that with respect to the 1986 election cycle the Colorado party spent $1.1 million for all of its activities, so it is theoretically possible, was then, is today, to spend money, if that were the party's decision, for the type of speech in excess of the limits as provided here. 
    With respect to when an individual is a candidate, which is a very important question raised by Justice Ginsburg, I point out that the definition of a candidate in the Federal Election Campaign Act is any individual who has raised or spent more than $5,000 in campaign funds. 
    That means that every person across a street is a candidate under the act almost the day after election and, in fact, Congressman Wirth, before he became a candidate for the Senate, was, prior to that time, between 1984... the 1984 election and up to the point where he declared his candidacy for the Senate, he was a candidate for reelection to the House of Representatives.
