United States v. Winstar Corporation

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    We'll hear argument first this morning in Number 95-865, The United States v. Winstar Corporation. 
    Mr. Bender.
speaker="paul_bender" startTime="9.136" stopTime="136.270">
    Mr. Paul Bender 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    In 1989, Congress enacted FIRREA, the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act in an attempt to deal with the calamity... one might more accurately say catastrophe... that had befallen the savings and loan or thrift industry in the United States during the decade of the 1980's largely because of a rise in interest rates at the beginning of the 1980's and then because of the risks that S&amp;L owners took in order to make more money to deal with the losses that were caused by the rise in interest rates. 
    S&amp;L's are invested in... were invested in long term low interest things, mortgages. 
    Primarily when interest rates go up their profit and loss picture tends to go down if they're stuck with those long-term debts. 
    During that decade, about a sixth of all the S&amp;L's in the United States, about 500, had to either be closed or absorbed into other S&amp;L's because they were insolvent, because they failed. 
    That accelerated at the end of the eighties. 
    About half of those failures occurred in 1987 and 1988. 
    The costs of that failure are enormous. 
    The cost in money to the insurance fund... which is in turn, was in turn mostly financed by premiums that the banks had to pay, and so when the insurance fund loses the banks have to pay more premiums, and that spirals the losses... the cost to the insurance fund was over $40 billion in those closings. 
    The cost in public confidence in the industry is probably even greater. 
    Still we are familiar with runs on banks and what that can cause, and when large numbers of institutes, one in six, have to start being closed, there is an enormous problem of possibly failing public confidence. 
    The public at the end of the eighties had $1.3 trillion invested in S&amp;L's, and S&amp;L's in turn are there because Congress put them there in order to help the housing market, and the housing industry, and make housing affordable.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="136.270" stopTime="152.802">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    And I gather before FIRREA was even passed, the executive branch was concerned about this problem and induced some solvent banks to take on their backs some insolvent banks in order to prevent them from failing. 
    Isn't that what this is all about?
speaker="paul_bender" startTime="152.802" stopTime="156.424">
    Mr. Paul Bender 
    It's not clear who induced whom in these transactions.
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="156.424" stopTime="165.220">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    Oh, I see. 
    I thought they did it in order to save the Congress from having to appropriate more money to pay the depositors who would have lost money.
speaker="paul_bender" startTime="165.220" stopTime="198.240">
    Mr. Paul Bender 
    They did it for a number of reasons. 
    It was the policy of the Federal bank regulators during the 1980's to close as few banks as possible and to have them absorbed into other banks because the insurance fund had a limited amount of money, and if that money runs out, Congress either has to appropriate money, which it has very rarely done, or the premiums have to be raised on the insurances. 
    The fund is primarily funded by premiums that the banks pay. 
    The banks have to pay more premiums. 
    The problem that you have of losses becomes even greater. 
    The policy, then, was to try to keep the banks alive.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="198.240" stopTime="210.258">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    In any case, whoever induced whom by doing what these banks did, the claims on the insurance fund were drastically reduced. 
    They were eliminated with respect to every one of these failing banks, I take it.
speaker="paul_bender" startTime="210.258" stopTime="212.551">
    Mr. Paul Bender 
    That's true, for a while they were reduced--
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="212.551" stopTime="212.890">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    Yes.
speaker="paul_bender" startTime="212.890" stopTime="216.693">
    Mr. Paul Bender 
    --but the danger was created, and it happened within that decade.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="216.693" stopTime="221.445">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    They were reduced until... the problem in effect was deferred until FIRREA was passed.
speaker="paul_bender" startTime="221.445" stopTime="245.351">
    Mr. Paul Bender 
    Well, the problem reappeared before FIRREA was passed, because if one bank, if one S&amp;L absorbs another, which has happened in one of these three cases, and the other two people came into the industry who hadn't been in it before, and took over a failing thrift, they then often take great risks. 
    Those risks may turn out not to be profitable. 
    They then... the larger entity may then fail, and that was what was happening at the end of the eighties.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="245.351" stopTime="245.972">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    But one of--
speaker="paul_bender" startTime="245.972" stopTime="253.137">
    Mr. Paul Bender 
    Don't assume that just because one bank is absorbed by another that deals with the problem. 
    That's a way of putting the problem off.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="253.137" stopTime="256.971">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    --One of those risks was the object of the contracts in these three cases.
speaker="paul_bender" startTime="256.971" stopTime="342.985">
    Mr. Paul Bender 
    I want to talk about the contracts in these three cases, but I think the right context to talk about it in is the context of what Congress did and why they did it in FIRREA and whether that amounted to a breach of any promise that had been made. 
    What Congress did in 1989 to deal with... to try to deal with the crisis, they did a number of different things. 
    They, for example, for the first time invested an enormous amount of money in the fund, $100 billion to try to increase public confidence and make the money available. 
    The thing they did that's most relevant, or directly relevant to this case, is, the reason banks become insolvent is because they lack capital. 
    I mean, that's almost a truism. 
    These banks that... the regulators during the eighties had permitted banks to continue to exist with zero or negative capital by counting things like the goodwill involved in this case as capital. 
    It's not capital, it's a fantasy. 
    It's actually a loss that's on the books of the bank you acquire, but they... you're right, that by... the strategy was to not close the banks, and in order to do that they permitted them to count as capital things that were not capital. 
    That is a very risky situation, because... a number of reasons. 
    The people who own those banks, if they have no capital in them, having nothing to lose by taking risks. 
    They lost everything they have already because they're at a zero stage. 
    They are encouraged to take more risks to make a profitable situation. 
    By taking more risks, there are more failures. 
    When there are more failures--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="342.985" stopTime="346.298">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Well, that was the policy that the Government regulators permitted--
speaker="paul_bender" startTime="346.298" stopTime="347.079">
    Mr. Paul Bender 
    --Right.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="347.079" stopTime="354.821">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    --to occur. 
    I mean, this... they were following Government policy in having that kind of capital--
speaker="paul_bender" startTime="354.821" stopTime="395.758">
    Mr. Paul Bender 
    They were, and the question in this case is, when Congress changed the policy in 1989 to require real capital so that banks would not be operating on zero or negative capital, so that the owners of the banks would have something at stake... several reasons for requiring real capital. 
    The owners have something at stake. 
    They're less likely to take risks. 
    There's a cushion there, also. 
    If a bank has $10 million in real capital it can absorb $10 million in losses before becoming insolvent. 
    If it doesn't have that, it can't do that. 
    Congress decided, as one of the many different things it did in FIRREA as a way of dealing with this was to require real capital, require a minimum amount of real capital as a safety feature.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="395.758" stopTime="409.930">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    --Well, Mr. Bender-- 
    --And this was-- 
    --No, go ahead. 
    And... I was going to say, and this event, I take it it is fair to say, was exactly the event that the parties assumed might happen when they made their contracts.
speaker="paul_bender" startTime="409.930" stopTime="415.183">
    Mr. Paul Bender 
    Exactly. 
    Congress had changed capital standards many times over the years.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="415.183" stopTime="441.980">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    Doesn't that fact defeat the Government's attempt to bring this case essentially under the impossibility doctrine, because the impossibility doctrine, if I understand it, assumes that the parties assume that the event that did happen was not something that was going to happen. 
    They both had made an assumption that was false, whereas in this case, it seems to me, each party had made the very assumption that turned out to be true.
speaker="paul_bender" startTime="441.980" stopTime="445.553">
    Mr. Paul Bender 
    You mean... by the impossibility doctrine you're referring to the sovereign acts doctrine?
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="445.553" stopTime="448.425">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    Well, I think sovereign acts is an element of it, yes--
speaker="paul_bender" startTime="448.425" stopTime="449.154">
    Mr. Paul Bender 
    But where the Government--
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="449.154" stopTime="473.710">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    --but the one... I mean, I think sovereign acts makes sense within the concept of an impossibility defense, and I think the impossibility defense, I understand it, rests upon the assumption that the act or event that makes it impossible to perform, and hence excuses performance, is an act or event which each party assumed would not happen, whereas in this case, each party assumed that it might very well--
speaker="paul_bender" startTime="473.710" stopTime="474.721">
    Mr. Paul Bender 
    --It might very well happen. 
    I think--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="474.721" stopTime="478.673">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    --Mr. Bender, are you relying on impossibility or unmistakability?
speaker="paul_bender" startTime="478.673" stopTime="482.856">
    Mr. Paul Bender 
    --We're relying on the fact that there was no promise here--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="482.856" stopTime="484.466">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    The unmistakability doctrine?
speaker="paul_bender" startTime="484.466" stopTime="499.637">
    Mr. Paul Bender 
    --The unmistakability doctrine is a doctrine of construction of a contract, and that doctrine... we don't think that doctrine needs to be used here at all. 
    If you just read the contracts... I'll get to that in a second... there is no promise such as the plaintiffs say. 
    I think... let's talk about what the plaintiffs are claiming. 
    The plaintiffs claim--
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="499.637" stopTime="510.436">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    Well, may I... just before you leave the... my question is... I take it your answer is yes, we... each side was assuming that this might very well happen, and this was part of the object of contracting.
speaker="paul_bender" startTime="510.436" stopTime="521.611">
    Mr. Paul Bender 
    --Right, and because of that, these contracts should be read and are only sensibly read as not making the promise that the plaintiffs say they make, namely a promise that that wouldn't change.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="521.611" stopTime="527.686">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    Well, no, it wasn't necessarily a promise that that wouldn't change. 
    It was a promise about what would happen to these banks if it did change.
speaker="paul_bender" startTime="527.686" stopTime="542.487">
    Mr. Paul Bender 
    The promise that they allege is either that Congress would not toughen capital requirements to increase the required solvency, or that if it did, these banks would be exempted from that, and the issue in this case is whether there is a promise like that.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="542.487" stopTime="567.701">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    And you want to convince us that these bankers and lawyers who signed this agreement put themselves in a visibly insolvent state at a time when there was clearly a crisis in the S&amp;L industry and Congress was clearly going to take some action, visibly put themselves in an insolvent condition without any commitment on the part of the Government to not count that against them for purpose of shutting them down.
speaker="paul_bender" startTime="567.701" stopTime="569.863">
    Mr. Paul Bender 
    Without any--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="569.863" stopTime="571.014">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    I mean, it is so utterly implausible--
speaker="paul_bender" startTime="571.014" stopTime="612.792">
    Mr. Paul Bender 
    --No, it's not. 
    No, it's not implausible at all. 
    There was a tremendous amount of money to be made in this industry. 
    These people were taking a risk. 
    Take Winstar. 
    They invested $2 million of their own money. 
    In return for that $2 million they got an enormous amount of assets that they could lend out, and Congress had loosened the restrictions on what they could lend it to, that they could lend out on risky ventures. 
    They were risking their $2 million, but the leveraging that they were getting was enormous. 
    They could have made enormous profits. 
    Glendale, for example, turned a very large profit during that time by doing... by taking on an insolvent institution, because Glendale got an institution with a tremendous number of assets in a totally new market, a booming market where they hoped they could lend out a lot of money--
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="612.792" stopTime="621.047">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    --At a time when not only they but-- 
    --When you say assets, I... when you say assets, I assume you mean deposits which are really, in effect, a liability, as everyone knows.
speaker="paul_bender" startTime="621.047" stopTime="626.731">
    Mr. Paul Bender 
    --Right, but they... the assets are the loans, not the deposits. 
    The deposits are the liabilities.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="626.731" stopTime="647.634">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    I find it very difficult to believe that if these documents had contained a clause that said that the Government, or FSLIC, reserves the right to change capital requirements and not to count this goodwill, that these parties would have executed the agreement. 
    I just don't believe that would have happened.
speaker="paul_bender" startTime="647.634" stopTime="649.875">
    Mr. Paul Bender 
    If the contract said the Government--

    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    If the contract had had a clause specifically allowing the Government to do what it's done in this case, it is impossible for me to believe that the parties would have entered into the transaction.
speaker="paul_bender" startTime="658.781" stopTime="681.216">
    Mr. Paul Bender 
    --I would look at that a different way. 
    If it is so vital to these acquirers that they be guaranteed that they can continue to count this capital even though Congress changes the rules to require real capital rather than phony capital, if it's so important to them, you would think that they would get a promise to that effect. 
    There is no promise here anything like that.

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well, isn't that where the unmistakability doctrine comes in, that people are not entitled to deal with the Government on assumptions of their own, or what reasonable people might say, it has to be unmistakable, not just what a reasonable person would--

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    The provision in the Winstar agreement... I think it's the Winstar one. 
    The Statesman agreement. 
    It says... it's on page 23 of the... set forth in full on page 23 of the Winstar brief. 
    It says, in the case of any ambiguity in the interpretation or construction of any provision of this agreement, such ambiguity shall be resolved in a manner consistent with such regulations, that is, including future regulations, and the bank board's resolution or action relating to the acquisition, the mergers, or of this agreement. 
    If there is a conflict, it says, between such regulations, which would mean future regulations, and the bank board's resolution or action relating to the acquisitions, the mergers, or this agreement, the bank board's resolution or actions shall govern.

    There's a serious problem whether a forbearance letter should be deemed to be a promise by the Government that... because the letter isn't in the agreement. 
    Winstar... all these banks signed agreements. 
    These provisions aren't in those agreements, but let's look at the letter and assume it is a promise.

    What's wrong with Statesman?

    Mr. Paul Bender 
    I agree with your interpretation of that, Justice Scalia. 
    The important thing, though, is to look at the regulation or document or promise that Statesman says constitutes a promise to them that, even if Congress were to raise capital requirements, make them stronger, require real capital, that even if that were to happen, they could continue to count this nonreal capital for, in the Statesman's case, I think it was 25 years. 
    That just doesn't exist. 
    There is no promise like that. 
    The closest they have is with regard to capital credits, which are a different form of goodwill, and that's what is on page 362a of the Joint Appendix.

    Only in that situation.

    Mr. Paul Bender 
    --No, there are two kinds of promises that they are alleging, that they could allege that would win. 
    One is that Congress won't do it, and the other is that if Congress did it, it would exempt them from the regulation, and no, I can't think of a promise like that, and it doesn't surprise me.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="993.512" stopTime="1017.828">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    So, but-- 
    --Isn't there a third possibility, Mr. Bender, that even if they are not exempted in the sense of being able to enforce their agreement specifically to allow them to act contrary to the regulation, isn't there a third possibility, and that is that the risk of loss if that happens falls on the Government, not on them, and that's why it seems to me important that we're dealing with a damages action here rather than an action for specific performance.
speaker="paul_bender" startTime="1017.828" stopTime="1033.617">
    Mr. Paul Bender 
    I don't think so, Justice Souter, because the unmistakability doctrine is a doctrine of how you interpret contracts. 
    That's the question in this case. 
    Did the Government make a promise that these people would be exempted from future tightening of capital requirements in the S&amp;L industry?
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="1033.617" stopTime="1058.153">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    Yes, but in each case, the question, I suppose, is, is it unmistakable that they either: 
    a) promised that Congress wouldn't do it? 
    Of course not. 
    b) That if Congress did it, they would be specifically exempt from the application of the regulation? 
    Probably not. 
    Or c), that if Congress did do it, the risk of whatever the added cost would be would have to be borne by the Government and not by them?
speaker="paul_bender" startTime="1058.153" stopTime="1059.395">
    Mr. Paul Bender 
    That would have to be unmistakable--
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="1059.395" stopTime="1074.926">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    And what may be unmist... I mean, what might be necessary to show unmistakability in case one, which is virtually impossible, or two, unlikely, may, in fact, be quite enough in case three, if we're talking about a contract which is reasonably read simply to shift a risk.
speaker="paul_bender" startTime="1074.926" stopTime="1078.728">

    Justice David H. Souter 
    --Yes, but you're saying in the same breadth that FSLIC had no authority in any effective way to continue to do that, because FSLIC would be overruled by any change in legislation, and if it was so overruled, the risk of that overruling never shifted from the three banks here to the Government.

    That's not much of an agreement.

    Mr. Paul Bender 
    --was that as long as the law permits this to be treated as capital for satisfying capitalization requirements, you can do certain things with it. 
    You can put it on your books, and the most important thing that went on, coming back to the Winstar agreement, for example... they all have elements of this in them... at that time, this capital, under existing accounting regulations, would have had to be amortized over the period that was the same as the average life of the deposits that the banks had. 
    And even though mortgages are like, 30-year mortgages or 15-year mortgages, the average life of those is about 10 years, so under the accounting principles at the time, this goodwill that they got would have had to be amortized over 10 years, which would mean they'd have to take one-tenth of it off each year. 
    The Winstar forbearance letter said, we forbear from applying that. 
    You can do it over 35 years, a much longer period of time, much more to the benefit of them. 
    That was a promise that was made.

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    So no promise at all even with respect to their own changing of their own regulations the next day?
speaker="paul_bender" startTime="1406.512" stopTime="1463.920">
    Mr. Paul Bender 
    Right, because at that time Congress had delegated to them the primary... Justice Scalia, think of a hypothetical that's I think a lot like this. 
    Suppose that hospitals were acting in unsafe ways, and a number of them had to close because of the large number of claims upon them. 
    The hospital regulatory agency decided that the way to try to deal with that, because we needed the hospitals, was to have other hospitals absorb them and promise to maintain certain minimum safety regulations as a condition of absorbing them, and suppose they signed contracts like, to do that. 
    Say it was a condition of this you're going to have to have this many nurses, this many operating rooms, this many this and this many that. 
    After that happens, hospitals continue to have real safety problems, and in the next 5 years there are lots of suits against them, lots of people are injured or die, and the legislature decides to increase those safety requirements. 
    Would anybody want to read a contract that said, you can do this if you meet these minimum safety requirements?
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="1463.920" stopTime="1480.210">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Certainly not, because there's no relationship between the safety requirements and the risk of insolvency which the hospitals have acquired by taking these hospitals that are being sued upon their back. 
    Mr. Bender-- 
    --Here, there is such a relationship.
speaker="paul_bender" startTime="1480.210" stopTime="1486.804">
    Mr. Paul Bender 
    I wasn't talking about the insolvency there. 
    I was talking about the safety problem.

    Here, the Government--

    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    Are you saying, Mr. Bender, that FSLIC was powerless to include the terms that the respondents now claim is a necessary part of their contract?

    Mr. Paul Bender

    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    There was no way... there was no form of language, there was no provision that FSLIC was authorized to include which would reach the result that these respondents seek here?

    Mr. Paul Bender 
    --Insofar as what they seek is to say... when you say reach the result, you mean that they get... that they--

    Mr. Paul Bender 
    --No, I'm sorry, I take that back. 
    If all you're asking about is the remedy that they could... that they could, for example, get the--
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="1525.040" stopTime="1547.055">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    --I'm asking about FSLIC's authority to make the contract that the respondents here assert was made. 
    Are you saying that FSLIC could... if all of this had been on the table in the bargaining session, if we had known about this problem, that FSLIC would have been powerless to include a provision that gives them the relief they now want?
speaker="paul_bender" startTime="1547.055" stopTime="1591.932">
    Mr. Paul Bender 
    --No, they wouldn't have been powerless to include a provision that gives them the relief they want. 
    If the relief they want, for example, is return of their investment, FSLIC would have been able to put in a provision saying if the capital rules change within the next 10 years, you can get your invest... you can wash out the agreement and get your investment back. 
    That's not what the... what is involved in this case. 
    What's involved in this case is a claim that the contract was made that they would be exempted from any changes in the capital requirements, and they're asking not just to get that money back, they're asking for breach of contract damages. 
    There is a possibility in this case, and they have made these claims... they're not involved in this proceeding. 
    This is just the breach of contract part. 
    There is a possibility of them arguing frustration of purpose. 
    If, for example, Justice Scalia, the next day they will close down, I would think that would be a very powerful claim. 
    That--
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="1591.932" stopTime="1618.110">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    But Mr. Bender, isn't your answer predicated on the fact not that they would be able to get their investment back by suing on their contract, they would be able to get their investment back on the theory that the contract was a nullity, and if that's the answer... I don't think that's the answer... I don't think that's the point of Justice Kennedy's question, because you're still... you're not saying that they would have authority to make a contract. 
    You're saying that the law would give them restitution if the contract turned out to be a nullity.

    Justice David H. Souter 
    So you're still in the position of saying... I think the answer to Justice Kennedy's question on your position is, it would have been ultra vires for them to do that.
speaker="paul_bender" startTime="1625.594" stopTime="1668.231">
    Mr. Paul Bender 
    No, I think if there had been a provision in the contract saying what the law would probably give anyway... that is, if the contract's frustrated you can get your investment back... that would not have been ultra vires. 
    That... I really need to stress that. 
    That is not what they're arguing here. 
    They are arguing that they had a contract that they should be excluded from the changes in capital regulations, and that they have a right to breach of contract damages, which are more than just getting their money back. 
    It is the profit that they would have made in the future. 
    If they bring... brought a suit for frustration of purpose, either on the theory of implied frustration in the contract or Justice Kennedy's example of an explicit frustration of purpose provision, which I think... I'm sorry if I misspoke before. 
    I think that is a provision that could have been included in these contracts... that's a different case.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="1668.231" stopTime="1688.617">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Mr. Bender, isn't any contract, not only by the Government but by a private person, subject to the condition which you say this must have been subject to, namely, if what I have promised becomes unlawful, of course I won't do it? 
    I mean, to say that this agency, if it was a promise, would have been conditioned upon that, is to say what every contract is conditioned upon.
speaker="paul_bender" startTime="1688.617" stopTime="1701.583">
    Mr. Paul Bender 
    I thought Justice Kennedy's example and Justice Souter's example were more than that. 
    It was not that, I won't do it. 
    It's that, one of the parties will get their money back, which is what the frustration of purpose doctrine I think would do in this case, or the provision that Justice Kennedy mentioned.

    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    What Mr. Bender refers to and what his reply brief referred to, and it did so by referencing a law review article in a 1993 Government report, is a hypothesized thrift which does not exist on this record. 
    It's this Court's purpose now to determine what the intent of the parties was in 1981, and the hypotheticals about what a Government report said the intent of other thrifts besides Glendale was in 1981 are not admissible.

    I mean, as I understand the doctrine, it would mean that even though, if you take the reasonable man theory of contracts, this is what reasonably... that's not enough in this case to hold the Government liable for damages. 
    You have to show something more.

    Mr. Joe G. Hollingsworth 
    Mr. Chief Justice, the unmistakability doctrine requires a clear promise, and clear authority, and interpreting the clear promise, this Court's precedents have held that the Court can look to the plain meaning and can interpret the plain meaning of what the parties intended from the language of the contract and from the circumstances under which the contract was made.

    What the lower court did, however, was find and apply the unmistakability doctrine correctly in accordance with this Court's prior rulings in the cases the Government relies on, and it did so and found that the contract between Glendale and the Government was stated in the, quote, clearest possible terms. 
    They did so in accordance with meeting the requirements of the unmistakability doctrine.

   Argument of Charles J. Cooper
speaker="charles_j_cooper" startTime="2573.452" stopTime="2608.054">
    Mr. Charles J. Cooper 
    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    Justice Scalia, I would like to open by returning to the examination of the contract documents in the tatesman case... I represent Statesman and Winstar... and you earlier referred to page 23 of our brief. 
    I'd like to pick up where you left off, if I may. 
    Justice Scalia, you quoted one of the two sentences that are italicized.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2608.054" stopTime="2610.417">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Are you now reading from page 23 of your brief?
speaker="charles_j_cooper" startTime="2610.417" stopTime="2670.768">
    Mr. Charles J. Cooper 
    Of my brief, yes, Your Honor, and you'll note in the block quote there that the last two sentences of that block quote are italicized. 
    Justice Scalia quoted a sentence that in fact the Government omitted from its discussion of this provision, which is absolutely critical to understanding the importance of this provision. 
    If there is a conflict between such regulations and the bank board's resolution or action relating to the acquisition, the mergers for this agreement, the bank board's resolution or action shall govern. 
    Your Honor, Mr. Bender responded that, well, that means the regulations at the time, not future regulations, and that's why we've also italicized the following sentence: For purposes of this section, the accounting principles in governing regulations shall be those in effect on the effective date as subsequently changed, amended, clarified, or interpreted by the bank board. 
    Your Honor, the parties anticipated this very dispute, and they decided it right then and there at the closing table. 
    They decided among themselves.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="2670.768" stopTime="2725.622">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Mr. Cooper, there's one thing that I'd like you to distinguish for me. 
    There have been, I think, cases involving consent decrees both in the environmental area and the civil rights area, consent decrees signed by the Government and the complaining party, and then when the administration changed, the argument was made, well, yes, the Government, the then-administrators of X agency, signed that document, but that's not the policy of the current administration, and one administration can't bind another to a policy even in a written agreement filed in the court and made a part of a consent judgment. 
    Now, I take it you must regard this situation as entirely discrete from that.
speaker="charles_j_cooper" startTime="2725.622" stopTime="2753.281">
    Mr. Charles J. Cooper 
    Your Honor, I do, because we are not seeking to hold the Government to continue to count our goodwill, to continue to count our capital credit. 
    That is not part of our claim. 
    It couldn't be done now in any event. 
    We're simply suggesting, as Justice Souter, I think, has correctly read this very provision, that it placed the risk... the parties understood that this could happen, but this was a life-and-death term for my clients, and so--
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="2753.281" stopTime="2776.016">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    In other words, in those consent decrees, at least as the Government's argument went, there would be no responsibility on the Government's part. 
    It could walk away from the agreement as if it had never been made. 
    But that's not what you're saying here. 
    You are, of course, recognizing Congress' authority to legislate. 
    However, you're saying my client must get the benefit of the bargain that was made.
speaker="charles_j_cooper" startTime="2776.016" stopTime="2784.631">
    Mr. Charles J. Cooper 
    --The Government can't break this agreement without any cost, exactly. 
    They can't visit on my client's shoulders alone--
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="2784.631" stopTime="2793.088">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Well, that's what... where you're saying there's a difference between at least the argument that was made that the Government could walk away from a consent decree without any cost.
speaker="charles_j_cooper" startTime="2793.088" stopTime="2843.709">
    Mr. Charles J. Cooper 
    --Well, Your Honor, I'm... I suspect that those consent decrees are not involved in the world of commerce, which is what these contracts were involved in. 
    We had the Government acting as an insurer of deposits. 
    It was the one who was on the hook for untold millions of dollars if these thrifts that we took off their hands happened to fail, and they had to pay off the depositors. 
    We came to the table with cash that they wanted. 
    Your Honor, if we had added in the next sentence of this clause that I've been reading to you a liquidated damages clause, surely no one would... I can't imagine the proposition that that would be invalid as well, but of course that is the necessary implication of the Government's argument, and--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="2843.709" stopTime="2853.707">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    What about your other client? 
    Just to be sure that I have... what about the agreement for Winstar?

    Mr. Charles J. Cooper 
    --Yes, Your Honor. 
    Your Honor--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="2854.478" stopTime="2855.457">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    This was the Statesman contract, right?
speaker="charles_j_cooper" startTime="2855.457" stopTime="2856.769">
    Mr. Charles J. Cooper 
    --That's the Statesman contract.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="2856.769" stopTime="2857.370">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    What about Winstar?
speaker="charles_j_cooper" startTime="2857.370" stopTime="2870.498">
    Mr. Charles J. Cooper 
    With respect to this particular provision, Winstar had a virtually identical provision. 
    The wording of the two sentences that I've just read to you is, I think, identical. 
    It's certainly not in any material way different, so--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="2870.498" stopTime="2876.170">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    And what about the bank board's resolution to which this refers? 
    Where does that appear, and how does that close the loop?
speaker="charles_j_cooper" startTime="2876.170" stopTime="2940.475">
    Mr. Charles J. Cooper 
    --Yes, Your Honor. 
    On the next page we've set that out as well, page 24 of our brief, and it carries over to page 25. 
    The block quote begins at the bottom of the page there, and the... the wording, again, that I'd like to call the Court's attention to, this whole provision is key, obviously. 
    It contains in, I think the courts below were quite correct, the clearest possible terms, the nature of the regulatory capital promises that the Government agreed with us that we could rely upon. 
    But the wording that I want to call the Court's attention to is in the first paragraph there. 
    It provides that the acquisition shall be accounted for and shall report to the bank board and the FSLIC in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles as accepted modified, clarified, or interpreted by applicable regulations of the bank board and the FSLIC, okay, so they had to report according to GAAP, except to the extent that their regulations changed GAAP. 
    The next phrase--

    Unknown Speaker 
    From time to time, presumably.
speaker="charles_j_cooper" startTime="2941.136" stopTime="2955.986">
    Mr. Charles J. Cooper 
    --From time to time, but the next phrase, again, is key, indicating we anticipated future changes, except to the extent of the following departures from GAAP, so again... and these departures--

    Mr. Charles J. Cooper 
    --Your Honor, I think it modified the phrasing that went before it. 
    It modifies the--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2963.820" stopTime="2972.055">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Yes, but there's several pieces of phrasing that go before it. 
    Is that except clause, does that modify the entire paragraph, or just the thing that's already excepted?

    Mr. Charles J. Cooper 
    --Your Honor, I think it modifies the entire provision that goes before it. 
    In other words, the parties agreed that GAAP would control unless they regulated a difference in GAAP, but that these particular regulatory promises would remain constant, because again--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="2993.329" stopTime="3001.804">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Now, these provisions are different from those in the contract and agreement of Glendale, I take it?

    Mr. Charles J. Cooper 
    --Your Honor, I think that is true. 
    I don't represent Glendale, but I don't believe that contract has these particular provisions, but--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="3011.471" stopTime="3023.639">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    May I also ask you, do you... have you sought any other relief under the Takings Clause, or have you sought relief by way of rescission of the agreement or anything?
speaker="charles_j_cooper" startTime="3023.639" stopTime="3045.922">
    Mr. Charles J. Cooper 
    --Your Honor, our complaint in this case outlines counts under theories of frustration of purpose as well as under the Takings Clause and the Due Process Clause. 
    The courts below didn't need to get to constitutional issues. 
    We had a contract. 
    The Government waived its sovereign immunity for breaches of contract in the Tucker act, and here we are.
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="3045.922" stopTime="3048.714">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    You concede that it has to be unmistakable.
speaker="charles_j_cooper" startTime="3048.714" stopTime="3050.357">
    Mr. Charles J. Cooper 
    I beg your pardon?
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="3050.357" stopTime="3053.907">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    You concede that to win you have to show the promise is unmistakable.
speaker="charles_j_cooper" startTime="3053.907" stopTime="3072.260">
    Mr. Charles J. Cooper 
    Yes, Your Honor, and I think that the courts below well and correctly understood what unmistakable means. 
    The unmistakable doctrine, unmistakability doctrine, Your Honor, truly, if reduced to a sound bite, is simply that the Government cannot be held to promises that it doesn't make.
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="3072.260" stopTime="3077.553">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    So the only issue before us is whether or not-- 
    --No, that's-- 
    --Is that any different-- 
    --That's no different from ordinary contract-- 
    --than any contract.
speaker="charles_j_cooper" startTime="3077.553" stopTime="3089.403">
    Mr. Charles J. Cooper 
    Well, Your Honor, if you look at the unmistakability cases that they rely... Merrion. 
    What was at issue there? 
    A tax exemption alleged to flow in connection with a lease for oil--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="3089.403" stopTime="3090.052">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well then, are you--
speaker="charles_j_cooper" startTime="3090.052" stopTime="3091.724">
    Mr. Charles J. Cooper 
    --and there was nothing in the contract about taxes, Your Honor.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="3091.724" stopTime="3103.441">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    --Are you saying, Mr. Cooper, then, that the unmistakability doctrine really does... is not... have any substantive content, that entirely apart from that doctrine you simply interpret the contract and decide who prevails?
speaker="charles_j_cooper" startTime="3103.441" stopTime="3113.857">
    Mr. Charles J. Cooper 
    Well, Your Honor, I think that it is a canon of construction designed to aid this Court and other courts in divining the true and genuine intent of the contracting parties.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="3113.857" stopTime="3118.852">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well, then it should be applied to everybody. 
    Why limit it just to Government, if it aids in determining the true intent of the parties?
speaker="charles_j_cooper" startTime="3118.852" stopTime="3180.071">
    Mr. Charles J. Cooper 
    Well, Your Honor, I think the one feature that it does bring is that when you are talking about a contract such as what was alleged in Merrion and what was alleged in the POSSE case, which they rely prominently on, that is, a contract that would, indeed, surrender a sovereign authority, there the taxing authority in Merrion, the Court approaches that with some skepticism, and so it requires that a clear expression of that promise take place. 
    Your Honor, I am happy to live with the unmistakability doctrine in no matter how rigid a formulation except theirs. 
    Theirs is a doctrine invented, Your Honor, for the purpose of saying a clear and plain promise, even coupled with provisions like I have read to you, is inadequate, because it isn't also coupled with the further promise that we will not breach those promises. 
    We... Congress is committed not to enact a law that changes this deal, or if it does--

speaker="charles_j_cooper" startTime="3196.671" stopTime="3215.024">
    Mr. Charles J. Cooper 
    --Well, you know, these contracts also recognized that possibility, too, and suggested that these provisions were binding on their successors. 
    But Your Honor, surely the Congress can't avoid it's contractual... or the sovereign can't avoid its contractual obligations by simply eliminating and extinguishing its agents.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="3215.024" stopTime="3219.328">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    May I ask just one other--

    I see that my time has almost expired, so let me close by simply saying this. 
    The question before the Court is whether these contracting parties are simply going to remain in the places that they are, with the Government holding $24 million of my client's money in its pocket, and with my clients with a $24 million lesson in the value of the Government's solemn contractual oath. 
    If there are no additional questions--

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Precisely what did the Government promise? 
    Precisely, the Government promised to let you continue to do... what it boils down to is, they promised to let you continue doing business as a bank so long as you maintained that minimum level of capital that these accounting principles would produce. 
    Is that the essence of the promise?

    I mean, I don't care how they calculate it.

    Mr. Cooper, if you seek damages for frustration, restitution, you still have to show a contract, don't you? 
    That is to say, the measure of damages doesn't particularly help us here, does it? 
    In either case there has to be a contract that was A, breached, or B, frustrated?
