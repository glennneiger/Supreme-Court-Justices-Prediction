Morse v. Republican Party of Virginia

    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    We will now hear argument in Number 94 203, Morse v. The Republican Party of Virginia. 
    You may proceed.
speaker="pamela_s_karlan" startTime="10.629" stopTime="71.878">
    Ms. Pamela S. Karlan 
    Thank you. 
    Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court-- 
    This case presents the question whether section 5 of the Voting Rights Act requires a preclearing method of nominating candidates for the United States Senate that restricts the right to vote to persons who give 45. 
    Under the facts of this case, if you don't pay 45, you have absolutely no say in how the Republican nominee for Senate in Virginia is selected. 
    Section 5 requires the preclearance of all voting standards, practices or procedures, or prerequisites to voting, no matter how small the change, and was enacted to keep States and political parties from denying the recently won gains in registration under the Voting Rights Act. 
    In Presley v. Etowah County Commission, this Court reaffirmed the broad scope of section 5, and identified once again a series of categories or typologies of case which require preclearance, and under the facts alleged in our complaint, this case falls within two of those typologies.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="71.878" stopTime="123.863">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Ms. Karlan, may I inquire, your brief suggests possibly three different theories of why section 5 might have been violated, and the first is that the 45 fee affects the process of selecting the nominee, and the second is that being a delegate to the convention is an elective party office, and third is the threat that the change from a primary election to a nominating convention required preclearance. 
    Now, were either of those last two theories contained in the complaint, and were they raised below? 
    Are they actually here, or do we just look at the 45 fee question?
speaker="pamela_s_karlan" startTime="123.863" stopTime="153.693">
    Ms. Pamela S. Karlan 
    Well, Your Honor, they were properly presented below. 
    As Your Honor knows, this case came up on an expedited schedule with no discovery permitted to the plaintiffs. 
    The result was that we found out when we received the affidavit of David Johnson contained in the Joint Appendix that the Republican Party had switched from a primary to a convention, and that this fee effective... this fee would only be possible were that change in there. 
    We then raised that issue at oral arguments--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="153.693" stopTime="159.148">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    The change from a primary to a convention, was that... it was not part of your complaint?
speaker="pamela_s_karlan" startTime="159.148" stopTime="161.429">
    Ms. Pamela S. Karlan 
    --No, Your Honor, it was not part of our complaint.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="161.429" stopTime="162.458">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    You talked about it.
speaker="pamela_s_karlan" startTime="162.458" stopTime="180.301">
    Ms. Pamela S. Karlan 
    That's correct. 
    Under our complaint, the facts of which must be taken as true for these purposes, we alleged that this was in effect a primary election itself, because as we alleged, and the district court assumed, anyone who pays 45 is entitled to go and cast a vote for a nominee.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="180.301" stopTime="186.163">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Well, the court below did not deal with those... with the second and third so called theories?
speaker="pamela_s_karlan" startTime="186.163" stopTime="195.770">
    Ms. Pamela S. Karlan 
    No, Your Honor, it did. 
    It held that nothing connected with the convention required preclearance, not the imposition of a fee, not the rules governing who could attend, and not the decision under section--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="195.770" stopTime="204.436">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    But do you think it dealt with the issue of whether the change itself from a primary to a convention required preclearance?
speaker="pamela_s_karlan" startTime="204.436" stopTime="210.849">
    Ms. Pamela S. Karlan 
    --It said, Your Honor, that nothing connected with the convention, including implicitly the decision to hold one, is covered--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="210.849" stopTime="214.062">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    And certainly not expressly. 
    It didn't expressly deal with that, did it?
speaker="pamela_s_karlan" startTime="214.062" stopTime="275.783">
    Ms. Pamela S. Karlan 
    --No, Your Honor, but under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15, we were entitled to conform the pleadings to the proof, and had this case not been done in the expedited manner in which it was done, we could have amended the complaint. 
    Now, under Rule 15, the failure to amend the complaint need not keep the Court from reaching that issue. 
    If this Court concludes that that's the central question, and that that issue wasn't sufficiently developed, then the proper response from the Court would be to reverse the judgment of the district court granting the motion to dismiss, and remand for further proceedings in which that issue can be expressly litigated. 
    Now, there are two theories of section 5 alleged in the complaint under which, under the text of the Voting Rights Act, this practice is covered. 
    The first of these is that the Republican Party's practices here, given the facts alleged, constitute a primary in and of themselves. 
    A primary election, after all, is an election in which individual voters who are adherents of a political party nominate a candidate by casting ballots.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="275.783" stopTime="301.962">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Ms. Karlan, may I ask you a preliminary question... at least, I think it's preliminary to that. 
    The section that you're dealing with speaks of 
    "whenever a State or a political subdivision. " 
    It seems to be addressed to a State or a political unit of a State. 
    How, then, can you proceed under section 5 against a political party?
speaker="pamela_s_karlan" startTime="301.962" stopTime="321.873">
    Ms. Pamela S. Karlan 
    Well, Justice Ginsburg, a political party under the circumstances of this case is a State actor in the same way that the Fifteenth Amendment by its terms simply guarantees the right to vote against abridgement or denial by a State, and has been held to cover political parties when they're engaged in the public nominating function.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="321.873" stopTime="340.067">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    I can see that... you... you're referring to constitutional... decisions under the Constitution like Terry and Smith v. Allwright, but here we have a statute, and the statute addresses State or political subdivisions. 
    Is there any definition of those words in the statute itself?
speaker="pamela_s_karlan" startTime="340.067" stopTime="387.719">
    Ms. Pamela S. Karlan 
    There is no definition of State in the statute itself, Your Honor. 
    The statute was by its terms specifically enacted to enforce the guarantees of the Fifteenth Amendment, and thereby it seems clear from the legislative history intended to reach political parties as well. 
    For example, we cite in our brief, Your Honor, the statement from the House subcommittee of the Judiciary that was responsible for the hearings on section 5 stating directly an election of delegates to a State party convention is covered, and a statement by Representative Bingham, the author of the language defining the term 14(c)(1), making clear that party canvases and caucuses that selected people who were involved in the nomination of candidates to public office were covered by the act because they were State actors.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="387.719" stopTime="416.649">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Ms. Karlan, how can that be? 
    Can I not follow a political party that... say a feminist group wants to start a women's political party. 
    Only women can be members. 
    Anybody in the world can vote for their candidates, but it's a women's party. 
    That's not permitted under this legislation? 
    It's action by the State simply because that party excludes men from participating in the political party?
speaker="pamela_s_karlan" startTime="416.649" stopTime="425.185">
    Ms. Pamela S. Karlan 
    Your Honor, section 5 of the Voting Rights Act would not cover the decision to form a party as discriminatory on the basis of race, but the Nineteenth Amendment--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="425.185" stopTime="426.887">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Their selection of a candidate.
speaker="pamela_s_karlan" startTime="426.887" stopTime="437.513">
    Ms. Pamela S. Karlan 
    --The Nineteenth Amendment, Your Honor, would say that if that party performs the public electoral function of nominating a candidate for United States Senator, they would be covered by the Constitution.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="437.513" stopTime="446.769">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    May I ask if the Virginia statutes draw a distinction between new parties such as Justice Scalia's feminist party, and established parties like the Republican Party and the Democratic Party?
speaker="pamela_s_karlan" startTime="446.769" stopTime="448.011">
    Ms. Pamela S. Karlan 
    Yes, Justice Stevens, but--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="448.011" stopTime="449.743">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    What is the difference under Virginia law?
speaker="pamela_s_karlan" startTime="449.743" stopTime="469.334">
    Ms. Pamela S. Karlan 
    --Under Virginia law, a political party within the meaning of the Virginia statute only comes into being if at one of the last two Statewide general elections some candidate of that party received 10 percent of the votes cast for Statewide office, so that the party to which Justice Scalia refers would not itself be covered. 
    However--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="469.334" stopTime="470.456">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Unless it was successful.
speaker="pamela_s_karlan" startTime="470.456" stopTime="471.656">
    Ms. Pamela S. Karlan 
    --Ultimately, yes.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="471.656" stopTime="474.738">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    And won election, and thereupon it would have to be, I suppose, disbanded.
speaker="pamela_s_karlan" startTime="474.738" stopTime="482.525">
    Ms. Pamela S. Karlan 
    Under the Nineteenth Amendment, which is not at issue in this case, yes, Your Honor, which says that no State shall abridge or deny the right to vote on account of sex.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="482.525" stopTime="512.993">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    Well, but the question is whether or not this is a State or a political subdivision, and it seems to me in light of the two cases Justice Ginsburg mentioned, Terry v. Adams and Smith v. Allwright, that you have a difficult position to maintain. 
    The Congress was well aware of those cases. 
    They were well aware of the White Primary cases, and yet they used the words, State and political subdivision. 
    They didn't say, or any other entity which is a State actor--
speaker="pamela_s_karlan" startTime="512.993" stopTime="513.874">
    Ms. Pamela S. Karlan 
    Well, but--
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="513.874" stopTime="516.087">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    --and that's what you want... and you want us to say the latter.
speaker="pamela_s_karlan" startTime="516.087" stopTime="535.959">
    Ms. Pamela S. Karlan 
    --Well, but Justice Kennedy, the provision under which the exclusions in Terry and in Smith v. Allwright were found discriminatory was a provision that only applied to the States, so Congress could reasonably assume that if it was State action for a political party to bar someone from a preprimary in which there was no governmental involvement whatsoever--
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="535.959" stopTime="545.727">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    I am assuming that State action cases are correct. 
    The point is, is that this jurisprudence was in front of the Congress, and they chose this rather limited language.
speaker="pamela_s_karlan" startTime="545.727" stopTime="554.372">
    Ms. Pamela S. Karlan 
    --No, Your Honor, this language is not limited. 
    This is the same language under which the courts held that political parties were covered. 
    Now, Your Honor--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="554.372" stopTime="563.989">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    The court held political parties were covered in those cases when election as the nominee of that political party was effectively election to the office.
speaker="pamela_s_karlan" startTime="563.989" stopTime="565.169">
    Ms. Pamela S. Karlan 
    --No, Your Honor--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="565.169" stopTime="567.820">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    That's quite a different situation from what one has here.
speaker="pamela_s_karlan" startTime="567.820" stopTime="580.738">
    Ms. Pamela S. Karlan 
    --No, Your Honor. 
    In United States v. Classic, the case on which both Smith and Terry rely, the court said that the primary was an integral part of the election process whether it always, sometimes, or never resulted in the election of a candidate.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="580.738" stopTime="591.728">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    No question about that, but those cases did not purport to be interpreting this language. 
    This statute was later enacted, and they did not focus on the words, State or political subdivision. 
    They talked about State action, of course.
speaker="pamela_s_karlan" startTime="591.728" stopTime="627.472">
    Ms. Pamela S. Karlan 
    Well, Your Honor, if I may draw a historical point not in the record, in 1965, the States that were covered by the Voting Rights Act were all States in the solid South, which was solidly Democratic. 
    Had Congress passed a law with the understanding that you have advanced, one that didn't apply to political parties, it is patently clear that the Voting Rights Act would have been strangled at its birth, because all of the discrimination would simply have been conducted by the Democratic Party in the South, and the Voting Rights Act would have been a dead letter. 
    Now, it's clear that that's so from both the statement in the House report and Representative Bingham's statement of what the language involving voting was intended to cover.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="627.472" stopTime="640.730">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Well, Ms. Karlan, the Attorney General has adopted a number of regulations pursuant to section 5 and the provisions of the Voting Rights Act. 
    Do you concede that all the Attorney General's regulations that are relevant here are valid?
speaker="pamela_s_karlan" startTime="640.730" stopTime="647.675">
    Ms. Pamela S. Karlan 
    I believe that they are all valid, yes, Your Honor, and they do provide that when political parties perform the State--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="647.675" stopTime="651.318">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    And you rely on those regulations to make your case?
speaker="pamela_s_karlan" startTime="651.318" stopTime="661.713">
    Ms. Pamela S. Karlan 
    --They certainly support our case, but even if those regulations were invalid, our case would go forward, because our claim is that this is a primary election in the same way that the behavior in Terry is a primary--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="661.713" stopTime="668.028">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Do you think that absent those regulations, your position would be sustained here?
speaker="pamela_s_karlan" startTime="668.028" stopTime="683.459">
    Ms. Pamela S. Karlan 
    --I would hope so, Your Honor. 
    I don't think our position depends on the Attorney General's regulations. 
    His regulations are based on the same understanding which we have advanced, which is that State action covers a political party when it's engaged in the process of nominating a candidate for public office.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="683.459" stopTime="695.987">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Ms. Karlan, you say that this would not have been... it would have been a dead letter if it couldn't have been applied against the Democratic Party in the South in the era when it was enacted. 
    How many times was it applied against the Democratic Party in the South?
speaker="pamela_s_karlan" startTime="695.987" stopTime="708.155">
    Ms. Pamela S. Karlan 
    Your Honor, I only have the list of the number of times where objections were lodged, and that was about a dozen.

    Ms. Pamela S. Karlan 
    Yes, Your Honor.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="724.916" stopTime="739.825">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    Ms. Karlan, may I go back to the textual argument? 
    You... if I understand what you're saying, you're saying that "State" is to be construed to include anyone who exercises a State function. 
    The process of winnowing candidates down is a State function, therefore, it applies here. 
    Is that--
speaker="pamela_s_karlan" startTime="739.825" stopTime="740.736">
    Ms. Pamela S. Karlan 
    Yes, Your Honor.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="740.736" stopTime="779.121">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    --basically what you're saying? 
    If that's the way the Congress intended the word State to be construed, why did it refer to political subdivision at all? 
    Because it seems to me... maybe I'm missing something, but it seems to me that political subdivision would be included on your definition without specific reference to it, without the need for specific reference to it, whenever it was engaged in... in effect in discharging any of the processes by which the State government would ultimately bring an election or a series of choices to be made in election before the people, so why is it in there at all?
speaker="pamela_s_karlan" startTime="779.121" stopTime="794.612">
    Ms. Pamela S. Karlan 
    The reason it's in there, Justice Souter, is because section 5 of the Voting Rights Act only applies to particular places. 
    Sometimes those places are entire States, but in some cases, like North Carolina or New York, only particular political subdivisions, only particular geographic regions--
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="794.612" stopTime="795.624">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    Ah.
speaker="pamela_s_karlan" startTime="795.624" stopTime="796.225">

    Unknown Speaker 
    Okay.
speaker="pamela_s_karlan" startTime="796.843" stopTime="806.239">
    Ms. Pamela S. Karlan 
    So if you only provided no State, it wouldn't define, for example, the preclearance cases that this Court has seen from North Carolina or from New York, UJO v. Carey, for--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="806.239" stopTime="810.132">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Why is that? 
    Wouldn't a political subdivision still be a State? 
    Wouldn't it still be State action?
speaker="pamela_s_karlan" startTime="810.132" stopTime="826.184">
    Ms. Pamela S. Karlan 
    --No, Your Honor. 
    It's not fair to define State action here to define which geographic areas of the country are covered, because if you only said State, then that wouldn't explain why, for example, a change in electoral rules in Manhattan is covered but not a change in Westchester County. 
    That's when the triggering provisions--
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="826.184" stopTime="827.335">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    Well, at least it would have been a serious question. 
    I mean--
speaker="pamela_s_karlan" startTime="827.335" stopTime="840.372">
    Ms. Pamela S. Karlan 
    --That's correct. 
    The triggering provisions of section 4 identify political subdivisions for purposes of deciding what's covered by preclearance, not for purposes of deciding what the standard is, or whom the actor is.

speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="840.372" stopTime="866.540">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    --I have one further question. 
    Under your view, if, in a covered jurisdiction, there is a small group of citizens, two or three of them, who have substantial community influence and many, many funds, if they meet in someone's home to decide who's going to be the candidate, and their voice is in effect conclusive as to who will be the successful candidate in a particular party, are they covered?

   Argument of Paul Bender
speaker="paul_bender" startTime="882.951" stopTime="952.627">
    Mr. Paul Bender 
    Thank you, Mr. Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court-- 
    Under Virginia law, a political party that gets 10 percent or more of the vote at an election is entitled to place the candidate it selects for the U.S. Senate on the ballot in a preferred position as long as the party maintains a certain kind of organization prescribed by the State. 
    The party is then entitled under Virginia law to choose its candidate either through a primary, or through a convention, or through some other means. 
    Both the district court and the appellees in this case agree that if the party chooses to choose its candidate through a primary election, that changes in the rules about who can vote at that primary election to choose the candidate are covered by section 5. 
    I think that's common ground. 
    The district court, however, decided that if the party chooses not to use the primary elections as a way of choosing its candidates, but instead to choose through a convention, then section 5 does not apply.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="952.627" stopTime="985.549">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Well, Mr. Bender, I can understand an argument to the effect that if the State permits a party to change from a primary election to a convention method, that that action by the State in allowing that change is something that in and of itself could be challenged under section 5, but I'm not sure that's what was done here. 
    I'm not sure that question is here before us, and we're reaching it by a very different route, as I see it.
speaker="paul_bender" startTime="985.549" stopTime="1007.485">
    Mr. Paul Bender 
    I think the question is whether, under State law, a party or any other group has a right to put a candidate on the ballot in a preferred position if they maintain a certain organization. 
    Those are the facts of this case. 
    If a party is given that power under State law, whether, when the party makes a change and who can participate in that selection process, whether that is subject to preclearance--

    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor

    Do you think that question is before us in this case?

    Mr. Paul Bender 
    --I don't think that question is before you in this case. 
    I think the district court did not decide that question. 
    If... it's unclear in this case whether that kind of change was made, because they apparently have never used a... have never used a primary, even though on a couple of occasions the party has said it was going to have a primary. 
    That question of whether that change was made has not been decided below and would have to be remanded, but I don't think you have to do that, because the change in... it seems to me the basic principle here is that the change in the people who can select a candidate to go on the ballot is a change sufficiently related to the general election so that that change needs to be precleared, and that's true whether the change occurs through a matter of State law, or the change occurs through a matter of city law, or county law, or political party law when the political party is given the right to put the candidate on the ballot in a preferred position.

    Mr. Bender, what do you mean by a preferred position? 
    Suppose a State just says, every party that in the last election got 1 percent or more of the vote is entitled automatically to be listed on the ballot in the next election?

speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="1095.754" stopTime="1110.153">

    Mr. Paul Bender 
    I wouldn't say any change in the process by which the party selects the candidates. 
    I think this case involves something that's very close to the election process, and that is the people who can select the party's candidates. 
    If you affirm the decision of the district court in this case, that would mean that in a State like Virginia, where parties have an automatic place on the ballot, that major parties could preclude members of certain races from voting for the candidate to go on the ballot.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="1138.032" stopTime="1142.675">

speaker="paul_bender" startTime="1185.925" stopTime="1225.829">
    Mr. Paul Bender 
    --Over... between 300 and 400 outside of the context of primaries. 
    One, for example, comes from Virginia, which is in the lodging that was made with the Court. 
    In 1982, the Democratic Party in Virginia precleared, and Assistant Attorney General Reynolds tried to preclear, and Assistant Attorney General Reynolds did preclear a change almost identical to the change, in terms of its relation to the voting process almost identical to the change in this case. 
    It was a change in the way the vote was going to be allocated at the party's convention, and they... the Democratic Party in Virginia applied for preclearance, and preclearance was given, and as I say, there have been over 300 of those kinds of submissions over the years. 
    The Attorney General's regulations--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="1225.829" stopTime="1237.259">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    It's a necessary part of your position, is it not, that you cannot form a party on any basis that it would be unconstitutional or unlawful for the State to discriminate on the basis of?
speaker="paul_bender" startTime="1237.259" stopTime="1267.790">
    Mr. Paul Bender 
    --The key to this case is the State's relationship to the party. 
    If... people can form a party, form a group as in Justice Kennedy's question, and decide that they're going to support a nominee at the election, and if you need 15,000 signatures to put their nominee on the ballot, they're going to go out and get the 15,000 signatures. 
    If five of them have been doing that for 10 years and decide let's let a sixth person into that group, there needs to be no preclearance, because there isn't the kind of connection there is here between State law and what the party does. 
    Parties have an official position--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="1267.790" stopTime="1278.887">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    But if the State agrees to let them on the ballot, the State can effectively preclude a party from being formed that is all black, that is all white, that is all rich people, that is all poor people, or whatever.
speaker="paul_bender" startTime="1278.887" stopTime="1284.970">
    Mr. Paul Bender

    Mr. Paul Bender 
    Preclearance applies when it has special rules for parties, and it... don't... I don't think you should denigrate the preferred position that parties get. 
    In Virginia, they are listed first on the ballot. 
    Every study of elections that I know says that that is worth an enormous amount, to be listed before the independent candidates. 
    Virginia has given them that privilege.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="1303.683" stopTime="1307.116">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    --So we will only prevent these specialized parties when they're successful.
speaker="paul_bender" startTime="1307.116" stopTime="1328.320">
    Mr. Paul Bender 
    No, not when they're successful. 
    We only require preclearance of the party's rules when the party is given by the State some power that other people don't have. 
    The Attorney General's regulation under section 5 attempts to cut down... this Court's decisions about what has to be precleared because of its relationship to a general election are very broad, starting with the Allen case.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="1328.320" stopTime="1335.416">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    And is that rationale that you're offering to us now that the delegated power, the preferred position, is that what makes it a political subdivision under the statute?
speaker="paul_bender" startTime="1335.416" stopTime="1339.008">
    Mr. Paul Bender 
    No, it's not a political subdivision, Justice Kennedy, it's the State under the statute.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="1339.008" stopTime="1339.938">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    A State.
speaker="paul_bender" startTime="1339.938" stopTime="1346.953">
    Mr. Paul Bender 
    The concept of the State. 
    As Ms. Karlan said, the political subdivision is in there because they're talking about the coverage formula. 
    The two things are--
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="1346.953" stopTime="1348.485">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    But that's what makes it the State.
speaker="paul_bender" startTime="1348.485" stopTime="1389.522">
    Mr. Paul Bender 
    --And as the Court said in Sheffield, the concept of State and political subdivision are territorial, and within that territory, every entity, as Sheffield said, which would be the State under the Court's State action principles... and it's clear that a party in this respect would be the State. 
    Every entity that would be the State is covered, so the State is used in section 5 as the word State is used in this Court's State action jurisprudence, not in the formal sense of the State, and you can see that in the Dougherty case, for example, where a school board put a financial burden on an employee and said they had to take a leave in order to run for election, and the Court held that that had to be precleared. 
    Now, that school board has nothing to do with voting.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="1389.522" stopTime="1394.086">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    Well then, the term State is coterminous with our State action jurisprudence?
speaker="paul_bender" startTime="1394.086" stopTime="1409.233">
    Mr. Paul Bender 
    Yes, except that the Attorney General's regulations should be given a lot of deference in dealing with that definition, and the Attorney General's regulations have tried to trim that concept some so as not to interfere with the constitutionally protected right of political association.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="1409.233" stopTime="1443.819">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    Mr. Bender, I thought you had said that State is not coterminous with State action, because you're saying that the addition of this element of preference, as you put it, is crucial. 
    You said that if a State allowed any party onto the ballot on the same... to place a candidate on the ballot on the same terms as any other party, that that would not trigger applicability, and yet that would be State action, would it not, because each of the parties, including the little splinter group that was in the hypo, would be performing a State function of winnowing candidates down?
speaker="paul_bender" startTime="1443.819" stopTime="1458.347">
    Mr. Paul Bender 
    I think the question, Justice Souter, is whether the action of a group of people in deciding who they're going to support for election, who they're going to go out and get signatures for, is State action, and I'm very doubtful whether, if five of us get together and decide to get 50,000 signatures--
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="1458.347" stopTime="1472.065">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    Okay, but once they organize themselves and say, the five of us are going to be the X Party, and the State says, yes, five signatures on a petition is enough to get on the ballot, they would then be, on your theory, performing State actions.
speaker="paul_bender" startTime="1472.065" stopTime="1474.589">
    Mr. Paul Bender 
    --I don't think so.

    At least under--

    --They are performing a State function... I don't think so.

    Mr. E. Duncan Getchell, Jr. 
    Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court-- 
    The opinion of the district court should be affirmed because it's in accord with the plain meaning of the statute and the regulation. 
    The Voting Rights Act applies to a State or political subdivision which is covered by certain terms in section 4 of the act when that State or political subdivision alters a qualification or prerequisite for voting or a standard practice or procedure without... with respect to voting and voting, as you would expect in a statute about voting, is a defined term, and voting is defined as those actions necessary to make a vote effective in a primary, special, or general election.

    Mr. E. Duncan Getchell, Jr. 
    Not if they are construed as the Attorney General would have them be construed, because I think that would raise grave First Amendment issues.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="1564.939" stopTime="1578.025">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Well, the regulations seem to extend the application to political parties in some circumstances. 
    Do you concede that that's a valid interpretation, that a political party can be a State actor?
speaker="e_duncan_getchell_jr" startTime="1578.025" stopTime="1588.624">
    Mr. E. Duncan Getchell, Jr. 
    There are certain actions performed by the political parties which are clearly delegated public electoral functions, involving exclusively--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="1588.624" stopTime="1593.018">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Well, could you answer my question? 
    Do you concede that a political party can be a State actor?
speaker="e_duncan_getchell_jr" startTime="1593.018" stopTime="1593.599">
    Mr. E. Duncan Getchell, Jr. 
    --It can be.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="1593.599" stopTime="1594.420">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Under the statute?
speaker="e_duncan_getchell_jr" startTime="1594.420" stopTime="1622.189">
    Mr. E. Duncan Getchell, Jr. 
    It can be. 
    I think the only area where it ever is is when it is conducting a primary, and when it is setting rules for a primary, because a primary implicates the machinery of the State, the electoral machinery of the State, the state ballot boxes, the State officers, the State polling places. 
    It has traditionally been a State function because it's neutral. 
    It exists only to count votes. 
    On the other hand, a convention is intensely political. 
    The nominating process itself, the decision to nominate anybody, is personal and political, it's not--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="1622.189" stopTime="1641.370">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Well, that's a curious line to draw, because where the State is conducting primary election activities by way of administering them, I assume that any change can be challenged by a suit against the State itself, so the line you would draw is a little curious, I would think.
speaker="e_duncan_getchell_jr" startTime="1641.370" stopTime="1656.421">
    Mr. E. Duncan Getchell, Jr. 
    --I think the line that I have drawn is the one that the Attorney General sought to draw in the regulation. 
    The statute itself doesn't address political parties at all. 
    The regulation says that the party--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="1656.421" stopTime="1662.765">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    No. 
    So I would have thought you might just say, well, the statute doesn't reach political parties, but that's not your approach.
speaker="e_duncan_getchell_jr" startTime="1662.765" stopTime="1676.065">
    Mr. E. Duncan Getchell, Jr. 
    --It does not reach political parties on its face. 
    The jurisprudence that has developed in the lower courts has drawn the distinction between primaries when it is deemed to be acting as the State and conventions and other--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="1676.065" stopTime="1678.115">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    What jurisprudence are you talking about?
speaker="e_duncan_getchell_jr" startTime="1678.115" stopTime="1735.291">
    Mr. E. Duncan Getchell, Jr. 
    --I am talking about Williams v. The Democratic Party, which this Court summarily affirmed in 1972. 
    The Congress has twice readopted the Voting Rights Act since then, presumably knowing of that jurisprudence. 
    Basically, that case said it does not apply to conventions. 
    MacGuire v. Amos, decided the same year, although it was dicta in a footnote, distinguished Williams v. Democratic Party to note that a convention was not involved in the Alabama case. 
    So without conceding that in all circumstances that that regulation is valid, it was not our purpose to challenge the regulation. 
    Our purpose was to say that the regulation clearly excludes us, because the regulation only applies to a political party if 1) the political party is exercising a traditional public electoral function, and b) that function has been delegated.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="1735.291" stopTime="1744.788">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    Well, Mr. Getchell, is it fair to say that it is only exercising that function, on your view, if it is in fact using traditional State machinery?

    Mr. E. Duncan Getchell, Jr. 
    Yes, Your Honor.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="1745.489" stopTime="1759.477">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    So that in... it is fair to say, I take it, then, on your view that although there are some circumstances in which the party would be covered, there are no circumstances in which the party would be covered which could not also be subject to a challenge directly to the State itself.
speaker="e_duncan_getchell_jr" startTime="1759.477" stopTime="1760.668">
    Mr. E. Duncan Getchell, Jr.

speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="1760.668" stopTime="1766.872">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Okay. 
    So if we had a 45 fee for a primary, that would be subject to preclearance, is--
speaker="e_duncan_getchell_jr" startTime="1766.872" stopTime="1786.386">
    Mr. E. Duncan Getchell, Jr. 
    Well, if it were viewed as a direct qualification for voting in the primary, it presumably would be. 
    On the other hand, if it were viewed as a delegate registration fee, this Court has struck down exorbitant delegation... I mean, delegate or candidate registration fees, but it said that it was not saying that they were improper in all circumstances.

    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    --But if the convention, as I understand it, is effectively a substitute for the primary, they both serve the same function in selecting candidates who will appear in preferred positions on the ballot, the function is identical, is it not? 
    Then why shouldn't the coverage be the same?
speaker="e_duncan_getchell_jr" startTime="1804.939" stopTime="1843.645">
    Mr. E. Duncan Getchell, Jr. 
    I would commend to Your Honor the law review article by a Professor Weisburd that we have cited several times in our briefs, where he makes the political science point that they're quite different animals. 
    The State provides neutral electoral machinery. 
    It has no valid interest but that the votes be fairly counted. 
    The convention is a voluntary, grassroots meeting of people who are seeking a very unneutral end. 
    They are exercising their core First Amendment rights, and anything that attempts to trench on that would have to be justified by compelling State interest and a narrowly tailored piece of legislation.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="1843.645" stopTime="1850.607">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    In your view, then, would this 45 fee stand on the same level as, say, the requirement of passing a literacy test?

    Mr. E. Duncan Getchell, Jr. 
    No, Your Honor. 
    This... practically, what this 45 fee is is reflected by the fact that we are dealing with a voluntary organization. 
    Because we have the largest political primary, we believe, in the western... I mean, not... we have the largest convention, although they call it a primary. 
    I'm getting ahead of myself... they want to criticize our convention. 
    They want to call it an indoor primary because it's so inclusive. 
    Then, at the same time, they want to say it's exclusive because a fee is charged. 
    Because the convention is so large, with 14,000 delegates at the most recent convention, we have to hire the largest hall in the Commonwealth of Virginia, and it costs money. 
    In the affidavit that was filed with respect to the '93 convention, the number was 300,000.

    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    All right. 
    So now what they do is, we're not going to have a primary. 
    Rather, we're going to call every voter who wants to come and vote in the primary to come to my meeting, whoever wants to come, and we will vote, and we'll call it a convention, and only white people can vote. 
    That, in your opinion, the Voting Rights Act just doesn't cover, and that's what I can't quite understand, why the people who would have written this Voting Rights Act would have wanted not to cover that possible situation, since it did exist many years ago.
speaker="e_duncan_getchell_jr" startTime="1981.455" stopTime="1986.158">

    So you're saying they didn't want to cover the possibility that the Democratic Party in the South, or the Republican Party, would say, oh, we no longer can insist only whites vote at the primary, so what we'll do is, we'll do exactly the same thing but call it a convention.

    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    Right, and the evidence that they didn't want to cover it, even though there was a Supreme Court case right on point which said that it was covered under the Constitution, the evidence that they didn't want to cover it is what?
speaker="e_duncan_getchell_jr" startTime="2033.709" stopTime="2093.949">
    Mr. E. Duncan Getchell, Jr. 
    I would submit that it is first in the plain language of the statute. 
    I would submit that it's secondly in the fact that the statute has twice been reaffirmed, or repassed, knowing what the jurisprudence was. 
    I would say that the prior practice is not that convention rules have been cleared. 
    Only one has been brought to this Court's attention, one incidence when the Democratic Party of Virginia did it in 1982, whether in error or out of an abundance of caution I do not know. 
    I would say that on the legislative history, that all of the legislative history is either for my position or neutral, except for the one statement by Congressman Bingham. 
    I would say that this Court has traditionally held that one chance statement by one Congressman is not valid legislative history. 
    I would say that if you look at section 11, which is the criminal part of this act, which has to be narrowly construed, they use the same language about primary, special, and general elections, and I would submit that that would not... that they didn't use that language differently in two different places.

    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    If there were a change, a party says, okay, the statute will reach us if we exclude people under the primary so we want to change to a convention system, would that change be subject to challenge--

    Mr. E. Duncan Getchell, Jr. 
    --I believe--

    --in your view?
speaker="e_duncan_getchell_jr" startTime="2139.489" stopTime="2195.625">
    Mr. E. Duncan Getchell, Jr. 
    --I believe that the statute that permits, in the State's view, a party to call upon it to conduct a primary, when that statute is changed, that is subject to preclearance. 
    I believe arguably when the State acquiesces in a call for the party to actually conduct the primary, that that requires preclearance. 
    When the party has a statute like we have in Virginia which says, you can have a convention or a primary, let us know if you want a primary, and elects to make the change, I don't think the party as a party is subject to preclearance, because under your traditional State action case law, Blum v. Yaretsky, for example, if a private actor is making private choices within a statutory framework, that is... does not trigger State action. 
    So I would say that whenever the State changes its law, or when a State makes... changes a practice, that's subject to preclearance.

    He points out that after your decision in Democratic Party of the U.S. v. Wisconsin, and particularly footnote 31, those statutes are all presumptively unconstitutional. 
    If we, as a party, want to avail ourselves of the public apparatus of a primary, then we entangle ourselves with the State, and the State action at least is subject to preclearance, but when we merely nominate with our own people in our own convention, we are not subject to the prior leave of the Government. 
    It would be terribly unseemly if an organization that exists to change the Government had to preclear the time, place, date, and rules for its convention, even if conceptually you could do that, which you can't, because a convention is a law unto itself.

speaker="e_duncan_getchell_jr" startTime="2640.348" stopTime="2739.344">
    Mr. E. Duncan Getchell, Jr. 
    --Well, the reason that I'm very concerned about that point of view, Justice Kennedy, is that it is not a State function to nominate, and even though that conceptually, if you don't have a candidate you don't make a vote effective, what is being argued for by the appellants is very, very radical. 
    It says that if we nominate, then we're part of voting. 
    Now, this was an argument... again, Professor Weisburd points out this was an argument that was made by commentators in the sixties following the '68 Democratic Convention. 
    There were some lower courts that seemed to make nomination a public function. 
    And then he reviewed your First Amendment jurisprudence, particularly in Cousins v. Wigoda and in Democratic Party of the U.S. v. Wisconsin, and I would add to that the Eu case, and it is perfectly... it seems to me perfectly persuasive that this Court would say that everything that happens prior to an election, and the involvement of State apparatus, is First Amendment private activity. 
    It is not a State function. 
    And Justice Souter, with all deference, on the idea that winnowing is a State function, that is a notion that comes out the Storer case, but in Virginia there is no winnowing, because in California, if you ran in the primary you couldn't run in the general election, and so the State was at least having the mass of people claiming a right to be on the ballot reduced. 
    In Virginia, if you are nominated by a convention, if the nomination is by the convention, a losing party can run as an independent.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="2739.344" stopTime="2778.017">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    Okay, well, let's take a simpler tack. 
    Going back to the definition of voting again, if we start with the assumption that one act which would have an effect on voting in primary, special, and general elections, may be the act of selecting party officials, as the definition seems to say, and if, in fact, a delegate here is a party official, why doesn't that alone extend the act on its terms to cover the situation?
speaker="e_duncan_getchell_jr" startTime="2778.017" stopTime="2781.750">
    Mr. E. Duncan Getchell, Jr. 
    Well--
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="2781.750" stopTime="2810.640">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    That doesn't require that the election of the party official be in a primary, special, or general election. 
    It simply requires that we hold that the act of electing or selecting the party official can ultimately have an effect on the effectiveness of votes in primary, special, or general elections. 
    If that is the case, that's enough for coverage of this practice, isn't it?
speaker="e_duncan_getchell_jr" startTime="2810.640" stopTime="2828.821">
    Mr. E. Duncan Getchell, Jr. 
    --I can't read the text, Justice Souter, that way. 
    I think that the text, the meaning of the text is that if you make a change in a practice or procedure or standard for voting--

    Justice David H. Souter 
    But if we read the definition of voting as I have just suggested it may be read, then you lose, I take it. 
    In other words, you can't accept that reading of the term, of the definition of voting and still win this case--

    Yes, but somebody does wish to start with the fee-- 
    [Laughter] 
    --and my difficulty with your argument is that it seems to me quite possible, and in fact even easy, to read the definition as covering this particular requirement for the election of a party official whose selection may have an effect on the effectiveness of votes in the ultimate election. 
    And the fact that the application in this instance may raise other questions about whether it applies to the timing of these delegate selections and so on is something to consider, but there's still the problem of why, on its face, this does not apply.

    And my point is, if you start with the fee, you can never stop there, because the only intellectually coherent grounds for saying that the fee is covered is to say that the party is engaged in State action by the mere act of nominating, and therefore the whole process is ultimately federalized to the same extent it would be if it were State action.

    Mr. E. Duncan Getchell, Jr. 
    I was going to make the additional point that it is too far down the road. 
    Remember, the whole purpose of section 5 was to freeze in time in 1964 the practices that were potentially discriminatory so that States wouldn't change them just as fast as the courts struck them down. 
    Now, the remedy for section 5 is to go back to where you were in 1964. 
    Well, in 1964, the Republican Party held its convention for this Senate seat in the John Marshall Hotel, which is boarded up and closed, and it held the next convention in the Hotel Roanoke, which is something else entirely. 
    This is not the kind of statute or remedy which makes any sense 30 years down the road to give an unexpected interpretation to, and the interpretation would now be extremely unexpected.

    That number's not in any of the briefs, or in the record. 
    What is before the Court are a handful of documents that the Solicitor General mailed to the Court and to counsel last week, or week before last. 
    Most of them have to do with the Green Party, the Republican Party, and the Democratic Party in Alaska. 
    The letter is dated September 18 to the Clerk of this Court. 
    Except for the Virginia convention submission, they all have to do with changes in primaries in Alaska.

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Well, perhaps the Solicitor General can tell us where this 300 number appears. 
    Are you saying, to go back for a second... let's go back 30 years, or 20 years, and you're a Member of Congress, and suppose what you're concerned about is that the major party, the Republicans or the Democrats, say only white people can vote in our primary, and that's terrible, and you want to make it illegal, and probably the Constitution does. 
    And then the idea comes through, maybe what they'll do is have a primary, they'll just call it a convention, and they won't go into a voting machine, they'll go meet somewhere. 
    Are you saying Congress, under the Fifteenth Amendment, lacks the constitutional power to forbid that?
speaker="e_duncan_getchell_jr" startTime="3219.006" stopTime="3224.950">
    Mr. E. Duncan Getchell, Jr.

    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    Yes. 
    What they've done is, the political party is simply going to go do just what they did before, but they won't call it a primary because they won't use a voting machine. 
    They'll all go to a room some place, anyone who wants to, and they'll raise their hands. 
    Okay, I'm saying, do you think... is your argument that Congress lacks the constitutional power to do it--

    Mr. E. Duncan Getchell, Jr. 
    For two reasons--

speaker="e_duncan_getchell_jr" startTime="3249.246" stopTime="3266.127">
    Mr. E. Duncan Getchell, Jr. 
    If I may elaborate, for two reasons. 
    One is that it's not a State function when you have nominations, and it doesn't involve State apparatus. 
    Secondly, the preclearance of this bill is too blunt, it's not finely tailored when it impinges on First Amendment rights, and Congress therefore wouldn't have adopted section 5 to deal with that problem.

    Ms. Karlan, you have 5 minutes. 
   
   
   
   Rebuttal of Pamela S. Karlan
speaker="pamela_s_karlan" startTime="3274.922" stopTime="3351.593">
    Ms. Pamela S. Karlan 
    Thank you, Justice Stevens. 
    I begin with one observation about what Mr. Getchell has told you today, which is, he tells you how the Republicans run their convention in Virginia, and how much it would cost, and how it should be operated, and how difficult it would be to preclear. 
    Those issues are not before this Court. 
    The issue before this Court is here on a motion to dismiss. 
    If his argument depends on what the Virginia Republican Party actually does, then the appropriate judgment from this Court is a reversal and remand so that we can conduct discovery on what the Virginia party actually does. 
    The second point I want to make is that the word State is, of course, ambiguous. 
    It depends on a construction of State that draws on the Fifteenth Amendment cases which the Voting Rights Act was intended to enforce. 
    It understands what State action was, which is when political parties conduct their public nominating function. 
    It relies on the Department of Justice's regulations, which this Court has always given great deference to. 
    The third point is about freedom of association. 
    Justice Scalia, your arguments would depend... would be equally strong in the context of a primary election. 
    If the Republican Party wanted to hold a primary election restricted to party members, and limit party membership to white voters only, then your argument would say they have that entitlement.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="3351.593" stopTime="3354.754">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    If they paid for it themselves, yes, if it wasn't a State run primary.
speaker="pamela_s_karlan" startTime="3354.754" stopTime="3363.780">
    Ms. Pamela S. Karlan 
    That might be correct, but Your Honor, the freedom of association point might be the same even if they did, and this court clearly has never taken that broad an approach. 
    Moreover--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="3363.780" stopTime="3370.926">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    I think the freedom to associate is not the freedom to have the Government pay for your association. 
    I think once you get the Government in, paying for the primary, it's a different situation.
speaker="pamela_s_karlan" startTime="3370.926" stopTime="3423.910">
    Ms. Pamela S. Karlan 
    --That's correct. 
    Now, in this case, there is no freedom of association claim, really, because if you look at the Republican call for the convention contained in the Joint Appendix, they allow all voters to participate. 
    The only point they make is that they have some kind of interest in charging the 45. 
    That may be so, but that interest will only be trenched on by section 5 of the Voting Rights Act if the Department of Justice, the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, or this Court, concludes that that practice of charging the 45 has the purpose or effect of discriminating on the basis of race. 
    At this point, their claim has to be that they would have the right to make people pay even if that excluded all black voters, or a disproportionate number of black voters. 
    Again, that is the issue to be determined in preclearance. 
    They have no First Amendment right that they have identified that would be trenched on by requiring preclearance in this case of this fee.

speaker="pamela_s_karlan" startTime="3474.684" stopTime="3523.655">
    Ms. Pamela S. Karlan 
    Under section 24.2 613 of the Virginia Code, political parties receive placement on the ballot above... lexically above all other candidates, and as Mr. Bender referred, there's a function called roll off, which means as you move down the ballot, fewer and fewer people are still voting, and it turns out that being the number 1 candidate or number 2 candidate on a ballot gives you some substantial bump up in the number of votes you receive. 
    That's the preferential position. 
    The second preferential aspect is that the parties need not show that this candidate has any particular level of support, whereas any independent candidate, or nonparty candidate running, must both gain a percentage of the registered voters as signatories and have those people spread across the Commonwealth. 
    I think the number, if you multiply it out right now, is about 15,000 signatures--
