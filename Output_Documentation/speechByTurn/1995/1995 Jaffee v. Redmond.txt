Jaffee v. Redmond

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    We'll hear argument first this morning in Number 95-266, Carrie Jaffee v. Marylu Redmond. 
    Mr. Flaxman.
speaker="kenneth_n_flaxman" startTime="10.739" stopTime="73.273">
    Mr. Kenneth N. Flaxman 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    In Rule 501 of the Federal Rules of Evidence Congress delegated to this Court the power to recognize new evidentiary privileges consistent with the principles of the common law as interpreted in the light of reason and experience. 
    Even before Rule 501, when this Court had full common law power to recognize privileges, the Court was very parsimonious in the privileges that it would recognize. 
    The Court recognized a common law privilege for trade secrets, a common law privilege for informants, a common law privilege for military secrets. 
    The Court rejected a news gatherer's privilege, and an accountant's privilege. 
    Following the adoption of the Federal Rules of Evidence, the Court has continued to be very reluctant to establish new privileges. 
    The Court rejected an editorialist privilege, a State legislator's privilege, an accountant's work product privilege, and an academic peer review privilege.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="73.273" stopTime="75.605">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    When were the Federal Rules of Evidence adopted, Mr. Flaxman?
speaker="kenneth_n_flaxman" startTime="75.605" stopTime="76.844">
    Mr. Kenneth N. Flaxman 
    1973, I believe.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="76.844" stopTime="77.365">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Thank you.
speaker="kenneth_n_flaxman" startTime="77.365" stopTime="103.052">
    Mr. Kenneth N. Flaxman 
    And the Court limited spousal privileges. 
    The respondents in this case ask the Court to fashion a new, broad privilege that would apply to any mental health professional engaged in psychotherapy or counseling. 
    The number of persons engaged in these professions is countless, and the number of conversations that would be protected by this new privilege are countless.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="103.052" stopTime="111.059">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    Well, it's not countless if they're licensed and we confine the privilege to those who are licensed. 
    I assume you could go to every State and count how many licenses there are.
speaker="kenneth_n_flaxman" startTime="111.059" stopTime="123.108">
    Mr. Kenneth N. Flaxman 
    Well, except the States are each day creating new counselor status positions. 
    I think California, there's now somebody who, after 2 years of an associate's degree, becomes a certified alcoholic counselor.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="123.108" stopTime="126.849">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    But are they licensed, or they have some State certification, or is there some document?
speaker="kenneth_n_flaxman" startTime="126.849" stopTime="129.601">
    Mr. Kenneth N. Flaxman 
    Yes. 
    They receive a State license, and they're--
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="129.601" stopTime="130.993">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    Well then, I assume they could be counted.
speaker="kenneth_n_flaxman" startTime="130.993" stopTime="136.076">
    Mr. Kenneth N. Flaxman 
    --They can be counted, but it would be... it would be a very large number.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="136.076" stopTime="140.811">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    And Mr. Flaxman, they would be counted in a diversity case, is that not right?
speaker="kenneth_n_flaxman" startTime="140.811" stopTime="152.884">
    Mr. Kenneth N. Flaxman 
    That's absolutely correct. 
    In a diversity case, the Rules of Evidence require the Federal courts to apply State law in determining privileges. 
    This was not a diversity case, this case. 
    There was a Federal civil rights claim.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="152.884" stopTime="156.599">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Wasn't there one State claim? 
    In addition, there was a wrongful death claim under State law?
speaker="kenneth_n_flaxman" startTime="156.599" stopTime="173.432">
    Mr. Kenneth N. Flaxman 
    There was a supplemental claim brought under State law. 
    The principle that was applied by the district court that was not questioned by the district court is that when there is a State law claim and a Federal claim, that the Federal... and there is no Federal privilege, the rule would be to admit the... admit evidence.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="173.432" stopTime="176.575">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Is there precedent that holds that the State--
speaker="kenneth_n_flaxman" startTime="176.575" stopTime="209.969">
    Mr. Kenneth N. Flaxman 
    There's precedent among... that principle is recognized, I think uniformly within the circuits. 
    It's consistent with the legislative history. 
    I don't think it's been ruled on by this Court. 
    It was not challenged by the respondents in the court of appeals, and I don't believe it's within the questions that are presented in the petition for certiorari. 
    I think the question here is that the agreed question is whether there should be a Federal privilege for this kind of evidence, and this kind of evidence that we're focusing on is not confidential communications about dreams or feelings.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="209.969" stopTime="225.838">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    --Well, is it different in kind from the kind of evidence that would be privileged under the clinical... under a privilege for clinical psychologists? 
    Does the social worker here learn something different in sort of standard counseling--
speaker="kenneth_n_flaxman" startTime="225.838" stopTime="226.209">
    Mr. Kenneth N. Flaxman 
    Well--
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="226.209" stopTime="228.742">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    --from what a clinical psychologist learns and hears?
speaker="kenneth_n_flaxman" startTime="228.742" stopTime="240.662">
    Mr. Kenneth N. Flaxman 
    --Well, we don't know, on this record, what kind of therapy was actually being administered. 
    As a general rule, I think a legislature could make a rational distinction between social workers and clinical psychologists and psychiatrists.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="240.662" stopTime="241.623">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    Because?
speaker="kenneth_n_flaxman" startTime="241.623" stopTime="243.125">
    Mr. Kenneth N. Flaxman 
    Because they'd be different kinds of therapy.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="243.125" stopTime="245.208">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    Well, what is the difference?
speaker="kenneth_n_flaxman" startTime="245.208" stopTime="259.168">
    Mr. Kenneth N. Flaxman 
    Well, I think as a rational distinction a legislature could say that a psychiatrist and a clinical psychologist are going to be more concerned with psychic reality, and a social worker would be more concerned with helping somebody deal with their... the problems that they're facing. 
    We... in the record--
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="259.168" stopTime="267.716">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    I mean, that sounds very sensible just based on the language we're using. 
    As a matter of positive knowledge, is that correct?
speaker="kenneth_n_flaxman" startTime="267.716" stopTime="268.186">
    Mr. Kenneth N. Flaxman 
    --It's--
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="268.186" stopTime="272.588">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    It sounds like a reasonable answer, but is it true, I guess is what I'm saying. 
    [Laughter]
speaker="kenneth_n_flaxman" startTime="272.588" stopTime="281.658">
    Mr. Kenneth N. Flaxman 
    --That's... unlike the number of people who are licensed, that's an answer... that's a question that can't really be ascertained. 
    It can be debated by scholars. 
    It can be debated by interest groups.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="281.658" stopTime="294.113">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    Well-- 
    --Well-- 
    --can we say that there simply are no clear, standard cases on which we can answer that question? 
    In other words, psychiatric social workers do all sorts of things. 
    Who knows what they're doing, is that sort of what you're saying?
speaker="kenneth_n_flaxman" startTime="294.113" stopTime="295.772">
    Mr. Kenneth N. Flaxman 
    That's correct. 
    Our approach.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="295.772" stopTime="311.053">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Well, Mr. Flaxman-- 
    --The brief of the American Psychiatric Association I take it, correct me if I'm wrong, supports the Respondent here, and they don't ask that we draw the line that you're suggesting in this colloquy with Justice Souter.
speaker="kenneth_n_flaxman" startTime="311.053" stopTime="312.976">
    Mr. Kenneth N. Flaxman 
    That brief--
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="312.976" stopTime="313.644">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    Or am I incorrect?
speaker="kenneth_n_flaxman" startTime="313.644" stopTime="329.117">
    Mr. Kenneth N. Flaxman 
    --No, I think you're absolutely correct, but I think they're incorrect in reading the record in this case. 
    The record in this case doesn't support the claim that there was psychoanalytic counseling going on with the social worker and respondent Redmond. 
    The record in this case doesn't reflect anything about the type of therapy--
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="329.117" stopTime="350.221">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    Well, but I infer from their position that formal psychiatric or psychoanalytic sessions are not necessarily different in their objectives than clinical counseling in the more ordinary sense, assuming there's an aura of confidentiality about it, where the confidentiality is expected on both sides.
speaker="kenneth_n_flaxman" startTime="350.221" stopTime="368.127">
    Mr. Kenneth N. Flaxman 
    --No, I think, and I... perhaps I'm misreading their brief, but I think they make a distinction between psychoanalysis and counseling. 
    Psychoanalysis is dealing with psychic truth. 
    Not with what really happened, but with a person's feelings and emotions and dreams about what happened, and about someone's childhood.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="368.127" stopTime="376.553">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Well, Mr. Flaxman, I take it you would not extend in a Federal case a privilege to a psychiatrist.
speaker="kenneth_n_flaxman" startTime="376.553" stopTime="381.438">
    Mr. Kenneth N. Flaxman 
    That's correct. 
    Our primary position is that there should not be any privilege.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="381.438" stopTime="382.069">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Right.
speaker="kenneth_n_flaxman" startTime="382.069" stopTime="384.319">
    Mr. Kenneth N. Flaxman 
    That when there are confidential interests, and we--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="384.319" stopTime="386.962">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Regardless of what differences there might be--
speaker="kenneth_n_flaxman" startTime="386.962" stopTime="387.202">
    Mr. Kenneth N. Flaxman 
    --Right.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="387.202" stopTime="390.354">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    --in the therapy or the nature of the questions.
speaker="kenneth_n_flaxman" startTime="390.354" stopTime="396.388">
    Mr. Kenneth N. Flaxman 
    That's our primary position, is that the confidential interest... and we concede that there are confidential interests in counseling and therapy.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="396.388" stopTime="402.872">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    And yet all 50 States recognize some form of privilege in this area.
speaker="kenneth_n_flaxman" startTime="402.872" stopTime="416.282">
    Mr. Kenneth N. Flaxman 
    Well, some of the... they recognize some form of privilege. 
    Some of those privileges amount to nothing more than the balancing test, the district judge's, the trial judge's discretion that we're seeking in this case, and the States have made different exceptions, and many States--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="416.282" stopTime="430.451">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Now, the court below didn't adopt a clear rule of, there is a privilege and that's that. 
    It went on to balance the need for the evidence?
speaker="kenneth_n_flaxman" startTime="430.451" stopTime="452.606">
    Mr. Kenneth N. Flaxman 
    --Well, the court below adopted a very unconventional definition of cumulative. 
    It said, I think, that because there were four witnesses who were family members of the deceased, and one police officer on the other side in the civil rights case, our learning what the police officer told the social worker, our learning that the police officer had had memory problems, would be cumulative.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="452.606" stopTime="463.314">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    In the area of privileged communications, do the Federal courts typically engage in a balancing in determining whether to apply the privilege or not?
speaker="kenneth_n_flaxman" startTime="463.314" stopTime="478.655">
    Mr. Kenneth N. Flaxman 
    The one circuit that has recog... the Second Circuit has expressly adopted a balancing test, and describes the privilege that it was adopting as nothing more than a requirement that the district judge balance the privacy interest with the opponent's need to know.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="478.655" stopTime="494.866">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well, that's really not much of a privilege, is it, because if everything is going to be balanced at the time the evidence is sought to be admitted... the time the privilege is supposed to work is when the person either feels free or does not feel free to confide to the professional therapist.
speaker="kenneth_n_flaxman" startTime="494.866" stopTime="507.558">
    Mr. Kenneth N. Flaxman 
    Well, we're not seeking disclosures about confidences about feelings or about dreams. 
    We want to know what the client... what the respondent told the social worker about the incident. 
    That's... the district judge said that's all we can get.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="507.558" stopTime="519.395">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well, but that may be a very difficult line to draw. 
    You say you don't want the person's mental reflections and that sort of thing, but it's not always easy to separate those from an account of what happened.
speaker="kenneth_n_flaxman" startTime="519.395" stopTime="534.508">
    Mr. Kenneth N. Flaxman 
    Well, it... the district judge and the magistrate judge who supervised the deposition of the respondent didn't have any trouble dealing with that. 
    It was very clear that we could ask, what did you say about the incident, and when we tried--
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="534.508" stopTime="544.544">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Mr. Flaxman, correct me if I'm wrong about this, but I thought that part of what you were asking did involve mental impressions to the extent that you were asking for the notes of the social worker.
speaker="kenneth_n_flaxman" startTime="544.544" stopTime="554.001">
    Mr. Kenneth N. Flaxman 
    --The notes of the social worker only came up after the respondent testified that she could not recall any of her conversations with the social worker.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="554.001" stopTime="561.785">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Are you now conceding that mental impressions of the social worker, mental impressions reflected in her notes, are things to which you do not have access?
speaker="kenneth_n_flaxman" startTime="561.785" stopTime="576.096">
    Mr. Kenneth N. Flaxman 
    As a matter of relevancy, that's correct, and the district judge said that we could not get her notes when he was ruling on the relevancy question. 
    The district judge said we could get notes that relate to conversations about the incident. 
    It was after--
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="576.096" stopTime="589.987">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    But the conversations, the notes, mix in, as lawyer's notes do, the social worker's own mental impressions with things that the patient or client said about what happened.
speaker="kenneth_n_flaxman" startTime="589.987" stopTime="599.526">
    Mr. Kenneth N. Flaxman 
    --Well, we were given three pages of heavily redacted notes which made clear the things that the client had said about the incident. 
    One of those things is that in November of 199--
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="599.526" stopTime="607.920">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    But I... please just straighten me out on what your position is. 
    Do you say... I thought you were objecting to the redactions.
speaker="kenneth_n_flaxman" startTime="607.920" stopTime="608.532">
    Mr. Kenneth N. Flaxman 
    --Well--
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="608.532" stopTime="612.575">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    I thought you were saying, we want her notes, without the editing.
speaker="kenneth_n_flaxman" startTime="612.575" stopTime="658.699">
    Mr. Kenneth N. Flaxman 
    --We objected to that. 
    The district judge ruled against us, and we agree with the... we're not challenging the district judge's ruling on that, and we've never challenged the district judge's ruling on the redactions. 
    The district judge held a hearing to inquire about these I don't recall, these 15 I don't recalls that came from respondent Redmond when she was asked about the contents of conversations with the social worker. 
    After hearing and observing the character and demeanor of the witness, the district judge said, these denials, these I don't recalls are wholly incredible, and the only way to refresh her recollection is to review all of the notes, and the review just for counsel's eyes only. 
    That order about production of the notes wasn't about a privilege or about confidentiality, it was to help us cross-examine her. 
    It was sanctioned for this meeting.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="658.699" stopTime="683.275">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    The propriety of that particular resolution I'm not sure is before us, or that the Court is interested in, but it seems to me very odd. 
    It's standard for you to ask a witness, have you talked to your attorney, and the unprepared witnesses will say, oh, no. 
    Well, everybody knows that that's incredible, but if the witness responds in that incredible way, that isn't an open door to then inquire about all the conversations with the attorney.
speaker="kenneth_n_flaxman" startTime="683.275" stopTime="685.178">
    Mr. Kenneth N. Flaxman 
    That's correct. 
    The attorney client--
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="685.178" stopTime="712.446">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    And it seems to me that if this is any kind of a privilege, that the same rule should apply here. 
    If she makes a statement that's incredible that she didn't go to a social worker or that she didn't discuss the event, I don't think that necessarily opens the door under the trial judge's ruling to explore everything that was said under any conventional privilege. 
    Now, if you want to have some different sort of privilege here, I suppose that's something altogether separate.
speaker="kenneth_n_flaxman" startTime="712.446" stopTime="723.495">
    Mr. Kenneth N. Flaxman 
    --Well, there's a vast difference between conferring with an attorney who is an officer of the court, who is interested in following the law and not helping somebody change their recollections of an incident, to going into therapy.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="723.495" stopTime="733.189">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Mr. Flaxman-- 
    --You say an attorney isn't always interested in changing someone's recollections of an incident? 
    [Laughter]
speaker="kenneth_n_flaxman" startTime="733.189" stopTime="757.537">
    Mr. Kenneth N. Flaxman 
    An attorney should not be helping somebody change their recollections and commit perjury, and if an attorney does that, then the attorney is subject to sanctions. 
    If a therapist does that, and helps somebody sleep at night after they did a horrible thing, then the therapist has succeeded. 
    The goals of therapy are quite different than the goals of an attorney. 
    An attorney is ultimately answerable to the court as an officer--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="757.537" stopTime="781.193">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Mr. Flaxman, you said earlier that the privilege recognized by some States, which amounts to a balancing of the importance of the information versus the... I guess, what, the confidentiality of it, that that isn't much different from what would be applied anyway in the absence of a privilege.
speaker="kenneth_n_flaxman" startTime="781.193" stopTime="791.734">
    Mr. Kenneth N. Flaxman 
    --In some States there is a judicial override. 
    There's a privilege, there are exceptions to the privilege, then there's a final exception that provided, however, the trial court may in the exercise of its discretion--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="791.734" stopTime="793.634">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Allow it in.
speaker="kenneth_n_flaxman" startTime="793.634" stopTime="795.545">
    Mr. Kenneth N. Flaxman 
    --Or allow it to be disclosed.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="795.545" stopTime="798.908">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Yes, but that still is a privilege of sorts, isn't it?
speaker="kenneth_n_flaxman" startTime="798.908" stopTime="799.479">
    Mr. Kenneth N. Flaxman 
    It's a privilege--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="799.479" stopTime="801.622">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    I mean, it's different from the rule which would be applied otherwise.
speaker="kenneth_n_flaxman" startTime="801.622" stopTime="806.344">
    Mr. Kenneth N. Flaxman 
    --That's correct. 
    It's like the Second Circuit's privilege that they're... just a balancing test.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="806.344" stopTime="815.012">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Now, any of these privileges that exist in other States, has any of them been adopted judicially, as a matter of common law? 
    Are they all legislated?
speaker="kenneth_n_flaxman" startTime="815.012" stopTime="826.171">
    Mr. Kenneth N. Flaxman 
    The Alaska supreme court adopted in State v. Allred, and the Arizona supreme court. 
    Other than that, all of the privileges have been adopted by legislative action.

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    What is the nature of the Alaska and the Arizona privilege adopted--
speaker="kenneth_n_flaxman" startTime="829.543" stopTime="835.199">
    Mr. Kenneth N. Flaxman 
    The Alaska privilege applied to psychologists and psychiatrists did not extend to social workers, and the Arizona--

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    --Absolute?

    --That's correct.

    It's an absolute privilege.
speaker="kenneth_n_flaxman" startTime="837.250" stopTime="852.623">
    Mr. Kenneth N. Flaxman 
    No. 
    Well, I think all of the privileges have been limited with the duty to disclose that someone is dangerous, or that there's a child abuse admission. 
    There are no absolute privileges in psychotherapy in any State in this--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="852.623" stopTime="854.743">
    Justice Antonin Scalia

    Mr. Kenneth N. Flaxman 
    --That's correct. 
    There are always instances where a therapist has to... is required by law to make disclosures, and so there can't be this guarantee of absolute privilege which the American Psychiatric Association would urge and would seek.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="868.403" stopTime="889.990">

    You asked us to recognize a line between statements about fact and statements about feeling, and I confess that I'm skeptical that we could do that. 
    What if somebody says to the social worker or the psychologist, 
    "I feel bad about killing somebody. "

    Mr. Gregory E. Rogus 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    In enacting Rule 501, Congress declared that the Federal courts are to look to reason and experience in determining evidentiary privileges. 
    The intent behind the rule as evidenced both in the legislative history and as acknowledged by this Court in the Trammel decision was not to freeze the law of privilege as it existed but to allow the courts flexibility to develop rules of privilege, once again in line with reason and experience. 
    Now, it is true, as Mr. Flaxman has mentioned, that decisions of this Court have counseled caution in terms of the recognition of privilege. 
    However, this Court has also stated that when a privilege promotes sufficiently important interests to outweigh the need for probative evidence, recognition and implementation of a privilege is proper. 
    Now, in this case the Seventh Circuit acted consistent with its authority under Rule 501 and consistent with this Court's directive in Trammel, and determined that reason and experience justified a recognition--

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    --Well, I'd consider that case-by-case, myself. 
    If you subscribe to what Justice Scalia just said, the purpose of the privilege is to enable the attorney or the doctor, whoever, to tell a person, I suppose, that what you say here is confidential, and if instead he has to say, what you say here may be confidential, depending on how some future court may balance the need for your testimony, that's much less disposed to get people to confide.

    Mr. Gregory E. Rogus

    Justice David H. Souter 
    You keep speaking of the function, and if you speak in terms of the function, then there's never any question as to whether, if a privilege for psychotherapy is recognized, it would cover social workers, as in this case. 
    Let's assume that I agree that there ought to be a privilege so far as communications back and forth between the patient and a psychiatrist are concerned and the patient and a clinical psychologist are concerned. 
    Is there a difference between what the clinical psychologist does in the kind of standard case and what the psychiatric social worker does?
speaker="gregory_e_rogus" startTime="1930.492" stopTime="1951.086">
    Mr. Gregory E. Rogus 
    My understanding, based upon what was developed in the record, and the research, and the information provided by the amici, is that the training, the education, and the functioning of clinical social workers approaches if not equates to what clinical psychologists do in terms of performing the psychotherapeutic function, of doing psychotherapy.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="1951.086" stopTime="1957.221">

    Mr. Gregory E. Rogus 
    Well, there is... I wouldn't say that one degree is more advanced than another. 
    There are a lot of Ph Ds, for example, in the clinical social work field, just as there are Ph D advanced degrees in psychology. 
    Much of the training, the clinical experience, as I believe was developed in the record with respect to Ms. Beyer, who... the clinical social worker who was involved in this particular case, demonstrates the amount of experience, the quality, the type of experience she had, much of which overlapped with that which a clinical psychologist--

    Justice David H. Souter 
    But I suppose--

    No, I understand that, but I just don't see the relevance of the fact that there is a duty of confidentiality. 
    There are duties of confidentiality in a lot of situations which we've simply, utterly ignored. 
    Parent-child, there's no parent-child privilege, for Pete's sake.

    But in principle, apart from that line-drawing methodology, there's no reason to draw it there, is there? 
    I have had law clerks tell me things in confidence, and I presume they felt better after telling me.

    As the Court indicated in Trammel, we certainly, in terms of formulating the Federal rule, can look to State law for guidance, but inasmuch as there was a Federal question involved in this case, and under the language of 501, we can look to State law for guidance, but State law as State law would not control the question.

    It tells us that the privilege of a witness shall be governed by the principles of the common law as they may be interpreted by the courts of the United States in the light of reason and experience.

    Mr. Gregory E. Rogus 
    At the common law prior to the early seventies there was no vast body of case law indicating one way or the other whether there was a psychotherapist patient-privilege or not. 
    There were courts that were starting to entertain the notion of a psychotherapist patient-privilege. 
    Based on the analysis provided by many of the commentators, it was at about that same time that many of the courts were getting involved in addressing that issue that many of the legislatures simultaneously also began to take action in terms of not only looking at, for example, the social work profession and stepping up the amount of State regulation of the profession itself, but also enacting provisions providing for privilege.

    Mr. James A. Feldman 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court. 
    Rule 501 provides that the privilege of a witness shall be governed by the principles... not the specific privileges, but the principles of the common law as interpreted by the courts of the United States in the light of reason and experience. 
    In our view, the most significant feature to look to in determining what reason and experience tells us here is the fact that all 50 States have recognized the privilege in one form or--

    Justice David H. Souter 
    Well, they recognize something. 
    I mean, your brother was just saying that, I think, that what we should recognize is a presumption of confidentiality subject to exception by weighing. 
    If we go no further than to do that, is it even worth the trouble?

    Mr. James A. Feldman 
    --Yes. 
    I think that that would be something useful to do. 
    It's not our position that that's what the courts ought to do. 
    I think under Rule 501, the Federal courts ought to take a cautious view towards the recognition of privileges. 
    It ought to be sure to recognize the general policy of the Federal rules in favor of the admissibility of evidence, but where a privilege is justified, and especially where the 50 States have so... have at least uniformly recognized the important interests that are at stake in a case like this, I think the Federal courts should do likewise. 
    The fact that all 50 States have recognized it I think shows that they recognize the importance of psychotherapy in the relief of mental and psychological distress for people. 
    I think they've recognized the need for confidentiality, the very strong need for confidentiality.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="2762.415" stopTime="2773.680">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Mr. Feldman, how could you justify a psychologist-social worker privilege without recognizing a medical doctor privilege?
speaker="james_a_feldman" startTime="2773.680" stopTime="2815.147">
    Mr. James A. Feldman 
    There has been... in our view the case for medical doctor privilege has not yet been compellingly enough made, and I'll tell you why. 
    First, there are fewer States that recognize it. 
    Second, if you look at the way the States recognize it, they generally... it generally has even more exceptions, and there's even... there's less of it than with respect to a psychotherapist-patient privilege. 
    As the advisory committee on the proposed rules in 1973, or around there, recognized, if you look at their commentary on the psychotherapist-patient privilege, which was in those proposed rules, and the doctor-patient privilege was not, they noted that confidential communications are even more important for the successful practice of psychotherapy than for the successful practice of medicine.
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="2815.147" stopTime="2866.853">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    Well, that's just exactly... what can I read to find out about this? 
    I mean, I'm used to, as many of us, having diversity cases, where, of course, there is the privilege you're arguing for and also a medical doctor privilege. 
    That's the normal case we find it in. 
    I've never had a case, I don't think, where it came out of the Federal system and a medical doctor, but Mr. Flaxman seems to agree... I agree with him. 
    I don't know how you distinguish between a patient who comes in with a gunshot wound, and the doctor's got to find out what happened, and a psychiatric social worker who says, I'd like you to tell me what your problem was in this case, or some other. 
    How can you do the one without the other, and what were the objections to the doctor privilege? 
    Why wasn't a rule written on that? 
    Where do I... what do I read to find out about this? 
    It didn't seem to me very fully developed in the briefs.
speaker="james_a_feldman" startTime="2866.853" stopTime="2911.263">
    Mr. James A. Feldman 
    In the advisory committee notes on Rule... proposed Rule 504, they do specifically go into that question, and they cite a previous paper that was issued by the Group for the Advancement of Psychology... I don't recall the exact name... that explored the subject more fully. 
    There's also been a number of other things that are cited throughout the amicus briefs about it. 
    But the general point, and the general reason why the States have seen fit to recognize one to a greater extent than the other is that, although confidentiality is no doubt important for the practice of medicine, it's important for the practice of many things. 
    It's probably important for accountants. 
    It's important... it's generally an important value, but the extraordinary level of confidentiality that a privilege involves, that step should only be taken where it's clearly justified.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="2911.263" stopTime="2960.678">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Mr. Feldman, why... let's assume that the consultation occurs in a State that has the very negligible... under State law, the very negligible privilege that you said it's worth adopting, but it won't do a whole lot of good, so all that that person can tell the client is, you know, under State law, you have very little assurance of confidentiality. 
    Why should a Federal court accord to that social worker or psychiatrist a greater degree of confidentiality than the State itself? 
    Shouldn't the maximum Federal protection be where the consultation has occurred in State X, we will accord whatever confidentiality the courts of State X accord? 
    I can't see any Federal justification for going further than that, or any use, for that matter.
speaker="james_a_feldman" startTime="2960.678" stopTime="2966.150">
    Mr. James A. Feldman 
    It would certainly be a possible rule to set the Federal ceiling at the State floor.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="2966.150" stopTime="2975.027">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Well, wonderful, but can we do that under the Federal rule? 
    It seems to me the Federal rule has to be uniform, so isn't this eminently an area that we should leave to legislation?
speaker="james_a_feldman" startTime="2975.027" stopTime="2996.163">
    Mr. James A. Feldman 
    I think that... I've two answers. 
    I think... first of all, I think Congress has made it quite clear and the Court has said in its opinions that this is something that the courts have to grapple with one way or the other. 
    A decision one way or the other... a decision not to recognize a privilege in a State that has a very strong privilege, for example, is going to do some damage to that State's policies, and what that State has recognized as necessary for the advancement of... or for--

    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    Well, it's not just that State's policy.

speaker="james_a_feldman" startTime="3009.145" stopTime="3032.830">
    Mr. James A. Feldman 
    --I wanted to get to the second point, which was that in our brief we suggest that the key question is whether a confidential relationship is formed, and that question, since States are the primary level of government that governs the relationships of psychotherapists and patients, as with most other professions, the question of whether a confidential relationship, a highly confidential, an extraordinarily confidential relationship is formed, I think it's reasonable to look to State law for that.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="3032.830" stopTime="3036.793">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    So you look to licensing, plus the extent of privilege, State by State?
speaker="james_a_feldman" startTime="3036.793" stopTime="3044.400">
    Mr. James A. Feldman 
    I think you'd look to the question of whether the privilege extends to this kind of a relationship. 
    As far as the specific narrow exceptions to the State--
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="3044.400" stopTime="3048.524">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    Under the rubric of whether or not there's a reasonable justification to believe that the communication is confidential?
speaker="james_a_feldman" startTime="3048.524" stopTime="3084.590">
    Mr. James A. Feldman 
    --Under the rubric of, if there's... the Federal privilege... a necessity for the application of any privilege is that a confidential relationship is formed. 
    In attorney-client privilege, if you're not a member of the bar in a given State... the State gets to determine who's a member of the bar. 
    If you're not a member of the bar, there's no question that you don't have a privilege in Federal court, and similarly with the marital privilege and other kinds of privilege. 
    In the same way, it's up to the State to determine whether a confidential relationship has been formed, and that's a prerequisite for the application of the Federal privilege. 
    Once you have that, I think the exceptions in the States follow enough of a pattern that--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="3084.590" stopTime="3088.681">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Mr. Feldman, in this case would Illinois have recognized a privilege for what's at issue here?

    Mr. James A. Feldman

    Mr. James A. Feldman 
    It would... no more--
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="3103.774" stopTime="3166.197">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    Okay. 
    But the reason I... let me tell you why I ask the question. 
    Part of the premise of your argument is, the value of recognizing the privilege depends upon the value of the confidentiality in the relationship. 
    Now, we can't tell what the value of the confidentiality in the relationship is unless we go State-by-State and find out which States have strong privileges, which States have just weak privileges. 
    And so I guess what we would have to do is to say well, if majority of the States have really strong privileges, that would probably justify our recognition of the strong privilege, but if a majority of the States have a weak privilege, it wouldn't do any good for us, at least in those States, to recognize a strong privilege because it would have no effect on the relationship. 
    The social worker would have to say, I can't guarantee much. 
    Is that what we should do, is sort of do a nose count and find out whether we're going to get much for our privilege or a little for our privilege?
speaker="james_a_feldman" startTime="3166.197" stopTime="3201.320">
    Mr. James A. Feldman 
    --I think not quite. 
    What the Federal court should do is look to see whether the State recognizes, for instance, a relationship between a psychiatric social worker and a client as being one that's entitled to a very high confidentiality protection and accords it a privilege. 
    If in that State the State has said, social workers in this State... you can go to see a social worker, but we're not going to accord it any privilege at all, it's just not that confidential a relationship, you don't have a reasonable expectation that a confid... it would be like going to see somebody about a legal problem who's not a lawyer. 
    You can do it, I suppose, but you can't... it's not going to be privileged.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="3201.320" stopTime="3211.846">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    Yes, but on your understanding, if there were 45 States that recognized a social worker's privilege and 5 that didn't, you would say we ought to recognize it, right?
speaker="james_a_feldman" startTime="3211.846" stopTime="3212.707">
    Mr. James A. Feldman 
    I think--

    As a uniform Federal rule.

   Rebuttal of Kenneth N. Flaxman
speaker="kenneth_n_flaxman" startTime="3235.054" stopTime="3280.399">
    Mr. Kenneth N. Flaxman 
    Thank you. 
    I have always been tantalized by the idea that if you tell someone, you tell this to me I'll keep it a secret, that that could be a privilege, that the court should enforce that kind of promise, and as a matter of fact, that used to be the law. 
    It used to be called the gentleman's privilege. 
    I think in about the 18th Century to 17th Century, courts stopped enforcing that privilege. 
    In Branzburg v. Hayes, this Court explicitly recognized that that used to be the law and it is no longer the law. 
    The question of whether the confidential communication should be recognized by... protected by a privilege or protected by case-by-case balancing I think should be answered in favor of case-by-case balancing.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="3280.399" stopTime="3308.341">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Could I ask a question about State law? 
    I assume that even in Illinois, the Illinois psychiatrist or social worker could not give assurance that even a State law action would not require... it would depend upon where the action came up. 
    I assume that an Indiana court would apply Indiana's rules; isn't that right? 
    So that if the lawsuit were in Indiana, the Illinois social worker, by reason of being an Illinois social worker, wouldn't have a special privilege in Indiana.

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    No, I'm not saying what it should do, but isn't that the way things work? 
    These are forum rules, so that Illinois can only assure that an Illinois social worker will not be compelled to testify in an Illinois forum.

    Mr. Kenneth N. Flaxman 
    --That's correct, but Illinois can't even make that assurance, because the common law trend of courts has not been to create privileges, it's been to create exceptions to broad statutory privileges. 
    We've seen that in Illinois, where there aren't exceptions, or evidence that might be relevant in a criminal case, where courts have created an exception.

    Mr. Kenneth N. Flaxman

    There was just a recent amendment to the Illinois statute which says that the social worker could reveal confidential communications to her employer, and if this was in State court we would argue that this exception and all the other exceptions require the courts, when the evidence is crucial, as we would argue it is crucial in this case, should fashion yet another exception, and courts in other States--
