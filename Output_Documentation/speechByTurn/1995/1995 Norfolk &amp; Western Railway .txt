    Justice Clarence Thomas 
    The second case I have to announce is a bit more obvious, it is a Norfolk and Western Railway Co. versus Hiles, No. 95-6. 
    This case comes to us on writ of certiorari to the Illinois Appellate Court for the Fifth Judicial District. 
    Railroad cars are connected by couplers located in both ends of each car. 
    The couplers attached to a housing mechanism on the car by drawbar that is designed to have some lateral plate to prevent moving cars from the derailing on a curved track. 
    As a result of this lateral movement, drawbars may remain off-center when cars are uncoupled and must be realigned manually to ensure proper coupling. 
    Respondent William Hiles injured his back while attempting to realign an off-center drawbar and sued petitioner Norfolk and Western Railroad Company in Illinois State Court arguing that the misaligned drawbar was a violation of Section 2 of the Federal Safety Appliance Act. 
    This law prohibits railroads from using cars that are not equipped with couplers that will automatically couple on impact and uncoupled without the necessity of employees going between the cars. 
    The Trial Court ruled in favor of Hiles and the Appellate Court affirmed. 
    We now reverse. 
    Hiles argues that the statute was violated because the car would not couple until he realigned the drawbar and he could not do that without going between the cars. 
    We disagree primarily because the language of Section 2 requires only that railroads equip their cars with standardized automatic couplers. 
    Section 2 does not independently prevent railroad employees from going between railcars. 
    We have previously recognized that employees must take certain preliminary steps to ensure proper performance of automatic couplers before a court can find a violation of Section 2 and today we hold that realigning a misaligned drawbar is one of those preliminary steps. 
    We decline to adapt an interpretation of Section 2 that suggest a misaligned drawbar is by definition a malfunctioning drawbar nor can we accept Hiles suggestion that Section 2 required the railroads to develop new technology for automatic realignment. 
    The judgment of the Illinois Appellate Court is reversed. 
    The opinion of the Court is unanimous.
