    We'll hear argument next in Number 95-668, Auciello Iron Works, Inc. v. National Labor Relations Board. 
    Mr. O'Reilly, you may proceed.
speaker="john_d_oreilly_iii" startTime="17.053" stopTime="155.092">
    Mr. John D. O'Reilly, III 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    Some 8 years ago we started what I thought was a run-of-the-mill, garden-variety type labor dispute which has grown and grown, and here we are. 
    In the course of a collective bargaining dispute, the... a strike arose; picketing took place. 
    Immediately during the course of this garden-variety dispute, 40 percent of the employees, the bargaining unit, crossed the line, the same 40 percent which, it's a small unit, that 40 percent is only 9 employees, were badmouthing the union. 
    The employer, during the course of this 5 or 6-week strike, obtained the belief that because of the 40 percent the union did not have the tremendously strong percentage of support, and it shot across the bow of the union bargaining position a rather extreme shot. 
    It beefed up its contract proposal. 
    However, the significant point, when it beefed it up, it did not have, then, reason to believe that the union was not a majority representative. 
    It had every reason... in fact, the... it would... to believe that the union still maintained its majority status, but it shot this across the bow of the union, this beefed-up union proposal, and at that time the negotiations are broken off. 
    The very next day, the union abandoned the picket line, the pickets went down, and a number of extraordinary events took place over the next 3 business days. 
    Everyone... almost everyone came back to work. 
    Of those who came back to work, a number of them did the same as their predecessors, the 40 percent who had come back earlier, had crossed the picket line, were knocking the union, being very critical of the union. 
    In fact, four additional employees resigned from the union after they came back, spoke to company representatives and said, we don't need the union, I don't know why we wanted a union in the first place. 
    Three of these individuals who were thus bad-mouthing the union had been picketing that Friday morning. 
    Friday afternoon they were in saying to the company, ah, we never needed a union here in the first place.

    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Did the board deal with the case in that posture, or not? 
    I somehow thought that we had before us a... the issue of whether there was a good faith doubt, not whether there was in fact lack of support.
speaker="john_d_oreilly_iii" startTime="202.223" stopTime="217.544">
    Mr. John D. O'Reilly, III 
    --Justice O'Connor, I believe you have both issues before you. 
    The facts clearly indicate... for instance, the company's telegram that it sent eventually, in response to the union's Sunday evening telegram said we have reason to believe that the union no longer represents a majority.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="217.544" stopTime="235.325">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    There may be any number of facts in the case that are not before us. 
    Your question presented is whether an employer is bound by a union's acceptance of an earlier proposal for a collective... when at the time of the union's... the employer had a reasonable basis for a good-faith doubt of the union's continued majority status.
speaker="john_d_oreilly_iii" startTime="235.325" stopTime="237.446">
    Mr. John D. O'Reilly, III 
    That is correct, Mr. Chief Justice.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="237.446" stopTime="241.650">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    I don't see that as raising the question in fact as to whether the union had lost its majority status.
speaker="john_d_oreilly_iii" startTime="241.650" stopTime="264.214">
    Mr. John D. O'Reilly, III 
    Well, of course, in fact that was... Mr. Chief Justice, that was raised in our original answer to the complaint 8 years ago at the labor board. 
    We also used the phrase, good faith doubt, and the reason we did is because it's easier for an employer to defend and to prove its defense by... through circumstantial evidence of creating a good faith doubt, but we did--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="264.214" stopTime="274.559">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Well, the issues are quite different, possibly, and I wonder if we aren't bound by how the question is presented in your petition for certiorari.
speaker="john_d_oreilly_iii" startTime="274.559" stopTime="315.398">
    Mr. John D. O'Reilly, III 
    --I think the issues may vary, but I... in this particular case I think they're so closely intertwined that they can be treated as one and the same. 
    For instance, the court of appeals, who heard... of the First Circuit heard this case twice, and both in their first decision, as well as in their second decision, they treated it, notwithstanding the original issue having been framed as a good faith doubt case, they treated it in both decisions as a question of the employer attempting to prove before the administrative law judge and before the National Labor Relations Board that in fact the union had lost its majority status.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="315.398" stopTime="325.083">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    And is that the board rule, that even if you were to show unquestionably, never mind good faith doubt, that the union no longer had majority status, that the same result would ensue?
speaker="john_d_oreilly_iii" startTime="325.083" stopTime="343.506">
    Mr. John D. O'Reilly, III 
    No, I think the only difference, Justice Scalia, would be if we, the employer, had raised and proved... established at the trial level that we had a good faith doubt, it would then be incumbent upon general counsel to establish that in fact the union had maintained a majority--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="343.506" stopTime="358.434">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    But I'm asking you what the board rule is. 
    Is the board rule that neither the establishment of a good faith doubt, nor even the establishment of actual nonmajority status will suffice to get you out of the contract here?
speaker="john_d_oreilly_iii" startTime="358.434" stopTime="370.623">
    Mr. John D. O'Reilly, III 
    --No, as I understand the board decision, they would... decisions, they would take the position that if we had established under the facts of this case actual loss of majority, or at least my friends at the--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="370.623" stopTime="370.943">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Right.
speaker="john_d_oreilly_iii" startTime="370.943" stopTime="375.806">
    Mr. John D. O'Reilly, III 
    --AFL-CIO in their amicus brief said that would be enough. 
    The board has reserved in this case--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="375.806" stopTime="376.487">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Okay.
speaker="john_d_oreilly_iii" startTime="376.487" stopTime="388.074">
    Mr. John D. O'Reilly, III 
    --its position with regard to whether or not the actual loss of majority would have entitled us, under the facts of this case, to send... fire back that reply telegram disavowing any further obligations--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="388.074" stopTime="390.866">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    So it is a separate question, then, and--
speaker="john_d_oreilly_iii" startTime="390.866" stopTime="396.469">
    Mr. John D. O'Reilly, III 
    --I suspect it is, but we feel the result would be the same under both scenarios.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="396.469" stopTime="411.209">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    --Mr. O'Reilly, would you... my understanding was that your friends at the AFL-CIO took the position, but there's only one way to establish that the union has lost its majority, and that is through a secret ballot.
speaker="john_d_oreilly_iii" startTime="411.209" stopTime="447.694">
    Mr. John D. O'Reilly, III 
    They... Justice Ginsburg, they took the same position, of course, and filed an almost identical brief in the Curtin Matheson case, saying that the board rule that this Court has implicitly affirmed over the years, the board rule that a good faith doubt entitles you to withdraw your recognition of the union, they took the position in that case and in the amicus in this case that that is no longer a good rule, and that the only way an employer can contest the majority status of an incumbent union is to file a decertification petition, and I--
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="447.694" stopTime="451.117">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    And they also said in their brief that general counsel had recommended such a position to the board.
speaker="john_d_oreilly_iii" startTime="451.117" stopTime="452.036">
    Mr. John D. O'Reilly, III 
    --Well--
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="452.036" stopTime="453.308">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Where does that stand, do you know?
speaker="john_d_oreilly_iii" startTime="453.308" stopTime="482.506">
    Mr. John D. O'Reilly, III 
    --My understanding, I've had an opportunity to look into that. 
    I contacted... and I can only reflect was I was told by the employer's counsel in that case, that the... and there is a board decision some 3 years ago in that case. 
    It was on appeal to the District of Columbia court of appeals, and the board then requested that it be referred back to the board. 
    Counsel for the employer indicated that all argument in that case was conducted a year and a half ago, and no decision has come out of it.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="482.506" stopTime="492.992">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    So we may be talking about something that really doesn't matter anymore. 
    I mean, if they deep-six the whole good faith doubt rule, it doesn't matter. 
    You would have to have a--
speaker="john_d_oreilly_iii" startTime="492.992" stopTime="496.705">
    Mr. John D. O'Reilly, III 
    Well, I would just suggest if you look at the... if my--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="496.705" stopTime="499.948">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    --I mean, it matters to your client. 
    I don't want to say it doesn't matter to you.
speaker="john_d_oreilly_iii" startTime="499.948" stopTime="519.441">
    Mr. John D. O'Reilly, III 
    --But I'm not sure what the likelihood is of the board adopting that particular view of the scenario I just described. 
    This case was decided within the last year. 
    Oral argument in the Lee Lumber case was a year-and-a-half ago. 
    The board certainly would have had an opportunity to adopt the general counsel's position in the meantime and at least, certainly in this case, deny it.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="519.441" stopTime="551.322">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    But if you... we... you are going in this case on the proposition that there's a reasonable doubt rule, so that the question is, at what point can the employer... it's really a timing question. 
    I think the reasonable doubt... I think you're agreed, are you not, that if you had withdrawn the offer on the 18th or 19th on the basis of your good faith doubt, there would be no contract that they could accept.
speaker="john_d_oreilly_iii" startTime="551.322" stopTime="554.634">
    Mr. John D. O'Reilly, III 
    There would be nothing out there for them to accept, is correct.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="554.634" stopTime="563.299">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    So why can't the board say, we have to draw the line some place, we're going to draw it at the union's acceptance of the contract?
speaker="john_d_oreilly_iii" startTime="563.299" stopTime="602.165">
    Mr. John D. O'Reilly, III 
    Well, of course, the board is apparently adopting this bright line theory that it's a lot easier to administer the act if we have a specific date, and obviously, I don't have a problem with that concept, but what I'm just saying is the specific date that they have picked, the bright line rule in this case, there is no logical basis for it. 
    The logical basis apparently is that sending a Sunday evening telegram somehow transforms a union that the employer had every reason to then believe had a good faith doubt as to its majority status, somehow this telegram, Sunday evening telegram, transforms that apparently minority union into a majority union.
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="602.165" stopTime="606.467">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    I take it that their basis is not a telegram, their basis is a contract, all right.
speaker="john_d_oreilly_iii" startTime="606.467" stopTime="606.947">
    Mr. John D. O'Reilly, III 
    Created--
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="606.947" stopTime="608.239">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    So once the contract is created--
speaker="john_d_oreilly_iii" startTime="608.239" stopTime="608.940">
    Mr. John D. O'Reilly, III 
    --Created by--
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="608.940" stopTime="611.171">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    --you can't question it for the period of the contract bar.
speaker="john_d_oreilly_iii" startTime="611.171" stopTime="611.791">
    Mr. John D. O'Reilly, III 
    --Yes.
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="611.791" stopTime="618.077">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    And it doesn't... I mean, what is illogical about saying there's a contract bar, it starts when the contract was created?
speaker="john_d_oreilly_iii" startTime="618.077" stopTime="618.454">
    Mr. John D. O'Reilly, III 
    If--
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="618.454" stopTime="625.200">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    If you have a complaint about the union, make it before the contract is... after, you're barred. 
    That's the contract bar, right.
speaker="john_d_oreilly_iii" startTime="625.200" stopTime="625.701">
    Mr. John D. O'Reilly, III 
    --And that's--
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="625.701" stopTime="628.603">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    And that, as I understand it, is the rule, and why is that illogical?
speaker="john_d_oreilly_iii" startTime="628.603" stopTime="656.492">
    Mr. John D. O'Reilly, III 
    --And that's their bright line theory. 
    I think the illogical argument comes into play this way, Justice Breyer. 
    We have an obligation, as an employer dealing with any union, at all times to see to it to investigate, to analyze what is the status of this union? 
    Is it a majority union, or is it a minority union? 
    Obviously, if it's a minority union, does not represent a majority of employees, it's illegal under the statute for us to--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="656.492" stopTime="662.454">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Is that right, even though it's been certified? 
    Can you be subjected to liability for dealing with a properly certified union?
speaker="john_d_oreilly_iii" startTime="662.454" stopTime="685.009">
    Mr. John D. O'Reilly, III 
    --Yes, Your Honor, at least beyond the... this is... the certification in this case, and of course, none of the employees who were involved in that certification process are still employed by the company, but the certification in that case was in the 1970's, as I recall, so you have... you could deal with... the board principle is that once it's certified there is an irrebuttable presumption no matter what happens to the majority status for a 1-year period.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="685.009" stopTime="685.948">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    For 1 year.
speaker="john_d_oreilly_iii" startTime="685.948" stopTime="694.904">
    Mr. John D. O'Reilly, III 
    So even though you know, as a matter of moral certainty, that the union has lost its majority status during that year, not only is it not illegal to deal with them, you have to deal with them.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="694.904" stopTime="709.544">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    But that gets us back to Justice Breyer's question that I don't think you fully answered. 
    The point was, why not make the contract bar rule become effective upon the acceptance of a contract? 
    We know when contracts are accepted, we know when they're not. 
    Why not make that the bright line rule?
speaker="john_d_oreilly_iii" startTime="709.544" stopTime="732.090">
    Mr. John D. O'Reilly, III 
    We suggest, Justice Kennedy, that the employer should have an opportunity, when it is going across a crescende of events that happened in this case during this 3-day period, should have an opportunity to analyze, review those events, to see whether in fact it is dealing with a majority or a minority union, and in this case we suggest that it didn't have.

    Mr. John D. O'Reilly, III 
    Well, I'll just take two of the major events, if I may, Your Honor, that led to the employees eventually creating in its own mind the good faith doubt. 
    Seven union supporters, including the union steward, the employer received that information on Friday afternoon, that hearsay information that these seven are employed elsewhere, and aren't coming back. 
    Now, they should have an opportunity to review that. 
    Have... was that decision made out of anger? 
    Are they going to be back next Wednesday, maybe, the next week?

    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    May I just interrupt with one question to be sure I understand correctly? 
    If you did review it thoroughly and concluded... and assume the facts are that, even though you had your doubts, that there still was majority support for the union, why is it all unfair? 
    If the other had happened, if you had been able to prove there was not, your doubt was correct, even though they'd accepted the offer you could get out of it, couldn't you?

    Mr. John D. O'Reilly, III 
    Our position is, we would be... if at the time of that telegram, and we had the opportunity to conduct this investigation, even though we had not won that race to the telegraph office, we would be protected, and that's our position in this case, Justice Stevens, that the mere fact that they send a telegram before we have an opportunity to fire off our withdrawal... and I'd ask the Court to bear in mind that this was Thanksgiving week, it was a 3-day week, and Sunday of week... we couldn't fire it back, obviously, that evening.

    We would suggest it is not, and I would remind the Court, as I am sure we do not have to, that in that case there was an unknowing violation.

    Mr. John D. O'Reilly, III 
    --But a contract bar rule would never be based upon an agreement that in turn is an unfair labor practice. 
    When an employer enters into an agreement with a union not maintaining majority status, that contract would not legitimately serve as the basis for a contract bar, so we're saying that if you adopt a contract bar rule by analogy in this case, we are saying that when that telegram was fired off, the union more than likely knew, and we definitely knew, that they didn't maintain a majority status.
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="1162.070" stopTime="1172.297">

    But even if they've lost their majority status during the time of the contract, and different people, people come in and say, look, we represent the workers now, junk that, you can't do anything about it.

    Mr. John D. O'Reilly, III 
    I think you have to focus on when was the collective bargaining agreement that serves as the basis for the... what was the basis of the offer and acceptance? 
    What was the status of the parties as of that offer and acceptance that created that contract? 
    We're saying in this case if the status of the union as of the date of that purported acceptance was that the union did not maintain a majority status, there cannot be a contract, and the implications of a legitimate contract do not flow. 
    A legitimate contract, of course, creates for the... if it's a 3-year or less contract, for the balance of that collective bargaining there is an irrebuttable presumption that the union, notwithstanding its actual status over the 3 years, there is an irrebuttable presumption that it is maintaining its majority status so as to encourage the parties to deal with each other. 
    We do not have that premise, namely a legitimate majority status, at the time of the inception of this, or conception, I guess, of this agreement.

    Mr. Richard H. Seamon 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court. 
    The narrow issue before this Court is the reasonableness of a rule of the National Labor Relations Board that concerns the timing of an employer's assertion of a good faith doubt a union's majority status.

    Mr. Richard H. Seamon 
    Justice O'Connor, the board has not addressed that issue, and it reserves it in this case. 
    It would obviously present very different considerations in light of decisions such as Ladies' Garment Workers, but we emphasize that at issue in this case is only a claim of a good faith doubt of majority status.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="1652.302" stopTime="1661.818">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Well, is it possible that if in fact there was no majority support that it would be an unfair labor practice for the employer to enter the contract?

    Mr. Richard H. Seamon 
    It is possible but I would emphasize that one important difference to which Justice Ginsburg alluded between the present context and Garment Workers is that Garment Workers involved a voluntarily recognized union, whereas the present case involves a union that was certified by the board.

    Mr. Richard H. Seamon 
    Emphatically so. 
    In fact, at every stage of the proceeding where petitioner had an opportunity to make a claim of an actual loss of majority support, it failed to do so. 
    In its answer to the general counsel's complaint of an unfair labor charge, it specifically asserted a good faith doubt, but did not assert a loss of--

    Mr. Richard H. Seamon 
    We agree with the judge that, under established board precedent, once the board finds that the parties have reached a binding collective bargaining agreement, it is unnecessary to consider the issue of a respondent's alleged good faith doubt of the union's majority status. 
    I would also refer the Court to page 54a of this same filing, which is from the board's second supplemental opinion in this case. 
    On page 55a, the very last sentence in the footnote states, we further emphasize that the case before us does not involve allegations of an actual loss of majority status.

    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    Well, I suppose the only way we really know that the... correct me if I'm wrong, that we know in a legal sense that the board... that the union doesn't have majority status is that there's been a certification, or decertification petition and an election, and it seems to me the employer is being put in a very difficult position here where it makes the quite careful, measured statement that it has good faith doubt, which is a term of art in the labor law, and then you fault him for not saying that he knew. 
    It really amounts to a very trivial difference, it seems to me.
speaker="richard_h_seamon" startTime="1837.655" stopTime="1850.985">
    Mr. Richard H. Seamon 
    Well, one of the reasons that the board has developed the good faith doubt rule is the recognition that it can be difficult, in the absence of a decertification, to prove an actual loss of majority status.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="1850.985" stopTime="1859.219">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    And it seems to me that the employer acted quite consistently with the dictates of the labor board and the dictates of the labor law in that regard.
speaker="richard_h_seamon" startTime="1859.219" stopTime="1891.200">
    Mr. Richard H. Seamon 
    The labor law permitted it to assert a good faith doubt, but it also required it to take other steps to either withdraw its offer and then assert the good faith doubt to petition for an election before the new agreement was entered into by the union's acceptance of its offer. 
    And it shouldn't be lost sight of that the employees themselves had an opportunity to file a petition for decertification during the window period from 60 to 90 days before the collective bargaining agreement expired and again after the agreement expired and before a new one was entered into.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="1891.200" stopTime="1941.372">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    But isn't the force of your argument somewhat undercut by the fact that the board is reserving the question of what the result should be if, in fact, the claim was and was proven that there had been a loss of majority support? 
    Because one of your arguments is there is need to have a bright line rule for the sake of stability and industrial peace once a contract has been formed, but now I understand the board is saying, well, we reserve the question whether there is such a need if it can be shown that the union actually had lost majority support. 
    So if... it seems to me that the practical effect of that is going to be that so long as that question is reserved, that any employer with a good faith doubt is going to make in good faith a claim that in fact majority support was withdrawn--

    Mr. Richard H. Seamon 
    --I acknowledge, Justice Souter, that one of the difficulties that would arise from creating a different rule for claims of actual loss of majority status from the rule that applies to good faith doubt claims is that employers would be tempted to circumvent it by a mere point of pleading, to say not only did I have a good faith doubt, but I also believe that the union in fact lost majority status, and that may, in fact, be a consideration that the board could validly take into account if and when in the future it addresses the question of whether the rule should be different.

speaker="richard_h_seamon" startTime="1993.636" stopTime="2004.944">
    Mr. Richard H. Seamon 
    It is a very serious question for the reasons elaborated in the Ladies' Garment Workers decision.

speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="2004.944" stopTime="2011.708">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    So you're saying that the need for the bright line is still there, but there just may be a circumstance in which, need or no need, we simply cannot have the benefit of it?
speaker="richard_h_seamon" startTime="2011.708" stopTime="2027.719">
    Mr. Richard H. Seamon 
    --That is right, and again, quite apart from the employer's temptation to plead an actual loss of majority status, it is perfectly logical for the board's rule to operate upon the acceptance of the petitioner's outstanding contract offer. 
    In this case--

    Justice David H. Souter 
    No, but... may I interrupt you, though? 
    That would not be the case... the board is reserving the question, as I understand it, whether any bright line rule would operate upon acceptance if it can be shown that at the time of acceptance majority status had been lost, isn't that correct?
speaker="richard_h_seamon" startTime="2044.270" stopTime="2045.211">
    Mr. Richard H. Seamon

    It is under submission before the board following oral argument, which occurred about a year ago, but I would say it's far from clear whether the board is going to address the general counsel's argument that the good faith doubt rule should be abandoned. 
    That is not the primary argument in that particular case, and the general counsel emphasizes that the board doesn't need to address it at all.

speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="2123.741" stopTime="2228.250">
    Unknown Speaker 
    The acceptance was a logical point for cutting off consideration of claims of good faith doubt, because it was that point in this case that ended the strike and restored productivity at the plant, and from the point of view of the National Labor Relations Act, that is an event of central importance. 
    More generally, when unions accept contract offers from employers, that marks a fundamental alteration in the relationship between the parties. 
    After that point, it is reasonable for the board to require the parties to accept the results of the process and get back to the productive enterprise in which they both have such an important interest. 
    I would also suggest that in any event it is not necessary for the Court in this case to decide whether, in lieu of a bright line, the board should have adopted a rule that would require it to determine in every case whether the employer had a reasonable opportunity to investigate and to voice its good faith doubt, because petitioner did have such an opportunity. 
    Most or all of the evidence on which it premised its good faith doubt was received 6 days before the union accepted petitioner's contract offer, and has arisen earlier in the argument. 
    At any time, petitioner had the option of withdrawing its offer. 
    It also could have petitioned for an election. 
    It didn't take any of these options, nor did it break off negotiations and take its offer off the table. 
    It may ultimately be for the board to balance, but the rule that it's adopted almost encourages employers to continue making allegations as to good faith doubts and disrupting the bargaining process. 
    It seems to me much more sensible to do it post hoc.
speaker="richard_h_seamon" startTime="2228.250" stopTime="2266.915">
    Mr. Richard H. Seamon 
    Well, in many ways the most sensible approach, and the approach that is preferred for purposes of the statute, is for the employer to file a petition for an election, assuming that the employees themselves have not availed themselves of that right. 
    This Court recognized that in Brooks, and it also recognized that the reason for that is that we can justifiably be concerned about employer's attempts to vindicate the rights of employees, especially when the employees themselves have ample opportunity to assert those rights. 
    The Court in Brooks said, in fact, that allowing employees to assert the rights of employees was not conducive to industrial peace, it is inimical to it.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="2266.915" stopTime="2279.014">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    But Mr. Seamon, wouldn't that be a burden for a small company like this? 
    There's only 23 employees. 
    Wouldn't it be an expense? 
    They've got to hire a lawyer to petition the board for an election.
speaker="richard_h_seamon" startTime="2279.014" stopTime="2322.332">
    Mr. Richard H. Seamon 
    It is not necessarily a particularly elaborate procedure, and in this case, of course, the litigation that ensued was quite as extraordinary as it would have been had... as it might have been had the employer taken the preferred route and filed the petition for an election in the first place. 
    And it also bears emphasizing that the board's rule does not permanently foreclose an employer from asserting its good faith doubt. 
    Instead, if the employer fails to raise the doubt before an employer has accepted the offer, the employer simply has to bid his time during the contract term. 
    When the contract expires, it again has an opportunity to assert its good faith doubt.

    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    Do the board rules permit this particular employer to go back and raise the other half of the claim, or has it lost... have they lost that? 
    I mean, I take it initially they thought there was just going to be one rule, actual good faith the same, and then they found out there wasn't. 
    There's a division... good faith, they lose, actual, we haven't decided.

    Mr. Richard H. Seamon 
    --I'm not certain of the answer to that question, but I would suggest that there's a very good argument that they've waived the argument to the extent that the board made it quite clear in both of its decisions that it considered this case as presenting only a good faith doubt, and petitioner could have sought reconsideration of the board's decision on the grounds that the board had overlooked one of its claims, but it failed to do so.

    Mr. Richard H. Seamon 
    That's right, and I believe the petitioner in this case had ample opportunity. 
    It was quite clear... it's been clear since the Celanese Corporation decision in 1951... that there are two separate claims that can be used to justify refusal to bargain. 
    One is a good faith doubt, the other is an actual loss of majority status, so petitioner... the clarity of the board's precedent can't be blamed for petitioner's failure to raise both claims if it thought both were grounded in the facts.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="2403.666" stopTime="2468.208">
    Unknown Speaker 
    The board's rule serves the interest in repose for the most part by drawing a bright line after which the parties are required to accept the results of the negotiation process, and it also prevents sand-bagging, which can occur where an employer decides that it is going to keep its doubts regarding the union's majority status to itself during the negotiation process and raise them after an agreement has been concluded if it decides in hindsight that the agreement is not to its liking. 
    We're not suggesting that that was operative here, and that it is a very real concern in the general run of cases. 
    Do we have... refer to Judge Campbell's opinion on page 2a of the petition. 
    The second time around he says, several years ago the National Labor Relations Board petitioned this court for enforcement of an order and we retain jurisdiction. 
    The board has now at long last responded. 
    Did the board ever offer any explanation for the years it took in this case to reply to the Second... the First Circuit's request?

    Mr. John D. O'Reilly, III 
    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 
    I do want to emphasize the manner in which the First Circuit dealt with this case, and it dealt with it on the basis of being a loss of majority case. 
    If I may just briefly, in addition to the reference at page 3a, the Court makes identical references on pages 80a, 82a, and in the specific order of remand to the board at page 83a it continuously refers to the issue as being a loss of majority, and it is easy to somehow distinguish, or sometimes confuse the distinguishing factors. 
    In fact, in this case there is a reference to the Chicago Tribune, the Seventh Circuit case. 
    That was a clear loss of majority case. 
    In the board's brief before this Court it says that has nothing to do with that, that was a loss of majority case, and this is a good faith doubt case. 
    Yet if... I direct the Court's attention to the board's own decision in this Auciello case. 
    How does it refer to... on seven different pages of the board's decision in this case, it refers to the Chicago Tribune case as being a good faith doubt. 
    It continuously says the employer raised its good faith doubt. 
    So sometimes the distinction between the two is not as clear as we would like it to be, so I think we have adequately raised the actual loss of majority in this case. 
    Notwithstanding the fact it was not expressly raised in the answer to the board, it was raised a number of times in the briefs, and that's how the court of appeals addressed it. 
    It remanded it to the board to deal with an actual loss of majority scenario, and the board can't pick and choose, I would submit. 
    While... even though the First Circuit told us to do it, number 1, quickly, we are not going to do that. 
    It had told us to deal with the actual loss of majority case. 
    It can't dictate that. 
    That's up to the court of appeals, and I think the issue is a live one before this Court. 
    Certainly... thank you.
