    Mr. Patrick A. Mullin 
    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    In this case, there is no dispute that the Government made a motion which asked the district court for a sentence that reflected the petitioner's substantial assistance. 
    The issue before this Court is whether that Government motion was sufficient to permit a sentence which both departed from the guidelines and was also below a statutory minimum. 
    Petitioner submits that the Government's motion was sufficient, and bases his position on the language in the pertinent statutory and Sentencing Guidelines provisions.

    Mr. Patrick A. Mullin 
    That... no, Mr. Chief Justice, I don't agree with that.

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well, the question presented, and I believe it was presented in your petition, is... let me get the petition. 
    It's, once the prosecutor moves for a sentencing departure in recognition of a defendant's substantial assistance to law enforcement, does a Federal court have authority to impose a sentence beneath both the guideline range and a minimum term set by statute, even when the Government does not seek the latter degree of departure? 
    You say, then, the Government did move under section 3553(e)?
speaker="patrick_a_mullin" startTime="135.480" stopTime="146.337">
    Mr. Patrick A. Mullin 
    --Oh, no, no, I'm not saying that they brought... that they specific... they specify their application as being under section 3553(e), Mr. Chief Justice. 
    What I'm saying is that the court had authority to--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="146.337" stopTime="154.603">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well then the Government... at least the Government's motion by its terms was not made pursuant to 3553(e), you agree with--
speaker="patrick_a_mullin" startTime="154.603" stopTime="230.623">
    Mr. Patrick A. Mullin 
    --Oh, that is correct, Mr. Chief Justice, yes. 
    Their motion was brought by letter, I would note, but was accepted as a form of notice of motion by both parties as specifying that a motion was being brought under section 5K1.1 of the guidelines. 
    It is our position that that motion permitted Judge Sarokin in the District Court of New Jersey to depart not only from the applicable guideline range, which in that case was 135 to 168 months, but also below the 10-year statutory minimum that was in place in that case, or in this case. 
    The three provisions enacted in the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986 establish a regime to reward substantial assistance by defendants. 
    Section 3553(e) imposes a Government motion requirement for sentences below statutory minimums. 
    In section 994(n), Congress directed the Sentencing Commission to, and I'm quoting from the statute now, which... it is found at the appendix Al... assure that the guidelines reflect the general appropriateness of imposing a sentence lower than would otherwise be imposed.

    Mr. Patrick A. Mullin 
    Moving down to the first line, Congress directed... let me state the language. 
    Assure that the guidelines reflect the general appropriateness of imposing a sentence lower than would otherwise be imposed... and this is the key language... including a sentence that is lower than that established by statute as a minimum sentence. 
    And it's petitioner's position that the Congress directed the Commission to establish a regime to regulate the substantial assistance motions to include, and as it states here, not only departures from the applicable guideline range but also departures below mandatory minimums.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="296.647" stopTime="303.420">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist

    Mr. Patrick A. Mullin 
    That is correct, yes. 
    That's what the Commission did. 
    The Commission took the motion requirement under section 3553(e) together with its directives under 994(n) and created a one motion, or a single motion approach, and required that once the Government brings a single motion, then the court has the authority to depart not only from the applicable guideline range, but also below statutory minimums, and this can be found not only in section 5K1.1, but also in the commentary to section 5K1.1 and other commentary found throughout the guidelines.

    In the reply brief, or brief?
speaker="patrick_a_mullin" startTime="451.647" stopTime="537.613">
    Mr. Patrick A. Mullin 
    Of my original brief. 
    In Note 7, as I was stating, section 2D1.1 deals with drug cases. 
    Most of the mandatory minimum cases at the Federal courts entertained are drug cases. 
    That's the reality of it, and Note 7 deals with this issue of departure below mandatory minimums, and the language I think is very instructive as to what it says and what it doesn't say. 
    Note 7 says that a mandatory minimum sentence applies, this mandatory minimum sentence may be 28 U.S.C. section 994, by reason of a defendant's substantial assistance in the investigation and prosecution of another person who has committed an offense. 
    And then it cites section 5K1.1 for that proposition. 
    Nowhere in this note is there any reference to section 3553(e). 
    If the Commission were looking to create a two-track system, or if the Commission were looking to not get involved in departures below mandatory minimums, and to basically not accept the authority that is given to them by the Congress, they would not have put that in there, section 3553, and they did not.

    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Well, section 994(n) doesn't refer by number to 3553(e), I take it, but it does say the commission shall ensure that the guidelines reflect the general appropriateness of imposing a lower sentence, including a sentence that's lower than established by statute as a minimum sentence, to take account of a defendant's substantial assistance.

    Mr. Patrick A. Mullin 
    Well, it was... yes. 
    It was passed as the exception to the otherwise rule that a court can't depart, or can't sentence below mandatory minimums, so it does create the authority for that.

    Justice Antonin Scalia

    Correct.

speaker="patrick_a_mullin" startTime="643.803" stopTime="677.195">
    Mr. Patrick A. Mullin 
    What the guidelines do is require that the Government bring a motion based upon a defendant's substantial assistance, and that is what section 3553(e) requires, before there can be departure below a mandatory minimum, and it's the petitioner's position that under section 5K1.1 the Commission devised a scheme where only one motion has to be brought for a departure both from the applicable guideline range as well as below statutory minimums, so there is the motion requirement met under section 3553.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="677.195" stopTime="691.234">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    You are saying that the guidelines have the power to say that a motion to move downward in the guidelines, to depart from the guidelines is, ipso facto, a motion under 3553. 
    Isn't that what you're saying?

    Well, that isn't correct as a statement of law, is it? 
    I mean, as a statement of law the Commission can't monkey around at all with the statute, has nothing to do with it. 
    The Commission's job is simply to say what the circumstances are under which you can depart from a guideline.

    All right, and if that's true, they could say, I'll tell you one situation in which you can depart downward from a guideline. 
    One situation... and there may be others, but one situation in which you can depart downward from a guideline, 99 percent of which have nothing to do with mandatory minimum statutes, one situation is where the Government makes the same kind of motion and shows the same kind of assistance that they'd have to show if this were a statutory case and they were interested in the statute. 
    That's the situation in which you can depart from a guideline for that reason. 
    That would have been within the Commission's power.
speaker="patrick_a_mullin" startTime="740.825" stopTime="741.606">

    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    All right. 
    Then how does that affect your case? 
    If, as I read this, the Commission said just that, we'll tell you... we'll tell you when you can depart downward from the guideline on the question of substantial assistance. 
    Judge, you can do that if you are in the same kind of situation where, if there were a mandatory minimum, which most of the time there isn't, it would suffice to get you below the mandatory minimum. 
    The Commission might well have thought that. 
    Now, how does that affect your case, because they're telling you that in this case it isn't that kind of situation. 
    That kind of motion wasn't made, and I guess the Government has the right not to make that kind of motion.

    I don't know where that gives authority for the executive to be involved in the judicial function of sentencing. 
    Now, I recognize that this is true under the statute, because the statute requires this.

    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    And I suppose you can say, well, the Commission is simply borrowing from the statute to assume that the Justice Department has a sufficient interest here that there can be no departure absent its motion, but I seriously question whether or not the judge is prohibited from downward departure absent the Government's motion in a guidelines case. 
    Well, I would think perhaps that 5K1 that you were just quoting, that requires a Government motion, does it not?

    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    But it doesn't... 5K1.1 doesn't say it's the exclusive way to get a downward departure for substantial assistance. 
    None of the 5K's say they're exclusive, and the beginning of the guideline specifically says at the beginning, in discussing departures, that the Commission... specifically says it, that the... with specific exceptions, and it doesn't mention 5K1.1 is one of them. 
    The Commission does not intend to limit the kinds of factors, whether or not mentioned anywhere else in the guidelines, that could constitute grounds for departure in an unusual case, so that to me has left open this question. 
    But limiting factors is quite different from saying whether or not there has to be a motion. 
    You agree that 5K1.1 requires a motion. 
    Yes.

    They then go to the judge at the time of sentencing, say, and the defendant asks for a downward departure on the basis of substantial cooperation and says, these facts are sufficient to establish what we think is going to justify a lower sentence.

    A motion was brought here under section 5K1.1 for departure, and it's our position Judge Sarokin had the authority to depart below the mandatory minimum range.

    Mr. Mullin, suppose the Commission should say, we understand there's some confusion about this downward departure for cooperation, so now we're going to speak clearly, and we're going to say the discretion is with the prosecutor, 1) to go below the guidelines, 2) to go below the mandatory minimum. 
    The discretion is not with the judge. 
    The judge cannot act unless... cannot go below the guidelines unless there is a motion to that effect, cannot go below the mandatory minimum unless there's a request to that effect, so it's not a question of whether one motion or two, but who has the discretion. 
    If the Sentencing Commission made it clear that it thought it had... the prosecutor had the discretion on both questions, do you have any case left?

    Mr. Mullin, you're not relying on any language in the operative portion of 5K1.1. 
    You're just relying on the application note, which simply notes that under circumstances set forth in 3553 and 994, substantial assistance would justify a sentence below the statutory required minimum, but the text of 5K1.1 simply says, upon motion of the Government, blah, blah, blah, blah, the court may depart from the guidelines. 
    That's all that the operative provision says it may depart from.

    Mr. Patrick A. Mullin 
    Justice Scalia, that is correct, and that is the operative language, departure from the guidelines. 
    There is nothing in that section which limits where the departure can take place, and 5K1.1--

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Right, nothing that limits it, but nothing that approves departure from something else, either.

    It could have said, from the guidelines and from any applicable statutory minimum, but that's not what it said. 
    How could it have said the latter, since the Commission has no authority whatsoever to govern the statutory part. 
    Well, and also, aren't... departures from the mandatory minimum are a subcategory of departures from the guidelines.

    Mr. Irving L. Gornstein 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    Our position is that a district court has the authority to impose a sentence below the statutory minimum only when the Government files a motion requesting such a sentence, so that when the Government moves for a departure from the guidelines to reflect the defendant's cooperation, but does not move for a sentence below the statutory minimum, a district court does not have the authority to impose a sentence below the statutory minimum. 
    We think that result is compelled by the text of 18 U.S.C. 3553(e), which is on page 2 of our brief.

    Mr. Irving L. Gornstein 
    The converse is true, but to address Justice Stevens' point, what the Commission has said in application Note 1 is that the only time you can do that is under the circumstances set forth in 18 U.S.C. 3553 (e), so it sends you back to the statute, and what you have to decide is what is the meaning of the statute, and it says that, upon motion of the Government, a court shall have the authority to impose a sentence below a level established by statute as a minimum sentence so as to reflect a defendant's substantial assistance.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="1637.824" stopTime="1661.149">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Well, could the Commission expressly adopt a rule that says, we will deem a Government motion asking the court to consider the defendant's substantial assistance to be a motion that satisfies 3553(e) as well as any guideline?
speaker="irving_l_gornstein" startTime="1661.149" stopTime="1696.883">
    Mr. Irving L. Gornstein 
    We do not think it could. 
    We think that 3553(e) means that there has to be a Government request for a sentence below the statutory minimum. 
    If there is not that kind of request, the Commission cannot deem it one. 
    I would say... I would distinguish that from the situation where the Commission set up a guideline system and said we will only open up a guidelines departure for assistance if the Government first comes in and says, we move for a sentence below the statutory minimum, but the Commission clearly did not do anything like that.

    Couldn't it have said the following? 
    There is a thing, a certain animal. 
    We'll call this animal what happens when you want to go below a statute. 
    The animal has two parts. 
    The Government makes a motion, and the Government says, a special assistance, and there's a statute that describes in words just what that is. 
    Doesn't the Commission have the authority to say, we will tell you when you can depart from a guideline, you can depart from a guideline when you have the statutory animal? 
    Doesn't it have the authority to tell people when it can depart downward for substantial assistance, and doesn't it have the authority to choose that those times are when you have the kind of animal that would allow you to depart from the statute?

    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    --Now, but then the question becomes, did it choose to allow the departure from the guidelines only where, under 5K1.1, there is the statutory animal? 
    The evidence that they give is that they used almost identical words. 
    The words of 5K1.1 are identical to the statute, almost, with irrelevant differences. 
    The second piece of evidence is the note you cited refers to circumstances set forth both in 3553(e), which is the statute, and 994(n), which is the guideline, so there are two pieces of evidence that they meant the same animal, and I see no evidence that they didn't mean it.

    Mr. Irving L. Gornstein 
    And now I'll explain why. 
    First of all, just by using the term, substantial assistance, the terms mean the same thing, but--
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="1819.414" stopTime="1820.763">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    Oh, no, it's more words than that.

    Mr. Irving L. Gornstein 
    --Well, let me start just, that was part of what was similar, and I'll take one bit of it at a time. 
    Just by using the term, substantial assistance, that is a necessary condition, but not a sufficient one for filing a motion to depart from the statutory minimum. 
    The Government must go on to decide whether, in light of that substantial assistance, the seriousness of the defendant's conduct, the level of operation, and a host of other factors, whether that warrants a motion by the Government to seek a sentence below the statutory minimum. 
    Now, there are many cases in which the Government, where there is a difference between the guidelines range, which is significantly above the statutory minimum because a defendant may have a long criminal history, he may be dealing in quantities that are much larger, and--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1871.137" stopTime="1889.528">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    May I interrupt... may I, just with this one thought, concentrating on the words, substantial assistance, you are in effect arguing there are two kinds of substantial assistance, one that justifies a departure from the statute, and the other just justifies a guideline departure, but there's nothing in the text of either document that describes two kinds of substantial assistance.

speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1913.706" stopTime="1928.905">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Yes, but the... well, let me just interrupt you. 
    The seriousness of the defendant's conduct, it seems to me, has already been evaluated in the guidelines, and the general purpose here is to say, to what extent shall we go below what would normally be the correct evaluation of the seriousness of the conduct?

    Mr. Irving L. Gornstein 
    --But on the statutory minimum sentences the Government is perfectly free to take into account that the defendant has engaged in serious conduct and, notwithstanding that he may be giving substantial assistance, we're not going to reward that substantial assistance for somebody who has a 16 to 20-year guideline sentence with something that goes below the statutory minimum.

    Mr. Gornstein, you argued a moment ago that because of the seriousness of the conduct, the Government might very well say, well, we'll go below the guideline but not below the minimum, and you say we shouldn't be placed in a position in which we're forced to do that. 
    But your argument seems to assume that if there is, we'll say, a one-motion procedure and if you speak the magic words, substantial assistance, in for a penny, in for a pound, that's not true. 
    I mean, the Government, on that assumption, does not have to stand moot after its motion is filed. 
    The Government can come in and say, look, judge, don't go below the statutory minimum. 
    The reason you shouldn't go below the statutory minimum is, the conduct is this serious, for reasons A, B, and C, and the second reason is, that isn't the deal we made. 
    The deal we made with this guy was that we would file the motion, and we would then come in and say just what I'm saying. 
    Go below the guideline, but don't go below the statutory minimum.

    Mr. Irving L. Gornstein 
    --The difficulty there, Justice Souter, is there are... the difference in perspective between the Government and the court. 
    In many instances, there is a difference in perspective, and the... where they're going to reach differing conclusions about the value of that assistance.

    Justice David H. Souter 
    That's always been true.

    Mr. Irving L. Gornstein 
    --But I think what that translates into is the behavior of the prosecutor as he makes the deal. 
    If... there... if you're in a situation where the prosecutor thinks that by filing any sort of motion at all it's going to open up a departure below the statutory minimum as well as the guidelines, then there will be a significant number of cases in which the prosecutor will be unwilling to make any deal at all.

    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    But isn't there a possible answer to that, and that's why both Justices... I don't know if this why Justice Kennedy asked the question, but his question raises this. 
    Supposing you lost the case, and I'm not suggesting you will, would it not thereafter still be possible for you to say in a plea bargain, we're not going to make any motions, but if... but we will agree to tell the judge that you had done the following cooperative things, and then the defendant could ask the judge for a departure saying, I've given substantial assistance, and is there anything in the statute that would prevent the judge from going ahead and taking that into account without any motion at all?

    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    Is the office of the Commission to issue a policy statement helping courts interpret what motions are, that there's a presumption that if you make the motion without distinguishing between the two that it means both guidelines and statutes, but that you still have the option to be more specific?

    Mr. Irving L. Gornstein 
    We don't think that the Commission does have that role. 
    We think the Commission's responsibility is with respect to 3553(e) motions it comes in after the Government makes its motion for a sentence below the statutory minimum. 
    It's at that point that the Commission's responsibility takes over in deciding what the sentence will be after that. 
    With respect to 5K1.1, yes, the Commission probably has authority with respect to the guidelines to decide what sort of motion should be filed.

    Mr. Irving L. Gornstein 
    Right, because I think that the statutory minimum penalties are so important, and were deemed so important by Congress, that you really need a very explicit and clear statement by the Government that it is seeking a sentence below the statutory minimum. 
    I think that's what 3553(e) contemplates, that specific judgment that we think that this is not just substantial assistance. 
    And it's not just substantial assistance that warrants a departure from the guidelines or a reduced sentence. 
    It is substantial assistance that, in our judgment, makes it appropriate for this defendant to receive a sentence below the statutory minimum.

    It's not a matter of objecting. 
    As a matter of policy, it's a good idea, but the question comes up in those rare cases where that warning wasn't given what should happen, and we think that what should... happen should be dictated by the statute in that situation.

    Mr. Patrick A. Mullin 
    Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, I know I have a couple of minutes. 
    I just want to address a point raised by Justice Breyer. 
    I believe that Your Honor was questioning the Solicitor General about statistical evidence showing the effect of the departures under section 5K1.1 not only below the guidelines but also below mandatory minimums. 
    I believe the annual report of the Commission, the Sentencing Commission, reflects those statistics, and if this Court wishes I can certainly produce an additional submission to that effect. 
    I would note, and again it's not in my papers, but of the research that I've done in a couple of the circuits, the Ninth Circuit and the Second Circuit that have ruled in favor of petitioner, the number of departure... number of departure applications by the Government has gone up, and has gone up significantly since those decisions were made. 
    But again, if the Court wishes for me to provide that information, I'd be delighted to do it in each one of the circuits where this decision was made in favor of the petitioner. 
    Otherwise, I'll simply rely upon my briefs and on the arguments that I submitted before this Court today, and ask that you rule in favor of Mr. Melendez.
