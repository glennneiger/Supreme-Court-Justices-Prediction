    Mr. Christopher J. Seufert 
    Justice Stevens, may it please the Court: 
    The common law of fraud: Justice Easterbrook in his opinion in the matter of Mayer stated, an intentional deceit concerning a material proposition is fraud whether or not a more alert target would have smelled a rat, as victims of intentional torts need not take special precautions. 
    Under the common law as laid out in the Restatement of Torts section 545(a), a plaintiff's reliance on an intentional fraud must only be justifiable. 
    His conduct does not have to conform to that of a reasonable man, because fraud is an intentional tort. 
    The victim of such is not required to exercise the care of a reasonable man, just that of a reasonable victim.

    Mr. Christopher J. Seufert 
    Yes, Justice O'Connor.

    Mr. Christopher J. Seufert 
    They are, Justice... may I explain +/? 
    similar to a shell game. 
    If you were to be walking in a common or a park, and there were to be a gentleman there, and he has three cups out. 
    If we were talking about false representations, the person who is going to be running the shell game would tell you that I have put the nut in the middle cup. 
    Let's play the game. 
    You can't win, because he hasn't put the nut in the cup. 
    The cups are empty. 
    But he tells you the nut's there, and he has you play. 
    He tells you. 
    He makes a false representation. 
    False pretenses. 
    Say, for instance, the same scenario, we have the same three cups, you walk along in the park, and he's there. 
    He doesn't tell you there's no nut in the cups, but he has the three cups out, and he says, let's play. 
    He puts those facts in place to lead you to the pretence that he's going to play the game honestly and that there's a nut. 
    You still can't win, because there's no nut, but he hasn't misrepresented fraudulently. 
    He's... by false pretenses, by subterfuge. 
    Actual fraud would be that he takes the nut, has the three cups, you walk along, he puts it in the cup, and then by a flick of the wrist takes the nut back out, so he actually does something, an overt act. 
    Three types of fraud. 
    Each one of them has the scienter of intent. 
    He's intending to defraud you one of three ways. 
    You still can't win the game because the fraud's there, and fraud has to be intentional under the Bankruptcy Code.

    Mr. Christopher J. Seufert 
    There's the very old U. S. Supreme Court case of Neal v. Smith that's cited also in the Joint Appendix.

    Mr. Christopher J. Seufert 
    Justice, there can be fraud implied by law. 
    New Hampshire and many other States have a fraudulent conveyances act, which means that if you sell property or give away property for less than fair value when you are about to be sued, or about to incur debts, that the State law considers that's a fraudulent conveyance, even though you had no intent to be fraudulent, you were making a gift.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="442.731" stopTime="484.126">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Let's go back in this case before there was any representation. 
    Suppose the debtor here had simply transferred that property without saying one word to the creditor. 
    Do I understand that the debt would then be dischargeable? 
    There would be no representation at all, just in violation of the agreement the debtor sells the property, transfers the property. 
    The creditor hasn't... doesn't know anything about it till the bankrupt... gets notice of the bankruptcy and finds out. 
    Dischargeable, right?
speaker="christopher_j_seufert" startTime="484.126" stopTime="488.680">
    Mr. Christopher J. Seufert 
    While that is not the facts of this case, I would agree with you, it would be dischargeable.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="488.680" stopTime="529.487">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Well then, can you explain to me the consistency between saying that if the debtor does something to alert the creditor, then the debt will not be discharged, but if he says nothing at all, then it's going to be discharged? 
    So if he does something that's helpful to the creditor at least in raising a red flag, some kind of alert that something's going on in the mind of the debtor, that maybe he's going to transfer this property, then it's not dischargeable, but if he just goes ahead and does it, it is. 
    What sense does that make?
speaker="christopher_j_seufert" startTime="529.487" stopTime="553.322">
    Mr. Christopher J. Seufert 
    If I can maybe explain, if the property would have had to have been transferred without any notification or any back and forth correspondence, that would be fraud under the Fraudulent Conveyances Act in the State of New Hampshire. 
    However, that would be fraud implied by law, so we would have--
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="553.322" stopTime="559.466">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg

    Mr. Christopher J. Seufert 
    --It would be dischargeable, but that is not the facts of this case.

speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="570.853" stopTime="600.463">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    But don't you think that there's a certain anomaly between the debtor being really bad and not saying one word and just doing it, and the debtor saying... giving some tipoff to the creditor? 
    Why should the one be dischargeable, that is, where... the worst conduct that we can attribute to the debtor, saying nothing, lead to a dischargeable debt, and if the creditor, the debtor has said something, then it's not dischargeable?
speaker="christopher_j_seufert" startTime="600.463" stopTime="724.034">
    Mr. Christopher J. Seufert 
    --It may not have been a tipoff, Justice, if I may explain. 
    The letters... if you want to get into a particular fact, the letter that went out to my client says, we know about the due-on-sale, and we do not want to trigger it, therefore we want your consent, making a representation that they knew and wouldn't violate that section, and subsequently they did violate that section when they sent that letter out, and the trial court said that was fraud. 
    That was false pretenses, so that was fraud. 
    If the letter... if the letter had not gone out and there was no representation, well, I know about it and I don't want to violate it, we'd have a tougher... tougher case here before this Court. 
    Those aren't the facts, though, because we have the actual fraud taking place at the time, and there was a finding of the fraud. 
    But the trial court turned on that we needed reasonable reliance. 
    The trial court in the appendix, pages 43 and 44, a party... this was the trial court's findings: A party is not entitled, you know, to be in good faith and just not objectively reasonable. 
    An objective reasonable man standard applies. 
    That would be the standard. 
    If we're using this balancing act and we're looking at negligent representation under the law versus intentional representation, because the law does this balancing act, and if there's intent, scienter, bad intent, evil intent on behalf of the perpetrator, then the law protects the victim by saying, okay, you don't have to prove the reasonableness, you just have to prove that you, in good faith, did rely--

    In other words, do you lose, then, if I think it's the same? 
    If I think all they meant was it had to be justifiable reliance, then you lose the case? 
    I mean, I thought there was this: you know, I go out and I say, hey, will you lend me a million dollars?

    When Congress wrote the two sections 523(a)(2)(A) and (a)(2)(B), you can see a clear distinction that Congress made by including in 523(a)(2)(B) that even if the victim proves reasonable reliance, he also must prove intent to deceive. 
    He has to prove those two elements, the intent and reasonable. 
    That is a departure from the common law, which says if you prove the evil intent, you don't have to prove reasonable reliance.

    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Well, we're talking about evil. 
    I'd like you to tell me why this obligation was obtained by fraud, because your answer to the question, if he has the debt, the creditor-debtor relationship is established, the debtor says nothing and just sells the property... dischargeable. 
    The debtor says something, but still he obtained the credit originally long before there was any representation, so why does this fit within obtained-by fraud, the obtained-by language?
speaker="christopher_j_seufert" startTime="1099.189" stopTime="1125.595">
    Mr. Christopher J. Seufert 
    The extension of credit is what we relied upon before the trial court, because there is a... there was a due-on-sale clause that called forward not only the original note but front-loaded all of the interest that this mortgage was supposed to pay out over its next 10 years immediately up front if the property was transferred without a written consent for transfer.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="1125.595" stopTime="1136.084">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    But in fact nothing formal happened, and what happened is the same thing as if the debtor had said nothing. 
    The due-on-sale clause would have kicked in had the creditor known about it.

    Mr. Christopher J. Seufert 
    That's right.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="1136.812" stopTime="1239.572">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    You have two situations where the creditor didn't know about it, and everything remained the same. 
    There was no new activity, there was no formal extension of the debt, there was just a debt obtained originally without regard to any fraud, and then a continuation of that same debt with no renewal, so I don't understand why we would say this debt was obtained by the fraud where if the debtor had said nothing it would not have been obtained by the fraud. 
    When we're looking at an intentional fraud, fraud in its purest sense, we have to find it wasn't intentional, because there are some negligent frauds, or fraudulent misrepresentations, negligent misrepresentation. 
    There's a difference. 
    If I... I understand your question, if he had done nothing in this case and just transferred the property and not spoken to my client, not given out deceiving letters, it probably would have been dischargeable, Judge, but we have his intent to attempt to deceive by him sending those letters, that I know it's due on sale, and I don't want to trigger it, therefore will you give me consent. 
    When the consent wasn't given, he did it anyways, and he did it during the course of time when he's sending letters back and forth to my client, and that's the evilness. 
    When there is that evilness, Justice, you don't discharge a bad person, or a bad debt in bankruptcy against an innocent victim.

    --I think that's correct. 
    In fact, we disagree with petitioners that the common law elements of fraud, whatever they may be, are controlling in this case. 
    We think the ordinary rules of Federal statutory construction, in particular the language, the structure, and the history of the Bankruptcy Code, are better tools for discerning Congress' intent in this case.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="1294.338" stopTime="1302.893">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor

speaker="alan_jenkins" startTime="1302.893" stopTime="1349.103">
    Mr. Alan Jenkins 
    I think that's possible, Your Honor, but I think the better source is, again, the structure of the code, and in particular the word, fraud, which is used elsewhere in the bankruptcy Code, is used in other Federal statutes which this Court in Grogan v. Garner indicated are better sources for discerning Congress' intent when it used the term fraud. 
    For example, in the False Claims Act, a Federal fraud statute, reasonable reliance is not required. 
    In the securities laws, reasonable reliance is sometimes required, but in particular situations such as failure to disclose, or a fraud on the market theory, reasonable reliance is not required, and so we think that the element of reasonable reliance that was required in this case is not inextricably bound with the term fraud as Congress likely intended it.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="1349.103" stopTime="1357.488">
    Justice David H. Souter

    Mr. Alan Jenkins 
    Well, I think, Your Honor, it's unclear whether false representations and false pretenses are common law terms or whether they in fact are statutory terms. 
    Fraud certainly is a common law term, but we think that in--
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="1371.289" stopTime="1381.364">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    Yes, but there's no definition of them anywhere in the statute, which is a pretty good indication that there is a reference to some place else, and the some place else is State common law, isn't it?
speaker="alan_jenkins" startTime="1381.364" stopTime="1405.880">
    Mr. Alan Jenkins 
    --Well, that may be, but we think that's not the best explanation. 
    In 1978, when Congress created the Bankruptcy Code, revised the Bankruptcy Act of 1898, it introduced the term, actual fraud, and looked to this Court's decision in Neal v. Clark, and that decision indicated that the term fraud means scienter, and that was the purpose that Congress had in mind when it introduced the fraud language.

    Is that in the legislative history?

    Mr. Alan Jenkins 
    It is in the legislative history, and it's cited in our brief, I believe footnote 5.

    Justice David H. Souter 
    Okay.
speaker="alan_jenkins" startTime="1415.667" stopTime="1472.353">
    Mr. Alan Jenkins 
    As I've said, we think that the better tool of statutory construction here is the structure of the Bankruptcy Code. 
    Section 523(a)(2) exempts from discharge two independent categories of fraudulently incurred debts. 
    Paragraph (B) is limited to false statements of financial condition, expressly includes reasonable reliance as one of its elements. 
    Paragraph (A) exempts all other fraudulently incurred debts and contains no such requirements. 
    In our view, the juxtaposition of those two provisions requires the conclusion that reasonable reliance is necessary... must be proved only in the narrower category of false financial statement cases. 
    We think Congress would have had no reason to create two independent provisions, paragraphs (A) and (B), if, as the respondent argues, it had intended for the elements of those provisions to be identical. 
    Congress could instead have simply created... introduced a single reasonable reliance requirement in a unified section 523(a)(2).

    Justice David H. Souter 
    Or it could... I'm sorry.

    Or it could simply have had a separate section and said, if it's a representation about financial condition, it's going to be in writing, and that's all it would have done.

    We look at the language in paragraph (A), a debt obtained by fraud, and argue that requires scienter, which is derived from the fraud language, and causation. 
    Causation generally will require, in all circumstances will require actual reliance, that the listener actually relied on the false statement and that's how the debt was created.

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Well, you've just destroyed your prior argument, then. 
    If you say that the materiality element is enough to distinguish (B) from (A), why do you have to also say that the scienter... that the lack of reliance is necessary to distinguish (B) from (A)? 
    Why can't you distinguish (B) from (A)... (2)(B) from (2)(A) on the basis of any one of those features in (B), that it's materially false, on which he reasonably relied, caused to be made published with intent to deceive? 
    You could say any one of those three.

    It seems to me... you know, the language, we've been talking as though they're common law causes of action, false pretenses. 
    It doesn't say false pretenses, false representation or actual fraud, it says false pretenses, a false representation or actual fraud. 
    It doesn't seem to me like they're talking in terms of common law causes of action at all, and if there is a reasonable reliance recorded it seems to me it comes about simply because we would not interpret the language, to the extent obtained by, to include something that is obtained through unreasonable reliance. 
    The causality does not exist. 
    And I think that's the same way the common law came to its conclusion with respect to fraud. 
    It's not obtained by fraud, if, indeed, the reliance is so unreasonable that no... causality is broken by the stupidity of the person who relied when he shouldn't have.

    We do think that the obtained-by fraud language requires causality. 
    Causation, however, we believe refers to actual reliance. 
    If someone foolishly relies on an intentionally false statement that was intended to deceive the listener, then that statement has caused the underlying debt, whether or not the person happened to be particularly gullible, and that would be particularly true if the speaker knew of this frailty of the listener and used that knowledge in order to incur the debt, but certainly causation would be there, and the obtained-by language would be satisfied.

    Mr. W. E. Whittington, IV 
    Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: 
    I intend first to address the issues raised by Justice O'Connor and Justice Souter as to the differences between false pretenses and the other two in the threesome in 523(a)(2)(A), and then to deal with the subject of whether in fact in false pretenses reasonableness has been required, and then to deal with Justice Breyer's question concerning difference, if any, between reasonable and justifiable. 
    If there's more time after those subjects, I will address other aspects of the plain meaning in the legislative history. 
    We believe that there are actually differences between false pretenses and the second two in the triumvirate. 
    That is, false pretenses is where there never was an intention to pay the debt at all, whereas in false statement, or false representation, or actual fraud, there may have been an intention to pay the debt, but there was a misrepresentation as... usually to security. 
    Obviously, false pretenses can be included in the second category, and the typical false pretenses cases are the credit card cases, where, for example, the borrower has already maxed out his credit card, and so the argument is made that at the time you incurred this debt, you had absolutely no intention of repaying it at all, as opposed to the typical actual fraud case, where the argument is, where you intended to pay it, but you fudged a little on what your means were as to whether you were able to.

    I can't answer the question with respect to Neal, Your Honor, but with respect to other pre-'78 cases, which we've cited at page 15 of our brief in footnote 13, there are, I believe, at least three cases in the 1970 to 1978 timeframe which did, in fact, require reasonable reliance as to 523(a)(2)(A).
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="2098.426" stopTime="2113.745">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    May I ask one other sort of basic question? 
    Is it your position that you would have prevailed under pre-1978 law, or that... or maybe you argue both... the change in 1978 by the addition of (B) gives you an argument that you would not previously have had?
speaker="w_e_whittington" startTime="2113.745" stopTime="2182.341">
    Mr. W. E. Whittington, IV 
    We would have prevailed under both, in our view. 
    That is, (A) 23 (a)(2)(A) in the prior version did, in fact, include actual fraud, actual reasonable reliance, whereas what was then (B), the second part of old 17(a)(2), the cases split, and in order to strengthen the (B) part with respect to written financial statements, Congress added the word, reasonableness, to clarify it. 
    In fact, the Government's brief in footnote 12 at pages 12 and 13 makes this very point, I believe. 
    Reading from the line that starts on page 12 and goes to 13, 
    "In any event, Congress clearly concluded that any judicial trend toward a proof of reasonable reliance requirement in financial statement cases was not so well established as to obviate the need for express inclusion of the requirement. " 
    I think that shows the congressional intent that they wanted to make what is now (B) just as strong as what now is now (A).

    With respect to the pre-'78 common law cases, how do you account for what seems to be a disparity of standards between the cases that you rely on and the Restatement, because I take it the Restatement, in talking about justifiable reliance, really is talking about a less strict standard?
speaker="w_e_whittington" startTime="2206.407" stopTime="2279.046">
    Mr. W. E. Whittington, IV 
    I don't think that's correct. 
    the distinction between justifiable and reasonable, which is the question that Justice Breyer raised, we believe that it's the same in both. 
    The principal case which has used the term justifiable as opposed to reasonable is the Kirsh case in the Ninth Circuit, which in reality was a 1-1-1 split. 
    The majority opinion said that justifiable was different, and there were two votes for that. 
    The third position was that reasonableness was all that was required, and then, splitting the other way, two justices said that, whichever word it is, it was either reasonable or justifiable. 
    The explanation given by the Ninth Circuit was that justifiable includes reasonableness plus other factors, that reasonableness is only 
    "one of the factors in the mix. " 
    and our position is, if we look at the various potential factors in the mix, they could include whether the lender is alerted by some fact, as in our situation, and/or whether the creditor had a duty to investigate.

    Justice David H. Souter 
    But you are conceding, I guess, then, to the extent that you are basing your discussion on the Ninth Circuit, that there is at least some distinction to be made between reasonable and justifiable.

    Mr. W. E. Whittington, IV 
    --That's correct.

    Justice David H. Souter 
    The duty to investigate is always the same on each one.
speaker="w_e_whittington" startTime="2326.528" stopTime="2330.320">
    Mr. W. E. Whittington, IV 
    Well, there may not be a duty to investigate. 
    It may depend--
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="2330.320" stopTime="2334.403">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    But if there is, it will be the same whether we're talking justifiable or reasonable.
speaker="w_e_whittington" startTime="2334.403" stopTime="2410.532">
    Mr. W. E. Whittington, IV 
    --That's correct, and that's the point of the Mayer case, I believe. 
    The Mayer case says, in the first instance, there's no duty to nose out the truth. 
    Then it goes on to say, but an investor or a lender cannot close his eyes to known risks, to known information. 
    That, in our view, is, in fact, the reliance-balancing which is necessary. 
    It's a factual determination of the factfinder which can be affirmed either direction that it goes on the clearly erroneous standard. 
    And so in our view it doesn't matter if the Ninth Circuit is correct, in terms of semantics, that they choose justifiable instead of reasonable. 
    Either way, it should be the process of balancing those factors. 
    I might add that the Ninth Circuit also points to the fact that in California the listing of the common law elements of fraud uses justifiable, which they take out of Prosser in the Second Restatement, which is one of the reasons that the majority opinion in Kirsh looks to the language justifiable as opposed to reasonable. 
    Now, turning to the plain language of the statute, the petitioners say that--

    Mr. W. E. Whittington, IV 
    In other words, our view is the reason that Congress took the trouble to list out the elements, to give us a laundry list, as you were, in section (B), is because they've changed the common law in two ways: writing, and financial statements. 
    Other than those two factors, they exactly track the common law, in our view, which is why there was no need to list out the elements in 523(a)(2)(A). 
    Instead, they could simply give us legal shorthand, if you were, a common law definition, which to lawyers with long jurisprudence connotes all those subsidiary elements in it.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="2475.300" stopTime="2486.787">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Do you agree that (B), the test of satisfying (B) is less strict than the test of satisfying (A), or do I have it backwards?
speaker="w_e_whittington" startTime="2486.787" stopTime="2515.277">
    Mr. W. E. Whittington, IV 
    No. 
    I think that they're equally strict, and in the '70 to '78 case period under the prior law, there was some disagreement as to that. 
    That is, some courts were construing (B) as being less strict, and Congress was concerned about that, so to clarify that, that they didn't want (B) less strict, they threw in the word reasonableness to clarify it, so our position is that (A) and (B) are both equally strict with respect to reliance.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="2515.277" stopTime="2527.262">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Do you agree, though, that (B) was specifically directed at finance companies that relied on written statements that they should not reasonably have relied on?
speaker="w_e_whittington" startTime="2527.262" stopTime="2580.507">
    Mr. W. E. Whittington, IV 
    I think the tightening up of the statute was specifically directed at that. 
    In fact, Judge Berry gave testimony to the House subcommittee that considered this, in which he delivered to them a decision in a case where there was no reasonableness, and he had ruled that therefore there was no fraud, and his view was that that was not appropriate. 
    And then in the language that's been quoted by both the petitioners and the Solicitor General, Congress in both the Senate and the House reports states that it's concerned about finance companies who might even encourage lenders to leave something out. 
    What Judge Berry gave to them was the actual forms that didn't even leave enough room to put the information on there, which was one of the abuses that Congress was concerned about.

    No, I don't think so either, because there's a discharge as of the date... the debtor would have to pay out of future acquired assets, I'm guessing, so I think the answer is no again. 
    Finally, as to the plain language, and why I believe that (A) is simply a laundry list, legal shorthand, is the fact that several justices have pointed out each of the other normal elements of the common law fraud action, although not expressly stated in (A), are read into (A), and I cite the Court to pages 12 and 13 of the respondent's brief... let me just confirm that... which list several cases at the circuit court level that have read those requirements in. 
    We're not aware of any cases that have refused to read those elements in.

    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Well, if you're right, then this case turns entirely on whether we think reasonable reliance is the same as justifiable reliance.

    Mr. W. E. Whittington, IV 
    I don't agree with Your Honor. 
    I think that Mr. Mans should win in either event, because whether the term reasonable is used, or justifiable, on the facts of this case it wasn't possible for Field to be either one. 
    In fact, the Court will recall that in this case Mr. Field had actual knowledge that a Mr. DeFelice was on the property claiming to be the owner, and that was the alleged implicitness representation. 
    That's the term of the bankruptcy court, was that Mr. Mans had implied that he hadn't transferred it, and our view is, whether you use... whether the Court would use reasonable or justifiable, it's neither one for Mr. Field to simply do nothing, not even ask Mr. Mans when he sees him on numerous occasions, golly, is it correct that you've transferred the property to Mr. DeFelice.

    I know both of those things, but still I relied on some letter written 3 years ago that said, I won't... it didn't even said that. 
    It said, I haven't sold the property yet. 
    I haven't transferred it yet. 
    So you'd say, you didn't rely on that.

    Mr. W. E. Whittington, IV 
    Our view is, those are all factors in the mix to be considered by the bankruptcy court, and as an advocate at the trial court level, those are the facts that I'm playing with. 
    Those are the facts that I'm trying to establish, that the creditor was on notice, that the creditor maybe was sophisticated, that the creditor maybe is required by Federal law to do certain investigations and has failed to do that if it's a bank, that the creditor had a special relationship with the debtor that would cause him to normally undertake an investigation... as an advocate at the trial court level, those are all factors in the mix which I would be trying to urge on the factfinder. 
    But the question before the Court, in our judgment, is, should the factfinder be engaging in that analysis, and to that answer... to that question, the answer has to be yes, in our view.

    Mr. Whittington, what about the argument that you made last in your brief that I asked your adversary about. 
    You say that this, in any event all of this is academic, because the credit here was not obtained by the fraud, so whether there's a requirement of reasonable reliance or justifiable reliance is beside the point if the credit wasn't obtained by the fraud.

    Mr. W. E. Whittington, IV 
    Next, I would like to address the collateral estoppel issue, which hasn't been spoken about here today. 
    This Court stated in 1991 in the Grogan v. Garner case that collateral estoppel principles are important, particularly in section 523(a)(2)(A) cases. 
    In Grogan, of course, you decided that the appropriate standard of proof was preponderance as opposed to clear and convincing, and the reason that the Court gave that... decided that was so that collateral estoppel principles would be furthered between State or Federal court actions and the bankruptcy court actions. 
    Under the same analysis, in order for collateral estoppel to work, there needs to be the same grouping of factors in the two types of cases, and in fact there are situations where a case may go to trial first in the State court, let's say, on a common law fraud action, by which it's determined... by which the debtor prevails, let's say, because there was no reasonable reliance, and then some months later, after there's a filing in bankruptcy, there is an inconsistent ruling in the bankruptcy court, or it could be the other way around, if the bankruptcy ruling under 523(a)(2)(A) could be determined first, and there be an inconsistent result the other direction later in State or Federal court. 
    Finally, I'd like to address a subject that was mentioned, I believe by Justice Scalia, which is the role that the reliance element really plays, and I think the answer to that question is that it is the principal tool of the factfinder in determining whether there's actual causation, a link between the misrepresentation on the one side and the action taken by the creditor on the other. 
    That language is expressly picked up by the Kirsh case, quoting Prosser, and that's the reason that it's important for this Court, in our judgment, to maintain the reliance requirement so that in fact judicial factfinders have this important tool to determine that in fact there is a causal link, which is a real one. 
    Thank you very much, and unless there are questions... I thank you.
