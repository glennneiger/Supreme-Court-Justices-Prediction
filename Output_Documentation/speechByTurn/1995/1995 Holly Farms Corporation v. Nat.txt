    This is a case about Union representation for teams that catch chickens for slaughter. 
    The question all these workers properly place in the Union representation unit covering processing plant’s employees as the National Labor Relations Board held and the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed, or should they be ranked agriculture labors exempt from National Labor Relations Act's coverage as Holly Farms, their employer and the petitioners here maintained. 
    In resolving this issue which has divided that all Courts of Appeals, we accord respect to the reasoning in judgment of the National Labor Relations Board because it is the agency entrusted with responsibility for administering the National Labor Relations Act. 
    In not too much detail despite the inescapable fascination of chicken catching as a subject for judicial review, dissenting with Wilkesboro, North Carolina, the processing plant of Holly Farms, a company that produces, processes, and markets poultry. 
    A local of the team state union sought to become the bargaining representative of employees at the Wilkesboro plant including certain workers called live-haul crews teams of truck drivers, forklift operators, and chicken catchers, dispatched to farm where newly hatched chicks are raised, a live-haul crew cathes chickens grown to a size fit for broiling loads them onto truck and holds the birds to the Wilkesboro plant to be slaughtered and prepared for retail sale. 
    Holly Farms hatches and owns the chicks but does not raise them, that job is done on farms owned by independent growers under contract to Holly. 
    An agricultural labor under the governing statutory definition works on a farm as an incident to or in conjunction with the farm's farming operations. 
    While the live-haul truck drivers do not do their part of the crew on the farm, the chicken catchers and forklift operators unquestionably do catch, cage, and load the chicken on the independent grower’s farms. 
    The Board determined however that the team’s work is not incident to or in conjunction with the raising of chickens by the independent farmers instead, as seen by the Board, the live-haul work is conjunction with the slaughtering and market preparation operations at Holly Farm's processing plant. 
    This is the question we conclude on which reasonable minds can and do different. 
    The Board’s current decision adheres to consistent mind of Board decision because we find the statutory language not free from ambiguity. 
    We differ to the Board’s reasonable interpretation of that language as did the Court of Appeals whose judgment we affirm. 
    Justice O’Connor has filed an opinion concurring in the judgment as to the truck drivers and dissenting with respect to the forklift operators and chicken catchers. 
    Her opinion is joined by the Chief Justice, Justice Scalia and Justice Thomas.
