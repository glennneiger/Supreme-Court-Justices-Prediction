    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    I have the opinion in O’Hare Truck Service versus City of Northlake to announce for Justice Kennedy who is absent today. 
    This case comes here on writ of certiorari to the Seventh Circuit. 
    It is an opinion that raises issues that have parallels to those raised in the one I just announced Board of Commissioner versus Umbehr. 
    The petitioner in O’Hare Truck Service versus City of Northlake is a man named John Gratzianna. 
    His company O’Hare Truck Service was in the automobile tolling business and important part of the business depended on referrals from the City of Northlake, Illinois. 
    For at least 30 years, the City had maintained a list of tolling companies which they have acceptable service. 
    When the police received the tolling request, they would call the company next on the list. 
    According to O’Hare’s complaint, O’Hare was removed from the list when Gratzianna refused to support the mayor in his successful re-election campaign. 
    O’Hare’s proprietor Gratzianna instead supported the campaign of one of the opponents of the mayor. 
    In the District Court and in the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, the complaint was dismissed in accord with Seventh Circuit precedents. 
    Cases from this Court such as Elrod versus Burns and Branti versus Finkel protect public employees from discharge based on their political affiliation unless that affiliation is a reasonable requirement for the job in question. 
    The Seventh Circuit declined to extend Elrod and Branti to the protection of independent contractors. 
    We now reverse that judgment. 
    Gratzianna was targeted with a specific demand for political support and on his refusal the City terminated the relationship that based on longstanding practice; he had reason to believe would continue. 
    We see nothing that distinguishes this on the type of coercion exercise in the long line of our cases holding that the government may not condition public employment on an employee’s exercise of his or her First Amendment rights. 
    We see no reason why the constitutional claim here should turn on the distinction between employees and independent contractors. 
    The Constitution accords government officials a large measure of freedom as they exercise discretion adherent in making decisions by the contracting of goods and services but the First Amendment does not deny independent contractors safeguards for exercising rights of political association and political affiliation. 
    The opinion for the Court was authored by Justice Kennedy. 
    The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed the cases remanded. 
    Justice Scalia has filed a dissenting opinion which Justice Thomas has joined.
