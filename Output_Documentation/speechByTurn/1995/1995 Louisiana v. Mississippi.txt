Louisiana v. Mississippi

    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    We will hear argument in Number 121 Original, Louisiana v. Mississippi. 
    Mr. Keyser, you may proceed.

    Mr. Gary L. Keyser 
    Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: 
    Louisiana's circumstances here today are decidedly less happy than they were 3 years ago in November of 1992, when we were here on the same case. 
    Since that time, we have had an opportunity to supplement the trial record from the Federal district court in Vicksburg with more than 200 additional exhibits and more than a dozen new witnesses who have augmented the trial testimony and we believe clarified it perfectly well. 
    Unfortunately, the reason we're here is because we filed exceptions to the report of the special master which has essentially tracked the district court, which was reversed by the Fifth Circuit in favor of Louisiana. 
    We hope to persuade the Court that Louisiana, like all other States, is entitled to some river frontage, to some access to navigation, and that there should not be an interstate boundary along our levee and along the bank of the river at Lake Providence, Louisiana, where the river never found its main course. 
    In order for a boundary to be drawn there, as Mr. Austin Smith contends--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="76.314" stopTime="81.968">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    You say the river never found its main course? 
    Are you saying the thalweg was never west of the island?
speaker="gary_l_keyser" startTime="81.968" stopTime="86.856">
    Mr. Gary L. Keyser 
    --When you say island, Justice Stevens--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="86.856" stopTime="88.006">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Stack Island.

    Mr. Gary L. Keyser

    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Right.

    The boundary is sought to be drawn--

    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Are you saying that the thalweg was never west of that island?
speaker="gary_l_keyser" startTime="98.580" stopTime="149.112">
    Mr. Gary L. Keyser 
    --Yes, sir. 
    Mr. Brien Winkley, the chief hydrologist for the Corps of Engineers, said it was never there, and he produced all hydrographic surveys for all known periods of time to show where the thalweg was every year, and those hydrographic surveys were introduced into evidence, carefully explained by Mr. Brien Winkley, by Mr. Mike Mayeux, a professional land surveyor, and by Dr. Ernie Easterly, who is a forensic geographic and fluvial geomorphologist. 
    All of them tracked the deepest geologic thalweg of the river, the downstream track of navigation for all periods of time, and none of them could find that the river was ever on the Mississippi levee, on the railroad tracks, across the property of Mr. Surles and Mr. House, or even across the Lake Providence Port Commission property, where Mr. Smith drew his boundary line.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="149.112" stopTime="178.112">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Mr. Keyser, I'm confused on that point, because I thought that Dr. Easterly testified in answer... there's this colloquy in the third supplemental transcript at 315, 313 to 15. 
    He's asked the question, so the logical conclusion, then, is that the boundary thalweg was west of Stack Island at its formation, and the answer is, that is correct.
speaker="gary_l_keyser" startTime="178.112" stopTime="200.208">
    Mr. Gary L. Keyser 
    Yes. 
    The answer there refers to the northeast position of the original position of Stack Island in 1881. 
    That's 6 miles, 5 to 6 miles northeast of the Louisiana levee. 
    That's why there's so much confusion in this record. 
    You can never understand from one minute to the next which area you're talking about unless you do it by latitude and longitude.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="200.208" stopTime="208.897">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    Well, if we speak just in neutral terms about disputed territory, that will take care of that confusion, won't it?

    Mr. Gary L. Keyser 
    Or the disputed areas, sometimes referred to the accretion along the west bank at Lake Providence.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="215.218" stopTime="258.664">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    You said in your brief, I believe, that the line as the master has recommended that it be drawn now cuts through property which has been owned and farmed by Louisiana residents since I think the beginning of this century, and that statement was simply hotly disputed in Mississippi's brief as being a factual misstatement. 
    Could you either now, or if you can't do it at this moment, perhaps by a letter to the Clerk after the argument is over, point me to sort of the exact places in the transcript, or the other evidence which supports that statement of yours?
speaker="gary_l_keyser" startTime="258.664" stopTime="291.468">
    Mr. Gary L. Keyser 
    One place you would want to look is to the testimony of Albert Surles, who adjoins the property of Mr. Sam House, who is the sheriff of that parish. 
    Mr. Surles' father bought the property in 1925, and he testified that the accretion which attached to his property he had leased out to another Louisiana witness, Lonnie Styron, and Lonnie Styron was then at that moment, when he was testifying, forming that property. 
    Now, that accretion was not, I don't believe, formed by Mr. Surles' dad, but rather by Mr. Surles himself, and Mr. Styron.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="291.468" stopTime="295.753">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    Okay. 
    Is there any other evidence in the record that you would point to?
speaker="gary_l_keyser" startTime="295.753" stopTime="334.378">
    Mr. Gary L. Keyser 
    I can't think of anything, except Robert... you have to recall that Mississippi really only had two witnesses, Austin Smith, who is their expert, and Robert Jarvis, who is the grandson of the Houston family. 
    Mr. Jarvis' testimony was from an aerial photograph in which he drew a blue ink pen line across the same property and said that was the property of the Houstons. 
    Well, that's the Surles, House, Delony, Shorter property. 
    Actually, the line that Robert Jarvis drew is more westerly than the line that Austin Smith drew.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="334.378" stopTime="346.455">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    Well, that may be, but none of that indicates that a Louisiana family was farming the land since 1900, and I take it it's the Surles' testimony and that alone that you point to.
speaker="gary_l_keyser" startTime="346.455" stopTime="350.924">
    Mr. Gary L. Keyser 
    Yes, sir, and you'll see in the testimony there that there... in fact, the lease was introduced: to evidence.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="350.924" stopTime="351.774">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    Okay.
speaker="gary_l_keyser" startTime="351.774" stopTime="363.148">
    Mr. Gary L. Keyser 
    Thank you. 
    So we're hoping to get some kind of river frontage and some access to navigation. 
    On the subject of Mississippi's expert witness, this is the same man--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="363.148" stopTime="389.732">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Before we leave the thalweg issue, whether it was west of the disputed territory or not, I confess to be totally at a loss to understand what's going on here. 
    In the brief of Mississippi, it is stated in this case it is undisputed that the boundary thalweg was west of Stack Island in its prepatent location. 
    Is that a misstatement?
speaker="gary_l_keyser" startTime="389.732" stopTime="398.755">
    Mr. Gary L. Keyser 
    --No, sir. 
    I think that's true. 
    It depends in any year, any given point in time, when you make a statement, whether or not it's true, because it changes all the time, but--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="398.755" stopTime="404.059">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Well, I'm talking about the prepatent location. 
    It was west of Stack Island, you don't contest that.
speaker="gary_l_keyser" startTime="404.059" stopTime="414.764">
    Mr. Gary L. Keyser 
    --It was west of Stack Island before the New Madrid earthquake washed the island away in 1811, and it was west of Stack Island... another problem--
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="414.764" stopTime="418.901">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    You're saying this isn't Stack Island, isn't that what causes all of this confusion?
speaker="gary_l_keyser" startTime="418.901" stopTime="424.370">
    Mr. Gary L. Keyser 
    --Certainly. 
    That is correct. 
    What the disputed area is is not Stack Island. 
    The originally island was--
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="424.370" stopTime="453.056">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    So if we accept the master's reasoning that in fact you can trace the... I'll call it the migration of this piece of land, whatever it's supposed to be called, from the Stack Island which was east of the boundary thalweg originally to the disputed area now, then your argument falls. 
    If we accept his reasoning for the identity of this land, then that's the end of your argument.
speaker="gary_l_keyser" startTime="453.056" stopTime="454.241">
    Mr. Gary L. Keyser 
    --That's correct.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="454.241" stopTime="464.947">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    And then you do concede... that was the Dr. Easterly testimony that I read, that the boundary thalweg was west of Stack Island at its formation.
speaker="gary_l_keyser" startTime="464.947" stopTime="472.203">
    Mr. Gary L. Keyser 
    In 1811 or prior years, not at 1994, 1995--
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="472.203" stopTime="485.694">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Well, we have just gone through that if this Stack Island continued in existence, then the boundary was west of Stack Island at the island's formation.
speaker="gary_l_keyser" startTime="485.694" stopTime="500.120">
    Mr. Gary L. Keyser 
    --Dr. Easterly's not referring to the Louisiana levee. 
    He's referring to the Mississippi area 6 miles northeast of the area of the dispute. 
    I'd have to reread the testimony you're reading to make absolutely sure, but I'm quite confident that's what he meant.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="500.120" stopTime="517.232">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    And the boundary thalweg, unless Stack Island is washed away, will remain west of Stack Island for all times, unless it is eroded away, and Dr. Easterly confirmed that that was correct.
speaker="gary_l_keyser" startTime="517.232" stopTime="525.088">
    Mr. Gary L. Keyser 
    That's correct, but he's not referring to Lake Providence, he's referring to Mayersville, Mississippi.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="525.088" stopTime="529.140">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    I thought he was referring to Stack Island.
speaker="gary_l_keyser" startTime="529.140" stopTime="544.482">
    Mr. Gary L. Keyser 
    No. 
    I think that colloquy is about where the location of the original island is and all of the exhibits depicted in black at a latitude reference... he's referring to, if the island is washed away... I think they're talking about the island rule there, but I would have to go back and reread it.
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="544.482" stopTime="558.890">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    Maybe I have this mixed up, but I didn't think it was that complicated, so probably I do have it mixed up, but I thought once upon a time there was a place called Stack Island that used to be part of Mississippi, and there was a big river that flowed to the west of it.
speaker="gary_l_keyser" startTime="558.890" stopTime="559.508">
    Mr. Gary L. Keyser 
    Correct.
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="559.508" stopTime="582.505">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    And then that big river that flowed to the west of it began to change its channel and began to flow towards the east of it, and the law is that if the river changes like that, that Stack Island still stays part of Mississippi. 
    But of course, if it really isn't one island, if really the island disappeared and then reemerged later on, when the river was flowing to the east, then it's part of Louisiana.
speaker="gary_l_keyser" startTime="582.505" stopTime="583.357">
    Mr. Gary L. Keyser 
    I agree with--
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="583.357" stopTime="593.796">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    So you're all arguing about whether this was one island called Stack Island, which has always existed, but the river changed course, or that there are three or four or five islands that keep coming back and forth and disappearing.
speaker="gary_l_keyser" startTime="593.796" stopTime="595.081">
    Mr. Gary L. Keyser 
    --That's exactly correct.
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="595.081" stopTime="595.665">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    All right. 
    Fine.
speaker="gary_l_keyser" startTime="595.665" stopTime="596.331">
    Mr. Gary L. Keyser 
    That's exactly what--
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="596.331" stopTime="618.696">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    If that's correct, then looking through this, it seemed to me they made an awfully good case that there was just one island, because they trace it through on all the maps, and then they show that there were cottonwood trees there that are about 100 years old, or 80 years old or something, and they're still there, and it's pretty hard to see how all these trees could have grown on this island that was popping in and popping out, and you have some other evidence, but what is it, because I haven't found it.
speaker="gary_l_keyser" startTime="618.696" stopTime="644.931">
    Mr. Gary L. Keyser 
    --Let me explain what that problem is there. 
    The special master misconstrued Mississippi's only third witness, the forester, Mr. Burkhardt. 
    Mr. Burkhardt was testifying about an 1867 Merriweather map which showed the island accreted to the Mississippi shore at that time, and it did have tall trees. 
    As Austin Smith testified, that island was completely washed away and washed downstream.
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="644.931" stopTime="663.825">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    The only thing I found on your side, or my clerk found so far was that one of these maps, which always talks about Stack Island, had at one point marked through it a thing that said river, or channel, and if you assume there were 50 yards on either side or something it must go through... do you know what I'm thinking of?
speaker="gary_l_keyser" startTime="663.825" stopTime="665.425">
    Mr. Gary L. Keyser 
    I think that was a survey--
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="665.425" stopTime="669.213">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    Yes, right. 
    But aside from that, is there any other evidence in your favor?
speaker="gary_l_keyser" startTime="669.213" stopTime="670.613">
    Mr. Gary L. Keyser 
    --About what?
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="670.613" stopTime="674.950">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    That shows this island was popping in and out instead of just being one island.
speaker="gary_l_keyser" startTime="674.950" stopTime="743.277">
    Mr. Gary L. Keyser 
    One of the best things... quickest handles you can get on that is to look at Dr. Easterly's testimony. 
    He explains the origin of the island, when it was washed away by the New Madrid earthquake, and attached to his prepared testimony in the supplemental trial is what's called the cartographic analysis. 
    It tells you for every year whether the island or any bar or shoal formation loosely called Stack Island was in existence, and you will see that it appeared and disappeared and reappeared, as did island number 7, below Lake Providence, and an agglomeration of bars and shoals which appear and reappear throughout this reach of the river. 
    But the location known as island number 94, and after it was washed away in 1883 it became Stack Island, and it was washed away in 1910 to 1915, became bars and shoals and an agglomeration of low-level accretionary features, washed away again in 1948, and now it's there in its full glory at its original location as a true island known as Stack Island near Mayersville, 6 miles from Lake Providence, and what is below on the Louisiana bank is nothing more than bank accretion.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="743.277" stopTime="781.052">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    Mr. Keyser, when you say that it washed away, do you mean that there was on the surface of the river at that point no land showing, or do you mean that the level of the island in relation to the adjacent river banks dropped sufficiently low so that by the legal definition you employ it was not an island even though there was visible land of some sort there, whatever you might call it? 
    Do you mean that literally there was nothing above the surface of the water, or there was something above the surface, but it wasn't high enough to be called an island?
speaker="gary_l_keyser" startTime="781.052" stopTime="793.794">
    Mr. Gary L. Keyser 
    Both of those are true, both of those statements. 
    In 1883, during a flood period, the river totally scoured the island away, and as Dr. Winkley testified, there was a 30-feet scoured channel right through the island.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="793.794" stopTime="804.418">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    Wasn't there also testimony that with respect to that time a given family was continuously farming the land, so that with respect to that, wasn't there disputed testimony?
speaker="gary_l_keyser" startTime="804.418" stopTime="807.204">
    Mr. Gary L. Keyser 
    They filed affidavits... the island was surveyed--

    Justice David H. Souter 
    Well, if somebody says, there's nothing there, and somebody else says, we were farming that land there at that time, the master can't have it both ways.

    Mr. Gary L. Keyser 
    --It's a gradual process of building on a river bank. 
    The accretion forms more and more, year after year, unless, of course, it's washed away, and that's what Dr. Winkley testified had happened here. 
    As the island to the northeast is being washed away, sediment is being deposited on the Louisiana bank at Lake Providence, so there are two separate and distinct features, two separate and distinct times and places building and eroding independently of one another.

    It would depend on the melting of the snow up north.

    I'm using the words Stack Island to refer to what Mississippi and the special master were referring as Stack Island, so I'm not trying to catch you in any kind of linguistic difficulty. 
    I mean, you're saying that this place that the master and everybody is talking about as Stack Island, which from reading the master's reports had trees all over it, cottonwood trees, that you all went out there, and there was nothing but water, and that down below the water level, 40 feet below was this place they're calling Stack Island with, what, some trees, branches, poking out the top?

    Justice David H. Souter 
    Part of your argument, if not your case, then, rests on your claim that this is not an island because it is not high enough in relation to the banks of the river to be called an island.
speaker="gary_l_keyser" startTime="1204.126" stopTime="1204.609">
    Mr. Gary L. Keyser 
    Correct.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="1204.609" stopTime="1221.887">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    And you're saying that for that reason, even though during some parts of the year there's land here, and indeed there's enough land to have trees, the tops of which look like a forest, it's still not an island, and the island rule, or the island exception, rather, does not apply. 
    That's your argument.

    Mr. Gary L. Keyser 
    Yes.

    Why... you in effect then are saying that the island exception should not apply to anything that does not... any body of land sometime above the river, which sometime is located above the surface of the river, which is not... I forget what the rule is, as high as the banks, or something like that. 
    Why in the world would we want a different rule for low-lying land, let's say, that is a foot or 6 feet below the banks from the rule that we would apply to an island as you would define it?

    Mr. Gary L. Keyser 
    --If you attempt to take into account every bar and shoal, and if each one of those can represent the legal character of an island, you'll have a thousand boundaries. 
    They're constantly forming and being washed away, so you'd be faced with trying to draw frozen thalwegs and active thalwegs, or different boundaries every time you found a bar or shoal, of which there are thousands in any one mile of the river.

    Mr. Gary L. Keyser 
    Not on the west bank of the river at Lake Providence. 
    Only patents for uplands fastlands to the riparians at the time of State sovereignty. 
    What has accumulated as accretion to the bank has never been patented out. 
    It is just attached. 
    The only thing that was ever patented was the northeast Mayersville, Mississippi location.

    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    You know, there is a series of maps that were put in evidence in this case, I assume by Mississippi, and each one has fixed markers. 
    You can lay one on top of another, and see at each map just where this disputed area has shifted a little bit or grown, or changed, and where the river has changed, and if you lay each one on top of the other, at the end of the day you see the disputed area that has shifted somewhat through the years, grown, changed in shape with movement of the river, but nonetheless traceable.

    And you come away at the end thinking, well, here is this piece of land that was patented, and it shift and changed through the years, but it's identifiable.

speaker="gary_l_keyser" startTime="1379.307" stopTime="1400.055">
    Mr. Gary L. Keyser 
    He did look at it, and apparently did rely upon it, and that technique is the subject of a book. 
    It's called, "How Maps Lie". 
    It's no different than taking aerial photographs of a car on an interstate, and you take the picture every day, and you say, see, the car is always right in that same place.

    All right, then that gets us... all right, then that gets us back to the claim of whether it is or is not an island by legal definition, but it doesn't go to the question of continuity, which Justice O'Connor raised with you.

    It shows that the bottom form of the river was completely devoid of some of those very formations you make reference to, and he explained that in his predicate testimony for what he would talk about, then he explained it specifically with regard to each map. 
    Now, sometimes there is a low-lying bar or shoal growing up... as the ancient writers used to say, fast growing up to be an island covered with willows, maybe a new crow's nest island, words to that effect, but it--

    It has to be above ordinary high water to be an island at any time.

    The yellow brief on page 30 contains the statement that 65 percent of the island as shown on the map in 1882 was still in place, in the same place as shown on a map in 1937.

    The other accretion against Louisiana is just that, it's in a remote location, so the two can't coexist... well, there's a new island in the original location, so they do now, but they couldn't along the lines of what you're suggesting. 
    I think I'll reserve the rest of my time.

   Argument of James W. McCartney
speaker="james_w_mccartney" startTime="1786.272" stopTime="1902.211">
    Mr. James W. McCartney 
    Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: 
    What has emerged from Mr. Keyser's argument is in our view simply that we have, as we had at the outset of the trial, an identity issue. 
    That is to say, is the disputed area Stack Island as it was patented but changed in configuration and location over a very lengthy period of time? 
    The Court appointed the special master. 
    The special master reviewed all of the evidence. 
    The special master heard the witnesses. 
    The special master also heard some of the arguments that you have heard today. 
    The special master addressed the question of whether this was an island. 
    The special master found from the record, and we have undertaken in our brief at page 25, joint response, footnote 23, to identify the evidence in the record that demonstrates not only that this island has the appropriate permanence which is the test that we submit is the appropriate test, that it has the appropriate... has the permanence to qualify as an island, but also that it was above high water, and the thought--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1902.211" stopTime="1910.751">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    When you say above high water, what do you mean? 
    Above high water 6 months out of the year, 9 months, 12 months... what do you mean by above high water?
speaker="james_w_mccartney" startTime="1910.751" stopTime="1915.138">
    Mr. James W. McCartney 
    --Your Honor, when I say that, I'm talking about constantly.

    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    So you disagree as a matter of fact with your opponent's statement that for several months each year it was 40 feet below high water.

    Mr. James W. McCartney 
    --Yes.

    Well--

speaker="james_w_mccartney" startTime="1931.980" stopTime="1938.170">
    Mr. James W. McCartney 
    We rowed among treetops, but there was also water... dry land above the water.
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="1938.170" stopTime="1968.022">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    I mean, where was... that what was mixing me up. 
    As I read these and I had my law clerk check into it, I did think there was an awful lot of evidence this is one place, and there are big poplar trees 80 feet around or something, or they're very, very broad, big trees. 
    I don't know how you could plant these trees if it's underwater all the time. 
    But he just said you went out on a boat, and there you were, sailing over the island 40 feet below you under the water. 
    What happened on that boat?
speaker="james_w_mccartney" startTime="1968.022" stopTime="2014.651">
    Mr. James W. McCartney 
    Well, what happened was that a part of the time... we motored, we didn't actually row. 
    [Laughter] 
    We motored among the trees over that portion of the island that was inundated at that particular time of the year, and the master was there, and viewed the island, and heard the evidence, and read the cases, and reached the conclusion, correctly, that this is a land mass that has the degree of permanence that qualifies as an island, and that qualifies as a feature that determines boundary.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="2014.651" stopTime="2017.270">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    But you said that it has to be permanently above high water.
speaker="james_w_mccartney" startTime="2017.270" stopTime="2060.199">
    Mr. James W. McCartney 
    Well, I didn't... if I said that, You Honor... I thought you were asking me... I didn't say it had to be permanently above water. 
    I didn't intend to, let me say that. 
    What I'm saying is that the overwhelming... well, let's direct our attention first to the question that you asked. 
    No, we don't say that it has to be permanently above water. 
    I think that an island could flood and still have permanence over 100 years, and the master so found, and documented his findings quite overwhelmingly in this appendix.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="2060.199" stopTime="2065.353">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    I'm not talking about permanently above flood tide, or anything.

    Mr. James W. McCartney 
    Yes.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="2065.753" stopTime="2085.766">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Permanently above normal high water, and so I took your statement to mean that if at the time when you went motoring among the treetops the whole island was underwater, that would contradict your case, but you say the whole island... because I assume that was just normal Mississippi high water at that time. 
    That wasn't a flood, was it?
speaker="james_w_mccartney" startTime="2085.766" stopTime="2089.634">
    Mr. James W. McCartney 
    It was a flood, but Your Honor, I guess that--

    Mr. James W. McCartney 
    --We wanted to see it at its worst. 
    We were perfectly prepared for the master to examine the feature at the time of extreme high water. 
    Actually, that's... it just happened to be that way. 
    I don't mean to suggest that we picked any particular time.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="2111.982" stopTime="2128.176">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    --Well, Mr. McCartney, I just wanted to get straight on what you saw out on the boat. 
    [Laughter] 
    I take it that part of this land mass was flooded. 
    There was water over the soil, but I gather from what you said a moment ago part of it was not--

    Justice David H. Souter 
    The edges of the island got flooded, but the center of the island didn't, is that true?

    Mr. James W. McCartney

    Justice John Paul Stevens

    Mr. James W. McCartney

    Yes.

    Mr. James W. McCartney 
    I mean, as pointed out, we have trees that... evidence that there were trees there that had been 50, 60 years old, and if I may just add to the evidence, in your review of the evidence of permanence, in addition to what the special master laid out in his Appendix D, which is itself overwhelmingly compelling, particularly when compared to the single or... map that they relied on to say that the island was scoured clean, and the bed of the river was scoured clean of this feature in 1883.

    Mr. James W. McCartney 
    --which itself, and I'll just... it's credibility is destroyed, or at least seriously impaired, because one of their experts gives it to the other expert in the middle of trial, and he takes that map, and he says, oh, you know, this land was underwater, and we say, well, wait a minute, here are affidavits given in 1885 that say these people were farming--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="2240.933" stopTime="2243.301">

    Mr. James W. McCartney 
    --And... and he says, how can they be farming land that's underwater, and we say, that is a good question. 
    Obviously, they can't. 
    The map was wrong. 
    It's a spurious map. 
    Besides, in addition to these documentary demonstrations of permanence, we have to remember that in 1921, after they say this was scoured clean, there was a timber deed given to my clients, the Houstons, the private parties. 
    In 1931, there was another timber deed, so these people are selling... these are the Blackwells, the patentees are selling timber off the island in '21, '31, an then my clients lend money and take a mortgage on this piece of land that's 54 feet, according to this Mr. Winkley, underwater. 
    They lend them money, and then they foreclose on the mortgage. 
    [Laughter] 
    The State of Mississippi, they take a tax deed. 
    They foreclose for the nonpayment of taxes. 
    There's litigation over this island. 
    This island has been known to all of the parties. 
    There's overwhelming documentary evidence that it's continued in existence.

    Mr. Robert R. Bailess 
    Justice O'Connor, I would... you mentioned the overlay exhibits which, it takes a little time to examine those exhibits. 
    You have to get acquainted with them. 
    You have to become familiar with them. 
    If each of you took the time to get familiar with the overlays, you would unquestionably say that Stack Island has existed from... and the first good metes and bounds, if you want to call it that, survey that is performed by geodetic positions... that is, latitude and longitude lines, which was done in 1882... show unquestionably that Stack Island at that time was good, fastland that existed, and if you follow that on through up to 1994, you will see that that island is in substantially the same position through all of those years.

    Justice David H. Souter 
    May I get specific about that with a question that I raised with Mr. Keyser? 
    Why, then... can you explain why we have such a clear dispute over the proposition which was in your yellow brief that 35... I'm sorry, 65 percent of the island as shown in 1882 was still shown in the same place in 1937?

    Mr. Robert R. Bailess 
    Justice Souter, the only way that I know to answer that question is to say, if you will look at who was testifying to come up with those percentages, it was Dr. Winkley on cross-examination, so Louisiana's own expert witness testified to that.

    Mr. Robert R. Bailess 
    --Your Honor, Mr. Keyser attempted to talk about two islands when we tried this case the first time in Vicksburg before Judge Barbour in 1989.

    Let me correct one other thing that is misleading. 
    When Judge McKusick and the attorneys went to view the island in May of 1994, we took a boat and we went around the island. 
    We put in at the Lake Providence Port Commission. 
    We went up the old channel, the boundary channel. 
    We never did go into the wooded area far enough to see dry land, but I can assure you it's there, and I can assure you that if you read the hydrographic surveys that are in evidence, and you look at the contours on those hydrographic surveys which are surveying the top bank of Stack Island, you will see that at all times on those survey maps, Stack Island is higher than what Mr. Winkley is trying to put into evidence as the... he called it the top bank, and in each instance you will see that Stack Island exceeds Mr. Winkley's top bank definition by at least 5 feet or so.

    We went back in September when we heard the case. 
    When Judge McKusick heard the evidence, we went back on an afternoon after the testimony and drove onto this island with a four-wheel-drive vehicle. 
    We drove to the north end of the island where the highest elevation is. 
    We drove to the south end of the island, where it's much lower.

    --Your Honor, we take the position that an island is an area of land surrounded by water that has permanent features, i.e. vegetation, i.e. 70-year-old trees, that is capable of sustaining vegetation, and in 1881, when this island was surveyed by the General Land Office of the United States by a deputy surveyor, it had trees that were 60 to 70 years old at that time. 
    Mr. Jarvis testified that in 1994 there were trees on this island that were 40 to 42 inches in diameter, which would have made those trees at least 60 to 70 year old in 1994.

    The top bank is in the neighborhood of 35 feet.

speaker="robert_r_bailess" startTime="3014.716" stopTime="3054.858">
    Mr. Robert R. Bailess 
    Mr. Winkley testified, when they came up with this proposition that to be a true island it had to be above mean high water, that's the term that. 
    Louisiana came up with. 
    When we asked Mr. Winkley, well, what is mean high water, he said he didn't know. 
    He did not have any definition, nor did the Corps of Engineers, nor did any other publication that he knew of publish a definition for mean high water on the Mississippi River. 
    So we asked, well, what is ordinary high water? 
    The same reply. 
    So what Dr. Winkley did is, he then came up with a definition that an island has to be above top bank. 
    He attributed that definition to himself.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="3054.858" stopTime="3057.043">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    And top bank means what?
speaker="robert_r_bailess" startTime="3057.043" stopTime="3097.453">
    Mr. Robert R. Bailess 
    According to Dr. Winkley, it is approximately 35 feet above zero gauge which, to determine that, what he did in his testimony was, he took a period of time, and he plotted heights of the river during the 1870's to the 1880's. 
    He said the reason he did that is because it was before levees. 
    Therefore, when the river got out of its banks, it had no barrier to hold it up. 
    But since you have levees, of course, the top bank, according to him, is really... you can't define it, because levees hold the water in. 
    It confines the water.

    Justice David H. Souter 
    And do I also understand... you didn't say this explicitly, but I took this as implied, and I want to make sure I understand you. 
    Did you also mean to say that if the entire island were flooded today, at a time of high flooding, that that would... that it's condition would simply be what the land on the bank of the river would be if there were not levees there, that the island would be no more flooded than the adjacent bank lands would be flooded?

    That is absolutely correct.

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Okay. 
    Once you establish an island on the basis of, you know, a portion of it is above... at least some portion is above top bank, whatever that means, the next question is, how much of that chunk of mud and whatever is an island? 
    Is the island then that you have identified, does it extend down to the low water mark?
speaker="robert_r_bailess" startTime="3206.424" stopTime="3217.330">
    Mr. Robert R. Bailess 
    Let me answer that in this way. 
    In Louisiana, the Louisiana riparian owns from the bank to the low water mark.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="3217.330" stopTime="3220.182">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    To the low water mark. 
    So it ought to be the same for the island owner.
speaker="robert_r_bailess" startTime="3220.182" stopTime="3246.280">
    Mr. Robert R. Bailess 
    It ought to be. 
    In Mississippi, the riparian owner owns to the thalweg, all the way out to the State boundary. 
    Now, why would you penalize the Mississippi parties and the State of Mississippi by some cockamamie definition of top bank, that an island has to be at top bank to be an island? 
    It's illogical.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="3246.280" stopTime="3256.271">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    Am I correct that there has never been any dispute in this litigation that at the time of the original patent... which was what, 1881, I think?
speaker="robert_r_bailess" startTime="3256.271" stopTime="3257.288">
    Mr. Robert R. Bailess 
    It was surveyed in '81--

    That has never been contested, is that correct?
speaker="robert_r_bailess" startTime="3270.714" stopTime="3273.982">
    Mr. Robert R. Bailess 
    To my knowledge, it has never been contested, Your Honor.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="3273.982" stopTime="3289.092">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Okay. 
    May I ask one more question? 
    Suppose the island does... does disappear and reemerge, does that mean all bets are off? 
    I mean, what's... is it the same island, or do you have to start all over again?
speaker="robert_r_bailess" startTime="3289.092" stopTime="3331.919">
    Mr. Robert R. Bailess 
    Your Honor, if it truly disappeared by the natural processes of the river... that is, the channel of the river scoured that island away, then the island in my opinion would be no more. 
    That would not destroy title to the land under the water, though, and in Mississippi the riparian owner would own to the thalweg, which would be to the State boundary, so it wouldn't disturb title, necessarily. 
    Now, if that island came back in the same place, then conceivably title would never be disturbed, but there is absolutely no proof in this record that Stack Island washed away.

    Justice David H. Souter 
    I was going to say, we don't have to get into that issue on your theory, because there is at least an evidentiary basis for viewing the facts as the master viewed them, so you don't want us to get into that.

    One is the case of Scott v. Lattig, which is cited in the brief, which gives a factual basis in that case for an island. 
    It doesn't say that this Court made the determination for all legal principles that you have to have this to be an island, but in that case, it had, really, four things. 
    One was, they said... this is factual things. 
    This island, in Scott v. Lattig, was 3 to 5 feet above ordinary high water.

    Mr. Robert R. Bailess 
    I have used the term myself, high bank, a number of times throughout this litigation to describe the bank coming from Louisiana or Mississippi where the bank makes a severe slope coming off of the flatland down into the bed of the river. 
    I've used that term high bank. 
    I may have even used the word top bank, but not for the purposes of defining an island.

    The other case is a circuit court of appeals case. 
    It's Uhlorn v. U.S. Gypsum company, and in that case the Court held that the elevation of the land was not the deciding factor in determining whether or not a State boundary would be lost, or to say it a different way, it did not have to reach an ordinary high water mark in order for the State boundary to remain... in that case I don't remember if it was to the west or the east or the north or the south, but for the State boundary to remain where it was when the change in channel occurred.

    Mr. Robert R. Bailess

    I'm a little different in representing the State of Mississippi than Mr. McCartney is. 
    He filed no counterclaim. 
    Mississippi filed a counterclaim to Louisiana's original complaint claiming that it was under Mississippi sovereignty, and we proved that, so as between Louisiana and Mississippi we had maybe an equal burden of proof only because I filed the counterclaim. 
    I refer the Court to the case of Kansas v. Missouri. 
    I don't remember the date of that.
