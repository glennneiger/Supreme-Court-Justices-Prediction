    Mr. Jonathan S. Abady 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    This case presents the question of whether a Federal appellate court, sitting in diversity, may apply a highly invasive State standard of review to overturn a jury's findings on compensatory damages in the absence of any error at trial, and after the district court judge has considered and denied a Rule 59 motion. 
    This Court must reverse the Second Circuit's decision for three principal reasons. 
    First, the Second Circuit's decision to apply a State rather than Federal standard of review violates the Seventh Amendment, the Rules of Decision Act, and this Court's precedent, most recently reaffirmed in a unanimous opinion in Browning-Ferris, where it was expressly held that in a diversity suit it is Federal and not State law that governs the standard of review.

    Not--

    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    That doesn't answer my question. 
    What is the standard of review? 
    Is it no reasonable juror could have reached the verdict, or is it... in this case do they... they were looking at a motion for a new trial. 
    Is it whether the trial court abused its discretion in denying the new trial?

    Mr. Jonathan S. Abady

    Justice Antonin Scalia

    I understand, but that is a question of how the New York law rule of law is enforced. 
    It can be enforced at the appellate level as well as by the trial judge, but as far as the substantive rule of New York law is concerned, namely that damages must be reasonable, is that at all distinctive?

    Mr. Jonathan S. Abady 
    Well, not a lid, and that's I think a critical distinction. 
    In 1986, the legislature enacted 5501(c) of the CPLR, which provided an appellate court with the opportunity not to impose a lid, but to make a determination of what it believed was reasonable compensation, and to move the award up or down, and--
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="307.292" stopTime="341.693">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    In this very field, what we've seen is a lowering of excessive verdicts, and what's startling to me about this case is going back to guarantee the basic Erie message that you are not to get dramatically different outcomes in State and Federal courts. 
    That's core Erie, and here you have the possibility of getting verdicts that are widely out of line with what you could hope to get if you went into State court.
speaker="jonathan_s_abady" startTime="341.693" stopTime="370.094">
    Mr. Jonathan S. Abady 
    --Well, I mean, I think you're raising an interesting point. 
    The Erie analysis that the Consorti court, the Second Circuit engaged in, which was the decision that the Gasperini court relied on, did, in fact, under an Erie analysis indicate that its decision to apply State law was a function of the Erie test, but there is a threshold question that must be addressed before one can proceed to the Erie considerations, and that is, is there a constitutional provision at play here?
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="370.094" stopTime="372.636">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Mr. Abady, is this a State-created right?

    That's correct. 
    That's correct, but--
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="380.779" stopTime="389.395">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    And yet you're arguing that because of Federal procedure, you can get a remedy in the Federal court much larger than you could get in State court on the State-created right?
speaker="jonathan_s_abady" startTime="389.395" stopTime="418.373">
    Mr. Jonathan S. Abady 
    --No. 
    What I'm saying is that because the Seventh Amendment applies, the Supremacy Clause prevents application of the State standard of review, not the substantive law. 
    The substantive law which determines the cause of action, and which determines the elements that the jury may consider in arriving at their determination is a function of State law, but the standard of review, as this Court held in Browning-Ferris, in Donovan v. Penn Shipping, and in Byrd v. Blue Ridge, is a function of fundamental Federal policy and the Seventh Amendment.

    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Mr. Abady, you never got a chance, really, to answer Justice O'Connor's question. 
    What is the Federal standard of review?

    Mr. Jonathan S. Abady 
    Well, the... what I'm saying is, where a new trial motion has been based on a claim for excessiveness or weight of the evidence, the Seventh Amendment prevents a Federal appellate court from reviewing that determination.

    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Your point is that as a matter of constitutional law there is no... the Federal appellate court has no power to set aside the--
speaker="jonathan_s_abady" startTime="444.270" stopTime="449.455">
    Mr. Jonathan S. Abady 
    That is correct. 
    The Reexamination Clause of the Seventh Amendment says specifically no fact--

    Mr. Jonathan S. Abady 
    --Well, I think Browning-Ferris addressed a slightly different issue, but interestingly, Browning-Ferris did indicate that this Court has never held expressly that a Federal appellate court can exercise review where weight of the evidence and excessiveness is the claim and, in fact, it's been the precedent of this Court for more than a century and a half, and a precedent that has never been repudiated, that a Federal appellate court cannot exercise that type of review.

    Mr. Jonathan S. Abady 
    Specifically the cases begin with Parsons v. Bedford up through Fairmount Glass.

    Well, Mr.--

    I know they're collected in your brief, but are you saying there's simply no possible review of a jury verdict under the Seventh Amendment?
speaker="jonathan_s_abady" startTime="499.518" stopTime="523.784">
    Mr. Jonathan S. Abady 
    --Not "no possible review", but the Seventh Amendment imposes a division on the review responsibilities of the district court and the court of appeals. 
    The district court under the Seventh Amendment is entrusted with responsibility for reviewing factual issues and therefore for determining excessiveness and weight of the evidence claims. 
    The court of appeals remains available to review and supervise questions of law.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="523.784" stopTime="529.856">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    But there's nothing in the Seventh Amendment that says the district court, the trial court shall do one thing and the appellate court shall do another.
speaker="jonathan_s_abady" startTime="529.856" stopTime="531.148">
    Mr. Jonathan S. Abady 
    Well, I actually think that there is.

    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Well--

    Mr. Jonathan S. Abady 
    The Seventh... the Reexamination Clause says, states, no fact found by a jury may be otherwise reexamined than according to the rules of the common law. 
    The Seventh Amendment is a very unique amendment. 
    It commands that we must look to the common law for the meaning of the scope of that reexamination. 
    If there was reexamination at common law by appellate courts over excessiveness and weight of the evidence claims, then contemporary American jurisprudence can exercise--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="559.127" stopTime="568.842">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    --Well, Mr. Abady, you do agree that at common law there was a group of judges that reviewed the trial court... trial jury's findings.

    Mr. Jonathan S. Abady

    Mr. Jonathan S. Abady 
    The only way that a new trial motion, where excessiveness or weight of the evidence was the claim, could be granted was with the authorization of xx nisi prius judge, who was the judge present during the trial proceedings. 
    That judicial review was exercised--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="592.858" stopTime="599.273">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    But sometimes that review was conducted without the judge who was present at the trial.

    --No. 
    No.

    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Let me ask you this. 
    On the Federal standard of appellate review, if the court of appeals determined that no reasonable juror could have awarded the amount of damages that it awarded at the trial, you say the appellate court could not, based on that determination, upset the verdict?

    Mr. Abady, the district judge is, however, and if you're stressing Federal procedure and the Seventh Amendment, we have a tension here between the award one can get in a State court and Federal procedure. 
    Isn't the logical answer to say, you have to take the State law, but fit it into Federal procedure, and that means the district judge has an obligation to do in the Federal courts exactly what the appellate division would do in the New York State courts.

    There is no--

    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    This district judge wasn't aware that he was to take as his standard for reviewing the verdict what the appellate division would have done in a similar case.

    Judge Brieant considered the Rule 59 motion. 
    He had a liberal standard that he could employ in deciding that motion. 
    He considered it, and he denied it. 
    What Judge Brieant recognized, what he must have recognized when he considered that Rule 59 motion, was that this verdict was fully supported by the record at trial.

    What we have to look to is the record, to see if the record actually supports his determination, and when we look to the record in this particular case, what we see is that even respondent's own expert at trial provided a basis for the valuation that the jury arrived at in this case.

    Mr. Abady, there's no general common law here. 
    The common law that is applied is the law of New York State, and suppose New York State court should clarify? 
    This change that our legislature made is in effect a soft cap on damages, not just a general reasonableness that always prevails, but we have in effect a soft cap, and we regard it as highly substantive. 
    Suppose that's what New York courts--

    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    --My question is, suppose that is the New York law. 
    Then we have your case, so it's clear that New York regards this as a matter of substance, that it is a soft cap. 
    Instead of being no more than $500 per transparency, it's this standard that the appellate division is to use. 
    New York labels it substantive. 
    Then we're in Federal court with your case. 
    What must the trial judge do?
speaker="jonathan_s_abady" startTime="926.887" stopTime="943.535">
    Mr. Jonathan S. Abady 
    Well, I think the determining factor is not how it's labeled but what, in fact, is the actual nature of a substantive law. 
    If it is, in fact, substantive law, if there is a limit imposed as a matter of State substantive law, that is controlling in a diversity suit.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="943.535" stopTime="973.166">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    Suppose that that limit required either the trial judge and the appellate court to look at verdicts in order to make them comparable, including verdicts that have been rendered after the verdict in question. 
    That is to say, if it comes to the court of appeals of New York under New York procedure, they look, in order to determine comparability, at what juries have been doing within a period, reasonable period of time both before and after this jury has entered its verdict.
speaker="jonathan_s_abady" startTime="973.166" stopTime="979.270">
    Mr. Jonathan S. Abady 
    That cannot be squared with the Reexamination Clause of the Seventh Amendment. 
    The Seventh Amendment says the facts--

    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy

    Mr. Jonathan S. Abady 
    --I... the Seventh Amendment requires, I think, that the jury's findings of fact be accorded great deference, and that they cannot be altered based on an assessment of what other juries have done in other cases where the parties in this particular proceeding have not been a party to.

    In this case there was judicial review at the district court level. 
    There's no constitutional right to an appeal. 
    The Court holding in Honda didn't say that there was a right to appellate review, and how could it be a matter of procedural due process to require appellate review when there's no right to an appeal? 
    Judicial review was exercised in this case by the district court.

    Well, but that's, I think, what I'm getting at, because I would have thought that the abuse-of-discretion standard, and review of a rule which pegs the permissible amount to, or limits the permissible amount to what a reasonable juror could have found, raised issues of law, rather than the kind of issues of fact which the New York rule does issue... does raise. 
    I mean, I concede the New York rule as being a rule of factual review, but abuse of discretion, no reasonable juror could... those, I would suppose, were limits of law, and I think you're telling me that there could not even be appellate review on those grounds.
speaker="jonathan_s_abady" startTime="1219.448" stopTime="1225.953">
    Mr. Jonathan S. Abady

    Everybody's agreed on that. 
    Okay. 
    Then, if New York were to have a law saying, and no jury verdict, no damages will exceed $1 million, and the jury gave them $2 million, everybody agrees that the district judge in a Federal case would have to follow New York law, set it aside over the million. 
    That's a legal question.

    I'm trying to get that out of it. 
    I'm saying, suppose I thought that it's the district court here that should have applied the cap. 
    Then what I want to know, if that's so, what should the review have been in the Federal appeals court?

    Well, let me go to the other example I tried. 
    Let's assume that the substantive rule in New York is no verdict may exceed the verdict that a... may exceed the range that a reasonable juror would... that a juror... that a reasonable juror would find appropriate, and the district judge is asked to remit or vacate because the verdict exceeds whatever that amount is claimed to be, and it, in effect it's a reasonable juror standard, and the district judge does not do so. 
    That is appealed.

    Mr. Theodore B. Olson 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    The Second Circuit in this case performed essentially the same supervisorial function as the courts at Westminster had performed beginning in 1655, under the rules of common law, to protect against exorbitant judgments, and it performed the supervisorial function required by Erie since 1938.

    The entry of the judgment made no difference. 
    What is functionally equivalent to what happened in the second circuit today is what was happening in the courts of Westminster at the time the Constitution was adopted, a review by judges other than the trial judge of the reasonableness of the jury's verdict.

    Mr. Theodore B. Olson 
    As Blackstone points out both in Chapter 23 and Chapter 24 of Volume 23, they were interchangeably trial judges, judges of appeal, and judges who would communicate with one another to perform a supervisorial function. 
    When they were reviewing motions for a new trial, Blackstone makes it very clear that the purpose was to preserve the jury trial itself, because if aberrational judgment, errors in the instruction, errors performed by juries, excessive judgments, and so forth, could not be corrected. 
    The faith that existed in the jury trial would vanish, and the jury trial system would go away.

    Mr. Theodore B. Olson 
    What was done was a retrial at the place at which the case was tried initially, unless the case was tried originally at Westminster.

    No. 
    If it was tried originally in a county some place by one judge, it would be sent back. 
    As I understand, that's the process that would work. 
    In other words, it is very much functionally equivalent to what we have today, separate judges, and the trial judge may have been a part of that review, or he may not have been a part of the review.

    The fact is that if you review those cases as we have carefully reviewed them, there is no... first of all, Blackstone does not say that it required a certificate by the trial judge to review possible errors made by the trial judge. 
    Blackstone talks about this in terms of supervising possible errors that may have occurred before.

    Mr. Theodore B. Olson 
    --What I'm saying is, it does not in any way refute the process that was going on concurrently at common law where a decision was made by a separate group of en banc judges that an excess of judgment had been rendered, and then that decision that a new trial should be granted was sent back to the place where the case was tried originally, or to where the record was returned, in the exact words of Blackstone. 
    So that when this process... because we created a different system of courts than existed in England at the time, there is going to be some differential in the process, but the substance of the fact is that a reexamination and a grant of a new trial was not... in that context was not considered to be a reexamination, which the Framers were concerned about. 
    It's fairly clear--

    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Mr. Olson, if we were back in the era of Swift v. Tyson, when there was common law to apply, and Federal courts could divine it, you would never be making this kind of argument, because the Reexamination Clause would control. 
    So my question to you is, why are you emphasizing the possibility of appellate review, instead of saying that this is New York substantive law, and fitting it into the Federal system is the job of the trial judge, and that's what went awry here. 
    And the Second Circuit, instead of taking it on itself to do this review, should have instructed the trial judge that that's what the trial judge should have done.
speaker="theodore_b_olson" startTime="2148.941" stopTime="2196.483">
    Mr. Theodore B. Olson 
    --Well, I agree with everything that you said, and I was going to discuss the Erie question. 
    What the appellate court clearly did in this case is decide that no reasonable jury could have come to the conclusion... in fact, that is the exact words of the Second Circuit in this case... could have come to the conclusion that the jury did in this case, and it's clear, in giving all deference to the decision of the jury and all inferences in favor of the petitioner, that the district judge should have done exactly what you said. 
    And the court in this case granted a new trial, which is exactly the procedure that did exist at common law to correct these kinds of errors, and then went on to suggest, as permitted under the Federal practice, that there could be a remittitur, which would avoid the new trial in the... at the option of the plaintiff.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="2196.483" stopTime="2233.636">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Mr. Olson, that's contrary to what we've at least said in the past the court's empowered to do. 
    We said in the Fralock case, a case a lot closer to the framing of the Seventh Amendment than we are today, we said, if... no error of law appearing upon the record, this Court cannot reverse the judgment because, upon examination of the evidence, we may be of the opinion that the jury should have rendered a verdict for a lesser amount. 
    If the jury acted upon a gross mistake of facts, or were governed by some improper influence or bias, the remedy therefore rested with the court below under its general power to set aside the verdict. 
    That's very categorical, and it says just the opposite of what you're telling us.
speaker="theodore_b_olson" startTime="2233.636" stopTime="2255.581">
    Mr. Theodore B. Olson 
    Well, what this Court said in the Browning-Ferris case is that the court of appeals was to review the decision of the district court to see whether the court of appeals came to the conclusion... this is a unanimous decision of this Court 6 years ago. 
    Our only inquiry is whether the court of appeals erred in finding that the district court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to grant petitioner's motion for a new trial, and--

    Mr. Theodore B. Olson 
    I think both types of damages under the decisions of this Court, and the decisions of the courts that have considered them and sanctioned them, say that punitive damages and compensatory damages do involve some element of fact-finding and some element of the application of the law to the facts. 
    It's a mixed question of law and facts, especially when the question is being reviewed, and what this Court said three times--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="2293.485" stopTime="2306.653">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    You think both are equivalently factual. 
    The question how much... you know, what value of suffering or injury has this person undergone, you think that is no more factual than the question, how much should this person be punished.
speaker="theodore_b_olson" startTime="2306.653" stopTime="2343.638">
    Mr. Theodore B. Olson 
    --I think it is more factual, but we're on a spectrum here. 
    Blackstone talks in terms of, when it talks about the private rights and private wrongs versus public rights and public wrongs, is talking about punitive damages to the extent that he was examining that subject in a context of a public wrong and a public remedy, so Blackstone at least was considering there was a public societal interest in the amount of punitive damages. 
    Now, of course, this case does not involve that subject, but I do think that there are different... you have State... you're having a State impose a penalty for what's perceived as antisocial conduct in the context of punitive damages, and there may be more strict judicial review.

    In this Court's decision in Pacific Mutual v.

    Mr. Theodore B. Olson 
    Well, what was very clearly going on here in New York was that New York wanted to change its substantive law. 
    It changed its substantive law in these procedural amendments to change rules like joint and several liability and other things, and imposed this kind of comparable limitation on the amount of damages, and did exactly as you were suggesting in your question, asked the court... and Justice Kennedy's question, asked the court to look at other verdicts to make sure that judgments are not going to be out of whack, that they're not going to be excessive, that they're reasonably consistent with judgments in other cases.

    --In this particular case, Judge Brieant might not have thought he was supposed to apply the standard of New York, and the appellate court did it for him. 
    I guess that would be wrong. 
    They should send it back, is that right?

    Mr. Theodore B. Olson 
    No, I think what the appellate... I think it is possible to assume, it's possible to assume anything with respect to what the district judge did here, because he didn't say anything about what he was doing, although it's clear that he did say on the record that he felt that $1,500 per slide was not something that was possible. 
    He said no sane person, or words to that effect, would accept that kind of characterization, so he was concerned about it, but then when it came to granting the motion for a new trial, he did nothing. 
    He just denied the motion for a new trial. 
    It's clear that in a review of that, the court of appeals felt that that was an abuse of discretion.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="2581.713" stopTime="2625.111">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    But Mr. Olson, you describe the history as though it's all or nothing at all. 
    The factual question of whether $1,500 is an excessive jury judgment is either reviewable by the appellate court or not, whereas the historical record suggests that it may be reviewable in some contexts, namely, in the context of whether the judgment can stand, whether there was liability, but not reviewable in another context. 
    That is, in the context of whether the damages are excessive. 
    It isn't an all or nothing at all that a particular factual question is reviewable by the court or not. 
    What the common law seems to xx it was reviewable for some purposes but not review purposes of determining whether damages were excessive.
speaker="theodore_b_olson" startTime="2625.111" stopTime="2646.304">
    Mr. Theodore B. Olson 
    The common law is very clear that the supervisorial function by the court above was to be considered in the matter of the sound discretion, though it's the words of Blackstone, of the court above. 
    He did acknowledge, and it's understandable that the trial judge would have been consulted with respect to whether the new trial would be granted because we did not have records in those days like we do today--

    Now, what could be more similar to what happened here than to that process, a separate, en banc court reviewing the procedures that had occurred out in the countryside to determine whether there was an excessive verdict, and the exercise of the sound discretion of that court to determine whether there's an aberration, but--

    Mr. Theodore B. Olson 
    Well, I'm... what I'm saying is that the answer to your question depends upon whether we're talking about Erie or the Seventh Amendment. 
    The Seventh Amendment, to the extent that it adopted the rules at common law, did not constitutionalize a standard of review. 
    The standard of review was in the discretion of the court above. 
    Now, it may well be that this Court and the courts of the United States chose to implement that in many respects as an abuse-of-discretion standard, and there is some support for that in Blackstone, because naturally--

    Well, part of the common law, Justice Scalia... in fact, I'm glad that you made that point. 
    Part of the common law was, and part of the reverence that we have for the common law and the Framers had for the common law was the fact that it was a continuing evolutionary process by which justice would be done, and in fact it would be very anomalous, and this Court has said it, for the Framers of the Constitution to have locked in a particular mode of procedure or forms of practice.

    Mr. Theodore B. Olson

    It would have made no sense. 
    In fact, the forms of procedure by which jury trial results were examined wasn't dependent upon any particular practice or procedure. 
    As Blackstone makes it clear, the idea of the new trial was for the purpose of the preservation of the jury trial itself, and for the purpose of preserving the confidence that the people would have in this most elegant... as he puts it, the new trial, the motion for a new trial eliminates these inconveniences which could occur as a result of errors or excesses, and at the same time the motion for a new trial preserves entire and renders perfect that most excellent method of decision which is the glory of the English law.
