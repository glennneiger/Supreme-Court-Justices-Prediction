    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    We'll hear argument now in Number 95-386, Jason Richards v. Jefferson County. 
    Mr. Baxley.
speaker="william_j_baxley" startTime="8.856" stopTime="91.950">
    Mr. William J. Baxley 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court: 
    This is a res judicata due process question that we're here on today. 
    To lead in, I'd like to give a short quote out of a case of Chase National Bank v. Norwalk. 
    Justice Brandeis said, unless duly summoned to appear in a legal proceeding, a person not a privy may rest assured that a judgment recovered therein will not affect his legal rights. 
    That quote was also cited by Mr. Chief Justice in the Martin v. Wilks case and quoted along with some other quotes from Justice Brandeis in that case. 
    The second little lead in quote I'd like to give... because it was cited, the case was cited by the respondent. 
    It's a Fifth Circuit case, Southwest Airlines v. Texas International, and they quoted Judge Widdeson as saying, quote, denial of the opportunity to bring a suit raises serious due process questions. 
    Further in the opinion, they quote, again, Judge Widdeson, because res judicata denies a nonparty his day in court, the Due Process Clause prevents preclusion when the relationship between the party and the nonparty becomes too attenuated. 
    In this instance, it's not only a attenuated relationship, there's a nonexistent relationship. 
    There's absolutely--

    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Well, Mr. Baxley, there... your opponents cite a string of cases, many of them State cases, in which some kind of claim preclusion doctrine, or res judicata, if you will, has been applied despite a change in the identity of the plaintiff taxpayer in suits by citizens challenging tax laws in State court. 
    Now, there is that body of authority, and how do you deal with that, and what's the extent of it?
speaker="william_j_baxley" startTime="124.292" stopTime="154.552">
    Mr. William J. Baxley 
    --All of those cases that they cited in that footnote, only two or three of them do I think really have application that they should have to be arguable. 
    All of them are State cases. 
    I believe all of them are State cases. 
    I don't believe there's a single case from this Court or even a circuit court that they cited in that footnote. 
    I think common sense is the best answer. 
    These are cases that I think that the law, especially when you're dealing with a constitutional right to have your case litigated--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="154.552" stopTime="162.879">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Well, you take the position that there is no doctrine of claim preclusion in these citizen taxpayer suits in State court?
speaker="william_j_baxley" startTime="162.879" stopTime="176.278">
    Mr. William J. Baxley 
    --I think the position that we would take is... was enunciated in your dissent, in Justice O'Connor's dissent in the Harper v. Virginia case which is--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="176.278" stopTime="177.697">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    But remember, that was a dissent.

    Mr. William J. Baxley 
    --But it did not conflict with the majority, either--

    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    It didn't carry the day.

    Mr. William J. Baxley 
    --and you quoted United States v. L.A. Tucker Trucking Company and Webster v. Fall, and I think your quote there was something to the effect that questions which are merely lurk in the record have no basis of precedent in--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="200.734" stopTime="211.521">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Well, what if the court in the Bedingfield case here had actually decided the issue that you're raising now, would you be here?
speaker="william_j_baxley" startTime="211.521" stopTime="214.122">
    Mr. William J. Baxley 
    --It would be a closer question. 
    I think that--

    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    And what is your answer? 
    Would you then be precluded, a new taxpayer, from bringing the same challenge?
speaker="william_j_baxley" startTime="221.197" stopTime="255.919">
    Mr. William J. Baxley 
    --I think you could make a good argument that you would not, because of nonprivity under the law as set out by this Court, but I think that... certainly I think that candidly the respondent would have a stronger case, because here this argument, a major constitutional right, has never, ever been decided by any court at any time. 
    It's never been argued. 
    It was mentioned in one amicus brief at the Alabama supreme court level, just mentioned in passing. 
    You've got a trial court that wrote a five or six page opinion that never touched on this major right.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="255.919" stopTime="293.784">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Mr. Baxley, just to be clear on what's at issue, if, in fact, the matter had been decided in the prior suit, raised, litigated, and decided, then really it wouldn't be too significant whether you put a preclusion, it wouldn't be a plain preclusion, an issue preclusion label on it, because you'd have precedent from the highest court in your State. 
    You'd be bound by stare decisis, so it wouldn't... if they actually decided the question, if the Alabama supreme court actually decided the question in the Bedingfield case, then wouldn't you realistically be out of court in your suit?
speaker="william_j_baxley" startTime="293.784" stopTime="307.601">
    Mr. William J. Baxley 
    I think common sensewise, yes. 
    I think you could argue that the claim... I don't think technically under the law that either res judicata or collateral estoppel would apply.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="307.601" stopTime="308.693">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    But how about stare decisis?
speaker="william_j_baxley" startTime="308.693" stopTime="315.298">
    Mr. William J. Baxley 
    Stare decisis I think would be... would be enough to where it would make your burden almost unable... you couldn't overcome it, but I... we don't have that--
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="315.298" stopTime="319.770">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    So your case really depends on this issue not having been fully litigated and decided.
speaker="william_j_baxley" startTime="319.770" stopTime="326.265">
    Mr. William J. Baxley 
    --Not having been litigated in any way, and I think that's the law from this Court, repeatedly.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="326.265" stopTime="350.571">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well, what if the State of Alabama decides to authorize taxpayer suits not in the sense of people who are being subject to a tax, but in the sense of challenging expenditure of public money? 
    In other words, any person in the State who pays taxes may challenge the... and I think many States have this. 
    Do you think a State has to allow more than one of those suits?
speaker="william_j_baxley" startTime="350.571" stopTime="353.052">
    Mr. William J. Baxley 
    No, sir, I don't think they have to--

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Where there really isn't any personal property interest at stake.
speaker="william_j_baxley" startTime="357.266" stopTime="383.764">
    Mr. William J. Baxley 
    --I think my answer there would be that you pretty well hit it on the head in Martin v. Wilks in your opinion, where you said it's really, the burden is on the parties, on the parties that are litigating it to determine what the issues are going to be. 
    When this issue was litigated in Bedingfield, if the county had really wanted to come in and have the due process... I mean, and the due process rights provided and the equal protection matter settled once and for all, they could have brought it up. 
    They know--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="383.764" stopTime="436.497">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    That... I don't believe that's responsive to my question. 
    Listen, please. 
    My question was, if the State says, we're going to authorize taxpayer suits, any taxpayer can come in and claim that the public moneys are being misspent, and A comes in and brings a taxpayer suit saying that you... this is a violation, say, of the First Amendment, the religion clause, for the State to spend money this way, and then that's... the highest court in the State decides that case against that taxpayer. 
    And then taxpayer B, who wasn't a party to that suit at all, comes in and says, now, I wasn't a party to that suit, I'm bringing a taxpayer's action to challenge that same expenditure of money under the same provision of the Constitution. 
    Now, can a State say, we're just not going to do that, this is a special kind of suit?
speaker="william_j_baxley" startTime="436.497" stopTime="440.809">
    Mr. William J. Baxley 
    --I think for the same reason, the principle of stare decisis that Justice Ginsburg--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="440.809" stopTime="454.199">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    I'm not talking about stare decisis. 
    I'm talking about, maybe it's a brand new supreme court of Alabama now, and maybe the supreme court of Alabama might be inclined to depart from its earlier ruling, but can the State simply say, we're not going to entertain this action?
speaker="william_j_baxley" startTime="454.199" stopTime="479.556">
    Mr. William J. Baxley 
    --I don't think they could and get by a due process test if they preclude... now, if... in your... and what... your example, if somebody came back and raised... you gave the First Amendment, raised the First Amendment, it had already been decided, yes, I think a statute that set that out would preclude others from doing it. 
    But if then they, somebody came in and said, now, wait a minute, this has not been decided on another constitutional ground, then I don't think that a... I think a State statute--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="479.556" stopTime="493.766">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    What if the law of Alabama is that anything that was... might have... was raised in the first taxpayer's action might have been raised is just, it's all over, there isn't going to be another suit, does that violate some provision of the Federal Constitution?
speaker="william_j_baxley" startTime="493.766" stopTime="495.027">
    Mr. William J. Baxley 
    --Yes. 
    I think it violates due process.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="495.027" stopTime="496.658">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Why?
speaker="william_j_baxley" startTime="496.658" stopTime="501.252">
    Mr. William J. Baxley 
    Because this Court has held basically that and the Alabama supreme court has held that over and over, repeatedly.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="501.252" stopTime="512.880">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well, held... are you talking... you say, held that. 
    You suggest that the Alabama supreme court and this Court has held that in the hypothetical example I've given you it violates due process?
speaker="william_j_baxley" startTime="512.880" stopTime="534.252">
    Mr. William J. Baxley 
    If you deny someone the right to fully and totally litigate a constitutional issue, however you cut him off, whether by case law or by a statute, then it would not meet the test of this Court, that this Court says the due process rights transcend and, so to speak, would overcome... whether it be case law at the State level or a State statute--
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="534.252" stopTime="560.598">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Mr. Baxley, but in many of these instances, these so called taxpayer suits, you wouldn't even have any right at all to be in court were it not for the grace of the State that allows you to be kind of a private Attorney General. 
    I would think... your taxpayer is someone who is paying tax and doesn't want to. 
    These taxpayer suits, where the taxpayer emerges to represent the public, are quite a different animal, are they not?
speaker="william_j_baxley" startTime="560.598" stopTime="562.901">
    Mr. William J. Baxley 
    --Well, I think--
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="562.901" stopTime="569.624">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Do you have any due process right to bring a case that, if you were in the Federal court, they'd probably say you don't even have standing?
speaker="william_j_baxley" startTime="569.624" stopTime="578.370">
    Mr. William J. Baxley 
    --I think that you always have standing if you've got a major constitutional right that you say is being infringed upon.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="578.370" stopTime="633.659">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    That's not... certainly not true. 
    I mean, let's assume that you have a... I mean, we have cases where the Constitution contains a statement of accounts clause, and we have held that a private citizen cannot sue, has no standing to sue to compel the expenditures of the CIA to be disclosed under that provision. 
    We say, maybe it violates the Constitution, maybe it doesn't, but no individual has standing because it's a generalized interest. 
    Now, we have that doctrine at the Federal level because of separation of powers concerns, because we have a distinctive Federal doctrine of separation of powers. 
    The States don't have to follow our separation of powers doctrine, and if they choose to allow a suit in that situation, why is it a denial of due process for them to say, we're going to allow the suit, but only one, whereas we don't allow the suit at all? 
    How can they be in worse shape constitutionally than we are?
speaker="william_j_baxley" startTime="633.659" stopTime="675.985">
    Mr. William J. Baxley 
    I think the best answer there is a case of this Court of Waters v. St. Louis, and it's so parallel to the situation we have here. 
    The legislature of Missouri passed a law that said cities of over 700,000 people can impose an occupational tax on businesses and individuals, but they said that on businesses and on proprietors that ran their own businesses they could do it on the net and deduct their taxes. 
    Before the tax actually went into effect, a taxpayer in Missouri filed suit on constitutional grounds. 
    It got to this Court, and I believe it was Justice Jackson who wrote the majority opinion--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="675.985" stopTime="736.356">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    But you very carefully and quite appropriately pick a case in which there would have been standing in Federal courts. 
    All that has been suggested by the Chief Justice and by Justice Ginsburg, and I'm suggesting the same thing, is that you're casting your net too widely, that there are certain... you have... there are certainly some actions in which the State allows a citizen to proceed with a suit where we don't. 
    The construction of a bridge. 
    If someone says that the construction of a bridge is contrary to law... the person is not harmed at all. 
    He just says, I don't like Federal money being spent for something it shouldn't be spent for. 
    Could he bring suit in Federal court? 
    No. 
    He can bring suit in many States simply on the ground that this money shouldn't be expended by the county, or whoever it is. 
    Now, your position is that although it's perfectly okay to deny the suit to anybody, the State cannot say, well, we'll allow the suit, but only once, that the latter violates due process of law, but the former does not. 
    That is not a very appealing proposition.
speaker="william_j_baxley" startTime="736.356" stopTime="744.840">
    Mr. William J. Baxley 
    --I think that the State does not have the right to, by statute or any other way, cut off someone's right to litigate a constitutional issue--
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="744.840" stopTime="780.453">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    But if you have no right to begin with under the Federal Constitution... you have a taxpayer, an actual taxpayer who doesn't want to pay tax out of his pocket. 
    Isn't that quite a different case from what is labeled, taxpayer suit, and what that note in the brief is of... the other side is filled with what we call taxpayer suits, where someone emerges as champion of the public in general, but is no more affected than the public in general.
speaker="william_j_baxley" startTime="780.453" stopTime="781.384">

    --Yes, Your Honor.

    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    But we are talking about real taxpayers, and that's a little different, isn't it?
speaker="william_j_baxley" startTime="785.969" stopTime="808.064">
    Mr. William J. Baxley 
    We're talking about real taxpayers, and in the Hansberry v. Lee, this Court said that the State is free to call these actions whatever they want to. 
    They can call them virtual representation, they can call them class actions, if they call them class actions they can set certain rules, but the State cannot... whatever they call them, they cannot deny someone's due process rights and--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="808.064" stopTime="818.851">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Wait, do you say that a State can't even authorize a class action and have the result of that class action binding on members of the class?
speaker="william_j_baxley" startTime="818.851" stopTime="852.413">
    Mr. William J. Baxley 
    --I think they absolutely can, but I also think you go back to the decision of this Court 3 weeks ago, roughly, in the Matsushita case, where... and your dissent, you say... I'm sorry, Justice Ginsburg dissent says that a State... you can have these class actions. 
    I don't think this part of it conflicted with the majority. 
    You still, even in a consent settlement you've got to make sure that due process rights of the, and adequate representation and things of that nature, that they still have got to be fulfilled.

    I know it is, but the questions we have been propounding to you are... which you simply haven't responded to, at least so far as I can tell, are the other situations, where, as Justice Ginsburg puts it, you have a taxpayer's action where the taxpayer is really a private Attorney General saying, we don't like... we think this money is being spent in violation of the Constitution, even though they suffer no particularized injury, and the question is whether that kind of a case isn't perhaps different.

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Well then, in order to agree with you, we don't have to go as far as you initially urged us, to say that in every case where a State allows suit it has to allow that a later plaintiff can bring the same suit. 
    Let me put the question more specifically. 
    Do you believe that your client would have had standing under Federal law to challenge what was done here if it had been done by the Federal Government?
speaker="william_j_baxley" startTime="992.927" stopTime="1000.451">
    Mr. William J. Baxley

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    No, but let's assume this scheme is in effect and it's a Federal scheme rather than a State or county scheme. 
    It's a Federal scheme. 
    Would there have been standing under our Federal law of standing to sue?

    Mr. William J. Baxley 
    Yes. 
    Yes, Your Honor.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="1013.778" stopTime="1032.101">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Well, it seems to me that that's the only point you need sustain, that in the type of a lawsuit where there would be standing under the Federal law of standing, in that type of lawsuit, at least, you cannot preclude a plaintiff who was not actually bound by the first judgment.
speaker="william_j_baxley" startTime="1032.101" stopTime="1033.483">
    Mr. William J. Baxley 
    I agree.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="1033.483" stopTime="1039.387">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Can I agree with that more limited proposition and perhaps find for you on that basis?
speaker="william_j_baxley" startTime="1039.387" stopTime="1177.034">
    Mr. William J. Baxley 
    Your Honor, you can find for us on any basis. 
    [Laughter] 
    Yes, sir, I would concur totally. 
    I think that there are really four cases. 
    There's another case that I think is very much in point about bringing this up again, when it involves a basic constitutional right, and this was a case that, again, they found for us. 
    Respondents cited it. 
    It's Quong Wing v. Kirkpatrick, I believe, the Montana case, and they cited it I suppose because it looked like it was a horrible case for us on the equal protection issue, but when I read that case, lo and behold, Justice Holmes... it was a case where the State of Montana had imposed a what looked like blatantly discriminatory tax aimed at the Chinese laundries. 
    And Justice Holmes mentioned in the opinion that in oral argument he tried to ask the counsel that was arguing about the equal protection issue and counsel wouldn't respond, denied it, might have been asleep like I was when Justice Scalia was asking me. 
    But Justice Holmes said in his opinion, he said that we brought this up, this is going to come up again, and when it does come up again, and laws are frequently attacked by... that the lawyers don't give the Court anything to sustain them and we don't want to sustain them, but when this issue comes up again, when it's properly attacked, because it's a constitutional issue, that if it comes up again we're going to rule with them. 
    So I would think that Justice Holmes would be wondering... if he thought that that opinion would be cited in later days by people in the position of respondents, saying that this opinion does not allow the same party to attack it on the constitutional issue... he said they could. 
    How horrified he would be if they said that that opinion by Justice Holmes prevented every future American of Chinese ancestry to not attack a ruling on that basis because the issue could have been raised and wasn't.

    There's an occupational tax, and your client says, it's not fair to make me pay that tax, so... but why isn't it fair for the State to say, it's good enough to have in this category, too, one taxpayer with a good lawyer fight out the case so we're going to apply in this taxpayer as taxpayer area the same thing we apply in the municipal bondholder's suit, and the people who want to challenge the annexation of a county, or Mrs. Frothingham who wants to challenge how public money is spent.

    Mr. William J. Baxley 
    Because the... I don't think you can cut off someone's right to litigate a constitutional issue that's affecting them, and... but we don't have that situation here. 
    This is not an action that was allowed by statute. 
    It just came on a declaratory judgment. 
    And also, one important thing, and it goes back to the question Justice Stevens asked, the complaint in Bedingfield, the first action here, never at any time was there any attack made on the exemption scheme. 
    It had not even gone into effect yet. 
    Probably most people didn't even understand it at the time, because the tax hadn't started taking effect yet, and so no one ever, even though it was in the complaint with the equal protection part, nobody has ever attacked the exemption scheme until the instant case right here, and we submit there are some possibilities that perhaps it would have been premature at the time Bedingfield came on, since the tax was not being collected. 
    It indicates that in Justice Jackson's opinion in the St. Louis case. 
    It might have been premature to have attacked the exemption scheme as early as they did. 
    Justice Jackson mentions--

   Argument of William M. Slaughter
speaker="william_m_slaughter" startTime="1510.743" stopTime="1538.150">
    Mr. William M. Slaughter 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    I do not think it would be an exaggeration to say that if this Court were to adopt the petitioners' truncated view of the Due Process Clause with respect to representational suits, that they would overturn several hundred years of equitable development of class actions as culminating in Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="1538.150" stopTime="1541.483">

speaker="william_m_slaughter" startTime="1541.483" stopTime="1571.943">
    Mr. William M. Slaughter 
    Justice Souter, I believe that by trying to rest this case on the authority, among others, of Martin v. Wilks, totally ignoring footnote number 2, in which the Chief Justice reserved from the implications of that case the whole panoply of representational suits, first of all as typified by Hansberry v. Lee, and also the second cite in the footnote was Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure--
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="1571.943" stopTime="1578.498">
    Justice David H. Souter

    Mr. William M. Slaughter 
    --Well, I think he--
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="1579.857" stopTime="1602.343">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    He is claiming that his clients want to sue simply as taxpayers. 
    They were not in privity with any other taxpayers who were sued and, in fact, they want to sue on an issue which was not litigated, and he is saying that in no sense can you call a prior action a representational suit as to my clients. 
    I think that's as far as his argument goes.

    Mr. William M. Slaughter 
    --That may be his argument, but it is both historically and factually incorrect. 
    The laws of Alabama have historically allowed, like the laws of other States, declaratory actions in which private citizens act as Attorney Generals to challenge public law--
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="1618.365" stopTime="1665.455">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    But that is not... we've just been all around that. 
    Let's concentrate on the case of a taxpayer, a true taxpayer. 
    This is not somebody who's coming forward as a private Attorney General. 
    This is someone that the State of Alabama is saying, you owe an occupational tax. 
    All right, that's standing in the Federal court, and it's certainly standing in the Federal court, so let's forget about the taxpayer suits of the kind where you wouldn't have standing in Federal court, where you're just one of everybody in the public, and nobody is hitting you in your own pocket. 
    Let's concentrate on those. 
    Now, I do not know of legions of precedent that say, you can have a virtual class action without notice to anybody in the class. 
    That's what we're dealing with, and that's what I'd like you to address.

    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Mr. Slaughter, how does your argument stand against an important precedent in this Court, a case called Mullane v.

speaker="william_m_slaughter" startTime="1806.257" stopTime="1821.788">
    Mr. William M. Slaughter 
    --The distinction between due process and Mullane v. Central Hanover Bank is that the holders of the trust, common trust interest in that case were not represented by anybody.

speaker="william_m_slaughter" startTime="1829.102" stopTime="1851.286">
    Mr. William M. Slaughter 
    --And that element to some degree was used by the court as a justification for not requiring a stricter standard of notice.

speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="1851.286" stopTime="1923.344">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    Why, if... assuming that... I mean, you may... I think you may be right that (b)(2) is implicated here, but I thought there's a mistake the State court seemed to have made. 
    They thought that this taxpayer action was like the private Attorney General taxpayer action, which is where these cases originated, but that isn't this. 
    This is a case, isn't it, like a bunch of 10,000 people living in a city, and the city puts up some noxious fumes, and all 10,000 people breathe them, so they want to proceed against a nuisance, or there's a giant accident, and it happens to kill or hurt 10,000 people, and there you would have, let's say, a (b)(2) action for nuisance. 
    But very well, I didn't find any contrary authority to the proposition that if you have a class action of that kind, you have to give notice to the other people. 
    At least you should give notice. 
    If Joe Smith is going to be the first person to run in and sue the city for the nuisance, or the first person to collect, Jones and 14,000 other people should at least have notice of what's going on and a chance to talk to the judge before they can be bound in res judicata. 
    At least, I don't know why that shouldn't be so.

    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    I know it does not say that in the rule. 
    That's the basis of my question. 
    What I want to know is, I couldn't find any authority that explained to me why there is not notice in (b)(2), why there shouldn't be notice, how those class actions work, or what conceivable thing was going through the rulemaker's mind in not saying you should have notice, given the precedent in the Supreme Court that you can't take a person's action away from them without notice. 
    That's my question.
speaker="william_m_slaughter" startTime="1958.708" stopTime="1995.523">
    Mr. William M. Slaughter 
    The explanation of that is to be found in the history of Rule 23 and the version that existed from 1938 to 1966. 
    That version was, in fact, merely a codification of the kind of historic equity class action that had been governed by this Court's Rule 48 and then Rule 38. 
    It did not require any kind of certification for a class, nor did it require any kind of notice. 
    The nature of the class was defined by the jural relationships between the members, by their common identity, if you will, in terms of their interests which were to be adjudicated.

    --Why, because normally you'd think, in a situation where you're proceeding against an injunction, for example, for a nuisance, you would have thought the first person to sue is going to win or lose, and then stare decisis will take care of the rest. 
    But I was rather surprised that in such suits that first person's suit could bind other people who suffered from the nuisance on issues that were not litigated. 
    Now, if, in fact, that did happen under (b)(2) or this historic practice in equity, I'd like to know why it happened, because it happening without notice would seem, (a) very unfair, and (b) contrary to the precedents of the Court that say you can't take a person's action away from him without notice.

    Mr. Slaughter, that's not quite right, is it? 
    There isn't mandatory notice because there is such a variety of cases that come under (b)(1) and (b)(2), but look at (d)(3), which instructs the court to require for the protection of the members of the class or otherwise for the fair conduct of the action that notice be given in such manner as the court may direct. 
    I assume from that provision that in a case comparable to the Mullane situation a district court, if we were operating under the Federal rules and in Alabama, since they have virtually the same rules, would say in this kind of action you have to give notice.

    But you are... are you saying that there are... sometimes you do need a class action with the court to certify the class and notice to the members. 
    Can you distinguish for me the cases where you do need a class action, if that is your position, and those where you don't?
speaker="william_m_slaughter" startTime="2480.123" stopTime="2532.089">
    Mr. William M. Slaughter 
    --I cannot distinguish all, but I can tell you that the very class of case that we're talking about today, cases which need to determine with some degree of finality and reliability State and local government issues do need the possibility of class adjudication, whether it be in the traditional form which I say the Bedingfield case was, or certified as a (b)(1) or (b)(2) class, as the petitioners seek to do in this case. 
    In either case, it would constitute a final litigation of the matter, and would enable government to proceed without the constitutional cloud of uncertainty hanging over its head. 
    In that respect, I think class actions are very useful, though they do conflict with this tradition in a free society that Justice Scalia was talking about.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="2532.089" stopTime="2558.716">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    But isn't it true that in the governmental context, normally the government feels comfortable proceeding with all the risks, reliance on the doctrine of stare decisis? 
    Once they've got a... the supreme court of a State has ruled on and passed on most of the issues, they figure things are okay. 
    And something... somebody can always come up with some new idea, but to say they have to have claim preclusion to give the government authority sufficient confidence to go ahead with their project seems to me carrying it a little farther than you really have to.
speaker="william_m_slaughter" startTime="2558.716" stopTime="2611.451">
    Mr. William M. Slaughter 
    Well, as I mentioned in our brief, Justice Stevens, we are not going to insist on claim preclusion in this case. 
    I think an adequate argument can be made for issue preclusion on the equal protection case. 
    And admittedly... admittedly, there are a number of cases where, if a matter in question, for example, the proper procedure for a bond issue had not been followed and the prior test case only dealt with the legality of its purpose, then clearly the second case would not be blocked. 
    But in this case, the county, bond attorneys, everyone relied upon the fact that the equal protection argument had been raised in the earlier case, and assuming that it was a class action that had the same preclusive effect as a (b)(1) class action, it was deemed to be res judicata with regard to that--
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="2611.451" stopTime="2637.416">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Mr. Slaughter-- 
    --But don't you-- 
    --I'm a little confused. 
    You just said you were not insisting on claim preclusion. 
    Instead, you said issue preclusion, but issue preclusion, or what some people call collateral estoppel, requires not merely the issue be raised, but that it be actually litigated, and decided, and essential to the decision, and it's those two things, actually litigated and decided and is central to the decision, that you don't have with respect to the equal protection claim.
speaker="william_m_slaughter" startTime="2637.416" stopTime="2662.585">
    Mr. William M. Slaughter 
    --With all due respect, Your Honor, I think it is present in this case. 
    First of all, the customary rule with regard to judgments is that if an issue was raised by the litigants, whether or not the evidence was sufficient, or whether or not the Court specifically addressed it, if it was consistent with the judgment and a contrary position would have negated the judgment, then the decision of that issue is merged in the judgment.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="2662.585" stopTime="2683.509">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    But that only goes to res judicata. 
    That does not apply in a claim preclusion situation. 
    I mean, Justice Ginsburg's very question is, I think, that if you are going to insist on the position that they are cut off on an issue which was not, in fact, litigated, even though it may have been raised, then you've got to rest your case on res judicata, not on issue preclusion.
speaker="william_m_slaughter" startTime="2683.509" stopTime="2720.154">
    Mr. William M. Slaughter 
    Your Honor, what I am trying to say in that argument, and for that purpose we cited Grubb v. Public Service Commission of Ohio, was that as a rule of decision, not... having nothing to do with res judicata, just what first of all was decided, before we get to whether or not that decision precluded anything, the proper rule is that the equal protection question was decided in the case. 
    Now, whether it should then have preclusive effect either on a res judicata or on an issue preclusion basis was a different question.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="2720.154" stopTime="2742.948">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    Right, and that's the reason for Justice Ginsburg's question and my question. 
    If you are saying, as I thought you were saying, that you didn't insist on res judicata, that you were satisfied to rely on issue preclusion, then you lose, it seems to me, on any claim of issue preclusion on the res judicata point, because it was not, in fact, litigated. 
    It was merely raised.

    You're absolutely--

    It may have cut off the parties to the first case, but it is not going to cut off anyone else.
speaker="william_m_slaughter" startTime="2748.271" stopTime="2776.000">
    Mr. William M. Slaughter 
    --On that point, you are correct, Your Honor. 
    If we cannot persuade this Court that the appropriate rule of decision was that the equal protection question was, in fact, decided by Bedingfield, then we may indeed be vulnerable, unless the representational nature of the class action of the suit is sufficient to invoke the broader standard of claim preclusion.
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="2776.000" stopTime="2862.345">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    Well, on that, could you go back to Justice Stevens' and Justice O'Connor's question for just a second, because it seemed to me that on... there are two equal protection claims, I think, that were raised. 
    One was 500,000, and they might have litigated that one, I don't know, but the other one is the licensed professionals versus the other, and that was stated in the claim and then abandoned, all right, I guess, or they never got to it, so think of the second one, all right? 
    Now, I take it no notice... is there... you were talking about tradition, the tradition of these class actions. 
    Did you find any case... because I couldn't find one, but did you find a case which, going back as long as you want in tradition, would say, take, e.g., a nuisance run by the city that hurts 10,000 people, not a taxpayer action that is a private Attorney General action... that's out of this case. 
    This is more like a nuisance, or an accident that hurts 10,000 people in their cars. 
    Did you find any case where the first person to bring the nuisance suit would bind later people who did not have notice on an issue that wasn't litigated? 
    That's the tradition that I think would be relevant here, and I'm not saying there is or there isn't. 
    I'm saying I couldn't find such a thing, and I do see the possibility of such a thing falling under (b)(2), and maybe the appropriate action order thing that Justice Ginsburg takes care of it, but did you find any such case?
speaker="william_m_slaughter" startTime="2862.345" stopTime="2881.509">
    Mr. William M. Slaughter 
    No, I did not, Your Honor, and that is precisely the reason why in the brief I said that perhaps the Alabama supreme court painted too broadly with the claim preclusion brush for purposes of due process, and that it might be more... a kinder and gentler due process application if, in fact, it were limited to issue preclusion.
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="2881.509" stopTime="2890.543">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    And if that were so, then I guess it wasn't just that there was no finding that the representation was adequate. 
    What concerns me more than that is the fact that there was not even any notice.
speaker="william_m_slaughter" startTime="2890.543" stopTime="2942.718">
    Mr. William M. Slaughter 
    Well, Your Honor, with regard to this notice, I can answer nothing, other than usage that has been sanctioned for many years as a settled practice meets the requirements of due process, because in fact, if you examine the history of this kind of representational suit in equity, the precursor of Rule 23 between 1938 and 1966 and its present operation with regard to (b)(1) and (b)(2) classes, which are the suitable vehicle for this kind of public issue, notice is not required in order to establish a class that is binding on all of the members of that class, provided that there has been fair and adequate representation of the class interest. 
    And that was the issue in Hansberry v. Lee, which I submit governs this case completely. 
    First of all--
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="2942.718" stopTime="2975.288">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Mr. Slaughter, you mentioned that you case is a little shaky on the claim preclusion part, but you say it's solid on issue preclusion, and since you do have a decision of the highest court of your State, is there, in fact, any difference between stare decisis and issue preclusion with respect to these issues, the ones that were actually litigated and decided all the way up the line in Alabama? 
    Is there any significant difference between those two labels?
speaker="william_m_slaughter" startTime="2975.288" stopTime="2994.673">
    Mr. William M. Slaughter 
    --Just the necessity of going through the relitigation of this particular case again, Your Honor, and the fact that if someone doesn't like the opinion of the Alabama supreme court in that case, yet another plaintiff may bring the public law equivalent of a strike suit.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="2994.673" stopTime="3006.251">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    But you can always bring a suit, and in both cases it seems to me the other side would move for summary judgment and one case would say, issue preclusion, and the other case would say, stare decisis.
speaker="william_m_slaughter" startTime="3006.251" stopTime="3023.010">
    Mr. William M. Slaughter 
    But, Your Honor, I think you would acknowledge that there is always a little bit more of a chink to get through the opening provided by stare decisis than there is with res judicata, because the law evolves, and that is taken into account with stare decisis.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="3023.010" stopTime="3025.321">

    More wriggle room, because you have more cases. 
    It is not the authority of the single prior case, but all of the cases that may be of a similar nature that are to be taken into account for stare decisis.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="3035.620" stopTime="3053.431">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    May I ask you one question on the distinction of stare decisis and preclusion?

    Well, the most--

    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Can you give me a case that--
speaker="william_m_slaughter" startTime="3064.868" stopTime="3200.557">
    Mr. William M. Slaughter 
    --Yes. 
    I think the Southwest Airlines case versus the Texas International case is very much on point in that regard, Justice Stevens, because the privity, if you will, was created in that case by the identity of interest in the single, narrow legal issue that was presented, which was the litigation of the validity of a Dallas ordinance prohibiting the use of Love Field, and it had been decided earlier that that ordinance violated Texas law. 
    All of the airlines who wanted to exclude Southwest from Love Field had a tremendous economic interest, but the court held that they were precluded from further litigating that question because their legal as opposed to their economic interest was indistinguishable from that of the City of Dallas and others who had litigated the same public question before, and that is a case, I think, that meets your criteria. 
    Now, they had notice, though, in the sense of actual notice, because of all the publicity attending the case, but not necessarily legal notice within the procedural requirements of Rule 23. 
    As I said earlier, I believe that this case is really governed by Hansberry v. Lee, which stood for several very fundamental points. 
    One, I agree with the petitioners that it said the States are free, subject to Federal due process, to devise any kind of procedural vehicle for representational suits they desire. 
    Secondly, those representational suits will bind the members of the class who are represented. 
    Thirdly, it is a violation of due process if the representative of the class has a conflict of interest or does not adequately represent the members of the class, and that was a specific holding in Hansberry v. Lee, and finally, Hansberry v. Lee stands for the proposition that the question of adequate and fair representation in this kind of suit is a matter for retroactive examination by the courts when res judicata becomes a question. 
    And in that regard, it is consistent with the principle of Rule 23 that the certification of a class does not establish its preclusive effect for the future.

   Rebuttal of William J. Baxley
speaker="william_j_baxley" startTime="3205.933" stopTime="3304.569">
    Mr. William J. Baxley 
    No question, Bedingfield was not a class. 
    Nobody ever considered it one, and contrast the lack of notice there with what was deemed not sufficient in Martin v. Wilks, where there, you had the Birmingham Firefighters Association that appeared, these later plaintiffs were members of the association, the court ordered that notice be published in both Birmingham newspapers for, I think, 30 days or so, they solicited opinions, asked everybody to come in, these organizations represented these people, you had much, much more notice type in the Martin v. Wilks than you had here, where you had none, zero. 
    Secondly, it could have been a class. 
    The county, if they had wanted it to barr everything forever, they could have come in... the Rules of Civil Procedure were in effect in Alabama for class actions 10 or 12 years before Bedingfield. 
    The county didn't want to do that. 
    They didn't want to make it a class. 
    They hoped nobody would ever raise legal protection. 
    They didn't want to litigate it then, they don't want to litigate it today, they don't wan to litigate it tomorrow, but that's the party that should have made it that way by your dicta, or your ruling of both parties are the ones that best know. 
    And lastly, in the Southwest Airlines case that he mentioned just then, that was a very different situation that the Fifth Circuit ruled in that instance. 
    The attorneys for the parties that were "nonparties" also filed amicus briefs. 
    They attended the... they sat through the actual first proceeding, there was a lot of different fact situations different in the Southwest Airlines case than here, where you had absolutely no relationship--
