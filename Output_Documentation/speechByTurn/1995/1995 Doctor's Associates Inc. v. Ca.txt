    Mr. Kravitz.
speaker="mark_r_kravitz" startTime="10.779" stopTime="185.295">
    Mr. Mark R. Kravitz 
    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    Section 2 of the Federal Arbitration Act makes written provisions valid, irrevocable, and enforceable except for grounds that apply for the revocation of any contract. 
    In this case, however, the Montana supreme court refused to enforce the parties' agreement to arbitrate because it failed to comply with the heightened notice statute that, by its plain language, applies only to arbitration agreements and not to other contracts. 
    Respondents thus have tried to recast Montana's notice statute as codifying some general principle of unexpectedness, but that effort fails for two reasons. 
    First, Montana's law does no such thing, since it applies to only one type of provision, arbitration agreements, and it applies to them whether they're unexpected or not. 
    Second, the FAA prevents a court from refusing to enforce the parties' agreement to arbitrate on the basis of a State law principle that turns on the fact that the subject matter involved is arbitration. 
    Thus, under the FAA, a State may not decide, as Montana has decided here, that a contract is fair enough to enforce its basic terms but not fair enough to enforce its arbitration clause. 
    Congress enacted the Federal Arbitration Act to clear away judicial and legislative suspicion of arbitration, in and so doing, Congress decided for itself to determine the circumstances under which arbitration clauses would be enforceable, unencumbered by State law constraints. 
    To that end, the text of section 2 alone determines the enforceability of an arbitration agreement, and that text provides that arbitration provisions are enforceable and valid and irrevocable, save for one explicit, and explicitly limited, exception: upon grounds that exist for the revocation of any contract. 
    We believe that in determining whether or not a State law or principle fits within that savings clause, two considerations are paramount. 
    First, the savings clause is an exception to a sweeping general rule of enforcement. 
    Therefore, the Court must be on its guard not to allow the exceptions to swallow or undercut the general rule. 
    Second, section 2 establishes a principle of what I'll call rigorous equality for arbitration clauses. 
    They may be no less valid, no less enforceable, and no less irrevocable than other contract terms under State law. 
    As a result, this Court has identified two tests that State laws or principles must pass before a law fits within the savings clause. 
    First, the law must be one of general application. 
    That is to say, it must apply to contracts generally. 
    Secondly, even if it is in theory a general principle of law, the particularized application of that general principle cannot turn on the fact that the subject matter involved is arbitration.

    Mr. Mark R. Kravitz 
    Well, Your Honor, I believe that the text of section 2 provides the answer to that, and that text says that the written provisions are valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, whether in State court or Federal court, save upon grounds that exist for the revocation of any contract, which is to say contracts generally. 
    Now, this Court in Perry and in First Options has said that you look to State rule, has made the choice that... let me step back, said as a matter of Federal law, therefore, the arbitration agreement is valid and enforceable. 
    The court has then looked to State principles of general application on revocability, but it has done that because the statute so provides, so I think that the court would be prohibited from developing specialized rules under some sort of Federal common law designed to impose on arbitration agreements limitations that are not applicable to clauses generally.

    --Well, but the law generally, of course, is that all of the terms in a forum contract, an adhesion contract are, in fact, presumptively valid, if you put your signature on it, so that in fact the law of contracts generally would say these are valid, and that law of contracts generally is being skewed solely... it's singling out arbitration, and solely because of the fact that it's arbitration involved as opposed to something else. 
    And one must ask oneself, why is one skewing the law that way, and it is because one is making a value judgment that arbitration is perhaps less good than a court proceeding, or the like, precisely the value judgment Congress sought to take the way from both Federal courts and State courts and State legislatures when it enacted the FAA.

    Mr. Mark R. Kravitz 
    No, I would not, and indeed, just to follow up on that point, it has been argued by the respondents that this is just a notice statute. 
    This doesn't affect the enforceability of these clauses. 
    But that argument is simply not so. 
    This law, which is labeled a notice law, says that arbitration clauses containing agreement without notice are not enforceable, whereas the other terms in the same agreement, without notice, are enforceable, so this statute, which is nominally denominated in a notice statute does, in fact, go to the enforceability of the arbitration clause.

    Actually, I'm not sure that any actually requires an underline on the first page. 
    There are... as you might imagine, the UCC, for example, says that a disclaimer of implied warranties has to be "conspicuous". 
    That's a heightened notice statute. 
    I believe the respondents make reference to retail instalment contracts requiring certain disclosures. 
    I don't believe they're underlined in capital letters. 
    But basically, we're talking about not the law generally in Montana.

    Mr. Mark R. Kravitz 
    I know the UCC... I'm aware because of their footnote that they're retail installment contracts, but that's all I'm aware of. 
    For example, Justice Breyer, I'm not aware of any principle in Montana law that waiving any constitutional right requires any special notice on the first page. 
    You can waive a jury trial... you can waive these things under Montana law, and nothing special is required, but something is specially required of arbitration under Montana law, and it... and the court explained why something special was required, and that was because the court itself and the legislature were concerned about citizens in Montana agreeing to a procedure that that court felt was devoid of all procedural protections.

    --Yes, Your Honor. 
    [Laughter] 
    It certainly is not a question that the answer for which determines this case at all, because of the focused nature of the statute, and I think that the courts... it's important, under the savings clause, I believe, to interpret it and to enforce it and to apply it in the way in which, the manner in which this Court has done in its cases, which is to say, insist, as the language does, that only laws or principles that apply to contracts generally can be used to revoke an arbitration clause, and it's important for really two reasons. 
    The first is that, if you want to allow States to add additional limitations, their own special rules or processes for arbitration agreements, it inevitably undercuts the enforceability of arbitration, and it makes them... puts them on a different footing than other contracts, so it impairs not only the words... violates the words as such, but impairs Congress' intent that this Court has recognized to treat arbitration agreements like any other contract.

    Well, Your Honor, to be honest, we... I think that Volt is about the oddest place to find support for the Montana supreme court. 
    Volt enforced the parties' choice of law. 
    Volt enforced the arbitration agreement. 
    In this case, the Montana supreme court refused to enforce the parties' choice of law and refused to enforce the arbitration agreement. 
    Volt really was no different--

    In fact, the parties intended that that was the result. 
    It was... Volt... I mean, really Volt is no different than if the parties had in their arbitration agreement spelled out and said, when there is litigation pending with someone else, this is how we'll handle it, and the Court in Volt said that the... it took the California supreme court's interpretation of the contract as the effective equivalent to what I've just posed and said, well, the FAA is about enforcing parties' choices, and we need to enforce those choices, but that's not the situation here. 
    And here we have a situation where the parties have said, Connecticut law governs, and we want to arbitrate, and the Court wiped away the Connecticut choice of law and then applied the Montana statute to eliminate the parties choice.

    Mr. Mark R. Kravitz 
    --Well, under Volt, then, you're trying to determine the intent of the parties. 
    However, this Court this last term in the Mastrobuono case said... recognized it's a cardinal principle of statutory interpretation that two clauses shouldn't be seen to intrude on one another. 
    And one would ask the question then if the court finds that the choice of law clause is meant to actually render completely invalid another clause in the contract, are they applying principles of contract construction in an evenhanded manner, or are they applying them in a manner that's skewed against arbitration? 
    And in Perry the Court said, in construing an arbitration clause, the court must do so the same way it would a nonarbitration clause, and so if, in fact, the court were overriding one clause of the agreement with another clause of the agreement and doing so because arbitration was involved as opposed to some other term, then that would run afoul of the FAA in the same circumstance, even when they chose Montana law in that circumstance. 
    And you wouldn't ordinarily expect that the parties in one clause would say, we'll arbitrate, and in another clause say, no, you know, we're not going to arbitrate. 
    But I must say, as the amicus brief points out, that is what courts have been doing with Volt, contrary, I think, to the intent of Volt, is that they have been using a choice of law clause to say, well then, if you've chosen Montana law, we'll just throw out the entire arbitration agreement. 
    That's not what happened in Volt. 
    I don't think that's what Volt stands for. 
    It certainly isn't what the Court explained it stood for in Mastrobuono, but yet that has been happening in courts below. 
    Of course, here again, the parties chose Connecticut law, and under Connecticut law this arbitration agreement is fully enforceable and fully valid, and the court then used the notice statute to void the parties' choice of law, the same notice statute it used to void the parties' choice of arbitration.

    Mr. Mark R. Kravitz 
    Well, let me say two things. 
    First, I want to make clear that this statute isn't limited to forum contracts or adhesion contracts or anything else. 
    Going to your hypothetical, I believe the answer is no, if you are saying holding the fact of arbitration unconscionable. 
    If you're striking down the entire contract, that would be acceptable under the construct that I've proposed, because then you would be fairly assured that what's happening is a principle of general application, not something that is targeted to arbitration, so striking down the entire--

    Ms. Lucinda A. Sikes 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court: 
    The issue presented in this case is whether a Montana notice statute, a statute which is aimed at ensuring that parties know that they're signing a contract that includes an arbitration provision, is preempted by the Federal Arbitration Act. 
    The Montana notice requirement is different from all the State requirements that this Court has preempted in the past because its function is not to prevent arbitration but to help ensure that arbitration is consensual. 
    The statutes preempted in Southland, in Perry, and in Terminex prevented the enforcement of arbitration agreements so that there was nothing a person who wanted to enforce arbitration could do to make sure that it would be enforced. 
    Here, on the other hand, it's in the total control of the person drafting the agreement to make sure that the arbitration provision will be enforced.

    I don't think that's what Montana is doing. 
    Let me explain why it falls within the savings clause of section 2 of the Federal Arbitration Act. 
    Suppose for a moment that Montana had not adopted the statutory notice requirement, but we had similar facts, so that the plaintiff had tried to sue... had filed a suit in court, the defendant had sought to stay litigation in order to compel arbitration, then the plaintiff could have gone into court and said that the arbitration was invalid under general contract principles that unexpected clauses in contracts need to be conspicuous. 
    And in that case, I don't think that would have been prevented by the Federal Arbitration Act, because what the Court would be doing in that case is applying a general contract principle of unexpected... of reasonable expectations doctrine to the arbitration provision and invalidating it, and that that's simply what the Montana court is doing--

    May I ask you a question before you leave the question Justice Breyer raised, and that is, in giving the answer that you could to his question, you were giving some examples that at least... perhaps I didn't understand what you were saying, but they didn't seem to suggest to me that they would be an appropriate part of the series of unexpected terms. 
    For example, you mentioned the terms of a retail installment contract. 
    What would be unexpected in buying a refrigerator on the installment plan in the fact that there were terms governing the installment payments? 
    What's unexpected about that? 
    It seems to me that the concept these examples are pointing to is something other than unexpectedness.

    Ms. Lucinda A. Sikes 
    Exactly. 
    I think that's right, and I think it's important also to note that the way that that statute's been applied in Montana is that if... that shows that it's really a notice requirement and nothing more is the Chor case, that's cited in our brief. 
    In that case, Ms. Chor signed a contract that included an arbitration provision. 
    She said that she understood at the time she signed the contract that the arbitration, that her... any disputes under the contract would have to be arbitrated, and even though the notice requirement wasn't on the front page of that contract, the Montana supreme court went ahead and compelled arbitration. 
    I think that shows that in Montana it really is an informed consent provision. 
    If the parties consent to arbitrate, then the court is going to enforce it.

    But what the Montana... the doctrine of how you determine whether or not something is within the reasonable expectations of someone signing the contract also has to go to whether it's conspicuous or not. 
    The common law has developed that way, so if it's on the front page of a contract you can't argue any more that you didn't expect to see it because it's there, it's in capital letters, and you see it, so you can no longer say, well, I didn't know what I was signing.

    Ms. Lucinda A. Sikes 
    Well, the people would be looking for those, and the common law doesn't say it has to be on the front page, but... which is why I think the statute actually benefits parties, because it sets out what the person drafting the agreement has to do in order to make sure that their provision is conspicuous enough. 
    So it sets out a bright line rule. 
    Once it's on the front page, they don't have to worry. 
    They know it's going to be enforced in Montana. 
    Montana has, since Southland, time after time, enforced arbitration agreements. 
    It's not a State that's refusing to enforce arbitration agreements. 
    They've only refused twice, once in this case and the other one, which was based on Volt, and all that the... the statute doesn't create any burden, any significant burden on a business to comply with it. 
    It simply requires them to look in the statute, see what's required, put it on the--

    Ms. Lucinda A. Sikes 
    --I think there's two... there's two points to your question. 
    First, I'm not sure that, given the Chor case, the Montana court wouldn't have gone ahead and enforced an arbitration agreement anyway, but even if they were... looked at the Montana notice statute and said, it's not the way we require, we're going to invalidate the arbitration provision. 
    It's not a tremendous burden on an interstate... on a business transacting business across the country to make sure that they comply with the different requirements of each State. 
    As I was saying, there's 12 States that have these franchise registration and disclosure requirements. 
    Franchisers have to know what those are, and they have to comply with them. 
    This is just a insignificant burden compared to all the other State laws that someone has to comply with. 
    All it does is, it requires... it's just to ensure that a person signing a contract knows that it includes an arbitration provision. 
    It doesn't discourage arbitration in any way, and it is easy for someone drafting the agreement to comply with it. 
    It's not a difficult process at all. 
    I also just want to--

    --Right. 
    It encourages... it makes sure that, unlike, as I said, all the other statutes that this Court has preempted, this one is easy to comply with. 
    In all the other cases, there was nothing someone who wanted to arbitrate could do to ensure that their arbitration agreement would be enforced. 
    In this case, all they have to do is comply with this requirement, which is an insignificant burden. 
    They just need to put it on the front page.

   Rebuttal of Mark R. Kravitz
speaker="mark_r_kravitz" startTime="3210.480" stopTime="3300.500">
    Mr. Mark R. Kravitz 
    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 
    I want to make two points in my rebuttal, if I may, just so that I'm clear about what our position is. 
    The first is this, and it was the second point that I made in my opening. 
    Regardless of whether or not this statute merely codifies some general principle of expectedness, which I don't think it does, but assuming for a moment that it does, as Ms. Sikes has said, it still falls under the FAA, so it would not be possible on remand for the Montana supreme court to decide we're now going to apply a general principle. 
    The general principle is adhesion. 
    We're not going to call it a statute, we're going to call it a general principle, and we're going to find that this is unexpected because Montana has outlawed arbitration for 100 years, and therefore no one in Montana would expect such a clause, and this Court dealt with precisely that issue in Perry. 
    In footnote 9 in Perry the Court said, you cannot have a statute that singles out arbitration, but it didn't stop there. 
    It went on and said, but there's one thing more. 
    If you're applying a State law principle of general applicability, and in that case it was the law of unconscionability, one can... a State cannot decide that a principle is violated on the basis of the fact that arbitration is involved because after all, if that's what could be done, then the courts could do that which this Court has said the legislatures may not do.

    Mr. Kravitz, isn't there another answer to my suggestion, namely that your opponent is suing on the contract, aren't they? 
    They're claiming a breach of the contract.

speaker="mark_r_kravitz" startTime="3312.878" stopTime="3414.635">
    Mr. Mark R. Kravitz 
    They're just attacking... you're absolutely right, Justice Stevens, and let me say one other thing. 
    The second point I wanted to make was that this statute, Ms. Sikes says it's easy to comply with. 
    I suggest to the court that the test that this Court has announced is not whether it's easy to comply with, but you have looked at what is required of other terms in the contract. 
    And looked at from that point of view, which is the point of view that the FAA requires, other terms in this particular contract don't have to be in underlined capital letters, it's only the arbitration clause that must be, and so the fact that we might be able to comply for this one clause doesn't satisfy the test. 
    The lens that this Court has to look through is the lens as to how other clauses are treated. 
    I would also say, incidentally, that the obstacles to complying with these State laws are great, and to follow up on Justice Ginsburg supposition, it's not a supposition. 
    Missouri requires the notice to be right above the signature. 
    Montana says it's on the first page. 
    Texas says it has to be initialed by a lawyer. 
    Iowa says it has to be signed by a party. 
    California says its 10-point type, and New York says its 12-point type. 
    It's impossible to comply with all those things, and the Nationwide uniformity that Congress sought to achieve with the Federal Arbitration Act is destroyed by allowing States to do this. 
    One final note is this. 
    This Court will read the Chor decision. 
    The Chor decision, one can read it from the front end to the back end, and the majority doesn't even mention the notice statute, so the supposition that my opponent supposes that this law, technical noncompliance doesn't make sense.
