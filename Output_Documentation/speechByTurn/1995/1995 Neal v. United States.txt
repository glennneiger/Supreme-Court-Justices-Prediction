    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    We'll hear argument next in Number 94-9088, Meirl Gilbert Neal v. The United States. 
    Mr. Bergerson, you may proceed.
speaker="donald_t_bergerson" startTime="22.235" stopTime="130.425">
    Mr. Donald T. Bergerson 
    Thank you. 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    In 1984, after 10 years of careful study, Congress responded to growing criticism of Federal criminal justice systems by creating the United States Sentencing Commission. 
    The task of the commission was to eliminate unpredictable, unequal, and unfair sentences which had marred Federal criminal law for decades. 
    To achieve this goal, the commission was vested with broad factfinding resources, staffed with jurists and leading experts in the sentencing field, and structured to interact symbiotically with the courts and other branches of Government so as to evolve predictable and proportionate sentencing practices throughout the Federal courts. 
    This case offers this Court an opportunity to define the role of the commission in such a way as to fulfill the express intentions of the Congress which created it. 
    Meirl Neal was convicted of trafficking in LSD in 1989. 
    Section 841(b) of title 21 requires a mandatory 10-year penalty for trafficking in 10 or more grams of a mixture of LSD. 
    At the time Mr. Neal was sentenced, neither the sentencing guideline nor the code contained a definition of the term, mixture. 
    In this case, and under the rule later announced by this Court in Chapman v. United States, the relevant mixture was held to consist of the blotter paper onto which the LSD was placed for purposes of sale and distribution. 
    Under this definition, Mr. Neal received a sentence of 16 years imprisonment. 
    Four years after Mr. Neal was sentenced, the Sentencing Commission conducted hearings on whether the sentencing practice used in his case could be reconciled with section 841. 
    The hearing was required under the commission's 1984 enabling legislation which chartered it and made numerous reference to its absolute and abiding duty to eliminate unwarranted sentencing disparities in Federal criminal cases. 
    Congress equipped the commission with numerous tools to achieve this result.

    Mr. Donald T. Bergerson 
    --This Court in Chapman held that in answer to the question of whether to include blotter paper in the weighing of LSD, in answer to the specific question, does mixture or substance refer to pure LSD, this Court held that one must include the blotter paper because Congress adopted a market-oriented approach for purposes of sentencing under 841. 
    The commission has, after thorough exploration, factfinding and hearings, reinterpreted the term mixture in light of the realities of the market.

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well, but can you answer yes or no? 
    You're describing the commission's interpretation of the term mixture, and I'm asking, is that contrary to the way this Court defined it in Chapman. 
    Now, certainly you can explain, but you can answer it yes or no.
speaker="donald_t_bergerson" startTime="301.948" stopTime="318.310">
    Mr. Donald T. Bergerson 
    --No. 
    It is an expansion. 
    This is a second generation case. 
    This Court in Chapman held that mixture or substance containing LSD requires that the paper be weighed in terms of sentencing, because the meaning of the statute was to punish drugs as they are sold in the market.

    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    What was the judgment that the Court... was it a judgment that the Court affirmed?

    Mr. Donald T. Bergerson 
    In both cases the Court affirmed the Seventh Circuit.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="327.885" stopTime="334.249">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Yes, and what was the judgment? 
    Was it set according to just some weight to the blotter paper, or full weight?
speaker="donald_t_bergerson" startTime="334.249" stopTime="342.964">
    Mr. Donald T. Bergerson 
    There was language in Chapman which was not necessary to the resolution or solution of the case which said that all the blotter paper should be weighed.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="342.964" stopTime="347.859">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Wasn't this a question of a conviction and a sentence that had been entered in Chapman?
speaker="donald_t_bergerson" startTime="347.859" stopTime="348.327">
    Mr. Donald T. Bergerson 
    Yes.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="348.327" stopTime="365.801">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    And if the position that you are now taking, that all the Court said was that you give some weight, not necessarily full weight, to the blotter paper, then wouldn't the judgment have to have been vacated so that it could be modified to reflect something less than full weight?
speaker="donald_t_bergerson" startTime="365.801" stopTime="393.397">
    Mr. Donald T. Bergerson 
    No. 
    In Chapman, the issue before the Court was whether the phrase, mixture or substance, referred to pure LSD. 
    The commission had not yet spoken to the issue, nor had any other agency, nor had Congress spoken, and the term had no fixed common law meaning. 
    Accordingly, the Court was obligated to use the plain meaning of the word. 
    What we are arguing in this case is that the plain meaning of the word has changed in light of the commission's thorough factual exploration into what that plain meaning--
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="393.397" stopTime="397.210">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    And the meaning couldn't be plain. 
    If the meaning was plain, it wouldn't have changed.
speaker="donald_t_bergerson" startTime="397.210" stopTime="404.534">
    Mr. Donald T. Bergerson 
    --Well, but the meaning can change in the context of the statute, because the statute refers to the drug market.

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well--
speaker="donald_t_bergerson" startTime="405.115" stopTime="407.626">
    Mr. Donald T. Bergerson 
    And that's what the commission studied, was the drug market.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="407.626" stopTime="433.545">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    --Well, what if in a totally different context this Court had said we take the plain meaning of the word employee, in a case that Justice Breyer wrote for the Court a few weeks ago, and then a great convention of lexicographers came along and said, well, we really want to get to the bottom of this thing, and we now think that employee means something different, could the next party come along and say, well, this case should be modified because you are wrong in deciding what employee meant?
speaker="donald_t_bergerson" startTime="433.545" stopTime="442.160">
    Mr. Donald T. Bergerson 
    No, because there is no congressionally delegated convention of lexicographers tasked with precisely the task that you've outlined in your hypothetical.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="442.160" stopTime="458.661">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    But Congress could do that. 
    That's the only thing lacking, really, right? 
    Congress can have this Court second-guessed all the time. 
    All it has to do is designate a particular convention of lexicographers, just as here it designated a certain aggregation of judges and scholars who could be commissioners.
speaker="donald_t_bergerson" startTime="458.661" stopTime="463.953">
    Mr. Donald T. Bergerson 
    If Congress designated a convention of lexicographers with the same thoroughness as it did--

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Right.
speaker="donald_t_bergerson" startTime="464.544" stopTime="466.495">
    Mr. Donald T. Bergerson 
    --the Sentencing Commission, then the answer would be yes.

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Gee, I feel a lot less important than I did before. 
    [Laughter] 
    Well, that's contrary to some of our decided cases, isn't it, that another body could in effect overrule our decisions? 
    In fact, it's contrary to that case back in 1790, the pension case.
speaker="donald_t_bergerson" startTime="484.988" stopTime="510.325">
    Mr. Donald T. Bergerson 
    Your Honor, this is not a case of stare decisis, and those cases all deal with stare decisis, and it's not a case of stare decisis for two reasons. 
    First, the language in Chapman which is problematic here, the language which talks about weighing all the blotter paper, was not necessary for the resolution of the Chapman case because the question presented in Chapman was simply answered by saying that the mixture includes blotter paper.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="510.325" stopTime="515.307">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    Did the length of the sentence in Chapman depend on the actual weight, including the weight of the blotter paper?

    Mr. Donald T. Bergerson 
    --Yes. 
    The answer is yes, Justice Souter. 
    The sentence did depend on the weight of the blotter paper entirely because no other alternative was presented. 
    Either one had to give Mr. Chapman a sentence--
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="545.839" stopTime="558.946">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    Well then, that was the holding of the case. 
    Whether another argument or another alternative might have been presented is beside the point. 
    That's what the case held. 
    The entire weight will be considered and the sentence will be set accordingly. 
    Right?

    Mr. Donald T. Bergerson 
    --Right at the time, but now the term, mixture or substance, has been revisited by the Sentencing Commission which was tasked with the task of--

    Mr. Donald T. Bergerson

    Justice David H. Souter 
    I'm not sure that it matters, but when we're talking about reality, is it correct to say, as I think the Government has pointed out, that the putative weight adopted by the commission is approximately 1/20th of the characteristic average weight?

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Mr. Bergerson, not only do I have some doubt whether we have to follow the Sentencing Commission, I have some doubt whether the Sentencing Commission doesn't have to follow us. 
    Is there any way in which the Government can challenge the Sentencing Commission guidelines as in effect creating a skewed system in which you get a 10-year minimum on the basis of our holding, and then everything from there is computed on a very different basis? 
    Apparently the commission thought that was okay, but it seems to me a crazy system. 
    Is there any way in which what the commission says is challengeable as not being in accordance with the statutory law?
speaker="donald_t_bergerson" startTime="686.710" stopTime="695.035">
    Mr. Donald T. Bergerson 
    Not under the delegation that's been given to the commission, Justice Scalia, to establish sentencing guidelines. 
    The Government concedes and we agree that it--

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    No matter how irrational those sentencing guidelines are? 
    That is, you have a 10-year minimum based on our holding, and then they use a totally different basis for deciding the increments of punishment above 10 years, which seems to me quite irrational.
speaker="donald_t_bergerson" startTime="709.074" stopTime="714.637">
    Mr. Donald T. Bergerson 
    --However, the totally different basis is entirely in keeping with the language of the statute because it punishes LSD in a--

    Theirs is and ours is, but you have the two of them working, and you say the commission's ought to prevail over ours. 
    If I think that ours ought to prevail over the commission's, I wonder... but you say there's no way to set the commission right. 
    Well, the Government can always go to Congress and ask that it not approve the Sentencing Commission's recommendations, can't it, the way it did with this crack cocaine thing?
speaker="donald_t_bergerson" startTime="735.871" stopTime="741.875">
    Mr. Donald T. Bergerson 
    --That's correct, Mr. Chief Justice, and the Government can go to Congress and ask Congress to change the Sentencing Reform Act for 1984.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="741.875" stopTime="747.779">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Congress doesn't change things just because they're illogical.

    [Laughter]
speaker="donald_t_bergerson" startTime="750.782" stopTime="758.357">
    Mr. Donald T. Bergerson 
    Congress has given to the Sentencing Commission the power to do what it did and reserve for itself the power to do what the Chief Justice is suggesting.
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="758.357" stopTime="808.009">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    Did it exercise that power, assuming it had it? 
    I mean, what's stopping me in this at the moment is it says, nonetheless this approach does not override the applicability of mixture or substance for the purpose of applying any mandatory minimum sentence, and then it cites Chapman, and then it cites 5G1.1(b), and in 5G1.1(b) it says, when a statutory minimum sentence is greater than the maximum guideline, apply the statutory minimum. 
    Now, I know you could find some ambiguity in that, but it's hard to find more than ambiguity, and what it sounds as if they're saying is, we're changing it for purposes of the guideline, but the mandatory minimum in the statute of course trumps the guideline, and there's nothing here that suggests we're changing that in any way. 
    That... I mean, that's what I'm concerned about from your point of view.
speaker="donald_t_bergerson" startTime="808.009" stopTime="836.337">
    Mr. Donald T. Bergerson 
    I would respectfully disagree with that interpretation. 
    Of course the statute trumps the guideline, and of course the commission is powerless to rewrite the statute. 
    However, what I read the commission as saying in that passage is two things. 
    First of all, it is proclaiming that the guideline is consistent with the statute. 
    It does not override the statute for purposes of setting a mandatory minimum. 
    Second, in light of the history, as I've outlined in my reply brief, of this amendment, the commission is simply proclaiming the process by which it reached its result.
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="836.337" stopTime="858.483">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    But if I were on the commission and were doing this thing, which is pretty radical, trying to change a case of the Supreme Court, interpreting a statute of Congress, which I can't remember an instance where the commission would try to do that, wouldn't the commission at least tell people what they were trying to do and explain it, rather than putting a sentence in the guideline that implies to an ordinary reading the contrary?
speaker="donald_t_bergerson" startTime="858.483" stopTime="884.068">
    Mr. Donald T. Bergerson 
    Well, the sentence is in the commentary to the guideline, and to the degree that it's inconsistent with the guideline it's not binding on this Court under this Court's Stinson decision, but my submission would be that the guideline is plain enough and the delegation to the commission to do what it did is plain enough that the commission need not have said anything, and simply proclaiming that it is trying to be consistent with section 841 and this Court's reasoning in Chapman is nothing more than the commission's own statement of its own limitations.

    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    There's another question that you may have. 
    I'm going to ask them the same question, but this is the great mystery here, which is a vacuum to me, and I'd like to try to find out about it. 
    I, of course, think that these things make more sense than people sometimes think-- 
    [Laughter] 
    --and one of the efforts here and in Congress is, they don't make these numbers up. 
    What they do is, they go to experts, particularly DEA, and they say to DEA, what should we do here to get our intent, so there was at some point some representation from DEA to Congress that would have told them how technically to write a statute that's going to achieve a particular objective. 
    But the particular objective was to put big guys and big deal gangs in jail for 5 years or 10 years, 5 years medium, and less than 5 years, itty-bitty, all right. 
    Now, what is the definition of this? 
    Did Congress have in mind that a fairly big-sized expert, or drug guy, or LSD guy was a person with 125 doses, or a person that was trying to sell 2,500? 
    Now, that's a huge difference, and somebody on the staff there would have found out from DEA and there would have been pamphlets, and there would have been writings about whether the dangerous people were 125-dose people, or 2,500-dose people. 
    So you've looked into this. 
    I haven't been able to find anything.

    Mr. Donald T. Bergerson 
    In the Chapman dissent there is a footnote, footnote 12, which indicates that if you strip away the paper, then the doses become equivalent for all the drugs listed in section 841(b). 
    That led the arguers in Chapman to believe that it was likely that Congress simply did not take into account the paper, but that issue has been decided. 
    What we're saying now is that the DEA had equal input into the commission's definition, and that the commission's definition was done with reference to all the provisions of the statute.

    Yes, but this is quite later. 
    At the time that this statute was passed, the DEA was going and telling the commission and Congress about the same thing as to how to write it, and so what I'm trying to figure out is, there must be a manual or something somewhere that refers us to whether it's 125 doses that looks... defines a fairly big guy, or 2,500 doses. 
    That's the key to this, and what is it?

    The DEA provided data to Congress on the precise weight of pure LSD. 
    However, if one looks at the statute and construes it as a whole in accordance with the jurisprudence of this Court, it is clear that Congress intended to punish these drugs in pari materia. 
    The relevant language of the statute is not simply mixture or substance, but all the other references, to 10 years, different doses, different quantities, absolute quantities of drugs that yield roughly equivalent doses, and one assumes that the commission was correct in interpreting the statute to mean that what Congress wanted was to go and have LSD punished at roughly the same level as the other drugs.

    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    In Chapman v. United States this Court held that the actual weight of the entire carrier medium must be used to determine whether the defendant is subject to the mandatory minimum sentencing statute for trafficking in LSD, and the question in this case is whether that rule was changed by the Sentencing Commission's new LSD guideline, which does not use the actual weight of the drug and the carrier, but instead uses a constructive weight for each dose of LSD and calibrates the defendant's sentence essentially to doses of LSD.

    It seems to me either the guidelines or our interpretation of Chapman denies... it puts somebody in a very weird position. 
    Somebody must have a claim here, and you're saying you can't challenge what the commission does.
speaker="paul_r_q_wolfson" startTime="1743.361" stopTime="1850.150">
    Mr. Paul R. Q. Wolfson 
    What the commission did within its own bounds, the guideline is certainly valid, and it has the effect of considerably lowering the sentences for LSD trafficking both below the 1-gram threshold and between... between the 1 and 10-gram threshold it brings most of them down to 5 years, and then above the 10-gram threshold it brings many sentences down. 
    Now, within the confines of its authority, we believe that the guideline is valid, but the commission does not have the authority to determine or to redetermine, because it would require a reexamination of this Court's decision in Chapman, when those statutes are triggered, and Congress did not delegate to the commission the authority to determine when the mandatory minimum sentencing statute applies. 
    And even if it were otherwise, the... our position is there's no way that you can... that the commission... the commission's new LSD guideline, the approach that it takes to sentences for trafficking in LSD is not consistent with the Court's definitive construction of the statute in Chapman. 
    In Chapman, the Court construed the terms that were in the statute, mixture or substance, and it used traditional tools of statutory interpretation to arrive at its construction. 
    It looked at the ordinary meaning of the words that were in the statute. 
    It invoked the canon of interpretation that every word in the statute has to be given effect wherever possible, and as a result it concluded that so long as it contains a detectable amount, the entire mixture or substance is to be weighed when determining whether a defendant is subject to those statutory penalties. 
    Now, the new guideline really is not consistent with that approach. 
    The two approaches are not the same at all, because the new guideline--

    The... I mean, you answer it as you wish. 
    I would have thought there are lots of statutes that govern the commission, and sometimes it's not possible to be literally consistent with the policy underlying each of them, but that's primarily a judgment for the commission, isn't it, and if it decided here that this was too tough, the mandatory minimum, because of policies involving in other statutes, maybe it has the statutory authority to do that, and then leave the statute in place, because, of course, it can't trump a statute. 
    I mean, if that's... what I'm sort of interested in here, though, is... look, does the commission have some authority to interpret a statute in the following sense. 
    You have a piece of blotter paper. 
    There isn't chemical binding between every molecule on the blotter paper. 
    Suppose they throw LSD into the Atlantic Ocean. 
    You don't weigh the entire Atlantic Ocean, so there must be some... some technical matter where the commission might, because of its knowledge, let us know how much of the binding that takes place in a matter of degree is that portion of the paper that should count, because they would go talk to the technical experts on that. 
    Now, I guess in that sense the commission, while it couldn't legally bind the courts, could tell the courts some information that might be relevant to them in deciding how much to weigh, how much of this piece of blotter paper is actually part of the mixture or substance connected with the LSD. 
    It could do that, couldn't it?

    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    It's not so unusual. 
    I take it that the molecules of the LSD thrown into the Atlantic Ocean might be dispersed among yards and yards or miles and miles of water, and so there will have to be a point where people will talk about the concentration of the LSD interspersed with the other molecules that bring it within the range, mixture or substance, and when it makes that kind of a decision, shouldn't the courts and the commission also take into account the policy that underlies this statute, namely, how big a guy Congress wants to put in jail for 5 years.

    It can help the court understand whether it is reasonable to conclude that something was or was not an intent that Congress intended, but it is not deference in the sense that this Court conventionally uses that term as a presumptively binding interpretation of a statute in the absence of a showing that it is unreasonable.

    So I agree with that, but then that... this is my... what I'm trying to lead up to basically is the Government must have in its file somewhere the information that Congress had in its mind, whether staff or Congressmen, at the time this statute was passed, and did Congress believe that they were putting in prison for 5 years people who distributed 125 doses of LSD, or did they think they were putting in prison for 5 years people who distributed 2,500 doses of LSD? 
    They could have read it in pamphlets, they could have talked to LSD people, maybe it's in hearings, maybe it was in memos, what's the answer to that question?

    Mr. Paul R. Q. Wolfson 
    Justice Breyer, I have to say I do not know of the pamphlet that you are looking for. 
    I will say that in the legislative history to the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986, there is a comment that the 5-year penalty is intended for the people who keep the street market going. 
    The 10-year is intended for the people higher up the chain, the 5-year in general is for the people who keep the street market going, the people who fill the vials, who pass out the baggies, that sort of thing. 
    I do not think that it is implausible that 120, even 125 doses of LSD could answer to that description. 
    That's a... that is certainly somebody who is keeping the street market going, and that is... Congress could definitely conclude that that was somebody who would warrant 5 years.

    Mr. Paul R. Q. Wolfson 
    Justice Stevens, I have to acknowledge that the doses for LSD that bring into play the 5 and 10-year penalties are less than... are lesser, fewer, rather, than they are for other drugs, but of course, that was before the Court in Chapman--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="2171.479" stopTime="2173.340">

    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    In the light... in that light of reconsideration, would the 4....4 solution that the commission has come to, would that have been a permissible interpretation of the statute for the Court? 
    Let's assume that the guideline interpretation came first. 
    The Seventh Circuit had dealt with the Chapman issue, but this Court had not. 
    Enlightened by the guideline, would it have been impermissible interpretation of the mixture or substance statute?

    Mr. Paul R. Q. Wolfson 
    No. 
    Justice Ginsburg, I do not think that it is... even if the question were still open in Chapman, or if the Court were reconsidering the matter, this is not a permissible interpretation of the statute because the only reasonable reading of the statute I think is an actual... the actual weight of an actual mixture or substance. 
    The statute says 1 gram or more of a mixture or substance. 
    It does not refer to hypothetical abstract or constructive weight, constructive--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="2245.301" stopTime="2274.159">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    May I give you... I hope it's not too hypothetical. 
    Supposing that you have a blotter on which you normally drop a spot of ink, and you can have a blotter that's about 4 inches long, and you see the spot of ink on it. 
    A lot of the blotter is white, and then there's a dark blue... you can also have a blotter such as we have here, about 3 feet by 5 feet, same drop of ink on it. 
    Would it be permissible to say that the mixture or substance merely includes the discolored portion of the blotter, because the rest of it isn't mixed with the ink at all?

    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    No, it's a clearly detectable amount in order to qualify, and you can see... with an ink blotter, it's easy. 
    You can see how far it is. 
    But supposing it's LSD, and you'd have a huge blotter on the one hand and a tiny blotter on the other. 
    Do you think it's irrational to treat them the same, even though the amount of the mixture, the geographical scope of the mixture is precisely the same?

    Mr. Paul R. Q. Wolfson 
    --I think there are situations where you could exclude the 99 percent of unmixed blotter paper, but that is not, I must emphasize, what the commission was doing, and I have to say I think it is... I do not think it is correct to say that the commission was really defining or considering what is a mixture, or what is a mixture or substance. 
    I don't think that is really what the commission was doing. 
    It's true that they used the... they kept in place the drug quantity table for purposes of convenience, and they used language referring to mixture or substance except as otherwise provided, but really what they were doing was putting... setting aside, departing from a system of sentencing based on the weight of the substance and relying, and adopting a scheme based on sentencing calibrated to the number of doses distributed. 
    Now, it's true that for purposes of convenience they assigned to each dose a particular weight, and that I think was just so they wouldn't have to write a new drug quantity table solely for LSD, because they had in place this useful system. 
    But I think it's wrong even to say that the Sentencing Commission was reconsidering what is a mixture, they really were just adopting a new--

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Well, any mixture, and that's how we interpreted subsection 5 here, and I don't know where the commission gets off interpreting it differently for purposes of deciding what the incremental penalties are. 
    Our holding clearly is that section 5, as it says, applies to mixture or substance, and then the commission comes in with a sentencing scheme that uses a totally different criteria quite inconsistent with our holding in Chapman.
speaker="paul_r_q_wolfson" startTime="2500.928" stopTime="2572.792">
    Mr. Paul R. Q. Wolfson 
    --Justice Scalia, I don't think that the commission was purporting to say when did the statute apply. 
    They were drawing up their own system, but they... I do not think... there's been a lot of discussion about what does the background commentary mean, where it says this approach does not override the applicability of mixture or substance, see Chapman and 5G1.1(b). 
    I think what that indicates is the commission recognized that Chapman and the binding force of section 841 were controlling. 
    It could not overturn that, and 5G1.1(b) clearly indicates that where there is a conflict between the statute and the guideline sentencing range, the statute controls in every case. 
    However, when you read what the commission did, they were not deciding when did the 5-year and when did the 10-year mandatory minimum sentence come into play. 
    They were setting... and so I don't think you even get past the threshold, which is, they were not purporting to overrule Chapman or decide when the statute applies. 
    They were setting up their own--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="2572.792" stopTime="2593.424">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    That may well be, Mr. Wolfson, but I have the distinct impression that if any other agency that I know of interpreted a statute this way, that the minimum applies to the mixture or substance, but the incremental penalty does not apply to the mixture or substance but to the number of grams in the mixture or substance, we would say, you can't have it both ways.

    --Well, of course, had there been no Sentencing Commission at all, had this just been left to the discretion of the district judges, as it was before... of course, there wasn't any mandatory minimum sentence, but had there just been mandatory minimum statutes and pure discretion of the district judges, the district judges could have sentenced all offenders who came within the reach of the statute at the low end--

    It was I think almost 5 years, 5 or 6 years difference in his sentence, and we agreed to that extent, that he was entitled to a reduction in his sentence down to 120 months.

    Mr. Paul R. Q. Wolfson 
    Well, of course, Congress could have adopted a determinate sentence approach as well. 
    This again was before the Court in Chapman, and had Congress said, if you sell 10 grams or more of a mixture or substance for LSD, you get 10 years, no... you know, no... nothing higher, nothing lower. 
    That's a... it's a completely determinate sentence. 
    That would be rational, and that was a system in sentencing that was common in this country until a generation or so ago.

    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Mr. Wolfson, if the Government did think that what the guidelines... what the Sentencing Commission did in adopting a particular guideline was irrational in light of the statutory language and the scheme that's in place, exactly what is it that the Government can do to challenge it? 
    You can tell Congress when they're looking at the guidelines that you don't think it should be allowed to go into effect?

    Mr. Paul R. Q. Wolfson 
    Two things. 
    Certainly during the 180-day period we could go to Congress and ask Congress--

    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    And failing that, if that is not done, you just were asleep at the switch over there in looking at it, what later could you do?

    Mr. Paul R. Q. Wolfson 
    --In another... in a case involving a different issue, we... the Attorney General has instructed the U.S. attorneys to oppose application of a guideline in particular cases and to appeal sentences if they're based on the guidelines, because in that case we believe they're inconsistent with the Sentencing Reform Act.

    Mr. Paul R. Q. Wolfson 
    --Right. 
    In another case we... it's our position that there's a statute that requires... it requires the Sentencing Commission to base guidelines on a... the highest available sentence under a statute, and the question is whether that... if I have it correctly, whether that involves... the calculation has to be made with--

    In sum, as earlier, we argued that the Chapman rule remains the controlling interpretation of section 841, and we would request the judgment of the court of appeals be affirmed.

   Rebuttal of Donald T. Bergerson
speaker="donald_t_bergerson" startTime="3137.318" stopTime="3217.607">
    Mr. Donald T. Bergerson 
    Thank you. 
    Congress created the Sentencing Commission with the idea of reconciling and eliminating precisely the irrationalities we have now been talking about for an hour, and which we've been talking about since the Chapman case. 
    The place is to inform the courts of the realities of criminal sentencing, and that's why this case is before this Court now. 
    The commission recognized in this case by a factual finding of great quality and depth that the sentencing in LSD cases was irrational and not consistent with the statute as it interpreted as a whole, but more than that, it defined the reality of what mixture or substance containing LSD means in accordance with the market realities of 841. 
    It didn't purport to overrule this Court, and it said it wasn't doing so, but it did give a new plain meaning to the word. 
    This Court recognized that the commission had precisely this place in the scheme of things. 
    What we're asking the Court to do is to allow the commission to do here what the commission does all the time, which is to establish binding guidelines for sentencing in criminal cases. 
    Our position is that.4 milligrams of LSD is a mixture or substance containing LSD within the meaning of section 841(b) in light of the realities, and that under this Court's jurisprudence, deference should be paid to what the commission has done. 
    If there are no further questions, we would submit.
