    Mr. Javier Aguilar 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court-- 
    At issue in this direct appeal is the constitutionality of three congressional districts that the court below erroneously ruled were racially gerrymandered. 
    These districts are localized in two metropolitan areas of the State of Texas, two counties, Harris County and Dallas County. 
    The districts involved are Congressional Districts 18, which is a black opportunity district that was created originally in the 1970's in Harris County, Congressional District 29, which is a brand new congressional district, which is now a Hispanic opportunity district in Harris County, and Congressional District 30, which is a black opportunity district in Dallas County, a brand new black opportunity district.

    This is new terminology.

    Mr. Javier Aguilar 
    Well, it's a majority minority district that was created under--

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Why don't we just call them majority minority districts? 
    I mean, you're entitled to use whatever terminology... you can call them, you know, motherhood apple pie districts if you like, but you will be insulting my intelligence every time you say it. 
    Can't we give it some, you know, unemotive terminology that we can use in the argument?

    Mr. Javier Aguilar 
    I'll refer to them as majority minority districts. 
    The district court we believe legally erred in its finding below that the three districts were racially gerrymandered for two reasons. 
    First, it held that race predominated in the drawing of the districts, but it did so because it refused to recognize the State's customary and traditional redistricting principle of incumbency protection, as well as other principles that it utilized, including the equal population rule that it always follows and it must follow--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="109.652" stopTime="120.661">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    That's pretty much a question of fact, isn't it, Mr. Aguilar, whether it was basically a desire to preserve incumbency or whether it was the desire to create majority minority districts?
speaker="javier_aguilar" startTime="120.661" stopTime="197.040">
    Mr. Javier Aguilar 
    --Well, yes, sir, it is a question of fact, Your Honor, but in this case... they decided this case before Miller v. Johnson, and I think their opinion is clear that they did not believe that incumbency protection should be considered a traditional districting principle because it was not among those listed in the Shaw v. Reno case to begin with. 
    It is our contention that the determination of what is a customary and traditional districting principle is something that is determined by the State and its practices, its historical practices, and there was no doubt that in this case there's plenty of evidence to show that Texas has followed the traditional practice of incumbency protection to decide where it's going to draw its districts, and incumbency protection as applied by the Texas legislature, certainly in the 1990's, really has four aspects, Mr. Chief Justice. 
    First, it is not pairing incumbents. 
    It will not vote for a plan that does not pair incumbents, simply because they want to preserve the State's congressional seniority. 
    Second, it means that if you're going to have to redraw districts, which they had to because of the fact that the population had increased so greatly in Texas that we had been reapportioned three different districts, that you try to maintain the constituency of each of the Congresspeople.

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Okay, but Mr. Aguilar, you made this argument, I take it, to the district court, and you can see it's a question of fact as to what the motivation for drawing... and the district court rejected those findings. 
    Are you contending here that they're clearly erroneous?
speaker="javier_aguilar" startTime="210.071" stopTime="225.201">
    Mr. Javier Aguilar 
    No, Your Honor. 
    We're saying that their decision is legally wrong because it did not properly apply the rule of Miller v. Johnson. 
    Now, in fact, quite frankly they didn't have it to apply because it wasn't decided until sometime after the opinion. 
    What we're saying is, they recognized--

    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Well, but Mr. Aguilar, the district court did make findings that the districts were formed in utter disregard for traditional redistricting criteria, and were unexplainable on other than racial grounds.

speaker="javier_aguilar" startTime="247.855" stopTime="259.903">
    Mr. Javier Aguilar

    Mr. Javier Aguilar 
    --That is correct, Justice O'Connor.

    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    --all right, but you did present evidence to the district court of protection of incumbency. 
    I mean, that evidence was apparently before the district court, and it nevertheless found that that may well be so, but it was overshadowed here by the decision in drawing the district boundaries to totally draw them along racial lines.
speaker="javier_aguilar" startTime="309.645" stopTime="320.311">
    Mr. Javier Aguilar 
    Yes, Your Honor, and if I may, they certainly considered that, and they even acknowledged in their opinion that incumbency protection was a major objective in the State, all over the State.

    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Right.

    Mr. Javier Aguilar 
    And they didn't particularly like it, and they said as much, but despite the fact that 24 out of the 30 districts, Justice O'Connor, were challenged on these grounds, only these three districts were found to be racially gerrymandered, and I'd like to point to the Court... refer to the Court to Joint Appendix at page 192. 
    I'd like to use that as an example, trying to flesh out what I'm trying to say.

    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Mr. Aguilar, before you do that, remind me... I think you mentioned it just a moment ago. 
    Didn't this Court not credit incumbency on the same line as the traditional factors that were mentioned in the Shaw opinion? 
    As you pointed out, Miller had not yet been decided, and I... can you be precise about how this Court treated incumbency? 
    Did it consider it a traditional districting factor?
speaker="javier_aguilar" startTime="380.571" stopTime="382.792">
    Mr. Javier Aguilar 
    Are you asking in the Shaw opinion, Your Honor?

    No, in this opinion.
speaker="javier_aguilar" startTime="384.374" stopTime="397.321">
    Mr. Javier Aguilar 
    I think it recognized that it was a motivation of the legislature all over the State. 
    I think it certainly recognized and accepted that. 
    I think that in the process of accepting that--
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="397.321" stopTime="409.900">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Did it treat it as something that could dominate? 
    My question is, did the Court recognize that incumbency should be treated as a legitimate factor?
speaker="javier_aguilar" startTime="409.900" stopTime="426.193">
    Mr. Javier Aguilar 
    --No, Your Honor. 
    They believed that incumbency protection was not something that this Court referred to in the Shaw decision and, consequently, since it didn't fall within the... those factors that this Court referenced in Shaw, therefore it wasn't something that they could pay attention to, and I think--
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="426.193" stopTime="482.647">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    Let me... may I ask you to go one step further? 
    I take it, of course, because they were deciding before Miller came down, I take it that what the court was doing was saying that predominant racial motive is an alternative to incumbency protection as a factor, whereas your argument is after... I think, after Miller, we judge what is a predominant racial motive by asking, among other things, whether it was done in disregard of traditional districting practices, and your final step is, incumbency protection is one of the objects of traditional districting practices. 
    So that I think what you're saying is the court made an either or choice when there wasn't an either or choice. 
    The two alternatives that it was opposing to each other are not really opposing alternatives. 
    It should have considered incumbency protection in deciding whether the motive was predominantly racial.
speaker="javier_aguilar" startTime="482.647" stopTime="483.217">

    --That is--

    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    Counsel, I want you to get to section... to page 192, but let me ask you one question before you do that. 
    If incumbency protection is the motive, but the means used to effect it is racial gerrymandering, is that constitutional? 
    Does that comply with Miller?
speaker="javier_aguilar" startTime="506.563" stopTime="527.216">
    Mr. Javier Aguilar 
    Well, no, Your Honor. 
    We are saying that you can... the legislature can apply its traditional motivation of incumbency protection, and just because it's applying it in an area where there are blacks or Hispanics living, that doesn't necessarily mean that the end result is a racial gerrymander.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="527.216" stopTime="557.587">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    Well, suppose I say I want to protect incumbents and, incidentally, I take it this means any incumbent who is an officeholder can protect his or her interests by running for some other office. 
    A State Senator can be a Congressman, and that's incumbency protection in Texas. 
    Let's assume that that is the goal, and we say, in order to do this we're going to have racial gerrymanders. 
    Does this... is this consistent with the Court's holding in Miller?
speaker="javier_aguilar" startTime="557.587" stopTime="568.372">
    Mr. Javier Aguilar 
    Well, if the predominant motivation is just collecting as many minorities that you can within one district, and you don't care whether it protects your incumbents, you don't care about--

    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    No, no, that's not my hypothetical. 
    My hypothetical is, we want to protect incumbents, and the way we're going to do this, the principal way, the principal mechanism we're going to use is assigning voters to districts on account... by race. 
    Does that comport with the command of Miller?
speaker="javier_aguilar" startTime="586.976" stopTime="594.112">
    Mr. Javier Aguilar 
    --I think it would, Your Honor. 
    You have to find out why race is considered.

    Mr. Javier Aguilar

    Mr. Javier Aguilar 
    Well, I think that... I guess the best example would be in the Miller case. 
    The boundaries there were much... we're talking about a totally different district that spanned some 200, 250 miles, that linked together different cities, different disparate black populations that had very little in common with them, where the district boundaries themselves, the black population was located in the outer ridges of the district.

    We believe narrow--

    Mr. Javier Aguilar 
    --It's narrowly tailored because we first of all realized that there was a sufficiently large minority population in a geographically compact area, and there was racially polarized voting.

    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court-- 
    Even if strict scrutiny is applicable to the districts in this case, the district court decision invalidating those districts was legally incorrect and it must be reversed. 
    The district court held that although Texas might have a compelling interest in creating majority minority, or minority opportunity districts in Dallas and Houston in order to protect the rights of minorities in those communities, who are the victims of polarized voting, to protect their right to participate in the process in a fair way, that even if Texas had those compelling interests, the districts that Texas actually created were not narrowly tailored. 
    The court held that because it found that Texas could have created three districts that were more compact than the ones that it actually created, and that in departing from compactness, the court flunked the narrow tailoring test.

    Do you agree with Mr. Aguilar that that is basically a confusion of categories, that narrow tailoring goes basically to number of districts, and the niceness of the lines with which they are drawn is essentially the question, or is essentially an issue that you look at when you're deciding whether, in fact, the motive was predominantly racial as distinct from a motive consistent with customary districting practices?

    Mr. Paul Bender 
    I think the niceness of the lines is relevant probably to both aspects of it.

    --Let me just follow up on one of Justice Scalia's questions. 
    But if you cannot draw a majority minority district without jettisoning your traditional districting principles, you don't have to do it. 
    In other words, section 2 does not require you to throw out the tradition of districting in order to create a majority minority district, and if that were the case, then you wouldn't have the compelling interest of complying with section 2.
speaker="paul_bender" startTime="1313.554" stopTime="1352.830">
    Mr. Paul Bender 
    Right, and so here, the fact that the State could have drawn three compact districts, two in Houston and one in Dallas... it could have drawn a compact district in Dallas to provide black minorities there with an opportunity to participate fairly in the process. 
    It didn't do that, and the record is absolutely clear on this. 
    The district court was absolutely clear on it. 
    It didn't do that because of the interests of the incumbents who were surrounding that district. 
    They did not want that compact district because it took too many Democratic voters away from them, and so they pulled Democratic voters out of that compact district, which required the minority district to get voters from some place else in order to both satisfy the one person one vote requirement and remain a majority minority district.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="1352.830" stopTime="1385.192">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Mr. Bender, is your answer the same... well, let me ask this first. 
    The appellees' brief cites a law review article in the Michigan Law Review which rates districts in the country for irregularity, and according to that law review article, districts 18 and 29 are tied for first with one other district in the country, as the district with the least regular borders in the country. 
    Is that accurate or not?
speaker="paul_bender" startTime="1385.192" stopTime="1389.104">
    Mr. Paul Bender 
    I wouldn't say that they were necessarily tied for first, but they are certainly--

    Mr. Paul Bender 
    --among the most irregular districts in the country, yes. 
    I think everybody concedes that. 
    In Dallas, that irregularity occurred, I think nobody doubts this, because of the interest in protecting incumbents, and Texas' amazingly strong interest in protecting incumbents. 
    That is a very strong interest that Texas traditionally has had and continues to have in districting. 
    They used--

    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Well, it's no different than in any other State, is it? 
    I used to serve in a State legislature, and I can well remember scrambling around to protect incumbents.

speaker="paul_bender" startTime="1424.077" stopTime="1426.939">
    Mr. Paul Bender

    Is that your position?
speaker="paul_bender" startTime="1438.186" stopTime="1457.960">
    Mr. Paul Bender 
    No, it doesn't override the need. 
    The question is, if a State could draw a compact minority district and it has a compelling interest in doing that to satisfy the Voting Rights Act and perhaps even the Constitution, and it also has a very strong interest in protecting incumbents, does the State have to choose between those two interests and jettison one in order to do the other?
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="1457.960" stopTime="1467.435">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Or does the State have to follow the constitutional requirement not to draw lines on primarily a racial basis?
speaker="paul_bender" startTime="1467.435" stopTime="1508.411">
    Mr. Paul Bender 
    That's not a constitutional requirement, Justice O'Connor. 
    I think you said in Shaw and Reno in writing for the Court, and Justice Kennedy repeated for the Court in Miller and Johnson, that that's not an absolute prohibition. 
    It's just something that requires strict scrutiny, and that strict scrutiny is satisfied if there's a compelling interest. 
    Here, the district court did not deny that there was a compelling interest, but said, you've got to choose between your compelling interest in Dallas in having a majority district and protecting incumbents. 
    And in Houston the situation was a little more complicated. 
    There was incumbent protection interest there, but there was also the fact that the State had a compelling interest in creating a Hispanic majority district in Houston, which could have been compact, and in creating a black majority, or in keeping a black majority district in Houston.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="1508.411" stopTime="1534.971">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Well, and there are also degrees of incumbent interest. 
    Some incumbent officeholder might say, I want a certain type of voter in my district. 
    It wouldn't double up officeholders, but nonetheless I want you to draw this along racial lines because I think I can pick up voters that are going to go to the polls more often than would be the case if it were compact.
speaker="paul_bender" startTime="1534.971" stopTime="1550.649">
    Mr. Paul Bender 
    That would require strict scrutiny. 
    In this case I think the evidence shows that the incumbents did not say, give us black voters just because they're black voters. 
    They were looking for Democratic voters to keep their incumbency safe, and in looking for Democratic voters there is a large correlation in that part of Dallas.

    Ms. Penda D. Hair 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court-- 
    I think I'll just pick up with the last point, which is whether race was being used as a surrogate, and let me use the Dallas area as an example. 
    Representative Frost and Bryant, Congresspeople Frost and Bryant were the two white Democrats that bordered on the new opportunity district that was being squeezed in between them in Dallas County. 
    They took about 483,000 people out of Dallas County and of those 53... roughly 53,000 were African American. 
    Those two Democrats were looking for Democratic voters of any race, and they were looking for voters that they had previously represented. 
    The district court erred because the district court said that... and it's a legal error. 
    The district court said that protection of incumbents is the equivalent of a racial factor, so all of the district court's findings of fact that race predominated in the construction of these districts is tainted by the legal error that protecting incumbents constituted a part of the racial gerrymander.

    I think that was his question, and I'd like to get your response to that. 
    The position is, you got this strange shape because in satisfying the incumbents' desire to protect their turf, you used race.
speaker="penda_d_hair" startTime="1806.717" stopTime="1885.479">
    Ms. Penda D. Hair 
    Your Honor, I would say that race was used to decide whether a majority minority district can be created, and again I'll use Dallas as the example. 
    In Dallas what you see is, you see the compact part of the minority opportunity district, District 30, is South Dallas. 
    It's a neighborhood with a community of interest that is 69 percent African American. 
    It shows up nice and almost oval on the district map. 
    The arms of that district that go to the north are majority white, and what happened is that when Congressmen Frost and Bryant came into Dallas County and peeled off, as I said, almost half a million white voters, the district had to go north to pick up population. 
    In going north, race was one of the factors that was considered, but it certainly was not the only factor. 
    The irregular arm to the west goes out to Grand Prairie and picks up white voters. 
    Congressman... Senator, then Senator Johnson was eager to represent those white voters in Grand Prairie because they had been in her Senate district. 
    That was not on the basis of race. 
    Another arm to the left goes out and picks up the airport, and the main northern arm goes up through the center of Dallas County, picks up about 20 percent African American voters and 80 percent non African American voters.

    It could have been recognized, as Justice O'Connor points out, in a nice compact district that would have been similar to the districts that this Court upheld summarily in the California case, DeWitt. 
    Instead, what happened is that that minority community of interest, like all other communities of interest across the State, saw its district become irregular not because of race... there was a nice district there that would have satisfied the Voting Rights Act... but because of protection of incumbents.

    I think, Your Honor, that would not be constitutional, and that would be race as predominant, but that's not what happened here. 
    These are integrated districts that were drawn with bare populations sufficient to satisfy the Voting Rights Act, and then for other reasons they became noncompact.

    I find the court saying, we conclude that the policy of incumbent protection to the extent it motivated the legislature--

    Right.

    Ms. Penda D. Hair 
    --to the extent it motivated the legislature was not a countervailing force against racial gerrymandering.

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Right. 
    I take that to mean that the court says you can't... you can protect incumbents, but not by using race as the basis.
speaker="penda_d_hair" startTime="2186.638" stopTime="2205.862">
    Ms. Penda D. Hair 
    And our position is that the court was legally in error when it said that the fact that Congressmen Frost and Bryant came in and took a huge amount of population, that that was part of a racial gerrymander. 
    That was solely to get Democratic voters that they had previously represented and black voters, just like a bunch of white voters, got caught up in there.

    Mr. Daniel E. Troy 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court-- 
    With regard to the point that was just being made, at page 19 of our brief we cite to what the district court says. 
    What the district court found exactly was that Texas, quote, repeatedly segregated African American, Hispanic, and Anglo populations by race 1) to further the prospects of incumbent officeholders... I'm adding the one... or 2) to create majority minority congressional districts. 
    These districts were conceived for the purpose of providing safe seats in Congress for two African American representatives and Hispanic representatives. 
    Your Honors, the indirect and direct evidence overwhelmingly supports the district court's finding that race was the predominant factor in the drawing of these bizarre, single race majority districts.
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="2314.993" stopTime="2341.010">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    Why did anyone care from a racial point of view, the interest being to elect a minority Congressman or woman? 
    That can be achieved with a compact district, so why, from that point of view, would anyone care whether the district is noncompact? 
    What human motive could there be for these irregular shapes other than incumbency protection?
speaker="daniel_e_troy" startTime="2341.010" stopTime="2360.932">
    Mr. Daniel E. Troy 
    Your Honor, what the district court found was that they pursued a maximization policy basically constructing these majority minority single... actually single race majority districts essentially for their own sake, and then race was used as a tool for partisan advantage. 
    That--

    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    Sorry, I don't understand. 
    I'm just trying to get clear on a person who is interested in having a black Congressman or a black Congresswoman would be interested, I assume, many, in having a majority minority district which could be achieved with a compact district.

    --in seeing that it's an odd shape? 
    In other words, what would the reasoning be? 
    I can understand why you might want an odd shape for the purpose of incumbency protection, but I don't understand what the reasoning would be to want an odd shape for racial reasons.

    Mr. Daniel E. Troy 
    --First of all, in Harris County what they did was, they were separating the races, Hispanics and blacks, because the communities were demanding their own districts for their own sake. 
    But with respect to Dallas County what the record shows, Your Honor, is that the architect of the district, Eddie Bernice Johnson, went... tried to create a performing single race majority black district, and the reason why... one of the main reasons why it was not compact, in fact the court found the predominant reason why it was not compact was she testified in the Terrazas v. Slagle litigation that she shed black voters in the South Dallas area, and she testified because they tend to be more transient, they tend to not turn out as well, and so then, in order to preserve the single raceness of the district she went north into Colin County, west into Tarrant County, hither and yon in order to gather as many blacks as possible in order to preserve that as a single race majority district. 
    That was the overall goal.
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="2461.148" stopTime="2487.845">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    In your view, if it were proved... I'm not saying this is this case, but if it were proved beyond any doubt that the only reason that the districts were not compact in shape was to protect incumbents, and that that had nothing to do with race, under those circumstances would these... would such districts be constitutional, even under Miller?

    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Mr. Troy, can we go back to, then, stage 1. 
    We have a very compact district. 
    It has no arms or elbows, but it was created to be a minority... a majority minority district. 
    Race was the consideration, but it's got wonderfully compact bounds, but race was why that district was created.

    Mr. Daniel E. Troy 
    --I think, Your Honor, that that is, in essence, a hypothetical that would not really arise in part because by definition, if you're taking into account compactness, contiguity, traditional political subdivisions, you are... race is not the predominant motivation. 
    It may be an important motivation, but it is one of a number of motivations.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="2539.450" stopTime="2545.324">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    Why isn't it the predominant motivation? 
    The motivation is to create a majority minority district. 
    That means race.
speaker="daniel_e_troy" startTime="2545.324" stopTime="2561.773">
    Mr. Daniel E. Troy 
    If you're creating a compact majority minority district, then you are necessarily taking into account other factors, i.e., compactness, contiguity, traditional subdivisions, and the fact that you've got a naturally occurring community of people.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="2561.773" stopTime="2581.126">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    So what you're saying is, it's okay to do it for racial purposes, and I... and you and I are both assuming that the racial purpose is justified by the Voting Rights Act, I take it, or at least by the... by correcting the Fourteenth Amendment violation. 
    It's okay to do that if you do it consistently with normal districting practices.
speaker="daniel_e_troy" startTime="2581.126" stopTime="2590.732">
    Mr. Daniel E. Troy 
    I would say that it is... it is permissible to take race into account in districting so long as it is not the predominant factor. 
    That is what Miller says.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="2590.732" stopTime="2618.882">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    But what... aren't you assuming that what determines whether it's the predominant factor or not, what determines whether that factor is treated as predominant for purposes of Miller and Shaw, is a function of whether it is created consistently with districting practices as traditionally understood, and if the answer is yes, then it's not predominant, race is not predominant for Miller purposes. 
    If the answer is no, it is. 
    I understood that to be the thrust of your answer.
speaker="daniel_e_troy" startTime="2618.882" stopTime="2632.202">
    Mr. Daniel E. Troy 
    I think if you create it consistent with... with, again, looking for naturally occurring communities, so it is clear that what you're not trying to do is achieve a certain racial goal, and that's not your primary... that's not your predominant--

    Of course it is. 
    Just in saying, we are going to create three minority majority districts, race is what we are after. 
    We want three racially determined districts. 
    We are willing to give up the incumbency and everything else. 
    We're willing to subordinate everything to race, and we will have a nice compact district. 
    Race is so important that we'll subordinate everything to it, and it will look just fine. 
    That's okay under your analysis.

    Mr. Daniel E. Troy

    Let's assume that the political correlation... let's assume that the political data in the computer about prior voting patterns is going to be a basis for drawing funny lines, for making these adjustments, and the purpose is incumbency protection. 
    Assume, secondly, that you've got two essentially adjoining Democratic districts. 
    No matter how you draw the lines, 1 and 2 are both going to be Democratic districts, and they've got a choice between drawing the lines in such a way that puts a lot of blacks in a white district and a lot of whites in a black district. 
    And somebody says, traditionally, if we were worried about the feelings between the French and the Irish, we draw the line in such a way so that the... most of the French could be in a predominantly French ward, and most of the Irish could be in a predominantly Irish ward. 
    Now we've got a situation in which instead of French and Irish it's black and Hispanic, black and white. 
    Can they do the same thing for the blacks who want to be in a black district that they could do for the Irish in the old days who wanted to be in an Irish district?

    In mine, I'm talking about making the Irish or the Poles or the Jews or the Wasps or what not happy to be together. 
    In his, the sole motivation is incumbency protection.

    It is suspect to use race as a tool or religion as a tool to tell who is of one party affiliation or another because race is immutable and politics are not, and the use of race is so dangerous that this Court has said that it should not be used unless there is a compelling governmental interest and it is being used in a narrowly tailored way.

    If race were used alone and nothing else, that would have been all right. 
    If the districts had been created so that they would be majority minority districts, and then the white incumbents were not part of the picture, so we had a district determined solely by race and not by incumbency, and not by anything else, that would be all right. 
    But once you intrude something that's nonrace, then it's unconstitutional. 
    That's the part that I don't understand, the logic of that, but you conceded, because that was the first step in the argument, that if... that the State has a goal, wants three majority minority districts, a racial goal, that's okay.

    They went in with the assumption that so long as they maximized they would be okay with the Department of Justice, and therefore they could do anything else they want, use race as a tool for purposes of incumbency protection, and that they did not have to narrowly tailor these districts to make them comport to requirements of section 2, if, indeed, section 2 is implicated. 
    But section 2 only requires geographically compact districts. 
    These are not geographically compact districts.

    You can give me the answer to both.

    But it turns upon, Your Honor, how you interpret the Voting Rights Act, and we think that certainly if the State sought to comply with their interpretation, or with the Department of Justice's maximization policy, then it would never be... it could not be a compelling governmental interest, so it depends upon how you interpret the Voting Rights Act.

    Justice David H. Souter 
    All right, may I go back to the Miller definition. 
    I understood you to say a moment ago that if the motive was simply to create a majority minority district, and we didn't know anything more than that, that that would, in fact, be unconstitutional. 
    Now let me add something to what we know. 
    Let us assume that in creating that majority minority district, number 1, the motive was to comply with the Voting Rights Act, and number 2, that in fact the district shape that came out of that process was a shape which was consistent with the shape that traditionally gets arrived at in districts when traditional districting practices are followed, as, for example, in Justice Stevens' case, it is a compact district.

    If that is... if those three facts are what we know, is it fair to say under the Miller definition of what is a subordination of districting to race, that we would not have an apparent case of subordinated districting to race? 
    That would be okay under the Miller definition, and it would not trigger strict scrutiny. 
    Is that correct?

    Then the question--
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="3956.769" stopTime="3986.666">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    Then what happens if... let's assume... all right, if I take that example, then it seems to me I am varying Miller, because Miller didn't say that any use of race, whether for compliance of section 2 or any other, is wrong. 
    Miller says it's only wrong when it is subordinated to traditional districting practices. 
    Miller puts a limitation on it, and it seems to me that your answers to us do not recognize that limitation, so that if we were to agree with you, the Court would have to expand Miller.

    If they depart from the compactness solely for nonracial reasons, I think we agree, but I'm not certain, that solely for nonracial reasons it would be okay, and then the question is, what did they do here, and what he says is, in order to protect incumbents other African American voters were deliberately fenced out. 
    But what it doesn't say is whether those African American voters were fenced out because they were African Americans or because there was an inference about their voting behavior in respect to one incumbent or another--

speaker="daniel_e_troy" startTime="4324.980" stopTime="4431.049">
    Mr. Daniel E. Troy 
    The reason why I don't think that's going to happen, Your Honor, is because of compactness, contiguity, respect for political subdivision. 
    What I understand what happens in city councils throughout the country is they take a look at particular neighborhoods, particular areas of interest, where people have things in common like the schools they go to, the places they shop, the water supply, the potholes in the streets. 
    What they did in this case was, they abandoned that and they said we are going to, particularly in Harris County, we're going to separate the races. 
    We're going to take someone who lived in the northwest corner of the city and who's always voted in District 18, who's Hispanic, we're going to take Al Vera and we're going to lump him with the Hispanics in the southwest... in the southeastern part of the city because he is Hispanic. 
    That seems to me to not respect traditional principles and to be affirmatively unconstitutional. 
    And Your Honors, in Texas what the court found, in Dallas what the court found is that simply, there was capitulation to a demand by the Dallas black community that... I'm quoting the Department of Justice's narrative, the narrative to the Department of Justice. 
    This is what Texas told the Department of Justice, that 
    "the Dallas black community insisted that a safe black district be drawn that had a total black population of at least 50 percent. " 
    That's at the joint appendix at 106. 
    Your Honors, we've gotten off on the... because we've been entertaining hypotheticals we've gotten far away from what happened in this case, and what happened in this case was that race was used as a tool for incumbency protection only secondarily. 
    Primarily, there was this maximization policy of the Department of Justice that everybody knew about. 
    They... Eddie Bernice Johnson specifically said, my policy was, if it could be drawn it must be drawn, and all other concerns were subordinated to that, and so that is what happened here, and that, we submit, is unconstitutional.
