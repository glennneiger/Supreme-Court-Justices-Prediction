    We'll hear argument next in Number 94 923, Ruth Shaw v. James B. Hunt; Number 94 924, James Pope v. James B. Hunt. 
    Mr. Everett, you may proceed.

    Mr. Robinson O. Everett 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court-- 
    I suppose I better do one thing at the outset to maintain the honor of North Carolina. 
    There was a question about two of the districts in Texas being, I believe, the least compact in the country, and I have here perfect evidence that we have four of the least compact. 
    Justice O'Connor will remember this map, because it was appended to her opinion in Shaw v. Reno, and the twelfth, I think... the snake... leads the country.

    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    The Court's opinion, Mr. Everett.
speaker="robinson_o_everett" startTime="71.427" stopTime="72.569">
    Mr. Robinson O. Everett 
    I'm sorry, Your Honor.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="72.569" stopTime="74.979">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    The Court's opinion, not my opinion.
speaker="robinson_o_everett" startTime="74.979" stopTime="159.135">
    Mr. Robinson O. Everett 
    The Court's opinion, one which you authored. 
    I apologize, Your Honor. 
    But in any event, the Court became aware of the absence of compactness, which leads into another point. 
    There was a discussion of the difference between narrow tailoring and broad tailoring. 
    I think we have here the exhibit of no tailoring. 
    And I'd like to make one other point, just to explain why we are here, and perhaps it reflects a rather naive understanding of the Constitution, of the Equal Protection Clause, but my impression has been that if there were two water fountains over there, one of which said African American, and another of which said, women, and another over here which said male, and said white, and if that in effect was here, with the signs, that I would be perfectly entitled to go to any one of those four fountains and drink the water. 
    The water would be the same everywhere, but the Court nor other public body, no State, no Federal body could approve racial classifications. 
    And the reason we're here is because this map reflects a redistricting plan which, in effect, is a racial classification. 
    That's what this is about. 
    That map says there are two black districts and there are ten white districts.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="159.135" stopTime="166.180">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Does it say that the people in those districts can drink at either water fountain? 
    Can they vote both either Democratic or Republican, as they choose?
speaker="robinson_o_everett" startTime="166.180" stopTime="177.186">
    Mr. Robinson O. Everett 
    They can vote as they please, Justice Stevens, but on the other hand they are preconditioned in their behavior by the fact that these districts carry a message. 
    They carry a message for the voters--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="177.186" stopTime="178.318">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    The same message your signs carry.

    --Your Honor?
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="179.249" stopTime="182.711">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    The same message that your signs carry, I guess, but they actually didn't inhibit.
speaker="robinson_o_everett" startTime="182.711" stopTime="183.089">
    Mr. Robinson O. Everett 
    Exactly.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="183.089" stopTime="184.831">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    You pick the fountain you wanted to pick.
speaker="robinson_o_everett" startTime="184.831" stopTime="201.592">
    Mr. Robinson O. Everett 
    We are saying that these, though, carry a message, and the signs would be impermissible. 
    This Court did that. 
    It had these labels... I would certainly be entitled to make a motion and get an injunction and have those signs taken down. 
    We would maintain by the same token--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="201.592" stopTime="202.804">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    I don't know who you'd get it from.

    Mr. Robinson O. Everett 
    --I would hope at least we could get a majority, but in any event, it would seem to me what we are saying is these signs, these labels should be removed. 
    Now, in order that there's no question about the status and the standing of the plaintiffs and the plaintiff intervenors, I should note that according to the Court's determination the plaintiffs and the plaintiff intervenors have established... this is on page 110a... have established that they are registered to vote in North Carolina congressional elections and that the challenged redistricting plan assigns them to vote in particular electoral districts, at least in part because of their race. 
    Which is to say that Professor Shimm is assigned to the 12th District at least in part because of the racial determination. 
    He is a white fill a person, and on the other hand there are three of us who are plaintiffs who are assigned to the 2nd District because of our race. 
    We... because our district was bleached. 
    Now, interestingly enough, and Justice Scalia called attention in the Texas case to an example of what we might refer to as Orwellian doublespeak. 
    The minority opportunity district I think was the phrase.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="287.729" stopTime="296.134">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Mr. Everett, there is some difference, isn't there, with respect to the standing of the plaintiffs in this case with respect to one district and the other?
speaker="robinson_o_everett" startTime="296.134" stopTime="302.438">
    Mr. Robinson O. Everett 
    We would maintain, Your Honor, that due to the ripple effect all these plaintiffs have standing as to all the districts.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="302.438" stopTime="308.052">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well, but supposing we don't accept the ripple effect, there is some difference, isn't there?
speaker="robinson_o_everett" startTime="308.052" stopTime="335.481">
    Mr. Robinson O. Everett 
    Oh, Professor Shimm and Mrs. Shaw are in the 12th District. 
    The rest of us are in different districts. 
    None of us is in the 1st District, but the 1st District was constructed by taking the... what would have been the 2nd District and playing around with it and changing the boundaries, so that our position would be that all those... and this is really the rationale, I think, of the court below, that all of us were affected because of the seamless web--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="335.481" stopTime="344.887">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Suppose-- 
    --What about our decision in Hays? 
    I mean, couldn't the plaintiffs there have made the same argument about Louisiana, that it's a seamless web, and we didn't accept that.
speaker="robinson_o_everett" startTime="344.887" stopTime="376.277">
    Mr. Robinson O. Everett 
    --I don't believe they made it, as I recall... I was here at the argument... and I don't think it was articulated in that particular fashion, but our position would be this, Your Honor, as a practical matter. 
    The 12th District, because of its inner penetration, is essential to the plan. 
    If you knock out the 12th District there is no plan, and as a consequence, and since Professor Shimm and Mrs. Shaw clearly have standing, it really doesn't make much difference. 
    The question is before you, is this plan a violation of the Equal Protection--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="376.277" stopTime="384.492">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    You're saying that a person who has a right to challenge one district by reason of residence in that district has a right to challenge the entire plan.
speaker="robinson_o_everett" startTime="384.492" stopTime="386.195">
    Mr. Robinson O. Everett 
    --I would say, Your Honor--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="386.195" stopTime="387.573">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    That's a different argument from the ripple effect.
speaker="robinson_o_everett" startTime="387.573" stopTime="394.048">
    Mr. Robinson O. Everett 
    --It's... I would say that in this particular situation, given the inner penetration of the plan, that would be true. 
    Now--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="394.048" stopTime="403.585">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Including the aspects of the plan that you claim are invalid with respect to other districts.
speaker="robinson_o_everett" startTime="403.585" stopTime="689.151">
    Mr. Robinson O. Everett 
    --We would think across the board in this situation, and we would note this, Your Honor, that the... well, I will admit, Cherokee County, over here, up into Tennessee, I'm not really saying that I'd have much standing perhaps to challenge that, but as a practical matter, everything in the middle and the eastern part of North Carolina is so tied together as a practical matter it is one plan. 
    It is like the unitary school system in the Hays case, which was promulgated from one source. 
    It's a unitary plan, and we would maintain we have standing. 
    One thing I would like to call to the Court's attention, and we stress it in our brief because we think it's important. 
    That is, what was said 2 1/2 years ago when we were here, and what's happened in between. 
    When I argued the case 2 1/2 years ago the counsel for the State appellee, and this is pointed out in our brief on page 4, said this case is about the legal significance of two facts. 
    First, the North Carolina General Assembly intentionally created two majority minority congressional districts. 
    Second, the General Assembly did so for the purpose of complying with section 5 of the Voting Rights Act and of securing preclearance of its congressional reapportionment plan from the Attorney General of the United States. 
    In response to a question from the Court, the same counsel stated... he's not here this time. 
    There's a different counsel for the State, but he presumably spoke with authority... there's no dispute here over what the State's purpose is. 
    There's a dispute over how to characterize it legally, but we're not in disagreement about what the State legislature was trying to do. 
    Then again, and this is quoted on page 27 of our brief in the footnote, counsel for the State defendant stated to the Court the determining factor in this case is that North Carolina is subject to section 5 preclearance, and then later, section 2 may, depending upon the particular demographics and the situation of the State, require majority minority districting, but once again, that's not this case. 
    So we were here 2 1/2 years ago thinking the case had to do with whether or not section 5 was involved, and the State put forth what we characterized as the Nuremberg defense. 
    The Department of Justice made us do it. 
    The Civil Rights Division made us do it. 
    They wouldn't give us preclearance. 
    And I was also here during the argument when the Solicitor General was asked back in April this year about the policy of the Department of Justice, and it seems very clear from the findings made in the Hays case, the original Hays case, from the findings in the Georgia case which you're well familiar with, from everything about it, that just as was said here to this very Court 2 1/2 years ago and just as was admitted in the defendant's answer, they did it in order to get preclearance. 
    What did they do? 
    They enacted this constitutional monstrosity, which replaced another constitutional monstrosity but a less aggravated monstrosity. 
    They did it in order to get preclearance. 
    So when we left here, or when we got the decision, actually, in summer of 1993, and we read about the gerrymander, what the Court said, racial gerrymander, strict scrutiny, we thought it was a fairly simple case. 
    Go back... can we prove there's a racial gerrymander? 
    Of course we can. 
    This map almost speaks for itself. 
    Everything else spoke for itself. 
    The record, the submission in Chapter 7 says the overriding purpose of the State, the State of North Carolina, is to create these districts and to obtain preclearance. 
    How could it be clearer? 
    So... but there are some very ingenious counsel on the other side, and then we learned that it wasn't really a racial gerrymander, oh, no, and it wasn't just section 2, oh, no, and it wasn't... I mean, it wasn't just section 5, pardon me. 
    It was also section 2, and it was also remedying past discrimination. 
    Very innovative, and moreover, we didn't have... none of us had standing. 
    Everything, we had all of it. 
    The State appropriated half a million dollars to put up this defense. 
    Various people came in to battle us along the way.

    Justice David H. Souter 
    Mr. Everett, may I ask you this question? 
    Do you find something legally or constitutionally inconsistent with the position the last time around, or at least the assumption the last time around that the reason for the configuration was to obtain section 5 preclearance and the reason found here... strike the word reason... and the fact found here that in fact the configuration was a means to comply with section 2? 
    Are those two inconsistent?

    --Well, I'd say--
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="735.100" stopTime="740.916">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    One says the motive... the motive the first time was to obtain section 5 preclearance, period.

speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="742.516" stopTime="754.513">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    And the finding now is that that configuration was necessary and hence justifiable to avoid a section 2 violation. 
    Are those two propositions inconsistent legally?

    Mr. Robinson O. Everett 
    They are in this context, Justice Souter.

speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="763.720" stopTime="788.956">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    Well, that may be, but that wasn't my question. 
    My question wasn't whether they had two different intents. 
    My question was, if we assume that the intent was in fact to get a section 5 preclearance, and we know from Shaw that that is not adequate, is there anything inconsistent with saying it is nonetheless justifiable now, because in fact it was necessary to avoid a section 2 violation and hence--

    No, they're not.

    --If--

    Is that your position?

    Justice David H. Souter 
    Well, let me must pursue that for a moment.

    So they redraw the map, and it looks like the last map. 
    New case. 
    May the section 2 violation be considered by the three judge... may the claim that it is reasonably necessary to avoid a section 2 violation be considered by the three judge court?

    Mr. Robinson O. Everett 
    Your Honor, we think the goal is impermissible. 
    Let me analogize this. 
    I can see the... well, if you want to have Democrats control or Republicans, or whatever it is, look at the registration of those, you may know that there's a heavy Democratic registration, say in North Carolina where 95 percent of the African Americans are registered as black. 
    You may know that where there's a 95... a heavy Democratic registration there probably is a very substantial African American population. 
    So what? 
    But what I am concerned about, and perhaps this is because of my reading or misreading of the peremptory challenges cases, my understanding is that if I look at a juror, I have a peremptory challenge, and I say, that juror is black, therefore I don't want him in this particular case, or that juror is a woman and I don't want her in that particular case, and I use a stereotype, and I use a classification, that is wrong. 
    If, on the other hand, as in the Hernandez case where you were dealing, as I recall, with peremptory challenges, I say, this Hispanic may be interpreting for himself or herself the testimony being given, rather than going through an interpreter, then I can challenge him off. 
    It's... as we view it, and we perhaps take Hirabayashi and the later cases too seriously, but we really take it very seriously that racial classifications are odious and are subject to stricture.
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="1320.439" stopTime="1360.476">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    So then you would say the same principle applies to every, whether it's a city council, whether it's any of the hundreds of thousands of elections that if people draw boundaries to a significant extent on the basis of race, I take it, of religion, of ethnic background, of sex, of anything of that nature, that that then will come into Federal court and they will then look and see if significant boundaries in this local city council race, or whatever, a significant number of those boundaries was drawn with religion in mind or ethnicity.

    Mr. Robinson O. Everett 
    Our secondary position is that it is clear there was not a reevaluation of section 2, that the section 5 denial of preclearance tainted everything, that just as the State represented when it came up here the first time, it was a matter of fulfilling the mandate of the Justice Department just as it was in Miller, and therefore this should fall, just as the Georgia redistricting fell. 
    Moreover, there was no totality of circumstances analysis. 
    There is no ability to satisfy the Gingles preconditions to whatever extent they still are preconditions. 
    There is an actual, very overt, mathematically demonstrable error in the opinion of the court that there can be created two geographically compact majority minority districts. 
    You can tell from this map and from the maps that show the concentrations of black population that it is simply impossible. 
    The court completely misconstrued the numerical facts, including one of the tables, and when you take all of that together, the section 2 compliance argument is an afterthought.

    Well, Your Honor, majority black is 50 percent. 
    The very table that was relied on by the majority below shows 44 percent. 
    Forty four percent is less than 50 percent, and therefore as a matter of mathematically demonstrable fact, the court was wrong. 
    They also refer to other examples of geographically compact districts. 
    Those other districts contain the equivalent of section 12. 
    Now, if anyone here... some things you can see, and I'm sure all of you all have 20/20 vision jurisdically and otherwise.

   Argument of Thomas A. Farr
speaker="thomas_a_farr" startTime="1767.199" stopTime="1805.474">
    Mr. Thomas A. Farr 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court-- 
    Speaking for the plaintiff intervenors, I would like to state what we think is at issue in this case, and what is not at issue. 
    We do not believe that the constitutionality of the Voting Rights Act is at issue. 
    We believe that it is constitutional. 
    Nor do we think that whether compliance with section 2 might, under the right case, serve some compelling governmental interest, that is not an issue in this case. 
    We think under the right case it may be a compelling governmental interest, so you create a district that would satisfy section 2.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1805.474" stopTime="1811.057">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    If it can be a compelling State interest in some cases, why isn't it in this?
speaker="thomas_a_farr" startTime="1811.057" stopTime="1861.761">
    Mr. Thomas A. Farr 
    It is not a compelling State interest in this case, Your Honor, for two reasons. 
    First, there is no evidence in this record that would show that the district adopted... met the Gingles preconditions. 
    There would be no plaintiff, I think, in the United States would walk into a district court with this map and say these are two geographically compact districts that entitle us to remedial relief under section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. 
    The other reason, Your Honor, why that is not an issue in this case is because no one in the North Carolina General Assembly believed that they were creating these districts to remedy violations under section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, and it's very clear that what North Carolina believed it was doing, because they said so, they made this statement in their submission in support of Chapter 7 to the Justice Department pursuant to section 5, was that they were creating these districts to respond to the dictates of the Justice Department for--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1861.761" stopTime="1874.300">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    May I go back to your first reason? 
    Why does that map bear on the question of whether it was possible to create a compact district, majority minority compact district? 
    That map doesn't tell us anything about where people live.
speaker="thomas_a_farr" startTime="1874.300" stopTime="1884.695">
    Mr. Thomas A. Farr 
    --Your Honor, I think that there's evidence in this case from which it might be concluded that a majority black district could be created in northeastern North Carolina--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1884.695" stopTime="1884.935">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Right.
speaker="thomas_a_farr" startTime="1884.935" stopTime="1934.049">
    Mr. Thomas A. Farr 
    --and that a majority minority district could be created running from Charlotte to the southeastern part of the State. 
    There's no evidence in this case that two majority black districts that are reasonably geographically compact could be created in this case. 
    It's not been presented by anyone. 
    Now, we believe, Your Honor, aside from the fact that the State did not comply with what is stated in Croson and Wygant, that they have to have substantial racism evidence at the time that they adopt a racial based remedy, assuming that they had done that, Your Honor. 
    The only defense that they have in this case is if the Court adopts the notion that you may place a remedial district somewhere else in North Carolina besides the part of the State where the violation has been proven, and we think that's a very novel concept under every other area of law, and it ought to be a novel concept under section 2 of the Voting Rights Act.

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Well, would you-- 
    --Why-- 
    --No, please. 
    I don't know why that would be. 
    I mean, if you buy the proposition of racial entitlement, that is, it doesn't matter whether a particular black man has been discriminated against, that the object is the race as a whole has to be made good, why wouldn't that follow? 
    It doesn't really matter what part of the State you're not properly creating the black district in, so long as you create a black district somewhere.

    Your Honor--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="1966.320" stopTime="1974.385">

    It's sort of a racial entitlement theory. 
    It has nothing to do with particular individuals who are being disadvantaged.
speaker="thomas_a_farr" startTime="1974.385" stopTime="2045.942">
    Mr. Thomas A. Farr 
    --Your Honor, we think that this right under the Voting Rights Act is not a right that is enjoyed by any minority in the State of North Carolina. 
    It is the right to be free from vote dilution, and I believe that Justice O'Connor's concurring opinion in the Gingles case makes it very clear that these cases are very district specific, that you've got to prove the Gingles conditions in the district in which you're trying to show the violation. 
    And if I might explain a little bit what happened in North Carolina, there is an argument that you could make a reasonably compact majority minority district running from Charlotte to the southeastern part of the State. 
    This was not done for incumbency protection reasons. 
    That's undisputed that that's why this was not adopted. 
    It's the only district that the Justice Department pointed out in its objection letter, and again, as stated earlier, there's no evidence... Justice certainly did not suggest a majority black district. 
    They suggested a majority minority district. 
    In running this district up I 85, the district took in the black population in Charlotte, which constituted approximately a third of the total minority population that would have been in existence if we had adopted a majority minority district.
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="2045.942" stopTime="2082.474">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    The reason, I take it, is that the specific argument would be that section 2 requires the creation of two districts in North Carolina because, just as you pointed out, one could be done in that part of the State and the other in the other part of the State, and the only reason that they're in a different place is for incumbency protection reasons, and that latter reason has nothing to do with race, and if you say that you can't do that, then you're saying that you can't do it when black districts are involved but you could do it when white districts are involved, and so the latter proposition is an impossible one to maintain.

    We believe, Your Honor, that that would fail the narrow tailoring requirement of strict scrutiny, and specifically, Your Honor, it's these people in this part of North Carolina that had their votes diluted.

    They'd be... still be drawing the boundaries on the basis of race, although in order to protect incumbents.

    That's very true, Your Honor.

    But it would still be racial boundary drawing, and your position is that's okay when you're doing it in order to comply with section 2, but it's not okay when you're doing it to protect incumbents, I suppose.

    Mr. Thomas A. Farr 
    Yes, I don't think incumbency protection is a compelling governmental interest, Your Honor, and in fact--

    Justice David H. Souter 
    Well, it may not be a... and no, I don't think anybody is claiming that it's a compelling governmental interest, but it is a relevant consideration, as I understand it, under Miller, in determining the extent to which race predominates, because one of the things you ask, the principal question you asked, I guess, is, has race subordinated traditional districting principles? 
    Now, if one districting principle is incumbency protection, if that as a matter of historical fact is true, that that has been an object pursued over the years, and if that can be pursued, let's say with political data as opposed to racial data which may or may not be a good surrogate for political data, if it's pursued with political data alone, then do you not concede that the boundary can vary from the compact boundary that would satisfy Gingles without flunking the narrow tailoring test? 
    Don't you concede that?

    Well, if I understood your question, you were saying, and Justice Scalia, we believe it's a very difficult case to prove a section 2 violation, and I hope I have a chance to explain that before I sit down, but Justice Souter, we again believe that the remedy must go to the people who have been injured, and if--
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="2255.639" stopTime="2267.185">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    No, but you are saying not that the remedy must go to the people who have been injured, but that the remedy must go to all and only the people injured, and no other consideration may play a role--

    --and if you are saying that, I think, you are asking the Court to depart at least in one respect from Miller, because Miller says a consideration as to whether race has subordinated, whether race is predominant, is, has race subordinated traditional districting principles, and if a traditional districting principle is incumbency protection, you are saying, well, you've got to modify Miller to the extent that incumbency protection will never be cognizable here, so I think you're asking for a change in Miller.

    Mr. Thomas A. Farr 
    Your Honor, I think there's a great distinction, because when you're talking about political subdivisions or county lines, you're talking about neutral criteria, and I believe that the Court discussed those issues as a frame of reference to show in a case involving circumstantial evidence whether or not you could prove the intent element of the Miller claim. 
    With incumbency protection that is a far more subjective factor, and Justice Souter, drawing a majority minority district has to be done for a compelling governmental interest, and we would suggest that doing it to protect an incumbent is not compelling. 
    Doing it to possibly comply with a section 2 violation is, and if you are doing that, you must draw the district where the section 2 violation exists.

   Argument of Edwin M. Speas, Jr.
speaker="edwin_m_speas_jr" startTime="2372.456" stopTime="2419.626">
    Mr. Edwin M. Speas, Jr. 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court-- 
    This matter first came to this Court on the granting of defendant's Rule 12(b)(6) motion, and all of the facts of the complaint, of course, were presumed to be true. 
    The matter was remanded to court for trial, to the district court for trial, and at the trial, extensive evidence was taken by the court. 
    Among that evidence were specific statements by legislators and the drafters of the map that they intended to draw the 12th District as an urban district. 
    Demographers told us without any question the 12th District is an urban district. 
    It is the most urban district created in North Carolina. 
    Historians told us also that the 12th District is located within the Piedmont Urban Crescent.

    Mr. Edwin M. Speas, Jr. 
    The 12th district is orange, Your Honor.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2424.238" stopTime="2425.159">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Oh, okay.
speaker="edwin_m_speas_jr" startTime="2425.159" stopTime="2470.918">
    Mr. Edwin M. Speas, Jr. 
    It is located entirely within the 10 counties that make up the Piedmont Urban Crescent, an area that the historians tell us has historic integrity. 
    The historians also... excuse me. 
    The demographers also told us that this area is laced together by interstate highways, that the district is accessible both for voters and their representatives. 
    All of these factors combined to lead the district court to conclude that this district and all districts provided fair and effective representation for North Carolina citizens, and we think that's very important in this case, because, as this Court has said, the ultimate purpose of redistricting is to provide fair and effective representation for all of North Carolina's citizens, both black and white.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="2470.918" stopTime="2480.205">
    Justice Antonin Scalia

    Mr. Edwin M. Speas, Jr.

    Mr. Edwin M. Speas, Jr. 
    No, Your Honor, but we think in this case that the issue of whether the district provides fair and effective representation is relevant to the issue of standing, is relevant to the issue of whether race was the predominant motive... if race was the predominant motive, you would assume that the district might not provide fair and effective representation for white citizens, and in fact--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="2535.261" stopTime="2546.709">

    Maybe so, maybe not. 
    I'm not sure there's any correlation between the two.

    --No, Your Honor. 
    We think that the issue for the State is whether such a district can be drawn. 
    If it is established, and there is strong evidence for believing that a district can be drawn, then principles of federalism and the discretion the States must have in this area give to the States discretion as to where they will place that district--

speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="2737.182" stopTime="2740.965">

   Argument of Julius LeVonne Chambers
speaker="julius_levonne_chambers" startTime="3538.696" stopTime="3656.382">
    Mr. Julius LeVonne Chambers 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court-- 
    I would first begin pointing out that this case is not Gomillion v. Lightfoot. 
    Nobody has excluded any citizen of North Carolina from participating in the electoral process. 
    Black and white citizens are, through this legislation, provided for the first time in over 90 years an opportunity to now have a voice... an opportunity to have a voice in the election of Congresspeople in North Carolina. 
    We have gone through a period in North Carolina where we have purposely discriminated against black people. 
    We've then moved, only through the urging of legislation and this Court, to periods where we have permitted blacks to register and vote. 
    We've moved to the Voting Rights Act. 
    We now for the first time have gotten to a point where black people will have a voice, or an opportunity to have a voice in the election of Congresspeople, and I hope in the Court's review of this case it appreciates that we're operating not in a vacuum, but in a situation where we've had a history of purposely excluding black people. 
    And now we're trying to devise a remedy, and that remedy is one, I submit, this Court has approved, where we say it is necessary to have a majority black district in order to give black people an opportunity to have a choice in who represents them in the legislature. 
    Nobody is guaranteeing any black representative. 
    We are only giving people a voice, and we know from the decision in Gingles that this Court, and that the Congress in enacting section 2, felt it imperative that we create districts where people would have a real voice and not a farce.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="3656.382" stopTime="3711.648">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Mr. Chambers, many people think that black people can have a greater voice when they are close to a majority, or at least a substantial minority in a lot of districts, rather than a majority in one or two districts. 
    Indeed, the charge is made that it is very much in the political interests of some people to aggregate all blacks into one or two districts so that the rest of the districts can ignore their interests. 
    I don't... you know, I am in total sympathy with the objective that you're urging upon us, but it certainly isn't clear as a matter of principle or logic that this is the only way to achieve that objective. 
    Indeed, there are many who think that this is moving in precisely the wrong direction, that its net effect is to reduce the opportunity of blacks to have their interests taken into account. 
    I frankly don't know what the answer is, but I certainly can't agree with you that this is the only way to achieve it.
speaker="julius_levonne_chambers" startTime="3711.648" stopTime="3729.921">
    Mr. Julius LeVonne Chambers 
    I understand that, Your Honor. 
    We had a district in North Carolina that provided, we thought, an opportunity, with 42 percent black votes. 
    Because of racially polarized voting we couldn't elect a candidate of choice.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="3729.921" stopTime="3738.235">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    What does that mean, you couldn't elect a candidate of choice? 
    is it clear that the candidate you elected ignored the interests of black people, or is it just that he was not black?
speaker="julius_levonne_chambers" startTime="3738.235" stopTime="3744.569">
    Mr. Julius LeVonne Chambers 
    It's because the candidate was not the representative of choice for African Americans in North Carolina.

    Justice Antonin Scalia

    Mr. Julius LeVonne Chambers 
    It means, Your Honor, the same thing it would mean for you if you didn't have a voice in the election of your representative. 
    We've gone through periods where we know, through the legislation that's been passed in Congress, where the interests of black people haven't been represented. 
    Congress sought through the legislation in 1982 to ensure for at least once we would move beyond that, and now we have this chance and this opportunity through section 2 of the Voting Rights Act to ensure that black people... and we know through experiences in North Carolina, and this Court found this in Gingles, that simply providing an opportunity district would not ensure the kind of opportunity that African Americans needed.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="3790.779" stopTime="3854.943">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Well, let me ask you this. 
    Assuming that it can be shown that the Gingles factors are met to establish a section 2 violation, and that there is an area in the State where there is a reasonably compact block of black voters that could be combined in a district and where there is evidence of racially polarized voting, or block voting, so that you could create a district there, then Gingles would suggest that's what you look at to see if there's a section 2 violation. 
    Now, if you establish that, can the remedy be to create a district in a different part of the State, not where the evidence showed at all that would satisfy Gingles, but go to a completely different part of the State and create something there? 
    Is that a narrowly tailored remedy?

speaker="julius_levonne_chambers" startTime="3860.356" stopTime="3940.138">
    Mr. Julius LeVonne Chambers 
    Well, in general, I would say that if we're looking at a congressional district, and we're looking at a State, I would submit that it would permit the State, using its discretion, which is the second point I wanted to raise with you, to decide how to locate that particular district in that State in order to accommodate that injury. 
    The injury, I submit, is to all the people in North Carolina who, because of the way we structured the system, are suffering from dilution of their votes and not having a voice in the election of representatives. 
    Now, in this district here, we had two plans... the Court asked about this... that assured that blacks would be able to elect a representative of choice. 
    These plans are in the record. 
    They are Exhibit 10, and they're filed with the Court, and they're maps that were run through the legislature. 
    What the State saw was it could draw a district running from Charlotte or Gastonia down through, either to Wilmington or up back through, near Raleigh. 
    These were, in your words, compact districts, which is the third point that I wanted to raise with you, and they saw the potential violation of section 2. 
    And Justice Kennedy, you asked about whether Gastonia residents could file a lawsuit. 
    I submit to you, they could. 
    You're not confining this to Gastonia. 
    You could begin in Gastonia.

    But you see, what... where we are, Mr. Chambers... as you know this as well or better than I, two very volatile areas, race and politics, in which there has been no long tradition or settled juridical principles about what are neutral, fair, adequate districting considerations. 
    It's been the law of the jungle. 
    And the point of Gingles was to try to introduce some neutral, controlled factors that could be the beginning point for building a principles jurisprudence, and I'm somewhat concerned that you suggest that we somehow now sweep those under the rug and put us back in the anything goes area.

    Mr. Julius LeVonne Chambers 
    That's not what I said, Your Honor. 
    Remember, too, in Gingles we were dealing with a State legislature, State Houses, State Senate seats, not with a congressional district, and second, as we talked about compactness and contiguity, we were assuming that that was what was necessary in order to ensure that we bring people together with a community of interest. 
    We now see from the findings in this Court, now before this Court, that we can look at things that, of the way the State develops, and that's the peculiarity of North Carolina, to help ensure the same kind of community of interest, the same kind of opportunity of people working together, not just because they're black, but--

    Even if we... if the Court sustains the plan here, we will not have proportional representation.

    The plans would guarantee about 2 percent, or may guarantee at least an opportunity for 18 percent. 
    We're not talking about proportional representation.

   Argument of Paul Bender
speaker="paul_bender" startTime="4109.419" stopTime="4204.021">
    Mr. Paul Bender 
    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court-- 
    Let me start with the question that has occupied the Court during much of this argument, and that is the question of whether, if the Gingles factors are satisfied so that there's a compelling interest in satisfying section 2 by drawing minority majority districts, whether the State can then locate those districts anywhere in the State. 
    It is not our position that the State can locate them anywhere in the State, and in this case the State did not locate them anywhere in the State. 
    The District 12 which was ultimately drawn here contains two areas, the Charlotte area here, and the Durham area here, which are... contain a substantial part of the black population. 
    In this district Charlotte alone contains a little over 30 percent of the black population in this district. 
    Durham contains some more. 
    Both of those areas were in a compact district in the Shaw II plan that's in the joint appendix. 
    It's this plan here. 
    Charlotte was in this district, and Durham was in this district, so there's a substantial overlap between those people. 
    And in addition, another limiting criterion, Justice Kennedy, is that the district must be placed in an area so that the majority of the black population in the district has been a victim of the polarized voting that invoked section 2, and a majority of that population is politically cohesive with other minorities in the State who have been the victims of that, and the findings of fact in this case, which are amply supported by the evidence, are that that was exactly true here.
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="4204.021" stopTime="4264.000">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    Is it the case that if, in fact, those criteria are met... you see, what... I find it quite difficult, because there's a constitutional principle that you're permitted to do this when there's a compelling need, and then it has to be narrowly tailored. 
    And by itself, narrowly tailored might suggest compactness, but is there a principle involved that, if it is compact, and you insist on it, then only black related districts would have the requirement of not taking into account protecting incumbencies, while white districts would not have such a requirement, and can the Constitution permit such a result, if that's right? 
    And what I want you to address, if you can, is if that's right, there's a constitutional principle each way. 
    Narrow tailoring cuts in favor of compactness, but the basic principle of equal protection of the law would seem to cut in the opposite direction, so how can those be reconciled?
speaker="paul_bender" startTime="4264.000" stopTime="4277.609">
    Mr. Paul Bender 
    Well, I think that's exactly right. 
    If North Carolina had wanted to create a district in which farmers were a majority, there's no constitutional principle which would stop it from creating a noncompact district like that.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="4277.609" stopTime="4283.753">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well, Justice Breyer's question asked you about the creation of a white district. 
    Would that be constitutional?
speaker="paul_bender" startTime="4283.753" stopTime="4329.715">
    Mr. Paul Bender 
    No, not a district based on race. 
    Section 2 only would justify a district for minority's interests. 
    But I was saying, there are other... take the desire of a State to create the district that has a majority of farmers in it. 
    I take it that that's a legitimate interest that a State could have, and that a State in vindicating that interest could design a noncompact district. 
    In this case, the district court found that the State acted not to satisfy a desire of the States, but to satisfy an obligation of the States, an obligation to comply with Federal law, an obligation to comply with section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. 
    I can't believe that when the State acts to satisfy a statutory and perhaps even a constitutional obligation xx has less discretion in doing that, in employing its other--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="4329.715" stopTime="4355.591">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Well, the problem... the problem, of course, is the Fourteen Amendment and its prohibition that the State not act on the basis of race alone in handing out public benefits, or in drawing district lines, or whatever it is. 
    I mean, that's why we're into this, and that's... it doesn't talk about farmers, it talks about race, doesn't it?
speaker="paul_bender" startTime="4355.591" stopTime="4374.344">
    Mr. Paul Bender 
    --Well, I think in this area, Justice O'Connor, the State can act on the basis of race in order to create a majority minority district in order to counteract the effects of past voting discrimination, which was present in North Carolina for a long time, and the legacy of that discrimination, which is the polarized voting. 
    It's unusual that a State can do that, and it--

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    You could have had a much more concentrated second district if you were only going for majority minority, but instead, the State chose to go for two majority black districts in spite of the fact that no one has given us any indication of why the failure to have a second majority black district could possibly have been a section 2 violation.
speaker="paul_bender" startTime="4435.242" stopTime="4451.094">
    Mr. Paul Bender 
    --Two points there. 
    One, they chose to do that because if they had done this district, this would be a district that had almost no coherence except that it was a minority majority district. 
    This district mixed rural and urban people together, there was no community of interest there, and a second reason they didn't--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="4451.094" stopTime="4453.124">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Whereas the community of interest here is what, that they're all black?

    Mr. Paul Bender 
    --No, that 80 percent of them are urban, and the State deliberately decided to create an 80 percent urban district here, and an 80 percent rural district here, as a purpose.

    Yes.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="4461.950" stopTime="4469.293">
    Justice Antonin Scalia

    Mr. Paul Bender 
    In doing this--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="4471.366" stopTime="4472.446">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Yes, in figuring out this strange scheme.
speaker="paul_bender" startTime="4472.446" stopTime="4474.119">
    Mr. Paul Bender 
    --I don't know what they punched into the computer, but they--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="4474.119" stopTime="4485.095">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    My impression is that they punched in... that they punched in black, that they were looking specifically for two majority black districts, and there is no justification that anyone has asserted under section 2 for punching that into the computer.
speaker="paul_bender" startTime="4485.095" stopTime="4537.939">
    Mr. Paul Bender 
    --No, there is. 
    Section 2 says that if minorities are denied a fair opportunity to participate in the political process because of racial polarization in voting and because the minorities... and when the minorities are cohesive, then you have to create a majority minority district for them. 
    Now, it's true that in this case, as you pointed out a number of times, the second district that was compact was not a majority minority district, it was a 49 point something percent minority district, and of that 49 percent, I think about 42 percent were black, and about 7 percent were Native Americans. 
    The statute, section 2, which is what we're applying here, doesn't require a majority minority district. 
    Gingles said that, but I think it said that as an approximation. 
    What the statute requires is to give the minorities a fair opportunity to participate in the political process, and how much of a percentage of minorities you need to do that depends upon the extent of polarized voting.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="4537.939" stopTime="4546.545">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    What about the other minorities that form the almost majority in the concentrated district that was identified but not used?

    They were what, Hispanic and Indian?

    Almost a majority, though not even a majority, much less a majority black, but you formed that out of a district in which only 42 percent were black.
speaker="paul_bender" startTime="4560.205" stopTime="4563.488">
    Mr. Paul Bender 
    That district would have had about 42 percent black.

    Well, what xx--
speaker="paul_bender" startTime="4563.675" stopTime="4572.902">
    Mr. Paul Bender 
    But that would have been a district in which minorities would have had a fair opportunity to have candidates of choice elected, because they would have had a sizeable enough population so that with a right cross over voting--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="4572.902" stopTime="4583.440">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    --And the theory is that Hispanics and Indians in that concentrated district, their interests will be well enough taken care of by the all black district in the northern part of the city.
speaker="paul_bender" startTime="4583.440" stopTime="4616.770">
    Mr. Paul Bender 
    --There was evidence, I believe, that the two groups voted as a cohesive minority, and all of those factors are perfectly relevant, completely relevant, necessarily relevant under section 2. 
    So you shouldn't have... if it's 49.9 percent it's no good, and if it's 50.1 it is. 
    That doesn't make any sense. 
    The sense here is to give minorities a chance to participate fairly in the political process and North Carolina has done that. 
    You can't force North Carolina to abandon other nonracial redistricting principles like keeping communities of interest, urban and rural, together, or like satisfying incumbency protection.

    Tradition is a very good way of showing that they weren't done here for racial reasons, but if you are convinced, as the court was in this case, that they are not done for racial reasons, I don't think the fact that this is the first time they decided that they needed to have an urban district because of urban problems that had recently arisen and they think that it's important for those people to vote together, I don't think the fact that that's just happened in the last 10 years should disqualify them from doing it.
