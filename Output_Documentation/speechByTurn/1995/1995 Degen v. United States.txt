speaker="lawrence_s_robbins" startTime="15.766" stopTime="122.387">
    Mr. Lawrence S. Robbins 
    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    On October 24, 1989, Federal prosecutors in Reno, Nevada commenced a civil forfeiture action against some five and a half million dollars in real and personal property owned by petitioner Brian Degen and his wife, Karen. 
    As the forfeiture statutes permit, Mr. Degen filed a claim for the property. 
    In it, he denied that the property was either the proceeds or instrumentalities of narcotics violations. 
    He also asserted a range of legal defenses, including that the forfeiture action was time-barred and that it rested on an ex post facto application of the forfeiture laws. 
    On the Government's motion, however, the district court struck Mr. Degen's claim for the property. 
    The court ruled that because Mr. Degen, a dual Swiss and American citizen, had not traveled to the United States to stand trial in a criminal case that had been brought against him, he was a fugitive, and as a fugitive from the criminal case, he was therefore disentitled, in the vernacular, from contesting the civil forfeiture of his property. 
    The district court therefore entered a judgment against Mr. Degen for the full amount of the Government's claim, some five and a half million dollars of property, and the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed. 
    Our central submission this morning is that Federal courts and Federal judges do not have the authority to do this. 
    To the contrary, this extraordinary application of the fugitive disentitlement doctrine cannot be squared with this Court's disentitlement cases, it cannot be squared with due process, and it cannot be squared, most importantly, with the limitations that this Court has always recognized on the scope of the inherent powers of the Federal courts.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="122.387" stopTime="130.464">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    When you say it cannot be squared with due process, Mr. Robbins, do you mean that if Congress had enacted such a provision it would be unconstitutional?
speaker="lawrence_s_robbins" startTime="130.464" stopTime="145.094">
    Mr. Lawrence S. Robbins 
    I believe it would. 
    I believe that Congress would not have authority to pass a statute that has done what the Federal courts in this case have done, although, Justice Scalia, if I might add, it is all the more unlawful when done by Federal courts.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="145.094" stopTime="147.808">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    What leads you to think that Congress wouldn't have that authority?
speaker="lawrence_s_robbins" startTime="147.808" stopTime="150.312">
    Mr. Lawrence S. Robbins 
    Well, I think the reason is that--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="150.312" stopTime="151.010">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    I mean, are you talking about a case?
speaker="lawrence_s_robbins" startTime="151.010" stopTime="152.162">
    Mr. Lawrence S. Robbins 
    --I'm sorry, Your--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="152.162" stopTime="155.785">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Are you talking about a decision of this Court that supports that proposition?
speaker="lawrence_s_robbins" startTime="155.785" stopTime="178.771">
    Mr. Lawrence S. Robbins 
    --Well, I... it's... I think that the line of authority that supports the proposition is embodied, for example, in McVeigh and in Hovey v. Elliott, where the Court, in deciding that a Court lacked the power, said that not even a legislature could pass such a statute, and therefore it's all the more unconstitutional for Federal courts, or in those cases State courts, to exercise that kind of authority.

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Where did your client reside before he went to Switzerland?
speaker="lawrence_s_robbins" startTime="182.593" stopTime="184.025">
    Mr. Lawrence S. Robbins 
    He lived in the United States.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="184.025" stopTime="185.975">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    And when did he go to Switzerland?
speaker="lawrence_s_robbins" startTime="185.975" stopTime="191.320">
    Mr. Lawrence S. Robbins 
    The record suggests, Mr. Chief Justice, that he went to Switzerland sometime in early 1988.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="191.320" stopTime="193.121">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    And when was the indictment handed down?
speaker="lawrence_s_robbins" startTime="193.121" stopTime="196.003">
    Mr. Lawrence S. Robbins 
    It was unsealed in October 1989.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="196.003" stopTime="206.628">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    If... supposing the district judge in this case had made a finding that he left the United States in order to avoid pleading to the indictment, would that make the outcome any different, in your view?
speaker="lawrence_s_robbins" startTime="206.628" stopTime="224.282">
    Mr. Lawrence S. Robbins 
    It would not. 
    Our position would be that even if he were a fugitive in that sense, which he's not, but even had he been, our position would be exactly the same. 
    That is to say that a Federal court in the civil forfeiture case would not have the authority to exercise the dispositive sanction of dismissal.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="224.282" stopTime="226.412">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    And that Congress wouldn't?
speaker="lawrence_s_robbins" startTime="226.412" stopTime="243.093">
    Mr. Lawrence S. Robbins 
    I think it would be... I think it would be very difficult to say that Congress could pass a statute that says that the... that you have no right to defend the forfeiture of property if you have become a fugitive in a criminal case. 
    But again--
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="243.093" stopTime="246.585">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    And that's so even if you make a general appearance in the action?
speaker="lawrence_s_robbins" startTime="246.585" stopTime="249.066">
    Mr. Lawrence S. Robbins 
    --A general appearance in the forfeiture action?
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="249.066" stopTime="249.307">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    Yes.
speaker="lawrence_s_robbins" startTime="249.307" stopTime="253.350">
    Mr. Lawrence S. Robbins 
    And the question would again be the power of Congress--
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="253.350" stopTime="271.413">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    Again, the powers of Congress under the Due Process Clause. 
    Assume that there's a general appearance in the action but a refusal to make discovery or a refusal to appear because you're a fugitive from justice. 
    Couldn't the Congress of the United States say, in that case we can take judgment against you?
speaker="lawrence_s_robbins" startTime="271.413" stopTime="301.292">
    Mr. Lawrence S. Robbins 
    --Well, again... my general answer is that when Congress does something, obviously they are not constrained by the limitations on inherent powers. 
    The question that would be presented, Justice Kennedy, in that situation is whether the application of that sanction through the legislative process satisfies the conditions articulated in Hammond Packing on whether there's a sufficient nexus between the violation and the sanction that's been imposed, and it might be--
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="301.292" stopTime="328.231">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Mr. Robbins, I thought you were not contesting that as far as the forfeiture is concerned Mr. Degen would have to be treated like any other litigant, so if he didn't show up, say, for a deposition, didn't comply with all the discovery requirements, out he goes. 
    I thought that you were saying as far as the forfeiture proceeding is concerned, he can't have any advantage because of his fugitive status, and if I'm wrong in that, please tell me.
speaker="lawrence_s_robbins" startTime="328.231" stopTime="351.626">
    Mr. Lawrence S. Robbins 
    --Well, we are certainly not suggesting, Justice Ginsburg, that he has some special advantage by being... by virtue of his nonappearance, and so, for example, if there were an appropriate sanction for nonappearance in the forfeiture action, I suppose that if that sanction otherwise comported with the two standards that this Court articulated in Insurance Corporation of Ireland, I suppose he could be appropriately sanctioned, and--
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="351.626" stopTime="360.962">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    I thought your case was, he has a right, the right that any litigant would have, to defend the forfeiture proceeding.
speaker="lawrence_s_robbins" startTime="360.962" stopTime="361.413">
    Mr. Lawrence S. Robbins 
    --Exactly.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="361.413" stopTime="365.307">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    He's not stripped of that right because there's a criminal prosecution against him.
speaker="lawrence_s_robbins" startTime="365.307" stopTime="365.928">
    Mr. Lawrence S. Robbins 
    Exactly.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="365.928" stopTime="375.153">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    But as to the forfeiture proceeding, he would have to comply with all the requirements the court would impose on anyone who's contesting a forfeiture.
speaker="lawrence_s_robbins" startTime="375.153" stopTime="400.820">
    Mr. Lawrence S. Robbins 
    That's absolutely correct, and the only point of departure that I thought I tried to suggest to Your Honor's question is... insofar as the predicate is that if he didn't show up for a deposition he would be automatically subject to have his claim dismissed, I'm not altogether sure that courts can dismiss claims whenever there's any particular violation of a discovery order. 
    The question--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="400.820" stopTime="402.712">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    It's a civil matter, though. 
    You wouldn't argue--
speaker="lawrence_s_robbins" startTime="402.712" stopTime="410.860">
    Mr. Lawrence S. Robbins 
    --Exactly. 
    You know, the question would be, you know, whether this comports with the due process restrictions on Rule 37 as this Court has articulated them in--
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="410.860" stopTime="435.536">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    --What... assuming, even apart from any rule, that the failure to show up made it impossible for the Government to perfect its forfeiture case, perhaps because the material forfeited was in the possession of the defendant, in a case like that, rule or no rule, I take it you would agree that there would be no due process violation in disentitling the person to defend any further.
speaker="lawrence_s_robbins" startTime="435.536" stopTime="461.971">
    Mr. Lawrence S. Robbins 
    --I think... I think that's correct, if I understand the question. 
    If, for example, his nonappearance rendered it impossible for the district court in the forfeiture action to proceed, for example by rendering it impossible to have... you know, to enforce the judgment, or to take control of the race, if you will, then, you know, there's nothing that should separate Mr. Degen from any other litigant. 
    That--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="461.971" stopTime="472.830">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    If the district court were to order him to appear in Nevada for a deposition, could he then be served with criminal process in the criminal case?
speaker="lawrence_s_robbins" startTime="472.830" stopTime="483.346">
    Mr. Lawrence S. Robbins 
    --Oh, I think if he were to appear in response to such an order, I have no doubt that he would be immediately served with process in the criminal case.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="483.346" stopTime="487.120">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    And would that be constitutionally objectionable, in your view?
speaker="lawrence_s_robbins" startTime="487.120" stopTime="499.277">
    Mr. Lawrence S. Robbins 
    Well, the... it would raise a question in my mind, Mr. Chief Justice, if it was done for the purpose of securing his appearance, as a way of sort of going around the extradition case.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="499.277" stopTime="508.253">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well, suppose it wasn't. 
    Suppose the district judge says, we do have these foreign claimants, and I always require them to come to Reno, or Las Vegas, and give their depositions.
speaker="lawrence_s_robbins" startTime="508.253" stopTime="563.382">
    Mr. Lawrence S. Robbins 
    Well, Your Honor, that... I think the answer is this. 
    If we were faced with that case, which, of course, we're not... he was not sanctioned for that reason. 
    He was sanctioned for the quite different reason that he didn't come and make an appearance in his criminal case. 
    But had he been sanctioned for that, Mr. Chief Justice, I think it would raise two questions, one about the formulation of the rule, and one about the formulation of the sanction. 
    The formulation of the rule would be, can a district judge say that in all civil forfeiture actions every claimant must show up in person? 
    I think that would raise a question, which I'm not prepared to sort of give a complete answer to, but I think it would raise a question as to whether a district court would be in effect announcing that the rules provided by Congress, including for foreign depositions and telephonic depositions, shall be just set aside, and that no discretion shall be exercised.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="563.382" stopTime="579.554">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    We've said that that's okay in civil matters, where the reason the person doesn't want to appear generally is that he will be served in other civil cases. 
    We've said it's perfectly okay for a State to say, you make a general appearance or you do not appear at all.
speaker="lawrence_s_robbins" startTime="579.554" stopTime="580.135">
    Mr. Lawrence S. Robbins 
    I think that that--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="580.135" stopTime="584.402">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    I would think that it's a lot easier to say it for the criminal case. 
    The interest of the State is much greater.
speaker="lawrence_s_robbins" startTime="584.402" stopTime="605.756">
    Mr. Lawrence S. Robbins 
    --I... well, again, I think the interest of the State is greater, but the question that I was intending to answer is whether a court could say that notwithstanding Rules 28(b) on foreign depositions and Rule 30(b)(7) on telephonic depositions, I'm just not... the judge would be saying in all civil forfeiture actions I'm not going to consider those--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="605.756" stopTime="618.322">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well, supposing the district court said, I don't require all civil forfeiture defendants to come to Las Vegas, but I'm going to require you to come to Las Vegas, because I'm exercising my discretion and that's the way I choose to exercise it.
speaker="lawrence_s_robbins" startTime="618.322" stopTime="640.148">
    Mr. Lawrence S. Robbins 
    --I think it is possible that if circumstances warranted that and the judge, you know, gave reasons that satisfy a reviewing court that this was an appropriate exercise of discretion that might be done, but then the further question, if I might, as to whether the violation of that order gives... justifies the sanction, the dispositive sanction of dismissal--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="640.148" stopTime="643.360">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    You sound as though your client might be planning to violate such an order.

    Mr. Lawrence S. Robbins 
    --No. 
    [Laughter] 
    And the question, of course, has not been presented, since he's obeyed every order in the civil case that's been pressed on him, and this district judge, unlike the hypothetical district judge that the question presupposes, has ordered foreign depositions in the case of Karen Degen, my client's wife.
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="666.745" stopTime="693.285">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    In your... I take it for pure purposes we could consider this as a case in which the defendant is happy to send his lawyers, he's happy to comply with every order. 
    What he'd like to do is send in one piece of paper, which piece of paper would be absolutely conclusive in his favor, and the judge says, I'm sorry, I won't look at the paper. 
    Since you're not here, you lose, period.

    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    Yes. 
    Since you're not here in the other case, you lose. 
    Now, we're used to doing that in an appeal where, after sentencing, for example, the defendant runs away, and you concede we can do that there.

    --No question.

    Mr. Lawrence S. Robbins 
    --Well, I draw exactly the line that this Court has drawn in that exact... in those very cases. 
    The line... and it cuts across several factors that distinguish the facts of this case from that line of cases. 
    In the first place, Justice Breyer, those are cases in which there is no underlying constitutional right that's been abrogated. 
    There's no--
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="741.098" stopTime="750.254">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    When I say, what line are you drawing, after all, there are a lot of intermediate cases. 
    He runs away before sentencing. 
    Can the judge then sentence him?
speaker="lawrence_s_robbins" startTime="750.254" stopTime="754.278">
    Mr. Lawrence S. Robbins 
    --I believe that the answer to that is yes. 
    That's exactly what--
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="754.278" stopTime="763.124">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    If, in fact, the judge wants to levy a fine, and he wants to produce one piece of paper which will show he has no money, does the judge have to look at that piece of paper?
speaker="lawrence_s_robbins" startTime="763.124" stopTime="770.259">
    Mr. Lawrence S. Robbins 
    --Well, again, these are cases in which the sanction is being imposed in the very proceeding in which the--

    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    No, I'm asking you for your... I mean, you're absolutely right that's where I'm driving. 
    What I want to see is what's your line. 
    You agree, I take it, the judge doesn't have to look at the piece of paper when he ran away before appeal. 
    The judge doesn't have to look at the piece of paper when he runs away before he's being fined at sentencing. 
    But you're saying the judge does have to look at the piece of paper when it's a forfeiture of property, and what's the distinction?
speaker="lawrence_s_robbins" startTime="794.090" stopTime="831.045">
    Mr. Lawrence S. Robbins 
    --Well, one distinction is that it doesn't turn so much on the forfeiture of property as it does on the fact that there are two different proceedings, and in the forfeiture proceeding there is no showing that the fugitivity has any impact, has had any impact on the process of the forfeiture court, which is, of course, exactly the distinction that persuaded this court in Ortega-Rodriguez to draw the line where it did. 
    We're insisting on exactly the same line and, indeed, the use of the disentitlement doctrine in this setting in my view is vastly more dramatic.

    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Mr. Robbins, may I ask you a question?

    Well--

    Mr. Lawrence S. Robbins

    Mr. Lawrence S. Robbins

    Mr. Lawrence S. Robbins 
    --And the inquiry would... and the inquiry would still be, has the fugitivity in case one affected the proceedings in case two, and my general answer is that if the answer is no, it doesn't meet Ortega-Rodriguez, it is nothing like any disentitlement case this Court has ever approved, it serves none of the purposes... none of the purposes... that this Court identified in Ortega-Rodriguez. 
    What the Government wants in order to sustain this forfeiture is for the Court to completely reformulate the doctrine of fugitive disentitlement so that it no longer matters whether the claimant has a dispositive motion that doesn't even require his presence, or even his testimony, so that it doesn't even matter if the Government has probable cause, so that it doesn't even matter whether there's venue in this court, so that the only thing that matters is that he hasn't shown up to face parallel criminal charges.

    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Mr. Robbins, in answer to Justice Scalia's question about the special or general appearance, you indicated that that was right that a State could say, either you stay out and forfeit whatever we have, or you come in for all purposes, but my understanding is that on the Federal side if the property is in the custody of the court, you could make a limited appearance and say, I'm coming in for purposes of defending my property, but nothing else that I own is going to be subject to the court's authority. 
    I thought that's... on the Federal side, that has been the Federal practice, whatever the Texas rule may be.

speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="985.325" stopTime="991.692">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Well, that's what a limited appearance is. 
    I'm there, I'm fighting out the case, but the only thing that's going to be subject to the judgment is the property.
speaker="lawrence_s_robbins" startTime="991.692" stopTime="1008.615">
    Mr. Lawrence S. Robbins 
    --Correct, which is, of course, the only thing that can be subject to the forfeiture judgment. 
    The forfeiture court has not seized jurisdiction over Mr. Degen for purposes of imposing, you know, a dispositive sanction on him other than in the course of the litigation were he to violate a court order.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="1008.615" stopTime="1029.992">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    And I guess the actual parallel in the State civil case anyway would not be whether you subject yourself to general counterclaims or whatnot that are relevant to that suit, but rather, I guess the parallel would be a State that says if you make even a special appearance in one case you are liable to being sued in separate cases. 
    I don't know any state that does that.
speaker="lawrence_s_robbins" startTime="1029.992" stopTime="1072.400">
    Mr. Lawrence S. Robbins 
    Well, exactly, and actually this is actually to me a more dramatic example of that for the following reason. 
    Mr. Degen has been sanctioned, indeed dispositively sanctioned, not because of something he did in the criminal case, but for his failure to come to the United States, an act over which the court in the criminal case lacks jurisdiction. 
    In a sense, this is the use of an inherent power to sanction someone in case one because of something that he failed to do outside the courtroom in case two, and I'd like to suggest, with all due respect, that there is no authority certainly in any of this Court's cases for this kind of a use of an inherent power of a court.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="1072.400" stopTime="1085.823">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    Could the judge decline to give the usual weight and credit to the sworn affidavit because of the defendant's absence? 
    He'd say, I have this paper in front of me, but number 1, this man's a fugitive. 
    I'm going to discount this.
speaker="lawrence_s_robbins" startTime="1085.823" stopTime="1095.897">
    Mr. Lawrence S. Robbins 
    I think the answer, Justice Kennedy, is that there... is that it's possible the court could do that, saying, look, I didn't get to test his demeanor--
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="1095.897" stopTime="1097.960">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    It's not only possible, is it permissible?
speaker="lawrence_s_robbins" startTime="1097.960" stopTime="1128.910">
    Mr. Lawrence S. Robbins 
    --I think it is permissible, and after all, it's important to bear in mind Mr. Degen bears the burden of proof. 
    His not showing up has consequences for him, too. 
    Just as this Court pointed out in Societe Internationale, there are consequences for the litigant that doesn't appear, but one of them is not that you dispositively sanction him, take his property, give him no day in court, for the reason that in a separate case over which the judge has no jurisdiction in the first place, he hasn't shown up.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="1128.910" stopTime="1149.126">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Maybe it isn't that separate a case. 
    I mean, certainly that's what the Government is going to argue in these cases. 
    It would be quite different if it were a totally unrelated piece of civil litigation that you're talking about, but this is, in fact, simply a piece of civil litigation that has a lot to do with the criminal case. 
    Why can't we consider them effectively joined?
speaker="lawrence_s_robbins" startTime="1149.126" stopTime="1171.923">
    Mr. Lawrence S. Robbins 
    I don't think so, any more than the court was inclined to consider the two stages of Ortega-Rodriguez the same case. 
    There, after all, you had a prosecution followed by an appeal, and yet the Court concluded that because there was no impact on the appellate proceedings of the same exact case, you couldn't apply the disentitlement doctrine in that way.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="1171.923" stopTime="1185.603">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Well, but that had to do with the fact that the appellate proceedings did not relate to the same court, that they didn't have to do with an offense to the dignity of the same court, and therefore couldn't be within the inherent powers of that court.
speaker="lawrence_s_robbins" startTime="1185.603" stopTime="1185.791">

    Well--

    But here it is the same court.
speaker="lawrence_s_robbins" startTime="1186.802" stopTime="1203.773">
    Mr. Lawrence S. Robbins 
    --Well, it is the same court, but it's the same court with respect to a different case, and the inquiry, I thought, in Ortega-Rodriguez is whether the appellate process... that was certainly one of the factors. 
    Has the appellate process been disturbed, or... and--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="1203.773" stopTime="1206.985">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Because it was only the appellate process that was the business of that court.
speaker="lawrence_s_robbins" startTime="1206.985" stopTime="1209.058">
    Mr. Lawrence S. Robbins 
    --I understand, but I think--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="1209.058" stopTime="1213.480">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    It had to do with the identity of courts rather than the absolute identity of lawsuits.
speaker="lawrence_s_robbins" startTime="1213.480" stopTime="1295.365">
    Mr. Lawrence S. Robbins 
    --I understand, but I think it remains the case that Federal courts... even if it happens to be the same judge, I do not understand any of this Court's cases to permit the sanctioning of a litigant who happens to be before the same judge in another case, even if it's related cases. 
    They have some facts in common. 
    Nevertheless, I understand no authority, and I'm aware of no authority, the Government cites no authority for the proposition that the judge, no matter how similar the underlying cause of action may be, that a sanction can be imposed in case one because of case two, particularly, let me add, for conduct that is not unlawful in any way. 
    It bears mention that although Mr. Degen's failure to come to the United States is doubtless frustrating to the United States Attorney in Reno, Nevada, to the Department of Justice, and to Judge Reed sitting in Reno, Nevada, neither of the political branches, neither Congress nor the executive branch, have chosen to proscribe it in any way. 
    It doesn't... it isn't extraditable. 
    It isn't punishable. 
    It's not against the law. 
    It violates no positive law, and yet there is a district judge in Reno, Nevada who, following circuit court precedent, and I must say, precedent in various other circuits as well, has dispositively sanctioned someone, taken all his property without giving him his day in court.

   Argument of Miguel A. Estrada
speaker="miguel_a_estrada" startTime="1426.863" stopTime="1473.325">
    Mr. Miguel A. Estrada 
    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    It is undisputed that this civil forfeiture action is directly related to a criminal case that is pending in the same district courthouse against Degen, and that Degen refused to appear to stand trial on the criminal charges. 
    For two reasons, the court of appeals correctly held that a claimant in Degen's situation may be disentitled from contesting the civil forfeiture action. 
    First and foremost a civil claimant's participation in the civil forfeiture action fundamentally threatens the integrity of the criminal case. 
    Second, the claimant's--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1473.325" stopTime="1478.819">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    You say the defendant's participation in the civil forfeiture threatens the criminal case?
speaker="miguel_a_estrada" startTime="1478.819" stopTime="1524.300">
    Mr. Miguel A. Estrada 
    --Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, and that is, in fact, our principal argument here. 
    Our argument starts from the premise that courts always have had the inherent authority to protect against the abuse of their processes by a litigant, and that is precisely what the rule at issue here does. 
    If a civil claimant is allowed to participate in a civil forfeiture action while at the same time he refuses to stand trial on a criminal case that is based on the identical event, he may then use the very broad civil discovery rules that... to circumvent the very well settled and strict restrictions on criminal discovery.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1524.300" stopTime="1530.023">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    But couldn't that be dealt with by a judge administering the civil discovery rules?
speaker="miguel_a_estrada" startTime="1530.023" stopTime="1562.945">
    Mr. Miguel A. Estrada 
    That is not true, Mr. Chief Justice, with respect, and in order to understand why, it is useful to note why it is that we have limited criminal discovery in our society. 
    Those rules limiting strictly criminal discovery exist because long experience has taught Congress and the courts that early disclosure of the Government's case in a criminal prosecution often leads to contrived defense testimony--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1562.945" stopTime="1570.932">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    But Mr. Estrada, wouldn't that be possible even if he appeared in the criminal case, that he could use civil discovery in the forfeiture case to find out the same information?
speaker="miguel_a_estrada" startTime="1570.932" stopTime="1592.637">
    Mr. Miguel A. Estrada 
    --That is not so, Mr. Justice Stevens, for the following reason. 
    Congress has recognized precisely the danger that we're pointing to in this case, and in section 20... and section 881(i) of title 21 has given the Government the right to go to the district court and get a stay of the civil forfeiture action pending the conclusion of the criminal case.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1592.637" stopTime="1594.169">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Well, why couldn't they have done that in this case?
speaker="miguel_a_estrada" startTime="1594.169" stopTime="1614.261">
    Mr. Miguel A. Estrada 
    Well, I take it that if we had done that in this case, Mr. Justice Stevens, the net... the result would have been that we couldn't get any judgment in the civil forfeiture action because the criminal case can't start while Mr. Degen is in Switzerland.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="1614.261" stopTime="1618.137">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    So it boils down to a question of money. 
    It's not the dignity of the court, you want the money.
speaker="miguel_a_estrada" startTime="1618.137" stopTime="1622.528">
    Mr. Miguel A. Estrada 
    Well, no. 
    We want our statutory rights under the forfeiture statute--
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="1622.528" stopTime="1624.030">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    Which is to get the money.
speaker="miguel_a_estrada" startTime="1624.030" stopTime="1648.107">
    Mr. Miguel A. Estrada 
    --Which is to get the money without having to compromise the integrity of the criminal process, and since we are not at fault for the fact that he's in Switzerland, we think that it is a reasonable exercise of the court's authority to have a very simple procedural rule in the civil case that says that if you want to file a claim in the civil case you should come and face the related criminal charges.

speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="1663.697" stopTime="1678.209">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    All right, and presumably the Government could stay the civil forfeiture and put a hold, in effect, on any transfer of title the property. 
    The property will be secure. 
    So what has the Government lost?
speaker="miguel_a_estrada" startTime="1678.209" stopTime="1689.270">
    Mr. Miguel A. Estrada 
    Well, the Government has lost its right to the property. 
    Under the forfeiture laws we have made a prima facie showing which on its face entitles us to the property outright.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="1689.270" stopTime="1708.264">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Well, it seems to me that the... it isn't as though the Congress hasn't addressed this problem. 
    It has, and it has given you a remedy. 
    The remedy is to stay the civil action until the criminal action is completed, and you say that remedy is inadequate. 
    Well, maybe go back to Congress and get an additional remedy for this kind of a case.
speaker="miguel_a_estrada" startTime="1708.264" stopTime="1745.573">
    Mr. Miguel A. Estrada 
    There are two points in answer to that question, Justice Scalia. 
    Congress has not addressed the problem that we are faced with here. 
    It has not dealt with how to deal with someone who is a fugitive in a foreign country, so that there's no negative implication that that is an exclusive remedy. 
    The second point, which I think is more important, is that the fact that Congress has dealt with an aspect of the issues that come up with cases when cases are related does not mean that the court ceases to have a very strong interest in keeping parties from abusing its processes, and that's what is at issue here.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1745.573" stopTime="1748.737">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well, there's no finding here, Mr. Estrada, that the petitioner is a fugitive.
speaker="miguel_a_estrada" startTime="1748.737" stopTime="1768.057">
    Mr. Miguel A. Estrada 
    Well, yes, there is, Mr. Chief Justice. 
    We have... at page 18a of the petitioner's appendix there is a finding by the district judge that he is a fugitive, and at page 5a--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1768.057" stopTime="1771.289">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Whereabouts on page... you're talking about the white--
speaker="miguel_a_estrada" startTime="1771.289" stopTime="1795.408">
    Mr. Miguel A. Estrada 
    --Yes. 
    It's page 18a, and it is the last full paragraph. 
    It says, the Ninth Circuit has given us the following definition of who is a fugitive, and the court goes on to say, in this case Brian knows he is wanted by the police but refuses to submit to arrest, even though he professes his innocence. 
    Thus, we conclude that Brian Degen is a fugitive.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1795.408" stopTime="1798.008">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    --In that sense of the word, I take it.
speaker="miguel_a_estrada" startTime="1798.008" stopTime="1837.800">
    Mr. Miguel A. Estrada 
    Right, in that sense of the word, and that is the sense of the word that is relevant to the application of the sanction at issue here. 
    I think it bears emphasis from our point of view that we are not here supporting the notion that the sanction being imposed is an exercise of the power of the court in the criminal case. 
    We are not saying, for example, that he has a legal duty that is enforceable in the criminal case if the case were standing alone. 
    What we are saying is that it is a proper use of the court's authority to manage the civil case to guard against the possibility that he will use the processes in the civil case to undermine public policies that have been reflected--

    --in the discovery rule.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="1838.739" stopTime="1876.137">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    --If he does, why not handle it at that stage instead of saying you... you're at total default. 
    We are predicting what's going to happen if we were to allow you to come in and defend, and Mr. Estrada, one striking difference between this and Molinaro, where the fugitive entitlement doctrine started, there the defendant is away and he says, aha, if I'm vindicated on appeal, I'll come home, but if they're going to affirm my conviction... so there was no way to enforce the court's judgment. 
    Here, all the property is arrested. 
    It's in the court's control, so he can't get his hands on any of that property.
speaker="miguel_a_estrada" startTime="1876.137" stopTime="1943.166">
    Mr. Miguel A. Estrada 
    Well, there are two different points being raised by your question, as I understand it, Justice Ginsburg. 
    One is why can't we wait, and the other one is, we have control over the property, so there is no question as to the enforceability of the judgment. 
    Let me take the first one first, which is that... and in answering that one, it is important to recognizes that we are claiming two distinct interests in the civil forfeiture action for supporting this rule. 
    One, of course, is the fact that he has shown to the court that he intends to play games with the court and maybe their answer is let's wait and see if he does it some more, but even... even accepting that that would be an acceptable answer, it is not an acceptable answer to the more fundamental problem that we are identifying, which is that by getting discovery and allowing... and being allowed to litigate the civil forfeiture action, he is circumventing the criminal discovery rules. 
    Those rules reflect a very strong public policy that cannot be dealt with on a case-by-case basis.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="1943.166" stopTime="1976.072">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    But Mr. Estrada, suppose the defendant says, I don't want to face a total forfeiture, and I realize this argument you're making. 
    I would rather have some defense than none, so if the district court wants to issue any kind of protective orders so that I won't get premature... a pre-vision of the criminal case, so be it, but at least give me some chance to defend. 
    The Government, in order to effect its interest in not having more disclosure than in the criminal case doesn't have to say, you can't come in at all. 
    It can say--
speaker="miguel_a_estrada" startTime="1976.072" stopTime="1976.392">
    Mr. Miguel A. Estrada 
    I don't--
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="1976.392" stopTime="1977.334">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    --Yes.
speaker="miguel_a_estrada" startTime="1977.334" stopTime="2016.648">
    Mr. Miguel A. Estrada 
    --I mean, let me make two points in response to that question. 
    The first one is that I think that it is not right because it is possible that he could say that all he intends to do in the action is to call the following six witnesses who will testify that in fact all property came from an inheritance or from some other source of income, and we may well know that that is not true because all of our evidence in the criminal case shows where the property comes from. 
    So all that is doing is pushing the problem one step further, because he will then put us to the choice either of compromising the criminal case or--
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="2016.648" stopTime="2023.584">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Are you saying there are no circumstances in which he could defend that would not involve disclosing the Government's case?
speaker="miguel_a_estrada" startTime="2023.584" stopTime="2038.343">
    Mr. Miguel A. Estrada 
    --No, I am not saying that. 
    What I am saying is there are enough circumstances in the class of cases to warrant the adoption of a general rule while recognizing that the rule can have exceptions for specific cases being, in its nature, discretionary.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="2038.343" stopTime="2071.656">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    Well, why in the example that you just gave does that example support you? 
    Why, in the case in which the Government knows because of its criminal evidence the property came from some other source than inheritance, couldn't the Government simply go to the court and say, we have evidence to rebut? 
    We will make a good faith offer of proof without disclosing the evidence itself, and therefore you in fact ought to stay the proceeding so that we don't have to disclose our case. 
    I suppose your answer is, well, we want the money, but--

    --But the fact is, in each instance what it comes down to is not your incapacity to defend your own position, and not your incapacity, in effect, to meet the evidentiary position that you feel is unfairly being foisted upon you, but rather, it comes down in every instance to the fact that you want the property now rather than the property at some later time when the two proceedings could be dealt with in an orderly fashion. 
    So it seems to me that it all boils down to kind of a time-money argument.

    Mr. Miguel A. Estrada 
    Well, it boils down to the fact that under the act of Congress that we have at issue here, we have a right to the money, and that there is no foreseeable time in the future at which the two proceedings can be dealt with in an orderly fashion.

    Mr. Miguel A. Estrada 
    And that is true both in the criminal case and in the civil case, and I think it leads me to a further point that I wanted to make in response to Justice Souter, which is that we can readily concede for purposes of this case that there is no legally enforceable duty to show up in the criminal case that flows from the criminal case itself. 
    That does not mean that his failure to show up in the criminal case has a positive value to our society that we should strive to accommodate in framing rules for the orderly conduct of the civil litigation.

    Mr. Miguel A. Estrada 
    --No, I said that it is not significant for our case in this case to show that he has a legal duty that flows from the criminal case, but what is at issue here is whether the court in the orderly process of the civil case may have a rule to protect the civil case processes from being misused in the criminal case, and it is equally true, for example, that there is no legal duty to... let's say, for example--

    Other than by this... by using the civil procedure to do so. 
    If you can't compel him to stand trial on the criminal case, you haven't lost anything by proving and winning your civil case. 
    You still get the same property, but you had to prove it instead of using this sanction to get it, and you end up with the property but no criminal judgment, and the reason you can't get a criminal judgment is you don't have authority to compel him to come from Switzerland to the United States.

    He's not getting any discovery.

    Mr. Miguel A. Estrada 
    --Because we can make a prima facie showing by a verified complaint in an affidavit that shows probable cause, which under the forfeiture laws then shifts to him the burden of proving a lawful source for the funds, but it is not our view that we can come into the court without making a prima facie showing under the forfeiture laws and get a judgment.

    Justice David H. Souter 
    You answered a question about that before, and I'm not sure that I understood your answer. 
    Justice Stevens alluded to the problem a second ago. 
    Let's assume that he tries to get criminal discovery. 
    Why isn't it perfectly open to the Government in that event to say, don't give him the discovery, because if you do you will be providing discovery in fact in a criminal case to which he is not entitled, a case in which he will not appear, and for that reason, court, use your discretionary authority not to allow discovery. 
    Why can the Government not be protected that way?
speaker="miguel_a_estrada" startTime="2462.347" stopTime="2483.733">
    Mr. Miguel A. Estrada 
    Because, as I think I indicated earlier, that only pushes the problem one further step. 
    He will then come in and put whatever evidence he thinks he has, and in effect put us to the choice of disclosing our case to meet his evidence, or giving up on the forfeiture case, and as I was going to--
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="2483.733" stopTime="2497.348">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    So it's not a discovery issue then. 
    As you say, it just pushes it further. 
    You want to put in a minimal case. 
    You want him to know as little as possible consistent with your capacity to... in effect, to justify the forfeiture.

    We simply don't want to have to put on a comprehensive case, because in doing so we might provide some advantage to him for use in the later criminal case if it is later tried.

    Mr. Miguel A. Estrada

    Justice David H. Souter 
    Well, you're not endangering it. 
    You're endangering it in the sense that you would be disclosing more of your case than any rule of criminal discovery requires you to disclose.

speaker="miguel_a_estrada" startTime="2563.956" stopTime="2598.220">
    Mr. Miguel A. Estrada 
    --Yes, but what I also mean is that the reason for the rules on criminal discovery is that what often happens when we have it is that we have obstruction of justice and witness intimidation and contrived testimony, and that the judgment of the rules being as strict as they are, and they do reflect a public policy, is that the danger of that happening cannot effectively be controlled on a case-by-case basis. 
    I mean, we cannot take a wait-and-see attitude to see whether someone will attempt obstruction of justice because often the first indication that we will see is the contrived defense at trial followed immediately by an unwarranted acquittal.

    Mr. Miguel A. Estrada 
    --No. 
    I don't think so. 
    From our point of view the case really does involve the very narrow question of the power of the civil court to make sure that someone will not misuse it to gain an unfair tactical advantage. 
    And it is, as the district court framed it, a limited rule, and as the court of appeals recognized, a rule that allows for the exercise of discretion in specific cases, this not being one of them, because Mr. Degen waived any right to discretionary claims in the court of appeals, but it is not in any sense the type of extreme rule that Mr. Robbins has indicated we have.

    Mr. Miguel A. Estrada 
    --I understand the point of your question, and I would say that I suppose that is a form of a compromise that has as much grounding in the court's inherent authority as the more easily manageable rule that we have here, and since we are not the people at fault, and since by statute we are also entitled to the principal, it seems to me that as between the choice of two reasonable rules that accomplish a purpose, we're entitled to that one that gives us our statutory rights.

   Rebuttal of Lawrence S. Robbins
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="3110.352" stopTime="3113.954">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Thank you, Mr. Estrada. 
    Mr. Robbins, you have 5 minutes remaining.
speaker="lawrence_s_robbins" startTime="3113.954" stopTime="3204.954">
    Mr. Lawrence S. Robbins 
    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 
    This case is a very good illustration for why what this Court called the blunderbuss of dismissal is inappropriate as way of solving the problem that the Government is concerned about. 
    If disentitlement is to be taken at the threshold in order to protect against the possibility that there may be discovery in the civil case that provides a window into the criminal case, district courts can do that, and they do it of every day of every week by applying Rule 26(c) of the Rules of Civil Procedure, and issue protective orders. 
    This case, however, is different, because in this case the Federal prosecutor said to the district judge in an argument, made and reproduced on page 6a of the appendix to our brief, that there was no need to stay the forfeiture proceedings one minute longer in deference to the criminal case precisely because the cat was out of the bag in the criminal case. 
    There was no need to protect against the disclosure of witnesses, no need to protect against the disclosure of any evidence, and in response to the prosecutor's argument, the district court said, fine, you can go ahead and take all the depositions you want... Karen Degen, the petitioner's wife, and in an order that's reflected in the minutes of the February 1, 1993 transcript. 
    In short, this district judge concluded that no protective order was appropriate precisely because there was nothing to protect against.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="3204.954" stopTime="3206.757">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Is Karen Degen in the United States?
speaker="lawrence_s_robbins" startTime="3206.757" stopTime="3210.550">
    Mr. Lawrence S. Robbins 
    She is not. 
    She is living with her husband and their children in Switzerland.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="3210.550" stopTime="3215.202">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    So a discovery order was entered against her but not against Brian?
speaker="lawrence_s_robbins" startTime="3215.202" stopTime="3249.934">
    Mr. Lawrence S. Robbins 
    Discovery was issued in her favor, but not in Mr. Degen's favor, that's correct, Your Honor. 
    The point here is the wonderful irony about this argument is it bears no... you know, no coherent relationship to the facts of this case, and precisely to avoid a problem that the prosecutor said was not presented, Mr. Degen is to be disentitled, dispositively sanctioned for conduct that the court has no jurisdiction even in the action in which he is a putative fugitive, to sanction him for. 
    Let me also get rid of one other red herring.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="3249.934" stopTime="3257.060">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    In that same exchange, what is the argument when you said, I would point out, Your Honor, that Mr. Degen is no longer a claimant in this case, he's merely a witness?
speaker="lawrence_s_robbins" startTime="3257.060" stopTime="3321.375">
    Mr. Lawrence S. Robbins 
    Well, he'd already been disentitled, so what they were saying is, you know, don't pay any attention to the need to get his evidence because you've already knocked him out of the box, and to the extent that Karen is relying on his unavailability as a reason to extend the summary judgment proceedings, you shouldn't credit his... the need for his testimony. 
    The other red herring I'd like to deal with is the argument that the Government has already established its right to this money. 
    What it has established is its right to the seizure of this money and this property through a prima facie showing, to be sure, but if I can be indulged one other Latinism, it's also completely ex parte. 
    They went into court with a complaint and an affidavit that, you know, to my mind barely shows probable cause to believe any of the property was in fact used in violation of 881(a)(6) and (a)(7), and now they have the money, and now, as the law permits, it's our burden to come into court and overcome that prima facie showing. 
    It's our day in court, the first and only one we get.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="3321.375" stopTime="3335.644">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Mr. Robbins, what they did, what they showed is comparable to what a plaintiff would have to show in the case of an ordinary civil default judgment, right, make an ex parte showing of the entitlement to money damages.
speaker="lawrence_s_robbins" startTime="3335.644" stopTime="3375.953">
    Mr. Lawrence S. Robbins 
    Well, that's correct. 
    They've gone in and shown that they have at least that much of a claim, but the law then permits Mr. Degen to come in and overcome it, and you know, if his unavailability prejudices his capacity to make that showing, then he's so much the worse for it. 
    We're not asking that he be treated any better. 
    We're asking that he be given the rights and opportunities that the law prescribes, and he's being... you know, he's been foreclosed those opportunities by virtue of conduct that is not against the law, period, and it seems to me that courts can't do it and we--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="3375.953" stopTime="3377.486">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Not against the law, you mean not criminal?

    Mr. Lawrence S. Robbins
