Commissioner v. Lundy

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    We'll hear argument now in Number 94-1785, Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Robert F. Lundy. 
    Mr. Jones.
speaker="kent_l_jones" startTime="9.728" stopTime="98.005">
    Mr. Kent L. Jones 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court-- 
    The tax court is an Article I court of limited jurisdiction. 
    This case concerns the limitations on the jurisdiction of the tax court to award refunds. 
    When a taxpayer commences a suit in tax court to review an asserted deficiency, the court may then also determine whether an overpayment was made. 
    Section 6512(b)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, however, provides three detailed jurisdictional limits on the amount of the refund that the court may award. 
    Under section 6512(b)(3)(A), the court may award amounts paid after the notice of deficiency is issued. 
    Under 6512(b)(3)(C), the court may award amounts for which a claim for refund was made before the notice of deficiency was issued, but when, as in this case, there was neither subsequent payment or a prior refund claim, section 6512(b)(3)(B), which this case concerns, limit the jurisdiction of the tax court to award amounts that would be refundable under 6511(b)(2) if on the date the notice of deficiency was issued a claim for refund had been filed. 
    In turn, 6511(b)(2) allows a refund of amounts paid within 3 years prior to the claim for refund only if the claim for refund was made within 3 years from the time of the taxpayer's return, but when--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="98.005" stopTime="137.662">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Mr. Jones, in subsection (B) that you're referring to it says that no credit or refund will be allowed unless it was paid within the period which would be applicable under 6511(b)(2)(C), or if on the date of the mailing of the notice of deficiency a claim had been filed, whether or not filed. 
    Now, that language is just incomprehensible. 
    What does that parenthetical mean? 
    Does it mean if it isn't filed we can deem it to have been filed?
speaker="kent_l_jones" startTime="137.662" stopTime="153.272">
    Mr. Kent L. Jones 
    --That's... what it means is that, whether or not a claim for refund had actually been filed, the court is to apply these statutes as if a claim for refund was filed on that date. 
    That was... no one has doubted, I think, that that is the meaning of that provision.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="153.272" stopTime="155.453">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    And is that what should be done in this case?
speaker="kent_l_jones" startTime="155.453" stopTime="176.908">
    Mr. Kent L. Jones 
    Yes. 
    In this case, because the taxpayer had failed to file a return before the date of the notice of deficiency, 6512(b)(3)(B) operates, and what it operates to do is to require the court to apply 6511(b)(2) as if a claim for refund was filed on the date the notice of deficiency was issued.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="176.908" stopTime="183.432">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    Why does it say, whether or not, since subsection (C) covers the case in which it had been filed before that?
speaker="kent_l_jones" startTime="183.432" stopTime="195.898">
    Mr. Kent L. Jones 
    Yes, it... subsection (C) applies if a claim had been filed before that date. 
    Subsection (B) says you are to assume a claim is filed on that date, whether or not one had been filed.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="195.898" stopTime="200.312">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    Why didn't it just say that it wasn't, or if it wasn't?
speaker="kent_l_jones" startTime="200.312" stopTime="220.318">
    Mr. Kent L. Jones 
    I think one of the reasons it might put it that way is because if you read the rest of subsection (B) it goes on to say, a claim based upon whatever grounds the tax court determined an overpayment was made. 
    Now, what that refers to is a basic distinction between district court and tax court jurisdiction.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="220.318" stopTime="220.899">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    Oh, I see.
speaker="kent_l_jones" startTime="220.899" stopTime="244.684">
    Mr. Kent L. Jones 
    The district court only has jurisdiction to consider a judicial claim that is based upon precisely the administrative claim. 
    If there's any material variance between the district court claim and the administrative claim, the district court claim has no jurisdiction, but in the tax court there is no requirement of an administrative claim. 
    The court may award a refund based upon any ground for which it determines an overpayment.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="244.684" stopTime="248.117">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    Well, in that respect the taxpayer is better off to be in the tax court.

    Mr. Kent L. Jones 
    It... the taxpayer has a broader refund argument in the tax courts. 
    He has whatever argument he can come up with, but the price that is paid is that the amount of refund that can be awarded is subject to the very specific and detailed jurisdiction provisions--

    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Mr. Jones, can I ask you a question about (B), the same... the one that is at issue here? 
    It says, if a refund claim had been filed. 
    Now, if on that date... I guess it was September 26, 1990... before receiving a notice of deficiency the taxpayer had decided that he ought to file a refund claim because he realized that they had overwithheld, what document would he have then filed? 
    Would it not have been a return?

speaker="kent_l_jones" startTime="297.269" stopTime="305.694">
    Mr. Kent L. Jones 
    I think the right answer to your question is that courts have routinely held that refund claims can be submitted informally, that they don't have to be on a return--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="305.694" stopTime="311.209">
    Justice John Paul Stevens

    Mr. Kent L. Jones 
    --There are... there isn't an Internal Revenue form that, of course, is exactly what you've described, a return that includes a claim for refund. 
    There's also--

    Justice John Paul Stevens

    Mr. Kent L. Jones 
    --It would be the amended return form.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="328.661" stopTime="332.023">

    It is an amended return.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="332.902" stopTime="338.856">

    But there's no way, is there, to file a claim for refund at that date without also filing a return?

    Mr. Kent L. Jones 
    No, sir, I'm sorry, I must disagree. 
    The courts have routinely held that you can file a refund claim informally.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="345.351" stopTime="354.299">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    But there's no form. 
    There's no regular IRS form that the average taxpayer who has overwithheld can go to the office and say, would you give me the refund form. 
    What would he get?
speaker="kent_l_jones" startTime="354.299" stopTime="361.095">
    Mr. Kent L. Jones 
    There's no IRS form, but there is... but you don't have to use an IRS form to make a refund claim, according to the courts.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="361.095" stopTime="369.800">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    How is the average taxpayer to know that? 
    If he went to the IRS, what would they tell him to do? 
    If he went to a lawyer, what would he tell him to do?
speaker="kent_l_jones" startTime="369.800" stopTime="372.462">
    Mr. Kent L. Jones 
    If they went to the IRS, the IRS would probably ask him to file a return--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="372.462" stopTime="373.330">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Correct.
speaker="kent_l_jones" startTime="373.330" stopTime="374.472">
    Mr. Kent L. Jones 
    --which this taxpayer hasn't done.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="374.472" stopTime="419.482">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    And that raises a question, Mr. Jones. 
    As I understand it, this provision, as you read it, favors the taxpayer when the taxpayer has filed a return. 
    We get into this problem with the taxpayer who hasn't filed a return, and at some point in the exchanges between the IRS and the Service, the taxpayer was told, file your return soon, and if you don't, then we'll prepare a substitute return for you. 
    Can you explain how that would have played out if the Service, instead of sending the notice of deficiency, had first filed a substituted return for the taxpayer?
speaker="kent_l_jones" startTime="419.482" stopTime="444.048">
    Mr. Kent L. Jones 
    A substituted return is... it's lingo, if you'll pardon the expression. 
    It is not a return. 
    A substituted return is simply an internal document that the IRS prepares to set forth their calculations based upon what they think the taxpayer's liability is. 
    The return that 6511 refers to is specifically the return filed by the taxpayer.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="444.048" stopTime="446.831">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    So that substituted return would not have counted--
speaker="kent_l_jones" startTime="446.831" stopTime="447.969">
    Mr. Kent L. Jones 
    No. 
    It would--
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="447.969" stopTime="448.910">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    --to serve as the return.
speaker="kent_l_jones" startTime="448.910" stopTime="450.651">
    Mr. Kent L. Jones 
    --It cannot be the taxpayer's return.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="450.651" stopTime="454.032">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    Does the taxpayer get a copy of the substituted return?
speaker="kent_l_jones" startTime="454.032" stopTime="469.664">
    Mr. Kent L. Jones 
    It isn't sent to the taxpayer. 
    What's sent to the taxpayer is the notice of deficiency, which includes the calculations. 
    Whether the taxpayer can see the underlying basis for it, I don't have any doubt that they can see it, but I don't believe that it's routinely sent.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="469.664" stopTime="475.320">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    But they don't attach the substituted return to the notice of deficiency. 
    They have the same calculation, but not the form.
speaker="kent_l_jones" startTime="475.320" stopTime="525.151">
    Mr. Kent L. Jones 
    I can't say definitively. 
    I'm sorry, Justice Kennedy, I don't know, but what I am confident about is that this thing that we call a substituted return is not a return of the taxpayer, it is simply... for example, a taxpayer, we might have a W-2. 
    It might show some information about income and withholdings. 
    That might have been all that we know. 
    For example, that might have been all that we know in this case, and based upon that limited knowledge, we "prepare a substituted return", but what we're really doing is filling in the blanks as best we know. 
    The definition of a return in the code I think is best described in 6611(h), which talks about a return in processable form. 
    A return... it must be a document filed by the taxpayer that purports to be a return, and that contains all of the information from which the taxpayer's entire liability--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="525.151" stopTime="527.645">

    Mr. Kent L. Jones 
    --Well, Justice--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="544.515" stopTime="547.827">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    --and you've just told me the only way you can file a claim is by filing a return--

    Mr. Kent L. Jones 
    I did not say that. 
    The courts have held quite clearly that you can file a claim informally, and you don't have to use a return, and let me be specific, a claim for refund--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="557.893" stopTime="561.085">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    You can file a claim informally without first having filed a return?

    --Absolutely. 
    A claim for refund--

    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    What case gives us an example of that?

    Mr. Kent L. Jones 
    --In our brief, in our reply brief we cite the Salzman Treatise, which elaborates a lot of cases that deal with this subject.

    Mr. Kent L. Jones 
    --Yes.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="580.890" stopTime="596.960">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    As you read the statute, he must have filed a return first. 
    He could have filed a formal, informal, all the claims in the world, and on your reading of the statute it would not have made any difference. 
    What he had to file, what he didn't file before the notice of a deficiency was not a claim, but a return.
speaker="kent_l_jones" startTime="596.960" stopTime="613.431">
    Mr. Kent L. Jones 
    That's absolutely correct. 
    The statute makes the distinction between taxpayers who have been delinquent in filing returns and taxpayers who have not, and by its very words it provides an abbreviated period of recovery for taxpayers who have not filed a return before the notice of deficiency was issued.

    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Mr. Jones, other than this, rather unusual circumstances of this case, is there any other time that the 2-year look back period would apply under this subsection?
speaker="kent_l_jones" startTime="629.103" stopTime="633.146">
    Mr. Kent L. Jones 
    Well, it applies whenever--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="633.146" stopTime="638.401">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Does it apply only to circumstances of this case, and in no other instance?

    Mr. Kent L. Jones 
    --It applies routinely when the taxpayer has not filed a return before the notice of deficiency is issued. 
    That would be the... you only get the 3-year look back if you have filed the return before the claim for refund arises.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="651.989" stopTime="673.114">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Now, has the IRS been totally consistent in its position and interpretation of this statute? 
    It seems rather inconsistent with the position the Government took in the Miller case in the Ninth Circuit, and with the Revenue Ruling 76-511.
speaker="kent_l_jones" startTime="673.114" stopTime="793.618">
    Mr. Kent L. Jones 
    There's a long answer to that question which I'd like to give, and I'd like to try to give it in a logical order. 
    The first part of the answer to the question is, has the Government been consistent about tax court cases, and the answer to that is plainly yes. 
    Since 1957, in Revenue Ruling 57-354, which is quoted at page 48 of the petition appendix, the Commissioner has stated that the status of a claim for refund must be determined as of the time it is filed and that if, as the time it is filed, no return has then been filed, you only get a 2-year look back period. 
    The tax court has consistently reached the same conclusion under its own jurisdiction since the early 1970's. 
    The suggestion that our position in this case is newly minted simply ignores this historical record, and moreover, factually, the suggestion of respondent that we would routinely pay refund claims in this context is demonstrably incorrect, as the tax court found, because 6512(a) of the Internal Revenue Code says that if a notice of deficiency is issued, and the taxpayer files a claim in tax court, then no refund or credit shall be allowed except as the tax court determines, so in tax court cases the Commissioner has no administrative authority to award a refund. 
    We are deprived of it by statute. 
    Now, the question that you're really, I think, focusing on is, have we been the same about district court cases and tax court cases, and I think... there's a short answer to that and a long explanation. 
    The short answer is, it is not perfectly clear whether in each and every situation the refund periods are supposed to be the same in district court and tax court cases, and there is no basis for assuming that Congress intended them to always be the same, and I'd like to explain the latter part first. 
    There's no reason to think Congress necessarily intended the same periods always to apply in district court and tax court.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="793.618" stopTime="833.835">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Mr. Jones, may I derail you just for a moment to go back to where you were in the tax court? 
    One might wonder whether the Commissioner was always consistent in the tax court because part of the history of this case that initially this taxpayer, that the answer in the... to the petition in the tax court didn't raise a time bar, and in fact the taxpayer got a letter that said, you're going to get a refund check, and then it was over a year after the initial answer that the amendment was made to assert the time bar.
speaker="kent_l_jones" startTime="833.835" stopTime="850.368">
    Mr. Kent L. Jones 
    I believe that you've accurately described the facts, Justice Ginsburg, but I also believe that the Commissioner raising the defense in this case is something that he has... she, in this case, has consistently done since the issue has been presented. 
    The fact that there may have been a delay in it's assertion in this case--
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="850.368" stopTime="862.164">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    It's not just a delay. 
    There just wasn't... there was an answer. 
    The time bar was obvious from the start, and yet over a year went by without this being asserted.
speaker="kent_l_jones" startTime="862.164" stopTime="912.897">
    Mr. Kent L. Jones 
    --It is... I think it's fair to say that it's relatively common for defenses to be amended, for answers to be amended, and I would hope the Court wouldn't draw any inference from that in this case. 
    There's really no reason to. 
    I mean, as I emphasized just a point ago, we don't have authority to make a refund in a tax court case unless the tax court has determined an overpayment, so we have to... when we think a refund might be appropriate, we have to submit an agreed order that falls within the jurisdiction of the tax court. 
    It may have been... and I'm speculating here. 
    It may have been that in preparing a draft of some kind of agreed order to submit in this case, that it then occurred to counsel, oh, wait a minute, this case isn't within the tax court's jurisdiction. 
    It may be that that's the mechanics that led to this being asserted at the time that it was. 
    Now--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="912.897" stopTime="929.350">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Mr. Jones, can I just follow up, because I didn't think I got a complete answer to my question. 
    I asked if there were cases involving claims for refunds such as the notations... and you referred on pages 14 and 15 of your reply brief... in which those informal claims had been made without there having previously been filed any return at all.
speaker="kent_l_jones" startTime="929.350" stopTime="931.791">
    Mr. Kent L. Jones 
    --And I--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="931.791" stopTime="934.122">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    And which of those do you think fits that category?
speaker="kent_l_jones" startTime="934.122" stopTime="939.827">
    Mr. Kent L. Jones 
    --I'm sorry, Justice Stevens, I cannot tell you, as I stand here, which of those cases might involve those facts, but I would like--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="939.827" stopTime="940.986">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Do you think any of them involve that?
speaker="kent_l_jones" startTime="940.986" stopTime="957.499">
    Mr. Kent L. Jones 
    --I would think they might well, and I would be speculating, but let me point out, because you seem... this is something important to you, and I want to emphasize it. 
    Congress wrote this statute. 
    Congress wrote it anticipating that there would be situations where claims for refund were filed at a time when no return had been filed.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="957.499" stopTime="958.478">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    How do you know that?
speaker="kent_l_jones" startTime="958.478" stopTime="970.665">
    Mr. Kent L. Jones 
    I know that because section 6511 (a) provides a limited look back for situations where the claim for refund is filed at a time that no return had been filed.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="970.665" stopTime="971.266">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Correct.
speaker="kent_l_jones" startTime="971.266" stopTime="981.324">
    Mr. Kent L. Jones 
    So Congress anticipated that claims for refund could, in fact, be filed where no return had been filed, and provided for a 2-year look back period and, in fact, that's this case.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="981.324" stopTime="983.566">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    That would be that no return had previously been filed.
speaker="kent_l_jones" startTime="983.566" stopTime="984.307">
    Mr. Kent L. Jones 
    Absolutely.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="984.307" stopTime="991.479">

    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Except that you can't give me an example in adjudicated cases of one having been filed without the other. 
    That is, of the claim for refund having been filed without the return, which seems to me makes it very reasonable to assume that when Congress used the term, claim, they used it to apply to the document on which the claim is normally made.
speaker="kent_l_jones" startTime="1019.690" stopTime="1026.675">
    Mr. Kent L. Jones

speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1026.675" stopTime="1034.710">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Oh, I don't suggest that at all. 
    I'm just suggesting that you cannot file a claim for refund without also having either previously or simultaneously filed a return.
speaker="kent_l_jones" startTime="1034.710" stopTime="1035.621">
    Mr. Kent L. Jones 
    --Well, Justice--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1035.621" stopTime="1037.251">
    Justice John Paul Stevens

speaker="kent_l_jones" startTime="1037.251" stopTime="1082.912">
    Mr. Kent L. Jones 
    --Well, this is such a case. 
    Congress imputed the claim for refund, but setting that aside, Justice Stevens, frankly you would have to write out almost all of 6511(a) to support that view, because first of all the second clause of the first sentence of 6511(a) said that, and if the claim for refund is filed at a time when no return has been filed, then you get a 2-year look back period. 
    So to suggest... I mean, you can't suggest that Congress didn't think that a claim for refund and a return were independent documents that could be filed in different orders. 
    Congress clearly contemplated that, and clearly also provided an abbreviated period, an abbreviated look back period for the taxpayer who fails to file the return before he files the refund claim.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="1082.912" stopTime="1103.325">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Mr. Jones, can I ask something about the Government's theory of why, when the return is later filed, after the deficiency has been assessed, you do not thereupon get the benefit of the 3-year period? 
    I think I may disagree with you as to the reason, though perhaps not as to the result.
speaker="kent_l_jones" startTime="1103.325" stopTime="1114.982">
    Mr. Kent L. Jones 
    Well, the reason that we see is that section 6512(b)(3) provides a detailed set of answers to these questions. 
    It says that you can base a refund on a refund claim filed before--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1114.982" stopTime="1117.684">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Where are you reading from, Mr. Jones?
speaker="kent_l_jones" startTime="1117.684" stopTime="1185.969">
    Mr. Kent L. Jones 
    --6512(b)(3)(C) says that you can award a refund based upon a prior refund claim filed before a notice of deficiency. 
    6512(b)(3)(B) says you can award a refund based upon a claim assumed to arise on the date of the notice of deficiency. 
    There is no basis for engrafting onto this statute an additional refund jurisdiction for subsequent refund claims, which is what the court of appeals theories would require. 
    You'd have to be adding a clause to the statute, and you'd be adding a clause to the statute that would contradict the clauses that would already exist. 
    Now, this Court has said on several occasions that the jurisdictional limitations on refunds are limited waivers of sovereign immunity that must be strictly applied and strictly adhered to by the judiciary. 
    In this case, the court of appeals acknowledged that it was not applying the statute as Congress wrote it. 
    The court said, we will not use the imputed refund claim under 6512(b)(3)(B) to decide whether a 2-year or 3-year look back period applies, but that is precisely what Congress told them to do.

    Mr. Kent L. Jones 
    Yes, Your Honor.
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="1193.224" stopTime="1206.442">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    And then you said, it's been consistent in the tax court, and then you said, well, in the court of claims for the refunds, it seems to be a little different, and I was wondering if you'd said everything you wanted to say there, or if you wanted to say a little more--
speaker="kent_l_jones" startTime="1206.442" stopTime="1272.588">
    Mr. Kent L. Jones 
    I'd like to try to briefly describe that, because time is limited. 
    There is no reason to think they have to be the same. 
    The jurisdiction of the tax court and the district court have always been different. 
    The district court had a common law jurisdiction to award refunds against the collector, had a statutory authority, ultimately had a statutory authority to award claims against the United States long before the tax court came into existence, and when the tax court came into existence, it was only allowed as an administrative wing in the Treasury Department to review the notice of deficiency. 
    It couldn't even talk about overpayments until 1928, and it wasn't until 1988, just 7 years ago, that the tax court was allowed to enter an order requiring that a refund be made. 
    Moreover, as I've already described, the jurisdiction of the courts is different, even as we stand here, because of the variance of the claim doctrine, and so there's no reason to assume, ab initio, that in establishing or in merging these disparate jurisdictions, that... and in using the terminology that is peculiar to tax court litigation in doing so, that you're always going to reach the same result.

    Now we're talking about that key middle year between 2 years and 3, and if you go into the tax court, on your reading of it, it's a race. 
    If they get the deficiency notice out before you file your return, you only get the 2-year look back, so you've had it.

    I'm just trying to find out what happens. 
    In the tax court, during that key year... nothing's happened, 2 years have gone by. 
    Now, during the next year, if the notice of deficiency comes out, forget it. 
    If, before the notice of deficiency comes out, the taxpayer wakes up and files his return, then you get back the 3 years. 
    That's correct, isn't it. 
    But in the court of claims, if the notice of deficiency comes out, the taxpayer can wake up then and file the return, and then he'll get the 3-year look back.

    We don't know, in reading it, whether it's based upon a textual analysis or upon administrative grace.

    Mr. Glenn P. Schwartz 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court-- 
    Justice Stevens identified the core issue in the interpretation of 6512(b)(3)(B). 
    The key question is, what is meant by the word claim in that statute? 
    Under the interpretation of the IRS, the claim is a defective claim, because if Congress intended, and it must have, that that claim be valid, then it would have to be on a Federal income tax return for the following reasons. 
    A return is required to be filed under 6011, but 6011 does not define what a return is, nor do the regulations, but the case law has--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1681.937" stopTime="1688.049">

speaker="glenn_p_schwartz" startTime="1706.380" stopTime="1738.632">
    Mr. Glenn P. Schwartz 
    Your Honor, a claim and a return can be different documents. 
    For example, for taxes other than an income tax, Form 843 is used, the claim for refund form. 
    Prior 1976, a Form 843 claim could be used in lieu of an amended return, but whereas here an original return has not been filed, a valid claim for refund, and Congress must have meant that that claim be valid, must be on a Federal income tax return for these reasons.

    Justice David H. Souter 
    Before you give me the reasons, would you respond to this (b)(3)(C) deals specifically with the case in which a return has been filed.

    Either you misunderstood him, or--
speaker="glenn_p_schwartz" startTime="1885.711" stopTime="1960.510">
    Mr. Glenn P. Schwartz 
    Perhaps I misunderstood him, but the core issue with respect to this statute is what is meant by the word claim. 
    Claim has to mean return. 
    Claim, again, is not defined in the statute or in the regs, but the regs under 6011 do say that you should make returns in accordance with the applicable Treasury regulations. 
    Now, a claim... a return has been defined under case law as meaning any document which contains sufficient information to allow the IRS to determine tax liability. 
    Now, the IRS in its construction of this section has ignored... in every brief it submitted to the tax court, the Fourth Circuit and this Court, the last phrase of the statute treats it as surplusage, stating the grounds upon which the tax court finds that there's an overpayment. 
    In fact, the IRS went so far as to excise it from its quotation of the statute on page 5 of its reply brief, but this language is important, because if the claim referred to in 6512(b)(3)(B) states the grounds upon which the tax court finds that there is an overpayment, that would constitute the same information that would be on a return, because the--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="1960.510" stopTime="1965.863">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    --The Government's position is that (b)(3)(B) doesn't refer to any real claim.

    Mr. Glenn P. Schwartz 
    --Well, it's... even if it's a hypothetical claim, it has to be something, and it has to be a valid claim. 
    A valid claim has to be a return. 
    The statutory language requires that it state the grounds upon which the tax court finds there's a overpayment. 
    In this very case, the IRS employed the taxpayer's return to determine that there was, in fact, an overpayment.

    Mr. Glenn P. Schwartz 
    --Your Honor, our view of 6512(b)(3)(B) is that it's basically... if the statute of limitations was open to the taxpayer on the date that the notice was mailed, then it's open to him in the tax court, that he... the tax court can grant him a refund, so if the notice was mailed after 3 years from the due date, then under no circumstances could the taxpayer recover.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="2060.696" stopTime="2069.963">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Well, I think everybody agrees with that. 
    So the statute of limitations wouldn't have run, on your theory, but the bar to recovery of money would have.
speaker="glenn_p_schwartz" startTime="2069.963" stopTime="2114.462">
    Mr. Glenn P. Schwartz 
    That's correct. 
    The statute of limitations on filing, in theory, as Justice Breyer suggested, that goes on forever. 
    Treasury Reg 6402-3(a)(5) says that a return showing an overpayment constitutes a claim for refund, and it's deemed filed on the same day, so a return filed several years after the due date would be a timely claim, but the limitation on amount would limit the taxpayer to the amount paid in the 3 years preceding the filing of the return, so there's no danger of stale claims, and there's no danger of a stale claim here. 
    The second reason that this--
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="2114.462" stopTime="2131.404">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    On that... in that same vein, then can you tell us under what circumstances the 2-year look back would apply when the Commissioner... when the Commissioner sends a notice of deficiency? 
    The Commissioner sends a notice of deficiency. 
    When would the 2-year look back ever come into play?
speaker="glenn_p_schwartz" startTime="2131.404" stopTime="2178.394">
    Mr. Glenn P. Schwartz 
    --The 2-year look back would come into play the same way it would come into play if we were not dealing with the tax court, and that is where the 2 years from the date the tax is paid provides for a longer period of limitation than 3 years from the date the return was filed, and that could come up in connection with an audit. 
    For example, if a taxpayer, 1990 tax year, his due date is April 15, 1991. 
    That's the date that the taxes are paid, and pursuant to an audit 2 years later he makes an additional payment. 
    He has 2 years to claim a refund for the taxes paid pursuant to the audit, but only 3 years to claim the taxes that were paid on the due date.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="2178.394" stopTime="2184.807">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    So your view of the 2-year look back is, it can only work to the taxpayers advantage--
speaker="glenn_p_schwartz" startTime="2184.807" stopTime="2185.848">
    Mr. Glenn P. Schwartz 
    That is correct.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="2185.848" stopTime="2193.015">

speaker="glenn_p_schwartz" startTime="2193.015" stopTime="2199.978">
    Mr. Glenn P. Schwartz 
    That is correct. 
    In the case of a return required tax, the only 2-year rule that applies is the first 2-year rule.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="2199.978" stopTime="2233.420">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    How do you square your notion that claim means a valid claim, that is, a claim accompanying a return, with the language of 6511(a), which says a claim for credit or refund of an overpayment in respect to which the taxpayer is required to file a return shall be filed within 3 years, blah, blah, blah, and then at the end of that sentence, or if no return was filed by the taxpayer within 2 years from the time the tax was paid. 
    That clearly contemplates a claim being made without a return having been filed.
speaker="glenn_p_schwartz" startTime="2233.420" stopTime="2241.225">
    Mr. Glenn P. Schwartz 
    Your Honor, there are several reasons why that second 2-year rule does not apply to a taxpayer who's required to file a return.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="2241.225" stopTime="2254.023">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    I'm not... I don't want to know when the 2-year rule... I want to know how it squares with your notion that when the statute says claim, it means a valid claim, that is, a claim accompanied by a tax return. 
    That's your principle.
speaker="glenn_p_schwartz" startTime="2254.023" stopTime="2261.457">
    Mr. Glenn P. Schwartz 
    My principle is that a valid claim for refund where no original return has been filed must be on a tax return.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="2261.457" stopTime="2269.144">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Must be on a tax return. 
    Well, that doesn't square with the language of 6511(a). 
    It clearly contemplates a claim where no return has been filed.
speaker="glenn_p_schwartz" startTime="2269.144" stopTime="2278.010">
    Mr. Glenn P. Schwartz 
    That's for nonreturn required taxes. 
    That second 2-year rule is for nonreturn required taxes, such as transferee liability.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="2278.010" stopTime="2286.864">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    It doesn't read that way. 
    Claim for credit of any tax in respect of which tax, the taxpayer is required to file a return. 
    Where are you reading from? 
    6511(a).
speaker="glenn_p_schwartz" startTime="2286.864" stopTime="2475.651">
    Mr. Glenn P. Schwartz 
    Your Honor, may I explain? 
    The... there are two or three reasons why that second 2-year rule where no return has been filed does not apply to Mr. Lundy. 
    The first is, if... the first 3-year rule, 3 years from the date the return is filed, or 2 years from the date the tax is paid, whichever is later, covers all possible situations, because if you assume that an original claim could be filed that was not a return, it would be covered by that first 2-year rule, making the second 2-year rule surplusage. 
    The second reason is, if the... if it was possible to file a claim for refund that... where no original return has been filed, it would be limited by the first 2-year rule, because the first 2-year rule would provide a longer period of time than the 3-year rule, so that the second 2-year rule would be surplusage. 
    The second reason is, if, as the IRS contends, that the first sentence of 6511(a) applies to return required taxes, including the second 2-year rule, or if no return was required, and the second sentence of 6511(a) applies to stamps, then there's no rule to recover nonreturn required taxes, so that second 2-year rule, which is surplusage for a return required tax, must apply to nonreturn required tax. 
    Third, as originally enacted in 1954, the statute provided for a limitation period of 3 years from the due date. 
    It was an absolute minimum 3-year period, so that that second 2-year rule, or if no... 2 years from the date the tax was paid if no return was filed, could not possibly apply to a return required tax. 
    In fact, the tax court in this very case stated that under the '54 code as originally enacted, the taxpayer would have been entitled to a refund even under the deemed claim theory because it was filed within 3 years from the due date. 
    Now, Congress in 1958 extended that period of time. 
    The amendment in 1958 was to improve the taxpayer's position to provide that he would be able... because the Commissioner could assess a deficiency within 3 years from the date the return was filed, but the taxpayer was limited to 3 years from the date the return was due, so as the tax court acknowledged that he could have recovered under the language as originally enacted, the tax court judge acknowledged that the purpose of the '58 amendment was to extend the time for filing, and yet what the tax court said was, somehow Congress did not perhaps analyze all the effects of this language. 
    And Your Honor, I submit that this legislative history is convincing evidence that a taxpayer is entitled to a minimum of 3 years.

    I put that so you can explain to me how you could. 
    One way is, you get the word claim to mean refund, you see.

    That's all... that doesn't mean, if you had been there, then something else would have happened. 
    It's a limitation. 
    It means how much you're going to get. 
    So we use the word if sometimes like that.
speaker="glenn_p_schwartz" startTime="2638.301" stopTime="2744.061">
    Mr. Glenn P. Schwartz 
    In this context, Your Honor... the problem has arisen because Congress took the short cut of incorporating the general statute of limitations under 6512, and the triggering points, the triggering points for the limitation periods in 6511 are couched in terms of claim for refund, because an administrative claim for refund is a prerequisite to the granting of an administrative refund or the jurisdiction of the district court. 
    So it... the statute's not self executing when it's incorporated by reference into 6512, and so there had to be a reference to the word claim to trigger the limitation periods in 6511, because the taxpayer would not have filed a claim for refund in the tax court because that's not a prerequisite, and this has always been interpreted as a reference date for application of the limitation periods in the tax court, so that if the statute was open to the taxpayer on that date, if he could have filed a timely claim for refund on the date that the notice was mailed, he's entitled to a refund in the tax court. 
    That's the understanding of Congress. 
    On page 22 of our brief, we quote from a 60... 1963 Senate report, and it says, since the 1954 enactment, moreover, the Internal Revenue Service has in practice interpreted the law as permitting the refund of amounts where valid claims have been timely filed, as well as where those claims could have been filed on the date of the mailing of the notice of deficiency.

    You have the facts of this very case, where once the taxpayer dropped his petition in the mail box, under the IRS theory of this case, he was barred by the statute of limitations, and yet the IRS answered the complaint, they dealt with him for a year, they made him submit 160-some pages of documents--

    But in answer to the question about, couldn't you revive a stale claim by paying a little bit years down the road, don't you... aren't you still bound by the look back period that you can't go more than 3 years... you can't get back money that you paid more than 3 years ago?

    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    In other words, doesn't the look... the very purpose of the look back provision to stop that kind of thing where you, many years down the road, pay a small piece, a small overpayment, claim that back, and then... and use that as leverage to go 7 years back to get the rest of the overpayment? 
    Isn't that the very purpose of having these look back provisions?
speaker="glenn_p_schwartz" startTime="3019.391" stopTime="3070.816">
    Mr. Glenn P. Schwartz 
    Yes, but the look back rule is the teeth of the limitation provisions, and prevents stale claims. 
    But Your Honor, this case is very much like Williams, because the very purpose of the tax court is to assist taxpayers like Mr. Lundy to allow him to contest an asserted deficiency without first... without prepaying, and yet, once he filed his petition in the tax court, he was in a position where he had no realistic alternative, and no remedy, because his only choice once that notice of deficiency is mailed to him is either to prepay the tax and file a suit in the district court, or go to the tax court, where he forfeits his refund, so that remedy--

    Well, that remains to be seen. 
    I mean-- 
    [Laughter] 
    But the mere notion that this is unthinkable doesn't strike me as self evident. 
    I mean, we begin with a taxpayer who didn't file a tax return when he should have.
speaker="glenn_p_schwartz" startTime="3099.877" stopTime="3122.834">
    Mr. Glenn P. Schwartz 
    That's correct, Your Honor, but if we assume that Mr. Lundy had a neighbor in the same position who overpaid his '87 income taxes, the return was due on April 15, '88, and he also was late filing, but he never got a notice of deficiency, he filed on the same date, on December 28, more than 2 but less than 3 years, he'd get his refund. 
    Mr. Lundy didn't. 
    Or--

    Maybe they ought to say, 2 years if you don't file your return, 3 years if you do.

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    --How would Congress have said what the Government says it said more clearly than what is here? 
    You apparently... I gather from an earlier comment you apparently think it would have been, the problem is that (3)(B), what was it, 6512(b)(3)(B) does not say, as if on the date of mailing, but just if on the date of the mailing, but it couldn't possibly say as if. 
    Within the period which would be applicable, as if on the date of the mailing? 
    No. 
    I mean, the way to say what the Government says it says is precisely what is written here, within the period that would be applicable under section 6511 if on the date, not as if. 
    I wouldn't put an as in there. 
    They would be totally incoherent.

    I--

    Unknown Speaker 
    It seems perfectly clear to me.
speaker="glenn_p_schwartz" startTime="3276.163" stopTime="3340.586">
    Mr. Glenn P. Schwartz 
    --My time is limited. 
    I'd like to take the opportunity to persuade you that the claim should be considered a return. 
    There are two other reasons that claim in this context must be considered to be return. 
    Treasury Reg 6502-2(b) requires that a claim contain the detailed statement of the grounds upon which the claim is based. 
    That, again, is the same information that if on a document submitted to the IRS under case law and under a '74 revenue ruling would constitute a return and finally, and most important, Regulation 6402-3(a)(1) requires, whereas here no original return has been filed, that the taxpayer must file his claim on a return. 
    So the IRS is asking you to ignore its own regulations and treat the claim referred to in 6512(b)(3)(B) as a defective claim, and I think that's an impermissible construction. 
    I think you have to attribute to Congress an intent that that claim is a valid claim.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="3340.586" stopTime="3354.005">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Whereas I guess you take the position that in 6511(a) the term claim can include valid claims and invalid claims that have to be corrected to become valid, and the 2-year rule would apply to the invalid claim.

    Mr. Glenn P. Schwartz 
    --Well, I think the key thing here is that a claim filed on a return, that a return showing an overpayment, is the equivalent of a claim under the Treasury regs... own regulations.

   Rebuttal of Kent L. Jones
speaker="kent_l_jones" startTime="3371.492" stopTime="3455.124">
    Mr. Kent L. Jones 
    Thank you. 
    The principal contention that Respondent raises here was not addressed by the court of appeals and has not been accepted by any court. 
    That contention is that a claim for refund and a return are synonymous concepts. 
    Congress plainly didn't intend that. 
    They use the terms quite distinctly and separately. 
    They make the periods of limitation and the refund periods depend upon which came first and how long apart they were, so to reach the conclusion that respondent seeks would literally make nonsense out of 6511(a), 6511(b), and 6512(b). 
    No court has supported that assertion. 
    The suggestion that somehow this problem would be cured if the respondent could have filed a timely claim is simply off the point. 
    A taxpayer can always file a claim for refund at any time, but that doesn't alter the limitations that apply when the refund claim is filed. 
    For example, in this case, if they had filed... if respondent had filed a refund claim on the date the notice of deficiency was issued, he would have been limited to the 2-year refund period, because as of that date he had filed no return. 
    Respondent simply ignores what's the principal dilemma that he faces. 
    That is, that he was delinquent in filing his return, and Congress made that delinquency relevant in determining the refund jurisdiction of the tax court.

    --Justice Scalia, I certainly would. 
    I have to admit, I don't know. 
    I have looked at 6512(a). 
    It doesn't say. 
    It simply says that when you have this tax court case, no other court can decide whether there's a refund, and neither can the Commissioner. 
    It doesn't say whether that case could be dismissed and a subsequent case filed. 
    It's possible the Commissioner has taken a position on that, so I'm reluctant to make an argument on it not knowing what position we may have taken. 
    Thank you very much.
