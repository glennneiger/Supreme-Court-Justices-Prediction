speaker="kent_l_jones" startTime="21.875" stopTime="149.792">
    Mr. Kent L. Jones 
    Well, I take comfort in the thought that we're all suffering together here. 
    This case presents two questions. 
    The first question is whether the tax imposed by section 4971 of the Internal Revenue Code is within the priority that Congress has established for excise taxes in section 507(a)(7)(E) of the Bankruptcy Code. 
    The second question is whether, if this tax is not entitled to that statutory priority, it may then be subordinated to the claims of general unsecured creditors under the principles of equitable subordination that we've been discussing. 
    I would like to briefly discuss the second question first. 
    The case that was just argued could be said to stand, or present the question of whether the principles of equitable subordination on grounds of fairness alone, would permit a court to deviate from what is known as the absolute priority rule. 
    That rule, as discussed by this Court in the Norwest Bank case, is that all claims of a higher priority have to be paid before any claim of a lower priority is paid. 
    In the case that was just argued, the higher priority was the first priority for postpetition tax penalty claims. 
    This case, the second question in this case, if it is reached, could be said to present the question of whether the principles of equitable subordination permit a court, again on grounds of fairness alone, to deviate from what is called the equality of distribution rule. 
    That rule, as discussed by this Court in the Begier case, is that all claims of the same rank must be paid pro rata, without discrimination among them. 
    Now, because, in our view, the principles of equitable subordination are the same in both contexts, and in the absence of creditor misconduct don't permit subordination either of claims of the same or of a different rank, the court of appeals erred in this case in subordinating the innocent claim of the United States. 
    Thus, if the court was right that the claim of the United States didn't have a statutory priority, it was wrong in then saying that the innocent claim of the United States could be subordinated to other general, unsecured claims. 
    That violates the principle of equality of distribution and it also--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="149.792" stopTime="156.715">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    So you're saying, in effect, even if you lose on the first question, you're entitled to some sort of relief on the second question?
speaker="kent_l_jones" startTime="156.715" stopTime="187.096">
    Mr. Kent L. Jones 
    --Yes. 
    The relief that we would be entitled to would be to be treated pro rata with other general unsecured claims, if we're not a priority claim. 
    Now, the first question in this case is whether we are a priority claim. 
    Section 4971 of the Internal Revenue Code was enacted in 1974 as part of ERISA. 
    It imposes a tax of 10 percent on underfunded pension plans. 
    Congress expressly designated and described this tax as an excise tax, and it--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="187.096" stopTime="193.641">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Well, do you agree that language doesn't always control, that something can be called a tax and, in fact, be a penalty?
speaker="kent_l_jones" startTime="193.641" stopTime="216.084">
    Mr. Kent L. Jones 
    --I agree that something can be called a tax that isn't, but there are two reasons why we think the designation of this tax as an excise tax is important, which I'll soon address, but I did want to make the point here that this tax does have the two features which are common to excise taxes, and by the way, excise taxes are probably the most common kind of tax there is.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="216.084" stopTime="221.717">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    This section deals not just with the Federal Government, but with all governmental entities.
speaker="kent_l_jones" startTime="221.717" stopTime="298.377">
    Mr. Kent L. Jones 
    That's right, any State, Federal, or local excise tax. 
    Subtitles B through E of the Internal Revenue Code are all excise taxes. 
    There's the estate taxes, employment taxes, miscellaneous excise taxes, alcohol and tobacco taxes... Congress has a lot of excise taxes, but the common feature, what you can see if you go through them, is there are two common features. 
    They're not universally present, but they're the common characteristics of excises, and those are that it is imposed upon a specific act or event, in this case the act of maintaining an underfunded pension plan, and second is that it's imposed of a portion of the value of that act or event, in this case a portion of the value of the underfunding. 
    Now, 4 years after this tax was enacted, Congress, in restructuring the Bankruptcy Code, enacted 507(a)(7)(E), which provides a specific, unqualified priority for any State, Federal, or local excise tax. 
    The court of appeals reasoned in this case that that priority could not reach this tax, because this tax was designed to enforce another law. 
    It was designed to deter the violation of another law, and the court regarded it as a penalty, and as a penalty the court concluded it wouldn't come within the priority for an excise tax.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="298.377" stopTime="301.119">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Because it was a nonpecuniary loss--
speaker="kent_l_jones" startTime="301.119" stopTime="330.450">
    Mr. Kent L. Jones 
    A nonpecuniary loss penalty, which simply means that it's a penalty that doesn't recover money that would otherwise be owed, I guess. 
    Now, whether you look at the text of the statute, or its structure, or its history, the reasoning of the court of appeals cannot be sustained. 
    The text, of course, which under Ron Pair is what we're supposed to look at, says unqualifiedly that any excise tax, State, Federal, or local, is entitled to this priority. 
    It doesn't contain any suggestion that an excise--

    Mr. Kent L. Jones 
    --that has a regulatory purpose is not.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="332.782" stopTime="349.362">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    --Mr. Jones, it does have one qualification, and that is, it uses the word transaction, rather than act or event, and I mean, just in common uses that implies something more, doesn't it, than the passage of the deadline without payment? 
    Would we normally describe that as a transaction?
speaker="kent_l_jones" startTime="349.362" stopTime="359.079">
    Mr. Kent L. Jones 
    The transaction language in that code is designed to key off the, if you will, statute of limitations that applies to excise tax claims. 
    Respondents agree--
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="359.079" stopTime="360.930">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    Does it use the word transaction?
speaker="kent_l_jones" startTime="360.930" stopTime="361.540">
    Mr. Kent L. Jones 
    --Does which?
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="361.540" stopTime="363.821">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    Does the statute of limitations?
speaker="kent_l_jones" startTime="363.821" stopTime="414.304">
    Mr. Kent L. Jones 
    No, I didn't... I was not being precise. 
    I don't mean to say a statute of limitations, but if you look at 507(a)(7)(A), (B), (C), (D), (E), all of which address various kinds of tax claims, each of them has a limitation as to the scope of a claim to fall within the priority. 
    For example, the language in (a)(7)(E), if I'm paraphrasing it properly, is that the tax has to be with respect to a transaction for which a report is due within 3 years of the filing of the petition. 
    The word transaction has a broad meaning, and couldn't be reasonably understood to be a narrow meaning. 
    For example, estate taxes are excise taxes. 
    What's the bargained for exchange if you think of transaction that way? 
    There's no bargained for exchange there. 
    The transaction language is the act--

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    How is that established?
speaker="kent_l_jones" startTime="421.800" stopTime="429.925">
    Mr. Kent L. Jones 
    Well, it's not addressed in the briefs, Your Honor, but I think it's... it's established in the case law and treatises.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="429.925" stopTime="431.295">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well, what cases?
speaker="kent_l_jones" startTime="431.295" stopTime="464.780">
    Mr. Kent L. Jones 
    I'm sorry, I'm not prepared... I don't have an answer to that question now. 
    I'm just speaking from, if you will, my general knowledge. 
    Excises are taxes that would include estate taxes, just as they include sales taxes. 
    They are at... this Court talked about the fact that excises, customs duties, and income taxes are really sort of the whole gamut, or as the Court said in the Steadman Machine case, the... all of the taxes appropriate to sovereignty, and you can track that through the way Congress--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="464.780" stopTime="468.611">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Are you saying that all taxes appropriate to sovereignty are excise taxes?
speaker="kent_l_jones" startTime="468.611" stopTime="488.316">
    Mr. Kent L. Jones 
    --No, sir. 
    I said that income, customs duties, and excises... the Court used the phrase, appropriate to sovereignty in the Steadman Machine case. 
    If you think about it, customs duties are in title 19, income taxes are in subtitle A of title 26, and as I said, subtitles B through E of title 26 are excises.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="488.316" stopTime="504.083">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    So your theory is that the Court said customs, income, and excise taxes, and they were covering the waterfront there, and therefore if something isn't a customs duty and isn't an income tax, it is by definition an excise tax?
speaker="kent_l_jones" startTime="504.083" stopTime="513.760">
    Mr. Kent L. Jones 
    I think that the point the Court was making was that these are broad and flexible terms. 
    I don't think the Court in the case that I referred to was trying to be specific in the way that you're suggesting.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="513.760" stopTime="522.687">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well, what if a State had structured its tax scheme differently than the Federal Government? 
    I mean, I take it we have to deal with State tax schemes here, too--
speaker="kent_l_jones" startTime="522.687" stopTime="522.947">
    Mr. Kent L. Jones 
    Yes.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="522.947" stopTime="529.512">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    --and the Federal Government doesn't get any bigger a break than the State does in trying to figure out whether it's an excise tax or not.
speaker="kent_l_jones" startTime="529.512" stopTime="545.831">
    Mr. Kent L. Jones 
    Well, I wouldn't say any bigger a break, but I do think that the Mansfield Tire court was probably right in saying that when Congress expressly designates something as an excise tax there's no reason to think it didn't intend to have its excises included within the priority that it adopted for excise taxes.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="545.831" stopTime="555.438">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well, does that really make much sense? 
    I mean, the same committees of Congress don't draft bankruptcy bills as draft tax bills.
speaker="kent_l_jones" startTime="555.438" stopTime="582.686">
    Mr. Kent L. Jones 
    It makes sense if you think about it from two perspectives. 
    It makes sense if you think about the fact that Congress is the one... I mean, if you're trying to decide what is the excise tax, the best evidence of that is... would be to go through the Internal Revenue Code and to see what Congress has done. 
    I mean, when I suggested that there are two common characteristics for excises, I think that was correct, and that's based on observation of what Congress has done. 
    Congress has probably enacted as many, if not more taxes than anybody.

speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="715.373" stopTime="717.814">

speaker="kent_l_jones" startTime="719.106" stopTime="751.886">
    Mr. Kent L. Jones 
    The United States has never pursued in an appellate court the question of the priority of the subsection (b) tax, and there are reasons to think that the treatment to be accorded to those taxes is different than the treatment to be accorded to the 10-percent priority. 
    There are two differences that I think can be addressed at this point. 
    There are others that may also exist. 
    There is, of course, the facial difference between a 10-percent tax that conforms to the, if you will, ordinary concept of an excise as a tax on the portion of the value, and a 100-percent tax, which is--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="751.886" stopTime="753.788">

    Which looks something like a penalty.

    Mr. Kent L. Jones 
    --Which would be, I suppose, a whopping big excise tax. 
    Whether Congress can enact a whopping big excise tax is something that I don't think that there's any reason to think it can't, but I think it's something we'd have to address if we ever argued that case.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="769.179" stopTime="774.151">

    Mr. Kent L. Jones 
    That's right, estate taxes can get very high. 
    Now, the other point that I think is a more problematic distinction between those two taxes--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="780.736" stopTime="783.178">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    More problematic than whopping big?

    Mr. Kent L. Jones 
    --Yes. 
    [Laughter] 
    More problematic even than whopping big is the fact that the (b) tax, unlike the (a) tax, and unlike, if you will, many other excise taxes in the Internal Revenue Code, is expressly subject to waiver by the Secretary of the Treasury on any grounds that he thinks is appropriate. 
    That's a... that kind of discretionary enforcement would raise a question about whether Congress has treated this as a tax.

    Mr. Kent L. Jones 
    It's very important, and it's the... in the words of the legislative history, which I think are useful guides, it says, if Congress has expressly treated it as an excise, or has... or if it's commonly understood to be one, and so the question that I'm noting about the (b) tax is that, well, it hasn't been expressly treated as an excise when it's subject to waiver on any grounds the Secretary considers proper.

    I'm not sure.

    No, it doesn't, and very few do.

    We don't think it's relevant, but I do want to point it out.

    I'm summarizing.

    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Right.

    Mr. Kent L. Jones 
    We're not suggesting that this is a question of interpreting the statute. 
    It's a question of understanding how Congress has treated this statute to determine whether it's an excise.

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Yes, but you're not willing to stand by the proposition, which sort of makes doubtful whether the proposition is correct... you're not willing to stand by the proposition that everything included within that title is an excise tax.

    I think everything--

    Mr. Kent L. Jones

speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="1087.587" stopTime="1118.617">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    No, but that begs the question. 
    It has not expressly treated it. 
    In the section itself, the closest to express treatment, as I understand your argument, is its placement in subsection D, which has an excise tax label, and therefore, if we use the placement in subsection D as the ground of decision, then we're going to pick up the (b) tax as well as the (a), and you don't want us, I take it, to be forced to decide on that ground. 
    If I'm wrong, if you say look, I'll take... I want the whole hog, and you should decide on the ground of that placement, then I want you to tell me.

    Mr. Kent L. Jones 
    --Congress has done more than just locating it in this section. 
    It's made it a fixed and determinate excise tax, and to understand why I'm emphasizing that, I want to point out that under the Bankruptcy Act the decision... our position in this case was endorsed by this Court in the case of United States v. New York.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="1136.520" stopTime="1158.943">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    No, but may I just interrupt you, because I want to get clear on one thing. 
    It's the same thing that Justice Scalia and Justice Stevens wants to get clear on. 
    Yes or no. 
    You should decide this case under a rule of decision that says, if it's placed under D, it's an excise tax, end of issue. 
    Is that the position that you take, or is it not the position that you take?
speaker="kent_l_jones" startTime="1158.943" stopTime="1163.706">
    Mr. Kent L. Jones 
    I have two answers to that. 
    One is, you make take that--

    Justice David H. Souter 
    No, it's yes or no. 
    You can only have one answer. 
    [Laughter]
speaker="kent_l_jones" startTime="1166.858" stopTime="1176.825">
    Mr. Kent L. Jones 
    --The Court could reach that decision. 
    I think that the Court could also have an analysis that also looked to the question of whether the treatment of the tax is--
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="1176.825" stopTime="1179.085">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    So I guess the answer is no.

    --an excise--
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="1179.325" stopTime="1196.627">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    I guess the answer is no. 
    But see, Mr. Jones, the court of appeals seemed to think it really is clearly labeled an excise tax, but they said, we apply a four part test from Cassidy or some earlier case, and you're saying don't apply a four part test, apply an act or event test. 
    You're just saying they applied the wrong test.

    Mr. Kent L. Jones 
    --And then they made it waivable.

    Mr. Kent L. Jones 
    Thank you. 
    In United States v. New York, the court addressed the same question that it has to address here. 
    It did it under the Bankruptcy Act. 
    The question in that case was whether an excise tax that is designed to enforce some other law is no longer an excise tax. 
    It's no longer qualified to the priority as a tax, it's a penalty, and what the Court said in United States v. New York is that the mere fact that a tax is designed to enforce some other, in this case State law doesn't make it, in the words of the Court, any the less a tax, doesn't remove it from the statutory priority. 
    If this case were being decided under the Bankruptcy Act, that analysis in United States v. New York would prevail here, because--
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="1279.053" stopTime="1280.002">

    That was a State tax.

    Mr. Kent L. Jones 
    --That was a Federal employment tax that was designed to enforce a State unemployment contribution law.

    Mr. Kent L. Jones 
    I believe the Federal employment taxes are in subtitle C, the immediately preceding section, which is also an excise tax. 
    The Court specifically said this excise tax does not lose its priority. 
    It's not any the less a tax because it's designed to do something else.

speaker="kent_l_jones" startTime="1361.376" stopTime="1417.795">
    Mr. Kent L. Jones 
    Yes, I agree, that would be some evidence. 
    If Congress... Congress as a general proposition doesn't allow the deduction of penalties, allows the deduction of ordinary necessary business expenses. 
    I don't know how the... I don't know what the treatment is here. 
    In Mansfield Tire, the Sixth Circuit made the point that many, if not most Federal excises have a punitive or regulatory purpose. 
    If Congress had intended to exclude all of its excises like excises on gambling, on green mail, on unregistered securities dealings, you would reasonably expect to see some evidence of that in the text or the legislative history. 
    But the text and the legislative history contain the unqualified statement that any excise, Federal, State, or local, that has been expressly treated or generally accepted as an excise is entitled to priority, and as the Court said in United States v. New York, the fact that this excise is designed to enforce a penalty doesn't make it any the less a tax.

    Now, the technical question on the next part of the case, assuming that for the sake of argument that we got there, under section 7 priorities, I would have decided that this was a penalty, right?

    All right. 
    So why in this section, in this Chapter 11 case didn't the bankruptcy judge just say, this is a penalty, therefore I put it in a different class. 
    I put it in a class which would be the class it would be in if this were a Chapter 7. 
    I put it in a class below unsecured creditors, and therefore I don't have to worry about equitable subordination or not, and since he could have just as easily done that, which would have come to the identical thing, he just used the wrong words to describe what he did, and therefore that issue drops out of the case.

    Mr. Steven Jack McCardell 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    The IRS claim to tax priority in this case rests on the single assumption identified in the questions of the last argument. 
    That is, that every exaction labeled a tax in section 4971, because of its placement under the heading, Miscellaneous Excise Taxes, is automatically and without further consideration entitled to the tax priority in bankruptcy. 
    The questioning in the last argument I think revealed that the 100-percent exaction imposed under sub (b) of section 4971 is indistinguishable from the exaction under sub (a) on the basis of its labels, and if the IRS can concede that the label alone does not control with regard to sub (b), that concedes the case, if label is the IRS' sole argument, which it must be in this case, because of the concessions that the IRS made in the lower court.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="1654.369" stopTime="1671.529">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Is there anything else that comes under sub (b) and therefore bears the label, Miscellaneous Excise Taxes, which you would assert is obviously not an excise tax, as you do the 100 percent, and as you do the 10 percent, for that matter?
speaker="steven_jack_mccardell" startTime="1671.529" stopTime="1679.074">
    Mr. Steven Jack McCardell 
    If I understand Your Honor's question, the only exaction under sub (b) is the 100 percent item designated as a tax.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="1679.074" stopTime="1690.503">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Whatever comes within that section of the code that bears the caption, Miscellaneous Excise Taxes. 
    Now, there are a lot of things embraced within that, are there not?

    Mr. Steven Jack McCardell 
    Yes, there are, Your Honor.

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    What else besides this 10 percent and 100 percent strikes you as obviously not an excise tax?
speaker="steven_jack_mccardell" startTime="1697.386" stopTime="1720.060">
    Mr. Steven Jack McCardell 
    Well, there are other tiered penalties. 
    For example, section 4941 tiered tax on self dealing. 
    It imposes a first tier penalty and a second tier penalty. 
    Both of them are designated as taxes. 
    Those are the exactions that the Fourth Circuit and the Fifth Circuit ruled under the Bankruptcy Act were not entitled to tax priority.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="1720.060" stopTime="1731.209">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Well, do you say that every exaction adopted under 26 U.S. Code section 4971, subtitle D, is a penalty, not a tax?
speaker="steven_jack_mccardell" startTime="1731.209" stopTime="1765.480">
    Mr. Steven Jack McCardell 
    We do, Your Honor, because both were asserted in this case. 
    The (a) provision which is before the Court today is in the amount of approximately $1.2 million, the (b) provision for about another $40 million, was in the amount emphasized... asserted in this case. 
    The reason the IRS must rely on its labels govern argument is that the IRS conceded in the lower court that it would not be able to sustain the position that these exactions are not penalties. 
    That concession is found at pages 48 and 49.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1765.480" stopTime="1773.525">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    To what extent are we bound by a concession like that? 
    We do not accept, for example, concessions on points of law as being conclusive, ordinarily.
speaker="steven_jack_mccardell" startTime="1773.525" stopTime="1791.447">
    Mr. Steven Jack McCardell 
    Your Honor, the IRS did not come forward with any evidence in the bankruptcy court to satisfy the court's traditional test for the tax priority in bankruptcy. 
    Having failed to meet its burden to prove its entitlement to the priority, I think the IRS is bound by that failure.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1791.447" stopTime="1796.720">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well, it's one thing to be bound by a failure to offer proof, another thing to be bound by a concession.
speaker="steven_jack_mccardell" startTime="1796.720" stopTime="1806.587">
    Mr. Steven Jack McCardell 
    And both occurred in this case. 
    The traditional test for tax priority requires that the exaction have the purpose of supporting the Government.

    Do you say that those aren't excise taxes?
speaker="steven_jack_mccardell" startTime="1823.298" stopTime="1829.652">
    Mr. Steven Jack McCardell 
    We do not, Your Honor. 
    The rule adopted by the--

    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor

speaker="steven_jack_mccardell" startTime="1838.178" stopTime="1852.716">
    Mr. Steven Jack McCardell 
    --There are, and in the cases of those taxes they have a mixed purpose, both regulatory and to raise revenue. 
    Section 4971 is distinct in that regard, in that it has only a function of coercing and punishing the failure to--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="1852.716" stopTime="1854.899">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Well, it raises revenue for Uncle Sam.
speaker="steven_jack_mccardell" startTime="1854.899" stopTime="1864.534">
    Mr. Steven Jack McCardell 
    --If it's ever paid, it certainly goes into the Treasury. 
    However, it's not used to fund pensions or to otherwise address the question of retiree claims. 
    Now--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="1864.534" stopTime="1892.133">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    But I think what-- 
    --Well, but we've never required that. 
    That would be constructing some other new-- 
    --What Justice O'Connor is suggesting is, how can we tell whether the purpose of... it's easy to say that this tax has a, you know, an encouraging or discouraging function. 
    How can we say that it isn't for the purpose of raising tax revenue? 
    I don't know how to figure out whether it is or isn't. 
    I know that it does raise tax revenue.
speaker="steven_jack_mccardell" startTime="1892.133" stopTime="1996.242">
    Mr. Steven Jack McCardell 
    --Certainly. 
    First, if I might address the end of Justice O'Connor's question, which I think addresses the question of what the Bankruptcy Code does with regard to penalty claims, subsection (G) of section 507(a)(7) the Court has before it today distinguishes between penalties that have a pecuniary loss, and penalties that are not based on a pecuniary loss. 
    Now, it's clear that if there could never be... if the simple fact that it's paid into the Treasury of the Government always made it a tax simply because the Government receives revenue, then there never could be such a thing as a nonpecuniary loss penalty, but (G) demonstrates that there is such a distinction, and that's why, in looking at section 4971, to answer Your Honor's question, the Court can look at objective characteristics of this tax that demonstrate that it does not satisfy the traditional test for taxes. 
    It was... first, the United States is not liable for the pensions that are guaranteed. 
    They are guaranteed by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, which operates on private funds. 
    The penalty, if paid, goes to the IRS, but not to the PBGC or to the plans or to the retirees. 
    If the section 4971 penalty is paid, the underlying obligation to fund the plan remains, and in that regard it's different from the responsible officer penalty addressed in the prior case, which can only be collected once. 
    This one is collected twice. 
    It says to the employer, you fund your pension plan, or if you don't you're still going to have to fund it, or the next year you're going to have to fund it at 110 percent, you have to pay 110 percent penalty, or the next year 220 percent, and so on.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="1996.242" stopTime="1997.932">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Well, it doesn't call it a penalty.
speaker="steven_jack_mccardell" startTime="1997.932" stopTime="1998.814">
    Mr. Steven Jack McCardell 
    That's correct.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="1998.814" stopTime="2003.145">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    I mean, you're calling it a penalty. 
    That's what we have to decide, and what's the test?
speaker="steven_jack_mccardell" startTime="2003.145" stopTime="2011.272">
    Mr. Steven Jack McCardell 
    The test, Your Honor, is whether it qualifies as a tax. 
    The Court has distinguished taxes from penalties by defining it--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="2011.272" stopTime="2014.303">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Well, yes. 
    What is the test for determining that?
speaker="steven_jack_mccardell" startTime="2014.303" stopTime="2029.792">
    Mr. Steven Jack McCardell 
    --The test is that stated in United States v. New York, that a tax is a pecuniary burden laid upon individuals or property for the purpose of supporting the Government, by whatever name it may be called. 
    That's the test.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="2029.792" stopTime="2047.165">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Mr. McCardell, I don't know why the issue isn't... forgetting these general tests about taxes and penalties, why isn't the issue simply whether it's a... whether you call it a tax or a penalty, it is imposed on a transaction occurring on a certain date. 
    If that is the test, do you win or lose?
speaker="steven_jack_mccardell" startTime="2047.165" stopTime="2060.313">
    Mr. Steven Jack McCardell 
    If the Court addresses the question of transaction, which we think it should, because that is encompassed within the question before the Court today, it's an element of qualifying for tax priority, the IRS loses. 
    There was no transaction.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="2060.313" stopTime="2080.315">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Well, they would say... I think Mr. Jones would say, well, the statute imposed an obligation to file... make a determination as of the end of the plan year and know exactly what the underfunding was, and I suppose the transaction might be described as making a determination with red figures in it... bing... and then you pay 10 percent of the red figure.

    Mr. Steven Jack McCardell 
    The IRS's proof of claim in this case identified when this tax arose, and that date was September 15, 1990, at the end of that day, when no payment was made... at midnight on September 15, 1990. 
    At 11:59 p.m. on that day, there was no tax.

    Mr. Steven Jack McCardell

    Your Honor, the end of the plan year was December 31, 1989, but ERISA allows the funding payments for that year to be made up until September 15 of the following year.

    Mr. Steven Jack McCardell 
    I'm not sure, Your Honor, but it's apparent from the language of section 507(a)(7)(E) that that line, indeed, was drawn because of the language, transaction occurring, and perhaps it's based on the distinction the Solicitor General points to that most excise taxes are based on an act or event, or a transaction.

    How is the transfer of property into an estate the result of a transaction? 
    It's the result of a disposition by someone who is now dead, and it's the result of an acceptance, I suppose, by an administrator, but the two in their respective capacities never meet, so there isn't any real transaction in the sense of the characteristically consensual act of two parties.

    Can I ask the same question I asked the Solicitor General, because assuming that I agreed with you, assuming for the sake of argument that I agreed it was not a tax, but rather it was a penalty, because it collects zero dollars as its objective. 
    Assume that. 
    Now, on that assumption, I found it very difficult to reach the question of equitable subordination without deciding whether or not the bankruptcy judge would have the power to create a subcategory that would rank this kind of penalty below the unsecured creditors, or you raised that. 
    They replied, I take it, in footnote 14 of their reply brief, and they cite a bunch of cases, but they cite them for the proposition that you cannot set up a subclassification of claims within a class of equal priority.

    Shouldn't we... I mean, to answer the question of what's equitable without hanging in the air seems difficult. 
    Should we remand the case? 
    Should we then say, go back and work this out, because we don't need to decide whether it's equitable or not when you have a perfectly good ground for reaching the same result.

    You didn't really argue... I mean, it's come up here under this other pretense.

    Wouldn't we have to send it back?
speaker="steven_jack_mccardell" startTime="2659.469" stopTime="2739.161">
    Mr. Steven Jack McCardell 
    The court of appeals affirmed the confirmation order, which is one of the three orders. 
    The order approving the plan is one of the three orders on appeal today, so that by affirming the confirmation order, the Court will approve the subordination that's provided for in the plan. 
    It's difficult for us to understand why the IRS doesn't want to address it, but it is an independent ground for subordination that really does exist in the plan, and really was... really occurred in this case, so that by reaching... by simply considering the confirmation order as one of the three orders, the Court does have that issue before it. 
    The two statutes which provide for that subordination are section 1122, which provides that claims may not be placed in a class unless they're substantially similar. 
    Well, these claims are not substantially similar to the general unsecured claims, first because they don't represent a pecuniary loss, and second, because they have different priorities in the liquidation. 
    Further, section 1129(a)(7) of the code gives them... requires that the Bankruptcy Code consider, in confirming a plan, what the liquidation results would be, and as the IRS has conceded in the Chapter 7 case, penalty claims not entitled to priority would be subordinated. 
    Thus, that result is required in a case of this nature, and those two statutory grounds, rather than any outside equitable factors, would be appropriate grounds for affirmance in this case.

    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Mr. McCardell, do I understand correctly that you are not making the argument that was made in the prior case? 
    That is, if you lose on the first question, if this is characterized in the bankruptcy context as an excise tax and therefore would have priority, you're not saying that even though it has priority status it can be subordinated.
speaker="steven_jack_mccardell" startTime="2763.546" stopTime="2865.484">
    Mr. Steven Jack McCardell 
    We're not saying that, Your Honor, and that's because Chapter 11 has a specific requirement that a Chapter 11 plan pay in full all taxes, which this plan says it will do. 
    That's found in section 1129(a)(9)(C) of the code, so that we are not making that argument. 
    Our argument, then, simply rests on the Court's traditional longstanding, well accepted test for the definition of taxes. 
    The IRS has never explained why Congress intended to legislatively overrule the Court's precedents defining taxes. 
    There's no definition for tax in the Bankruptcy Code. 
    Where the Bankruptcy Code intends to incorporate a specific definition from the Internal Revenue Code or any other Federal statute, it does so expressly so that... and a further significant factor in this case is that the kinds of claims we're dealing with in this case were simply disallowed entirely under the Bankruptcy Act, and to suggest that by saying nothing Congress intended to suddenly elevate those claims to the seventh priority is quite a stretch, as we view the development of the law. 
    The legislative history on which the IRS relies time after time in its brief simply says that exactions that are taxes may... are covered by this priority if they're excises, but they must be taxes first, and so we ask the Court to consider with regard to this exaction the traditional test, which the IRS conceded in the lower courts it did not satisfy, and did not... never came forward with any evidence that it satisfied that test, which was its burden as the claimant in this case.

    You know, Sheppard's Tax Dictionary does have a definition for minimum funding excise tax which, it refers to this particular provision, so the tax community as reflected by the tax dictionary calls it an excise tax.

    Mr. Steven Jack McCardell 
    Your Honor, it certainly has been treated in various ways as an excise tax, but not even the tax practitioners would agree that a tax of this nature is a tax for all purposes under the Internal Revenue Code. 
    We've cited the conflicting line of cases on similar taxes in the Third Circuit and the Eighth Circuit, the Latterman case and the Rockefeller case, where there is disagreement that taxes like this may not even be taxes for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code, so that in view of that kind of a disagreement in a tax of this nature, it's difficult to say that you then import that concept into the Bankruptcy Code when the tax code does not settle bankruptcy priorities. 
    That's settled by the statute and the court's decisions interpreting the meaning of the statute.

    Mr. McCardell, I understand the big difference it makes in the bankruptcy context whether it's classified as one or the other.

    I can, Your Honor. 
    An example would be the responsible officer penalty exacted under 6672. 
    It represents an assessment of 100 percent against the officer, responsible officer, of the taxes that should have been paid by the corporation. 
    The Government gets what it would have received if the law had been obeyed and, indeed, the Senate Finance Committee report, which we've cited in our brief, in describing pecuniary loss penalties, describes them as any fine or penalty, however denominated, which actually represent the collection of a tax. 
    That's the concept we believe is codified in section 50--

    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    Is... withholding taxes, that's... is that... the corporation withholds its employees taxes, then it doesn't pay them, and the person who owes the tax is the employee, and the code refers to the money that the corporation should have withheld, which, of course, is the tax that the employee owed, as a penalty, is that right?
speaker="steven_jack_mccardell" startTime="3037.617" stopTime="3039.186">

    Mr. Steven Jack McCardell 
    I can think of another example of possible pecuniary loss penalty, and that is an exaction under the Internal Revenue Code that simply represents interest on a tax that should have been paid and compensates--

    It doesn't compensate any tax that was not collected. 
    Congress did not enact section 4971(a) with the idea that individuals would not fund their pension plans and that the IRS would then collect revenue. 
    Instead, it passed the statute with the idea that individuals who had sponsored pension plans would fund them, and that that funding would go to pay retirees.

    Justice Antonin Scalia

speaker="steven_jack_mccardell" startTime="3097.337" stopTime="3100.088">
    Mr. Steven Jack McCardell 
    Yes, they are. 
    That's found in section 302 of ERISA.

speaker="steven_jack_mccardell" startTime="3102.179" stopTime="3190.165">
    Mr. Steven Jack McCardell 
    They... there's no criminal penalty, Your Honor, but that under section 502 of ERISA the failure to fund may be enforced by a civil action, including injunctive proceedings, so that it is a statutory obligation which, if violated, gives rise to these escalating penalties. 
    Now, in this case, the... not only did the IRS fail to meet the traditional test for taxes, fail to establish that a transaction had occurred, but in asserting these claims, would have taken funds right out of the pockets of the creditors, and many of those creditors include the very retirees who are intended to be protected by this statute. 
    We don't think, all other things being considered in this case, it makes sense for the Court to adopt a rule which would reach that result. 
    Nothing in the statue requires that the court read section 507 to require that any label in a nonbankruptcy statute governs priority in bankruptcy. 
    The Court's cases, from the Embassy Restaurant case, to the Nathanson case, to the Simonson case, all clearly specify that the Court's mode of analysis over many years has been to say that it's bankruptcy law that establishes bankruptcy priorities, and labels or meanings or understandings in nonbankruptcy statutes while, perhaps, evidence, are not controlling. 
    That was the basis of the court of appeals decisions in this case, and we believe the Court should affirm the court of appeals.

speaker="kent_l_jones" startTime="3194.119" stopTime="3233.283">
    Mr. Kent L. Jones 
    I have two brief points I want to make. 
    The claim that a tax that effects a penalty loses its priority was exactly what this Court rejected in United States v. New York under the Bankruptcy Act. 
    The Bankruptcy Code simply makes it easier to understand that that's the correct answer, because knowing full well that many of its excises are penalty or regulatory in nature, Congress adopted an unqualified priority for excise taxes. 
    We have to establish only that it's an excise tax. 
    Whether it's also regarded as a penalty is not relevant for applying the plain language of the statute, and the court held in United States v. New York it was not relevant under the Bankruptcy Act. 
    The other point--

    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg

    Other than what we've already discussed, I'm not familiar with any circumstances. 
    I hate to make categorical statements, but I'm not familiar with any. 
    And the other point that I want to address very briefly is the suggestion that this... the priority for this excise tax is unfair because it comes in front of claims of employees for residual retirement benefits. 
    In saying that, the court of appeals looked at only the cost of the tax, and utterly ignored its benefit. 
    These employees not only get the promise of insurance, they get the fact of insurance. 
    The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation comes in and pays benefits, guaranteed benefits. 
    The employees are much better off with this guarantee system in effect, including the priority tax, than they would be without it.
