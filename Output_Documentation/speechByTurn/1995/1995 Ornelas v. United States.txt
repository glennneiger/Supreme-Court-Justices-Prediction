    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    We'll hear argument next in Number 95-5257, Saul Ornelas and Ismael Ornelas-Ledesma v. The United States. 
    Mr. LeBell, you may proceed whenever you're ready.
speaker="robert_g_lebell" startTime="22.606" stopTime="51.367">
    Mr. Robert G. LeBell 
    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court: 
    We believe this Court should maintain the de novo review standard for Fourth Amendment warrantless cases as it has previously done in First Amendment cases, Fourth Amendment cases, Fifth Amendment cases, and Sixth Amendment cases. 
    We believe that the recently enunciated decision in Keohane is instructive in how the principle is evolved in determining that de novo review is appropriate in warrantless Fourth Amendment cases.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="51.367" stopTime="65.656">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    Mr. LeBell, it seems to me in... either the magistrate or the district judge made a finding of fact as to credibility. 
    You wouldn't suggest that that particular finding be reviewed de novo, would you?
speaker="robert_g_lebell" startTime="65.656" stopTime="83.027">
    Mr. Robert G. LeBell 
    No, Justice Rehnquist. 
    I believe that that is historical fact, and that an historical fact determined below is to be given deference. 
    What we take issue with is the determination, legal determination whether the law was correctly applied, and that mixed question of law and fact we believe should be accorded de novo review.
speaker="robert_g_lebell" startTime="83.027" stopTime="149.151">
    Mr. Robert G. LeBell 
    We believe that there are three sound reasons why de novo review should be accorded warrantless Fourth Amendment cases. 
    First of all, historically this Court has given de novo review for constitutionally enshrouded issues. 
    Secondly, de novo review furthers the appellate directive of developing the law, making consistency in the law, and basically in error-correcting, and thirdly, we believe that the decision, or, strike that, the de novo review standard is consistent with the principles enunciated in Gates v. Illinois. 
    This Court has in the past addressed issues that are encapsulated in the Fifth Amendment, and basically it has determined that de novo review is appropriate. 
    In the Keohane decision, this Court basically said, although the issue of voluntary... strike that, of custody is fact-laden, in other words, the issue is a question of what facts occurred during the course of the custody, still we believe that the question of whether, in fact, the person was in custody for the purposes of Miranda requires de novo review. 
    That was Federal habeas, though, under a statute, wasn't it?
speaker="robert_g_lebell" startTime="149.151" stopTime="155.584">
    Mr. Robert G. LeBell 
    That is correct. 
    It was a question of whether there was a presumption of correctness under 2254(d), but still the Court--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="155.584" stopTime="157.216">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    This is a direct appeal.
speaker="robert_g_lebell" startTime="157.216" stopTime="169.274">
    Mr. Robert G. LeBell 
    --That is correct. 
    We do not believe that the differentiation between a habeas action or a direct appeal should in any way prevent this Court from according de novo review or plenary review in Fourth Amendment warrantless cases.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="169.274" stopTime="180.761">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    Well, I can see why you argue naturally for plenary review, but I don't see how you could derive much support from a holding that was based on the Federal habeas statute, which this isn't.
speaker="robert_g_lebell" startTime="180.761" stopTime="193.871">
    Mr. Robert G. LeBell 
    I believe I'm looking at the words that were enunciated in that decision. 
    Those cases, that case was also backed up in this Court's decision in Ker, this Court's decision in Beck, Carroll, and Brineger, all of those--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="193.871" stopTime="196.321">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    Maybe those would be better cases for you to rely on, then.
speaker="robert_g_lebell" startTime="196.321" stopTime="260.964">
    Mr. Robert G. LeBell 
    --Certainly. 
    Those Fourth Amendment cases that have been previously been decided basically, whether the Court actually spoke the words de novo, it certainly conducted an independent review. 
    In the Ker case, in fact, the Court said that when it is to be... it's considering a constitutionally enshrouded issue, and specifically Fourth Amendment, it's going to be an independent review, and the importance of that is to assure that the Fourth Amendment as a constitutional right is, in fact, upheld. 
    Similarly, the Court decided the same principle in Beck. 
    In Carroll and Brineger, again, those two decisions were based on a fundamental reevaluation of the law and, based on that reevaluation of the law, some of the cases were overturned, and some of them were affirmed. 
    In the Cortez case, which was a case decided by this Court, the lower court determined that the decision satisfied the definition of clearly erroneous. 
    When it got to this tribunal, this Court showed no deference to the clearly erroneous determination and, in fact, reviewed the determination de novo.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="260.964" stopTime="266.788">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    You... what court made the determination of clearly erroneous in Cortez?
speaker="robert_g_lebell" startTime="266.788" stopTime="267.539">
    Mr. Robert G. LeBell 
    The lower court.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="267.539" stopTime="269.949">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    The district court, or the court of appeals?
speaker="robert_g_lebell" startTime="269.949" stopTime="281.327">
    Mr. Robert G. LeBell 
    No, the court of appeals, and upon reviewing the district court's decision determined that there was no clear error, and therefore it affirmed the decision, and this Court then reversed, showing, in essence, no deference to the decision by the court of appeals.

    I can point the Court to this particular case, where the circuit, or the circuit court of appeals specifically said, we find this to be a close case, but because we are bound by the clearly erroneous standard, we're going to have to affirm, and that was in light of the fact that on two occasions the district court reversed the finding of the magistrate judge, who had listened to 4 days of testimony, reversed the finding of probable cause.

    Where you have a single factor, like one case we had 9 or... 8 or 9 years ago involving whether it's an unreasonable search when an officer who is in a room lawfully sees a turntable in plain view and opens it up, you know, turns it over to look at the bottom to get the serial number, that issue... couldn't that issue be decided just as well and established just as well under a clearly erroneous standard?

 Where you have a single factor, like one case we had 9 or... 8 or 9 years ago involving whether it's an unreasonable search when an officer who is in a room lawfully sees a turntable in plain view and opens it up, you know, turns it over to look at the bottom to get the serial number, that issue... couldn't that issue be decided just as well and established just as well under a clearly erroneous standard?

    Mr. Robert G. LeBell 
    --I can answer the question. 
    I don't believe that the district court in this case, or in any other case, is better suited to make an application of the fundamental legal principles to the facts. 
    In fact, Salve Regina, decided by this Court, is instructive in that respect, in that the courts of appeals are better situated because of their fundamental acts, because of their institutional values, that they can pause, they can reflect and spend the time, once the facts have been developed below, to address the legal concepts and develop those legal concepts. 
    So I don't believe that deference of the legal decision could be accorded the district courts, especially in this particular case, where the district court basically, without hearing a single witness, and on the first occasion with only hearing one transcript which emanated out of 4 days of testimony, reversed the decision, which was a well-reasoned decision by the magistrate. 
    I realize that under the Magistrate Act that the court was entitled to do that, but I think it was inappropriate.

   Argument of Cornelia T. L. Pillard
speaker="cornelia_t_l_pillard" startTime="719.176" stopTime="760.345">
    Ms. Cornelia T. L. Pillard 
    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    Our position is that determinations of reasonable suspicion and probable cause to search without a warrant are subject to de novo review in the courts of appeals, and there are three closely related reasons why de novo review is the correct standard here. 
    First is the role of the courts of appeals as an expositor of the law. 
    The level of suspicion required to justify a stop or a search is a very general standard, and it's only through the process of case-by-case adjudication that specific content over patterns of cases can be given to the--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="760.345" stopTime="772.381">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    Well, why do we need specific content to be given? 
    Why isn't it sufficient to say reasonable suspicion, and just have an ad hoc decision in every case? 
    Why do we need more elaboration of the law?
speaker="cornelia_t_l_pillard" startTime="772.381" stopTime="827.038">
    Ms. Cornelia T. L. Pillard 
    --I think there are two reasons for that, Justice Rehnquist. 
    First is the need to have uniform standards from court to court, and the second is the need of law enforcement in applying those very general standards to have some guidance as to what those standards mean, and this case is a good example of that. 
    Because the court of appeals applied the clear error standard, we're left not really knowing what the court of appeals itself thought was the correct result. 
    It thought that the district court's decision fell within a range of permissible results, but we don't know whether the court thought it was ideal, and that leaves law enforcement officers, when they do confront this type of situation again, not knowing whether, if the district court in the other... in the second case were to suppress, would the court of appeals reverse that or not. 
    So we're left with a more murky standard than we would have if the court of appeals had affirmed under the de novo standard. 
    We'd have clearer guidance, and Federal law enforcement officers--

    You are, but the circuits in fact are very much guided by one another. 
    If you look at the courts of appeals cases, they cross-cite, and the State cases cross-cite as well. 
    What they do is, they look for closely analogous fact circumstances, and they ask themselves, well, we have a few different facts here, we do need to look at the totality, but are we on the more suspicious side of the line here or the less suspicious.

    --I think you're right that if the Seventh were talking solely about the application of a label to a set of facts, if circuit courts do it you will get better precedent. 
    I agree with you. 
    That also has a down side. 
    There will be less flexibility in the law, and the other down side, which I don't know how much weight to give it, is that district judges would then feel that they have to really write out every last detailed fact, including matters of mood and that... very hard to write down. 
    What they do now very often is, they just say, probable cause, that's it, and they don't feel they have to go and write every last little bit down. 
    So how do we weigh that? 
    On the one side, you're right about it being more binding precedent. 
    On the other side, it's going to be quite a complicated thing in many cases to try to write everything down... you know, every last little detail... because the three judges up there who know nothing about it are going to start second-guessing it. 
    So that's an administrative... I mean, I'm sort of... I don't know which way.

 --I think you're right that if the Seventh were talking solely about the application of a label to a set of facts, if circuit courts do it you will get better precedent. 
 I agree with you. 
 That also has a down side. 
 There will be less flexibility in the law, and the other down side, which I don't know how much weight to give it, is that district judges would then feel that they have to really write out every last detailed fact, including matters of mood and that... very hard to write down. 
 What they do now very often is, they just say, probable cause, that's it, and they don't feel they have to go and write every last little bit down.

    Ms. Cornelia T. L. Pillard 
    Well, given, in particular in this area, that the norm of requiring articulation, I think that that's something that is going to be less likely to be lost here in the translation, and you know, the countervailing concerns are that these are followed as precedent and that, yes, there will be bases for distinguishing, and you see courts all the time saying yes, this looks close, but we have more here, or we have less here. 
    But given that there's some scope in choosing the de novo standard for having the kind of additional clarity the importance of which this Court emphasized as recently as the Thompson v. Keohane case--

    Ms. Cornelia T. L. Pillard 
    I think that we should and we will keep on doing that, and the question is whether, when the Court does that, for example as it did in the Carroll case dealing with the illegal transportation of liquor, and then came up with a fact pattern in Brineger which the Court viewed as indistinguishable from the Carroll case, in Brineger the Court said if probable cause is to mean the same thing from one courtroom to another, we're going to have to reverse the district court's finding of no probable cause in this case and follow Carroll, and that's the kind of development of the law that we think the de novo standard facilitates, and we think the Court should continue to carry on in that case.

    The court of appeals cases are full of them. 
    And this Court, in fact, in the United States v. Sokolow dealt with a narcotics stop at an airport where there was a purchase of an airplane ticket with cash in small bills, travel from a source State city for drugs, an individual who traveled under an alias, appeared nervous, and did not put his address on his checked luggage, and the Court looked back to Florida v. Royer, where it had confronted a situation where an individual had purchased a ticket with small bills, traveled from a source city for drugs under an alias--

    --It is different. 
    In Illinois v. Gates, the Court said that there should be deference in that circumstance to the issuing magistrate. 
    Now, it's... it doesn't necessarily follow from Gates that the court of appeals defers to the district court. 
    The court of appeals, I think, also defers to the issuing magistrate, and in that case that's based on the policy favoring warrants, a strong Fourth Amendment policy that a search pursuant to a warrant is the preferred form of privacy intrusion, and so to that extent, when you don't have the magistrate issuing the warrant, you don't have that form of deference.

   Argument of Peter D. Isakoff
speaker="peter_d_isakoff" startTime="1554.129" stopTime="1644.467">
    Mr. Peter D. Isakoff 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    The issue before the Court is whether a Federal court, Federal district court conclusion as to the existence or nonexistence of probable cause or reasonable suspicion ought to be reviewed under the clearly erroneous standard or de novo. 
    The circuits are divided on this. 
    They have been shifting somewhat. 
    They've been inconsistent among themselves, or within their own circuits. 
    The Seventh Circuit staked out a very clear position for clearly erroneous review in this particular context, and I submit that this Court should affirm. 
    It is helpful in addressing this issue just to briefly review the characteristics of the opposing standards. 
    De novo review means that when you get to the bottom line, if the court of appeals thinks that the district court applied probable cause and reasonable suspicion in the wrong way to the facts, that it would reverse. 
    Clearly erroneous review is, by definition, more deferential. 
    The reviewing court may not reverse simply because it thinks it would have decided the case differently. 
    Where there's more than one permissible view of the evidence, it is obliged to defer, but I think that it's implicit in some of the questions that I heard addressed to opposing counsel that clearly erroneous review is not tantamount to no review. 
    Where ar appellate court sees that there's been a legal error, or that there's a legal principle that would decide the case differently--

 Isn't it really the case that courts that do that are indulging in a lot of dicta, that they're going to have a lot to say, and they're either going to have to follow that by saying, nonetheless, that isn't the way the lower court viewed it and even though we think it would have been better if they had concluded another way, we'll let it stand, or they're going to say, yes, we think they applied it rather badly, and it's so bad that we're going to call it clear error, in which case they're not really going to be following a clear error standard at all, they're going to kind of jump into de novo whenever they want to come up with an illustrative case, while still calling it clear error. 
 Isn't that the kind of, sort of protean court of appeals review that we're going to get, either a lot of dicta, or a lot of departure from doing what we're saying we're doing?

    Mr. Peter D. Isakoff 
    Well, it's certainly possible that you could get that kind of review. 
    It seems to me that this could be the occasion for defining what a court of appeals is supposed to do in performing a clearly erroneous review, and when I was talking about questions of law perhaps affecting the analysis of the probable cause issue, I think of Justice Scalia's example of the turntable, with whether or not you've got something, whether it amounts to a search. 
    That narrow question can be considered to be a legal question, when you pick up the turntable and look at the thing that's not in plain view.

    Mr. Peter D. Isakoff 
    Well, you... there may be a distinction between whether something constitutes a search for purposes of whether you pick the de novo or clearly erroneous review versus probable cause or reasonable suspicion determinations. 
    And part of the reason for that is the history that was recited by this Court in Illinois v. Gates, where this Court had attempted to look for recurring fact patterns and to try to develop a set of rules that would provide the kind of guidance that opposing counsel have suggested is provided in each one of these highly fact-specific cases. 
    And the Court's experience was that it was becoming impossible to kind of draw these distinctions on appeal, and that we have to adopt a totality of the circumstances rule specifically recognizing that these fact patterns really do vary from situation to situation and that, while you think you may be identifying a common fact pattern, in fact there may be many, many variables.

    --I think that there's a point that is lost in that argument Ms. Pillard made, and that is that nobody is talking about adopting the clearly erroneous standard of review on appeal, of deferring to the actions of a police officer. 
    Nobody is suggesting that unless the police officer was clearly erroneous, we're going to permit the evidence in. 
    This is a question of deferring to the decision of the district court Article III judge after a full adversary presentation, which I would submit is far more extensive even than considered by magistrates, and the whole point of it is that you're deferring not to a police officer but to a district court. 
    And in terms of encouraging the exercise of warrants, the very fact that there might be uncertainty in the Seventh Circuit in this case as to whether or not, when you have all of these circumstances, were they ever to arise again, suggests that these police officers, if they want to be certain, should go out and get a warrant, and once they get a warrant, then they've got all of the protection of--

    Mr. Peter D. Isakoff 
    Well, I think that that's not quite correct, Your Honor. 
    I think that in habeas corpus cases, where you are defining what is a fact issue by 2254(d), which then goes back to Townsend v. Sain, and where you're looking at how much you're going to give to the State courts to do without independent Federal review there, I think all... in all of the situations where you're looking at juror bias or that kind of thing, you are saying mixed questions of fact and law are subject to de novo review by a Federal district court in habeas corpus, okay. 
    That's one situation. 
    But the other situation, even though it's the same type of issue, I submit has been resolved differently by this Court, that the criterion that the Court has used is, who's in the best position to decide the question, and is the decision going to be of precedential significance, because as long as you're going to have three judges spend their time trying to scratch their heads and decide whether the court was right or not in close cases, you ought to at least be getting something for it. 
    And I would suggest also that we are talking about the close cases by definition, since it's only in the cases where two permissible results could be the outcome that there's a difference between the de novo standard and the clearly erroneous standard, so it's hard to see how you're going to get very many precedents coming out of just those close cases.

    Mr. Peter D. Isakoff 
    Certainly the Bose and the Hardhanks decision that followed it and Justice Stevens' very clear language was that this was a unique interest that's being protected by the actual malice standard, that this Court in particular has an obligation to be sure that this core value of being able to criticize public officials be given the fullest protection. 
    I would submit that, in contrast to the probable cause and reasonable suspicion type determinations, which are specifically nontechnical in nature, that until at least this Court has given guidance perhaps in a series of cases, that the First Amendment cases simply pose a different type of issue, and I would agree that it is an exception.

    --Well, courts really were never troubled with this problem until either some appellate judges school said let's figure out what the standard of review is, and then we say, well, it's deferential, or it's de novo. 
    Courts never bothered to think about that for a long time, and they got along fine.
speaker="peter_d_isakoff" startTime="2271.558" stopTime="2309.174">
    Mr. Peter D. Isakoff 
    Well, it's interesting, Your Honor, because I think that courts of appeals, whether prompted by this Court or otherwise, have been paying much more attention to standard review issues. 
    I know that, for example, the Third Circuit has a rule that in every brief you must have a little introductory section on the standard of review, and I was in an oral argument last week where I was listening to somebody else's case and they were saying, well, you know, we might come out one way if it's abuse of discretion and another way if it's de novo or if it's plenary. 
    And I think the courts of appeals are paying a great deal of attention to it, and frankly I think they are highlighting an issue of, you know, Federal judicial administration here, really, who is in the best position to decide these questions.

    Mr. Isakoff, doesn't this very case, though, illustrate that the court of appeals sometimes is? 
    I'm really puzzled by the significance of the labels, too, as are other people, but if I ever saw a nice precedent it was Judge Posner's here, because he said, if you have these four, five factors, and you didn't have the two NADDIS hits, it wouldn't be enough. 
    So now the district court knows that this one, two, three, four, five, if that's all you have, it's not enough. 
    It's a really nice precedential decision, and yet this is described as deferential review.

    Mr. Peter D. Isakoff 
    Well, I think what's deferential is when you get to the bottom line, because the bottom line in this case I think is arguably close. 
    I think at the point where if you leave out the NADDIS hits and all you've got is an automobile in Milwaukee with California license plates in December, and that's all you've got, then what the court of appeals is essentially saying is, if you found probable cause or reasonable suspicion on that basis alone, we would be saying that's clearly erroneous. 
    And I think that it underscores, frankly, that the whole notion that the court of appeals must be exercising de novo review in order to have this expositor of the law function is wrong.

 Do you think maybe something like this has been going on at least before we got the courts of appeals got to the point of articulation, that in most cases they did engage in deferential review? 
 Every once in a while they would get a case in which they would say, the trial court seems to be straying pretty far from what we generally think of as probable cause here, and we've got to take this case as an illustration to show that they should have analyzed their facts differently, or concluded differently, or whatnot, and in those cases they engaged in de novo review. 
 They were selecting cases for de novo review, and that's the way we've gotten along the way we've gotten along. 
 Every once in a while the courts of appeals would take an illustrative case and they'd really rake it over. 
 Would there be anything wrong with leaving a system... a) do you think that's what's been going on, before we got to the labeling era, and b) would there be anything wrong in leaving it that way and saying yes, you can pick one out once in a while?

    Mr. Peter D. Isakoff 
    Well, I think Your Honor makes a good point that, whether you call it clearly erroneous or de novo review, the ultimate bottom line is, are you going to... do you think that the district court's in the better position or not. 
    But I think that the development of these labels has come to the point where these concepts have enough meaning that when you've got the development of the law to the point where probable cause and reasonable suspicion have, and you see that it's a fact-bound area that resists specific rules, that it's appropriate specifically to tell the courts of appeals that this is an area where we think that the district courts are in the better position, and we don't think that in most cases you're going to have much precedential significance to drawing the line in these close cases one way or the other because these situations are not going to arise exactly the same way again.

    Justice Stevens 
    Mr. Isakoff, can I ask you a question that occurred to me listening to your opponents? 
    She suggested that what this Court has, in fact, done in cases like Brineger and all the airport search cases where they reversed and so forth, they just explained... the court explained its conclusion why there was, in fact, probable cause, and usually reversed in most of those cases I remember. 
    But they never said anything about a deferential standard. 
    They just went ahead and did it, which seems to imply that the Court itself, this Court, has applied a de novo standard.
speaker="peter_d_isakoff" startTime="2566.823" stopTime="2675.673">
    Mr. Peter D. Isakoff 
    Well, I think that... I think there's some truth to that, particularly when you go back to cases as far as Brineger and before you had the history that led up through Aguilar and Spinelli to Illinois v. Gates, where I think there may have been a recognition that the probable cause and reasonable suspicion determinations were really not susceptible of the kind of precedential significance that I think in Brineger the majority of the Court found, and in that case, it was different from that, Justice Stevens. 
    In that case, they lined up the facts in Carroll, and they lined up the facts in Brineger, and they said, unless we're going to say that this is for the trial court to decide, we can't distinguish these, and therefore we must reverse, and Justice Jackson in dissent made the very point that I'm frankly arguing for today, which is that the difference is that we only said in Carroll that it was permissible to make this finding, and I think that's a big difference. 
    In this case, I would affirm because it's permissible, but you didn't have to find it, and I think that that dissent was very prescient. 
    I think that it picked up the theme that later drove the Court's decision in Illinois v. Gates to reject Aguilar and Spinelli. 
    So I think that the law has progressed somewhat, in that I think there is something useful to be said to the courts of appeals and in response, I believe to Justice Kennedy, there was a question, I believe whether the Court should take into account deficiencies that a clearly erroneous rule would have. 
    I would suggest that certainly that that would not be a justification in and of itself. 
    I would suggest that where the district court is in a better position to decide the question and the courts of appeals are not really making precedent, that it's certainly not unreasonable to give the guidance to say, look, you don't have to try to make these fine distinctions on appeal, particularly since you weren't there to raise what additional questions might have come to mind like, how loose was the panel, and so on.

    Mr. Peter D. Isakoff 
    There's no question that when you look at this particular case you could reach that conclusion and decide that, well, we ought to maybe have one standard for when the district court hear's the testimony and another standard for when the magistrate hears the testimony, and yet another standard for when they disagree with one another only on the label but not on the credibility. 
    But I think of Your Honors' decision last term, and the name of the case doesn't come to mind right now, but where you, I believe, suggested that you should not have... it was the arbitration case, where you said it would be unduly complicated to have so many different standards, but I think that the possibility of error may be greater in reviewing a district court where he has not heard the testimony.

    Mr. Robert G. LeBell 
    It was suggested by Justice Souter that in the past the practice has been by the circuit courts of appeal that basically it's an ad hoc basis, and that the determination whether it's going to be clearly erroneous, or where it's going to be de novo, is sort of on, we're going to call them as we see them, and I think that's... and the question was posed, why couldn't that just continue to work.

    Mr. Robert G. LeBell 
    Yes, Your Honor, I do. 
    As a practical matter, that's precisely what has been going on, and I think the resultant effect is that there is no continuity in decisions, and there's a disparity in these decisions and the application of Fourth Amendment principles. 
    More importantly, it was posed by counsel that perhaps this should be an opportunity for the Court to more clearly define the definition of clearly erroneous, as was announced in Bessemer. 
    I don't believe that there is any more workable standard by which to determine when something is clearly erroneous or is not. 
    There's no way to quantify by setting a certain specific value, and basically what it comes down to is a court of appeal judge saying, I think this is clearly erroneous, and I think it's a totally subjective standard, and I think it's unworkable in the sense of saying we should leave it on an ad hoc basis. 
    Counsel also alludes to the principles enunciated in Gates v. Illinois, and it is our position as petitioners that to accord the clearly erroneous standard in warrantless Fourth Amendment cases would be inconsistent with the principles of Gates. 
    In Gates, obviously the Court, citing Ventresca, was trying to encourage police officers, the front line law enforcement individuals, to rely on the warrant. 
    To now say to police officers, or send the same message, well, if we're going to... if you're going to rely on a nonwarrant situation, basically we're going to accord the same deference to that decision, I think it's--
