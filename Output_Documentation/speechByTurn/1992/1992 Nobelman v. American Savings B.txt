Nobelman v. American Savings Bank

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    We'll hear argument next in No. 92-641, Leonard Nobelman against the American Savings Bank. 
    Mr. Palmer.
speaker="philip_palmer" startTime="39.206" stopTime="472.480">
    Mr. Philip Palmer 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court: 
    The basic issue in this case is whether section 506(a) of the Bankruptcy Code and section 1322(b)(2) are compatible and can be harmonized, or whether they are hostile and conflict. 
    It is the position of the petitioner that they are compatible and they can be harmonized. 
    The function of Code section 506(a) is to divide a claim into secured and unsecured parts. 
    A creditor who is undersecured under 506(a) may wind up with two claims, one of which is a secured claim to the extent of the value of the collateral, and the excess, or any amount above that, becomes an unsecured claim. 
    We know that 506(a) does apply in Chapter 13, because the Code tells us it does in section 103(a). 
    But does it apply specifically to Chapter 13, Code section 1322(b)(2)? 
    Everything I've said so far is little in dispute between the parties, but we now reach the point where the ways divide. 
    The respondents argue that it does not apply, in an argument that is based upon the 1322, the clause that reads 
    "other than a claim secured only by security interest in the real property that is the debtor's principal residence. " 
    As you look at the various respondent positions taken, they differ somewhat between themselves as to why the 506(a). 
    American Savings and Freddie Mac specifically focus on the word "rights" to tell us that the "other than" clause modifies only the word "rights". 
    Nationsbanc, Fannie Mae, and the Chapter 13 Trustee look to almost the same thing, "rights of holders". 
    Whereas the Realtor Group, Fannie Mae again, and Freddie Mac look to the word "claims", which they define by going back to the definitional section of the Code to determine that a claim is both a secured and an unsecured claim... indeed, a right to payment. 
    None of the respondents look to the word "secured" or "secured claim" together. 
    Now, the argument for the application of 506(a) can be made first by the rule of last antecedent, which was applied by the Ninth Circuit in the Bellamy case to say you should look to the words that immediately precede the clause in question. 
    Not just claims, but Bellamy looked to the adjective as well, secured claims. 
    Another approach is that when several words are followed by a clause and the clause is just as applicable to the first word or the last word or middle words, that clause should be read as applicable to all, which was an approach espoused by Justice O'Connor and Kennedy in the Ron Pair dissent. 
    Either approach is fatal, because either approach puts the word 1322(b)(2). 
    And it is 506(a), and 506(a) is what the respondents must avoid. 
    Now if, as those opposed to the application of 506(a) would argue, that it was not meant to apply, one thought which occurs is that the clause could have been put at the very first of 1322(b)(2), or at the very end. 
    In effect, to start off by saying "other than" what I'll call a homestead mortgage, the debtor may modify secured or unsecured claims, and you could reach the same reasoning at the end. 
    Or as another alternative, Congress intended that both the secured and the unsecured homestead lands were untouchable, and put in something equivalent to the 1111(b) option that is found in Chapter 11 and with which all respondents seem to be happy. 
    But none of those things happened. 
    And if you simply take the statute as it reads, 506(a), for the determination of what is a secured claim, and 1322 by either of the techniques of the "other than" clause, you come out with a statute that is consistent. 
    It harmonizes, there is no conflict. 
    We do not need to search further for the intention of Congress because it is expressed clearly.

    The secured claims that I was referring to is the language that is before the comma in 1322(b)(2): the 
    "secured only by a security interest. " 
    The argument has been made that to really say clearly what I am arguing, you would have to say secured claim secured. 
    And that is rejected by Bellamy upon the proposition that that would be a wooden and awkward way to force Congress to express its intent; that there is really no significant difference between a secured claim and a claim secured.

    It's been cited several times for the grammatical analysis which, frankly, does appeal to me at this moment. 
    [Laughter] 
    If you take... or if you accept that there is some uncertainty as to what the "other than" clause applies, if you do not accept the Bellamy rule of last antecedent, then we seem to fall right into the analysis that you made... with considerable and respectable authority, I might add... that it must apply to the whole thing, rights of holders of secured claims. 
    But what are the rights of the holders of the secured claims? 
    And that brings us back, I think, to the operative word, "secured claim". 
    We're not now speaking about the rights of holders of secured, or partially secured, or secured and unsecured claims, but only secured claims. 
    There are some other points that lead to somewhat the same analysis.

    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    Mr. Palmer, I hope you will discuss either now or after we return from the noon recess, the bearing you think the Dewsnup... our opinion in Dewsnup against Timm has on this. 
    It seems to me that that... although it may not be controlling, it certainly cuts against some of your arguments.
speaker="philip_palmer" startTime="719.921" stopTime="978.143">
    Mr. Philip Palmer 
    Dewsnup and lien pass through, we can certainly start it now and may not finish. 
    There is a question of whether or not Dewsnup forecloses the argument that was made here. 
    And, of course, all are aware that that was a Chapter 7 case. 
    All are aware that that was dealing to 506(d). 
    And I think all are aware that that was... the issue there was whether or not an abandonment would revive the lien that appeared by its terms to be cut off under 506(d). 
    And what I think the Court held, and properly, was that 506(d) applies only when it is not an allowed secured claim claim. 
    Because otherwise, Code liens would not pass through the act the way that Act liens did. 
    Now, when I say pass to... through, I think this Court was speaking in terms of unadministered. 
    They come into the estate at the beginning, but they are abandoned out of the estate and they should go out as they came in, with the same lien encumbered. 
    That was the old Bankruptcy Act rule and it was... the Court found nothing in the Code or the legislative history to indicate any intent to change that. 
    And the results of implying such a change would be a rather unfair windfall to the debtor, because it would be a permanent reduction even though it no longer served a bankruptcy purpose. 
    But none of those considerations apply here. 
    Chapter 13, as indeed do Chapter 11 and 12, have a built in protection against the windfall problem. 
    Chapters 11 and 12 keep... and 13 keep the property in the estate; abandonment is not a problem. 
    I see nothing in the Dewsnup case that indicates that it would move beyond the Chapter 7 abandonment factual situation the Court applied it to. 
    There is a reference in Dewsnup... and the Chapter 13 trustee here speaks to it in her brief... that 506(a) does not, by itself, avoid liens; it simply classifies claims into secured and unsecured. 
    But that something further... as I recall, she used the word catalyst... some catalyst is required. 
    And this Court determined that 506(d) did not apply in Chapter 7. 
    Even if you were to assume that the Dewsnup opinion should be expanded to say 506(d) does not apply in Chapter 13 either, that's not the catalyst that avoids the excess lien in Chapter 13. 
    Instead, it's section 1327(c), which is the effect of confirmation rule, that reduces the property to the value... by... well, mechanically it revests the property in the debtor free and clear of whatever amount has been determined to be an excessive value. 
    So a 1327(c) trigger, and a discharge under 1328, except as to long-term debts assumed by the plan, which would include the mortgage, as reduced in-- 
    Obviously, Dewsnup spoke to none of those issues. 
    I don't think they were before the Court. 
    And I see Dewsnup as a case somewhat limited in its scope to arrive at a proper result.

    Mr. Palmer, you may resume.
speaker="philip_palmer" startTime="996.673" stopTime="1207.642">
    Mr. Philip Palmer 
    When we took our noon break, we were discussing Dewsnup, and I'd like to pick up again at that point. 
    Dewsnup, of course, was a Chapter 7 case. 
    Dewsnup did not involve homestead or residence; it involved farmland in Utah. 
    And the argument was made in Dewsnup that because there had been a valuation of the property at a value well below the total amount, the total amount of the debt, that that was something akin to albatross branded to that property, even after that property was abandoned from the bankruptcy estate so that no distribution purpose in the bankruptcy remained. 
    The Court felt, and I think with justification, that that was an unfair result. 
    Should the property appreciate in value, it would create a windfall to the debtor. 
    The Court found 506(d) ambiguous, and having made that initial determination then determined that the Court was uncomfortable in changing pre-Code law on ambiguous language when there was no legislative history whatever to support it. 
    But we turn then to Chapter 13 and its differences. 
    Chapter 13, of course, is one of the rehabilitation sections. 
    The property is not abandoned from the estate but remains in the estate, and that is true even if there is no objection to the exemption status as homestead. 
    Exempt property does not pass from the Chapter 13 estate until after the plan has been confirmed, and only then under 1327 does it pass from the estate. 
    The purpose of determining exemptions in Chapter 13 is not, as in Chapter 7, to have it pass from the estate, but to determine whether or not the debtor must include in its payments to creditors an amount equal to all of its nonexempt property. 
    Now, that's all a Chapter 7 debtor does, is surrender his nonexempt property. 
    But a Chapter 13 debtor is required to do more than that. 
    The Chapter 13 debtor must not only pay the value of all of his nonexempt property, but must also pay his nondisposable income... that is to the excess under his monthly budget, his nondisposable income for 3 years to get the benefits of a Chapter 13. 
    Chapter 13 is a favored chapter in bankruptcy, and that has been a consistent purpose of Congress and that's well reflected in legislative history throughout.

    Because Chapter 13 presents a man who is doing more than the legal minimum that he would have to do to receive a discharge of his debts.

    Mr. Philip Palmer 
    Than he would have to do under Chapter 7, yes.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1226.574" stopTime="1232.079">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    But he also gets some benefits from Chapter 13 that a Chapter 7 debtor doesn't.
speaker="philip_palmer" startTime="1232.079" stopTime="1318.474">
    Mr. Philip Palmer 
    That is true. 
    Otherwise, I assume it would be very hard to sell. 
    But those benefits are these. 
    First, he will consider Chapter 7 when he needs to take an Internal Revenue Service, a tax debt otherwise nondischargeable, and wants to pay it out over a period of time. 
    Or he wishes to save a homestead, because Dewsnup now makes it clear Chapter 7 will not help him save a homestead. 
    Or in those States where exemptions are parsimonious and he would rather value and pay for his furniture, car, et cetera than give them up. 
    Those are the benefits of Chapter 13. 
    Saving a homestead, I will not deny, is a major benefit in Chapter 13, and one reason why many people select Chapter 13. 
    But if the respondents prevail today, that incentive will be taken away and there will be more people filing Chapter 7 than 13. 
    Well, there is another I should mention, and that is that the grounds for objection to discharge in Chapter 13 are more restrictive than they are in 7. 
    That's really not a major consideration for the average couple, but it's also a benefit of 13 over 7.

    Mr. Philip Palmer 
    Let me begin by explaining it in an area where there is absolutely no controversy between the parties, the $50,000 lien on the $100,000 automobile. 
    All the same... instruments are the same. 
    Security agreement instead of the deed of trust, but other than that exactly the same. 
    506(a) and 1322(b)(2) clearly permit the valuation of the lien, the secured claim, to $1,000, on the proposition that that's all the car is worth. 
    If the car were abandoned, the lienholder could get no more than the $1,000 fair market value and have an unsecured claim for $49,000. 
    If we move it to a homestead, the result is exactly the same unless, of course, the "other than" clause gives more protection than we say it does. 
    The debtor... the creditor will have a $23,500 secured claim in this case.

    I don't know of any case that ever dealt with modifying the unsecured portion of the claim.

    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    Thank you, Mr. Palmer.

   Argument of Michael J. Schroeder
speaker="michael_j_schroeder" startTime="1896.713" stopTime="1994.007">
    Mr. Michael J. Schroeder 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    Mr. Palmer was correct when he said that this case involves an interpretation of one or more statutes. 
    I would like to reread section 1322 for the Court, the pertinent portions of that statute, and if the Court wants to follow along, that statute is reprinted in page 3 of American Savings' brief. 
    The pertinent provisions of 1322(b)(2) state that 
    "the plan may modify the rights of holders of secured claims, other than a claim secured only by security interest in real property that is the debtor's principal resident. " 
    Taking a plain and clear look at the language of this statute, it appears that the word "rights" is the grammatical object of the word "modify". 
    Modify. 
    What are modifying? 
    We're modifying the rights. 
    In addition, the term "secured claim", again in that first phrase, is preceded by the preposition "of". 
    It's our contention that those three words together, "of secured claim" is merely definitional and defines the type of holder that the Congress was talking about when they passed the statute. 
    They're talking about a holder of a secured claim. 
    Now, applying Mr. Palmer's rule--

    And applying Mr. Palmer's rule of last antecedent, several courts which have allowed lien strip-down have simply gone back and applied the "other than" words simply to the phrase "secured claim".

    He would be a secured creditor. 
    However, his security interests would be undersecured. 
    In your example, there would be no value in the property to support his security interest. 
    Nonetheless, because he has, for example, a second lien mortgage or deed of trust, he would ostensibly be classified as a secured creditor because he has a security interest claim against property of the debtor in the bankruptcy proceeding.

    Mr. Michael J. Schroeder 
    I understand that, Your Honor. 
    And until the legislature clarifies your concern, it's our interpretation that the same treatment must be accorded to a first, second, or third lienholder against residential real property, without regard to the value of the property. 
    And let me, if I can, explain how I arrive at that conclusion. 
    Mr. Palmer's client would have this Court believe that 506(a) automatically kicks in to affect the claim or secured claim rights of a holder as defined in section 1322. 
    It's our position that 506(a) doesn't necessarily automatically kick in to define the term "secured claim" in that instance. 
    The term "secured claim" is merely definitional, again, of the type of holder that the statute's talking about.

    Mr. Michael J. Schroeder 
    Well, this... this Court, in Dewsnup, gave us some direction as to some of the rights that a holder of a mortgage has, with respect to its note and deed of trust, a mortgage. 
    And it comes into the bankruptcy court as a creditor of the bankruptcy estate. 
    This Court, for example, in Dewsnup has said that it is the creditor, not the debtor, who has the benefit of increase in value, so as to avoid a windfall to the debtor in that case. 
    I believe that's one right. 
    Another right that the Dewsnup Court set forth was the right to have the lien pass through bankruptcy unaffected. 
    In addition, this Court in the Barnhill case, in interpreting the words property and interest in property, said that in the absence of a controlling Federal law, we may look to State laws. 
    So by analogy, I think... to answer your question... yes, we may look to State law in determining what rights are.

    They have several elections or alternatives, and some of the alternatives are not very realistic. 
    One alternative would be to cure any existing arrearage immediately so there is no problem with the mortgage company. 
    Most debtors wouldn't be in bankruptcy in the first place if they had that ability to do that. 
    Another alternative would be... and this is what I believe the legislature intended and Senator DeConcini's comments went to, is that a claim such as the one claimed by American Savings Bank, the debtor would elect to cure and maintain payments under section 1322(b)(5). 
    Under 1322(b)(5), a homestead debtor typically takes a prepetition arrearage, that arrearage that existed on the mortgage loan prior to bankruptcy, puts it into his plan, and, depending on what district you're in, either makes direct regular monthly postpetition payments to the creditor or through the trustee to the creditor. 
    That's an election that a creditor in the Nobelmans' position could take.

    Mr. Michael J. Schroeder 
    If he wants to avoid personal liability, that's correct, Your Honor. 
    And Chapter 13, the discharge provision, section 1328, has an exception. 
    There are certain debts which are excepted to discharge in Chapter 13 which are not excepted to in Chapter 7. 
    For... and one of those is long-term debt, where the last payment on the debt is on a date further into the future than the last payment date on the Chapter 13 case. 
    So potentially in the situation we're talking about, a debtor may be better off going into a 7 because he would have the receipt of a Chapter 7 discharge, would receive that personal liability relief. 
    But obviously he would lose his home. 
    The creditor, more than likely, would ask the court to lift the stay or modify the stay to allow foreclosure to proceed.

 How do you... how do you explain that? 
 They just take your... the petitioners' view of this thing, I guess, in terms of how to read the statute.
speaker="michael_j_schroeder" startTime="2771.843" stopTime="2972.817">
    Mr. Michael J. Schroeder 
    Well, if I might answer your question, Your Honor, by addressing the four specific cases individually. 
    In the Hougland case which came out of the Ninth Circuit, which was the first of the pro lien-stripping cases, it appears from a reading of the text that that court was predisposed as to its decision. 
    There was some verbiage in that decision which says we can't believe that a mortgage creditor wouldn't have an equity cushion in the first place. 
    They also do, as my opponent is suggesting, automatically take 506(a) and force it into 1322(b)(2), just because 506... the Chapter 5 provisions of the Bankruptcy Code are ones of general applicability to all other substantive provisions. 
    The Wilson case is somewhat distinguishable. 
    The same result was reached there, but in that case the creditor had additional collateral beyond the homestead. 
    And so the court, in part... almost in passing, but it did recognize that additional collateral beyond the homestead was claimed by the mortgage company in that case, so that case is somewhat distinguishable. 
    In the Hart case we have the same situation where we had a mobile home on real property and other collateral. 
    Again, that is somewhat distinguishable. 
    That's not what the court necessarily... the facts that that court necessarily relied on in reaching its decision, but those were considered by that court in the result that took place. 
    In the most recent case, the Bellamy case, the court there takes a somewhat circular analysis of the statutes in effect. 
    The court, by that time, had heard several arguments. 
    And as a matter of fact, the creditor involved in that case, the Federal Home Mortgage Corporation, made the argument that it was rights and not the secured claim that was subject to modification at 1322(b)(2). 
    The Bellamy court on one page of its decision said yeah, that might be the case. 
    You may be correct in saying that it is the rights that are the subject of the adjective modified. 
    However, the real question is whether it means unsecured rights or secured rights. 
    And then it goes on to make a statement about the Code being a substantial change from the Act, which it was. 
    And therefore... without really looking at the terms of the statute, therefore we must only be talking about secured claims. 
    A couple of pages later in that same decision that court goes and automatically, as the Hougland, Wilson, and Hart courts did, take the "other than" phrase and apply it to the words "secured claim", just as if it had forgotten that it already used the rule of last antecedent to apply to the entire phrase of that preceding phrase.

    Which has the certain exceptions to discharge for Chapter 13. 
    And one of the exceptions is long-term debt, and that note is still due and payable 25 years in the future, or whatever the maturity date is, which may be outside the 3 or 5 year plan that the Chapter 13 debtor is in.
