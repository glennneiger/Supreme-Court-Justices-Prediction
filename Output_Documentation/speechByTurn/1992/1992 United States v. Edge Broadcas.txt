    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    We'll hear argument next in No. 92-486, United States and Federal Communications Commission v. the Edge Broadcasting Company. 
    Spectators are reminded not to talk until you get out of the courtroom. 
    The Court remains in session. 
    Mr. Larkin.

    Mr. Paul J. Larkin, Jr. 
    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    This case involves a First Amendment challenge by a radio station to Congress' regulatory program for broadcast lottery advertising. 
    Sections 1304 and 1307 of title 18 create a simple bright line geographically based rule under which a station's right to broadcast lottery advertising hinges on the state to which that radio station is licensed. 
    A radio station licensed to a state like Virginia that runs a state lottery can broadcast lottery advertising about that state's lottery or any other state lottery. 
    By contrast, a radio station licensed to a state like North Carolina without a state lottery cannot broadcast lottery advertising about any state lottery. 
    It is the validity of that bright line rule that is at issue as applied to respondent in this case. 
    The district court in a divided panel of the Fourth Circuit held this regulatory program unconstitutional under the commercial speech standard this Court adopted in the Central Hudson case. 
    Those courts reasoned that Congress had legitimate and substantial interests involved in helping the states pursue their policies towards gambling. 
    Those courts also concluded that this regulatory program was narrowly tailored to achieve that end. 
    Nonetheless, those courts held these statutes unconstitutional as applied to respondent on the ground that in that circumstance it did not directly advance Congress' goals.

    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Mr. Larkin, under a First Amendment analysis in commercial speech cases when we apply Central Hudson do we look case-by-case at an as-applied challenge or do we simply look to whether the Central Hudson test is met and it's a reasonable response to the overall problem? 
    Is there such a thing as an as-applied case-by-case look in the analysis?
speaker="paul_j_larkin_jr" startTime="192.534" stopTime="222.708">
    Mr. Paul J. Larkin, Jr. 
    Your Honor, the as-applied type of challenge that I think the court contemplated under the commercial speech basis is a challenge that would go to show that a particular broadcast in this case should not properly be treated as commercial speech. 
    That type of as-applied challenge can always be brought. 
    We don't believe that these statutes should be construed to apply to editorials and news stories. 
    In fact the decree entered by the district court in this case so construed the statutes. 
    We did not challenge that aspect of the decree in the court of appeals.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="222.708" stopTime="242.247">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    But as applied here insofar as it addresses the problem of a commercial advertisement, do we look at some case-by-case approach and say well, look, in this case it's so close to the border it's ridiculous as applied to Edge?
speaker="paul_j_larkin_jr" startTime="242.247" stopTime="249.369">
    Mr. Paul J. Larkin, Jr. 
    No, Your Honor, you don't. 
    Both precedent from this Court and reason indicate to the contrary. 
    First the precedent. 
    In the case of--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="249.369" stopTime="253.712">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    I'm not sure the precedent is all that clear, so I'm interested to hear your response.
speaker="paul_j_larkin_jr" startTime="253.712" stopTime="337.038">
    Mr. Paul J. Larkin, Jr. 
    --In the case of Ward v. Rock Against Racism this Court addressed a similar argument. 
    In that case people were using the band shell in New York City Central Park. 
    The city had a regulation that was treated as a time, place, and manner regulation of the speech. 
    It required people using the band shell to use city equipment and have a city employee run it. 
    The city had this regulation in place to serve two competing goals, competing goals much like the competing goals at issue here. 
    It was to insure that the concerts were loud enough so that they could be heard by concert goers but not so loud that they would disrupt the surrounding communities. 
    The argument that was made on behalf of Rock Against Racism is that regulation doesn't serve its purposes as applied to us because we're loud enough so that everybody hears us. 
    There is no need to worry about whether or not that goal is served. 
    This Court rejected that argument. 
    The Court said that the validity of a time, place, and manner regulation serves on the general purposes that the Government seeks to serve through the regulation and not on how it's applied in an individual case. 
    One week later in the case of SUNY v. Fox this Court said that the analysis under a time, place, and manner regulation is substantially similar to the analysis that is applied in the commercial speech area. 
    We think the combination of those two cases as a matter of precedent indicates that you don't look at a station-by-station approach, you don't undertake that type of analysis to decide in this case whether Congress' regulation of the broadcast spectrum is permissible.

    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    So we just apply Central Hudson?
speaker="paul_j_larkin_jr" startTime="339.301" stopTime="345.893">
    Mr. Paul J. Larkin, Jr. 
    Correct. 
    You look in this case to see whether the legislative judgment is reasonable. 
    That is what this Court said in Central Hudson.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="345.893" stopTime="357.951">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Well, do we have to ask for instance whether there is a substantial Government interest in, in what? 
    In protecting North Carolina citizens from knowing about what goes on in Virginia?
speaker="paul_j_larkin_jr" startTime="357.951" stopTime="370.086">
    Mr. Paul J. Larkin, Jr. 
    I wouldn't say it's from knowing about what goes on in Virginia. 
    We're not seeking to suppress general information. 
    What Congress has sought to do here is accommodate the conflicting goals of Virginia and North Carolina. 
    Virginia believes--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="370.086" stopTime="380.722">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    What is North Carolina's goal insofar as it deals with commercial speech about something going on lawfully in Virginia?
speaker="paul_j_larkin_jr" startTime="380.722" stopTime="396.279">
    Mr. Paul J. Larkin, Jr. 
    --North Carolina's interest in not having its citizens participate in gambling. 
    North Carolina doesn't permit private lotteries on a large scale basis, it doesn't run a state lottery, because it's interest is in not having North Carolinians gamble. 
    That is the interest they have--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="396.279" stopTime="398.387">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Even in another state where it's lawful?
speaker="paul_j_larkin_jr" startTime="398.387" stopTime="429.858">
    Mr. Paul J. Larkin, Jr. 
    --Even in another state where it's lawful because they bring the problems back home. 
    If someone goes to another state and impoverishes himself he comes back and then can become a burden on the citizens who don't gamble. 
    So North Carolina has an interest in protecting the citizenry of the State of North Carolina both against the harms that gambling can cause to participants as well as the harms that gambling can cause to third parties. 
    That is an entirely legitimate interest and we think Congress can reasonably attempt to accommodate the interests of Virginia and North Carolina and that the Central Hudson test is sufficiently flexible to allow--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="429.858" stopTime="437.310">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    But certainly the people in North Carolina can hear ads in a Virginia licensed station, can't they?
speaker="paul_j_larkin_jr" startTime="437.310" stopTime="464.735">
    Mr. Paul J. Larkin, Jr. 
    --If they are in a community that is close to the border and if the border state has a lottery, as it does here, and the broadcast airwaves cross state lines, as they do, that can happen. 
    But it is nonetheless reasonable for Congress to focus its statutes on the geographic lines separating lottery from non-lottery states. 
    After all, stations like respondent's stations are licensed to serve a community, and unless they serve that community they will not hold onto their license.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="464.735" stopTime="475.247">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Do we know how far these licenses typically allow, I mean how large a geographic area the broadcast reaches typically?
speaker="paul_j_larkin_jr" startTime="475.247" stopTime="489.444">
    Mr. Paul J. Larkin, Jr. 
    Well, I'm told by the FCC that on average there is a 50-mile radius for broadcast lottery, for broadcasters. 
    So you have that situation which therefore can repeat itself along the border in various circumstances.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="489.444" stopTime="495.567">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    Was it a condition of licensure that the transmitter be located in North Carolina?
speaker="paul_j_larkin_jr" startTime="495.567" stopTime="508.139">
    Mr. Paul J. Larkin, Jr. 
    No, it was not a condition, and in fact you can have your transmitter located in a different state. 
    The license requires you to serve a community, in this case the community is the Elizabeth City community.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="508.139" stopTime="514.746">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    Why do we know that this is a North Carolina station, because of where its principal office is located or where its transmitter is located?
speaker="paul_j_larkin_jr" startTime="514.746" stopTime="579.297">
    Mr. Paul J. Larkin, Jr. 
    That's where it's licensed to. 
    As a matter of fact there is no dispute about that. 
    There's an argument made by one of the amici that you can treat this station as having been licensed to Virginia and North Carolina, and there is utterly no factual support for that at all. 
    The complaint filed by the respondent, the stipulation of facts, the district court decision, the court of appeals decision, and even their own brief in this Court all concede that they are licensed to North Carolina. 
    The reason is under the broadcast regulations that are in effect you are licensed to serve a community. 
    Here the community is Elizabeth City, North Carolina. 
    So that they are not licensed to serve Virginia. 
    And the way the FCC looks at it is this. 
    You are licensed to serve that community and it is your responsibility to do so. 
    If you do so you are satisfying the concerns that the FCC has when it licenses you. 
    If by chance your broadcasts go into another state, that is not a problem because that's just physically what happens, but it is not a bonus. 
    You are required to serve your community, and here the community is in a state that has a state policy against lotteries. 
    It has a state policy against lotteries because it wants to dissuade its citizens from gambling.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="579.297" stopTime="588.247">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    Just one more question of a preliminary nature. 
    Does the FCC ever license for an inter-state community, say the Washington metropolitan area or something?
speaker="paul_j_larkin_jr" startTime="588.247" stopTime="592.511">
    Mr. Paul J. Larkin, Jr. 
    You can be licensed to serve an area that includes more than one state.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="592.511" stopTime="605.130">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    I'm a little puzzled by that, Mr. Larkin. 
    They are licensed to serve Elizabeth City, North Carolina, but isn't it something like 90 percent of their listening audience is outside of Elizabeth City?
speaker="paul_j_larkin_jr" startTime="605.130" stopTime="628.122">
    Mr. Paul J. Larkin, Jr. 
    Well, they have set up their transmitter north of Elizabeth City so that it is close, it is about, you could say midway on a map between Norfolk, Virginia Beach and Elizabeth City. 
    What they are doing in essence is trying to serve Elizabeth City as they are required to do but also serve the interests of the State of Virginia so that they can hopefully sell lottery ads.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="628.122" stopTime="640.961">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    But is it not true that... how much magic is there in the words licensed to Elizabeth City when, as I understand it, Elizabeth City represents only 4 or 5 percent of their total audience, of the total market?
speaker="paul_j_larkin_jr" startTime="640.961" stopTime="643.693">
    Mr. Paul J. Larkin, Jr. 
    I think the actual number is 8 percent, but I'm not going to quibble about the numbers.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="643.693" stopTime="645.568">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    8 percent, whatever.
speaker="paul_j_larkin_jr" startTime="645.568" stopTime="645.787">
    Mr. Paul J. Larkin, Jr. 
    If that--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="645.787" stopTime="649.379">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Are they unlicensed to serve the 92 other percent of their audience?
speaker="paul_j_larkin_jr" startTime="649.379" stopTime="661.920">
    Mr. Paul J. Larkin, Jr. 
    --Well, if you want to put it that way it's fine because the way the scheme works is to focus on where you license the service. 
    The statute, for example, requires that licenses be allocated so that communities are served, and the FCC--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="661.920" stopTime="676.992">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    In other words they are mandated to serve that Elizabeth City. 
    They have a duty, I guess, to serve that community. 
    But they also are permitted under their license, are they not, to broadcast to a much larger audience? 
    And is this larger audience totally irrelevant to the problem that we have to confront?
speaker="paul_j_larkin_jr" startTime="676.992" stopTime="677.758">
    Mr. Paul J. Larkin, Jr. 
    --Yes.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="677.758" stopTime="679.288">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    It is totally irrelevant?
speaker="paul_j_larkin_jr" startTime="679.288" stopTime="679.945">
    Mr. Paul J. Larkin, Jr. 
    Yes.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="679.945" stopTime="690.690">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Even though they have, I guess they have a First Amendment right to transmit it as long as there's no statutory objection to an audience that, you could pose to a lot of people who want to buy lottery tickets in Virginia.
speaker="paul_j_larkin_jr" startTime="690.690" stopTime="706.077">
    Mr. Paul J. Larkin, Jr. 
    Well, that's what we're here to decide. 
    Since they are in North Carolina, since Congress has adopted a bright line rule, and since it's an unavoidable law of physics that the broadcast waves will cross into Virginia, it is our position that while that happens--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="706.077" stopTime="737.329">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Well, that's not an unavoidable... I suppose the license restriction could say your signal shall be no stronger than is necessary to serve the area for which you're specifically licensed. 
    I guess they could limit them to the North Carolina area, and then this thing might make some sense. 
    But as I understand it they're authorized to broadcast, and if they conflicted with other stations there would be a problem, I gather, when you have scarce frequencies. 
    But they are authorized, as I understand it, not merely to license, to broadcast to the small community but to a larger audience that mostly includes Virginia residents.
speaker="paul_j_larkin_jr" startTime="737.329" stopTime="750.152">
    Mr. Paul J. Larkin, Jr. 
    --Your Honor, the reason I disagree is you use the term authorized. 
    That's not the way the scheme works. 
    It's not as if they are given the authority to go ahead and broadcast into Virginia. 
    They are licensed and authorized to serve Elizabeth City.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="750.152" stopTime="759.086">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    But is it not true that if their broadcasting into Virginia interfered with the signals of other, of Virginia stations in Virginia they would then be subject to some kind of restriction from the FCC?
speaker="paul_j_larkin_jr" startTime="759.086" stopTime="761.241">
    Mr. Paul J. Larkin, Jr. 
    Yes. 
    If their broadcast--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="761.241" stopTime="767.020">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    So they are, they are authorized in the sense that the license allows them to do that without any Federal objection.
speaker="paul_j_larkin_jr" startTime="767.020" stopTime="785.716">
    Mr. Paul J. Larkin, Jr. 
    --Well, for different purposes. 
    In other words they are authorized in the sense that there is a different Federal law that governs licensing and it doesn't forbid them from conducting the broadcasts in the way they do here. 
    They are not authorized in the sense that the statutes that they have challenged here as applied to them permits them to engage in this type of activity.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="785.716" stopTime="796.555">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Is the licensee, is the license conditioned on obeying governing Federal statutes relating to, such as the one we've got before us?
speaker="paul_j_larkin_jr" startTime="796.555" stopTime="798.101">
    Mr. Paul J. Larkin, Jr. 
    Absolutely. 
    If they--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="798.101" stopTime="807.129">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    So this station clearly is not authorized to broadcast gambling information to, from where it is.
speaker="paul_j_larkin_jr" startTime="807.129" stopTime="817.828">
    Mr. Paul J. Larkin, Jr. 
    --That's right. 
    And if they violate this law they can not only be criminally prosecuted under title 18, they can have, when their license comes up for renewal they can have their license taken away from them.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="817.828" stopTime="883.707">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Mr. Larkin, I didn't, I guess I knew but I had forgotten that you didn't have to have your transmitter located within the community that you're licensed to serve. 
    I suppose... and I had thought that one of the things that supported your position or the Government's position is that it, the Government certainly might think it unreasonable to permit the state law to be violated on the very ground of the state by transmitting from its own soil advertisements that are against its public policy. 
    But as I understand the way things can work, if you had a transmitter, if you had a station licensed to a community which permitted gambling you could have your transmitter located across the border in a state that bans gambling and you could broadcast from that state gambling announcements which would go to the community to which you're licensed since that community permits it, and would also go to the people within that state that you're broadcasting from, which is not the community you are licensed to serve. 
    Am I correct about that?
speaker="paul_j_larkin_jr" startTime="883.707" stopTime="912.962">
    Mr. Paul J. Larkin, Jr. 
    Yes, that's my understanding, that you could have a situation in the way you posit it. 
    But the reason it's a reasonable scheme here is that different states have adopted their policies and you are licensed to serve a community within that state. 
    If you are violating the laws of that state by broadcasting the advertisements, regardless of physically where they actually happen to emanate from, you are disserving the policies of the state that you are licensed by the FCC to serve. 
    That is one of the key ingredients of the licensing scheme.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="912.962" stopTime="921.364">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    Is it often true that you're licensed to a community that contains only 4 to 5 percent of your listening audience? 
    That seems very strange to me.
speaker="paul_j_larkin_jr" startTime="921.364" stopTime="957.725">
    Mr. Paul J. Larkin, Jr. 
    Often? 
    I wouldn't say it's often, but what I would say is this. 
    If you are in a community that is rather sparsely populated it probably becomes easier to obtain a license to serve that community than it would be if you are trying to seek a new license in New York City, for example, where there are numerous stations. 
    If there aren't very many stations in the area, or perhaps if there are none, that you are trying to serve, it becomes that much easier to show that you will be able to meet a need in that community that is not now being met. 
    Now, what you can have in a situation then is somebody come in and try to serve the interests of that community and, if you will, also try to serve perhaps the surrounding community.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="957.725" stopTime="972.889">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Or vice versa. 
    I expect it happens all the time, Mr. Larkin, that in fact whoever got the license expected to make more money in the Norfolk area than in Elizabeth City. 
    Have you ever been to Elizabeth City? 
    It's very nice. 
    It's on the way to the outer banks, but there ain't much there. 
    [Laughter]
speaker="paul_j_larkin_jr" startTime="972.889" stopTime="1066.666">
    Mr. Paul J. Larkin, Jr. 
    I think I have been through it but I haven't stopped off. 
    What we were talking about is the second point that I hope to make today, which is that what we have here is a reasonable scheme, and the Central Hudson test reasonably accommodates that. 
    I would also, however, like to say just a few words about the first point we have made in our brief which is that for purposes of the commercial speech doctrine lawful gambling should not be treated differently from illegal gambling. 
    And the reason is gambling is one of a small category of unique products or activities. 
    This Court in Posadas referred to these sorts of activities, such as the consumption of alcohol and gambling and the like. 
    What you have is a situation where they are activities that have traditionally been deemed harmful to participants and to third parties and for which there always seems to have been a black market available. 
    Because they are deemed harmful to individuals in society the society has always attempted to regulate them heavily and sometimes flatly to ban them altogether, as most states do in connection with casino gambling. 
    In some instances, however, society can rationally conclude that the costs of a flat prohibition are too injurious for society to bear, and as the result the appropriate approach to undertake is the one that Professor Epstein has called damage control, legalization and regulation where the regulation includes a ban on the advertising of that activity. 
    That is the sort of approach that has been undertaken for example with respect to gambling, with respect to alcohol, and other similar matters. 
    It's where you have that type of narrow activity, not the broad range of activities that can potentially be regulated by the Congress, by the state legislatures, and by the municipalities, that we think the rationale that was expressed in Posadas of greater includes the lesser is a reasonable rationale to apply.

    Mr. Paul J. Larkin, Jr.

    The essential objection raised--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1438.217" stopTime="1453.101">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Mr. Larkin, may I just pursue Justice Kennedy's point one step further to get it sharp? 
    It seems to me the question should be whether the State of North Carolina, to follow up on Justice Scalia's notion, could prohibit gambling advertising of the lotteries in Virginia in its own newspapers in the state.
speaker="paul_j_larkin_jr" startTime="1453.101" stopTime="1457.740">
    Mr. Paul J. Larkin, Jr. 
    --I think if it's illegal in North Carolina--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1457.740" stopTime="1472.626">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    It's illegal in North Carolina, but it's not illegal for the citizens, as I understand you, to go across the border and buy the tickets. 
    But can therefore the Virginia lottery people run ads, do they have a constitutional right to advertise their lotteries in North Carolina newspapers?
speaker="paul_j_larkin_jr" startTime="1472.626" stopTime="1477.374">
    Mr. Paul J. Larkin, Jr. 
    --No. 
    North Carolina can prohibit that type of activity because it is illegal in that state.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1477.374" stopTime="1480.732">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    But it's advertising activity that's legal where it's performed.

    Mr. Paul J. Larkin, Jr. 
    That's right.

    And you think they can--
speaker="paul_j_larkin_jr" startTime="1483.341" stopTime="1504.519">
    Mr. Paul J. Larkin, Jr. 
    Yes. 
    There are certain counties in Nevada, for example, that have legalized prostitution. 
    I don't think Virginia or North Carolina has to say that its newspapers can advertise legalized prostitution in Nevada. 
    The First Amendment doesn't prohibit them from undertaking that type of activity. 
    It is sufficiently flexible that we think they can engage in the type of regulation that we have discussed, and that the Government can engage in this type of regulation here.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="1504.519" stopTime="1507.987">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    --Why? 
    Because of clear and present danger? 
    What's the rationale for that?
speaker="paul_j_larkin_jr" startTime="1507.987" stopTime="1574.850">
    Mr. Paul J. Larkin, Jr. 
    It's an activity that in a perfect world would not be conducted at all. 
    In a less perfect world Congress or the legislature could flatly prohibit it. 
    But in the type of world that we have the costs sometimes of prohibiting this activity are too great because of all the harms associated with the black market to allow this activity to be undertaken. 
    As the result, society has to regulate it rather than prohibit it. 
    That's the way we think that the types of instances that are discussed in Posadas can reasonably be tied together. 
    Let me say just a few brief words about the Central Hudson test. 
    We think that essentially the theory adopted by the lower courts and urged by respondents is one of under-inclusiveness, and we think that under inclusiveness theory is not materially different from the one that was rejected in the Metromedia case and that was rejected in Posadas itself. 
    What Congress has sought to do here is accommodate competing interests, the interests of Virginia and North Carolina. 
    The fact that the fit is not perfect is not fatal to this scheme. 
    It doesn't have to be, it only has to be reasonable. 
    And it does, the reasonableness of it doesn't have to be defended on a station-by-station basis. 
    Since this fit is reasonable as a general matter, we believe that it is reasonably--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1574.850" stopTime="1583.722">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Mr. Larkin, how do we know it's reasonable as a general matter? 
    Is there any evidence in the record that shows that this is not a typical station? 
    I mean, I know of a lot of stations that broadcast across state lines.
speaker="paul_j_larkin_jr" startTime="1583.722" stopTime="1589.985">
    Mr. Paul J. Larkin, Jr. 
    --It is reasonable because you are licensed to serve a community. 
    If you are serving that community you are broadcasting to them.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1589.985" stopTime="1593.749">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    So we may assume that this is a typical station, and you would still defend it?
speaker="paul_j_larkin_jr" startTime="1593.749" stopTime="1595.654">
    Mr. Paul J. Larkin, Jr. 
    Well, if it were--

    Is that right?
speaker="paul_j_larkin_jr" startTime="1595.920" stopTime="1598.293">

speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1598.293" stopTime="1601.276">

    Mr. Conrad Moss Shumadine 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    I'd like to start off by noting that the question presented in this case is whether a ban on commercial speech that is wholly ineffective in promoting any governmental interest when applied to a particular speaker violates the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, and we begin with the notion that in this record we believe we have established that as applied to this litigant this statute is wholly ineffective to promote, encourage, foster any governmental interest of any kind, any interest in federalism, or promote any purpose. 
    And the question for this Court is whether a statute that as applied accomplishes nothing can still restrict our liberties.

    Mr. Conrad Moss Shumadine 
    We have not, we have challenged this statute only as applied to Edge. 
    We have followed the well established--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="1719.870" stopTime="1726.460">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    I suppose that there are probably people who listen most of the time to the Edge station.

    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, I would suppose it wouldn't be in business if it didn't have an audience, and if that, if the audience that listens to Edge stations, the station, can't hear lottery ads on that station, why it certainly to that extent serves the interest that the statute has in mind.
speaker="conrad_moss_shumadine" startTime="1751.998" stopTime="1772.770">
    Mr. Conrad Moss Shumadine 
    I would respectfully differ and note that what we established in the brief was that the dominant medium was television. 
    We pointed out the amount of time that people listen to television, the saturation of advertisements through television. 
    We proved that people switch radio stations. 
    We proved the other radio stations that saturated this area--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="1772.770" stopTime="1802.680">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Yes, but as long as somebody is listening to Edge, and if Edge is forbidden from carrying lottery ads, as long as somebody is listening to Edge station it is not going to hear lottery ads, and that would go for all stations in North Carolina. 
    If the people who listen to North Carolina stations can't hear lottery ads on those stations it certainly serves the purpose of the statute.
speaker="conrad_moss_shumadine" startTime="1802.680" stopTime="1814.285">
    Mr. Conrad Moss Shumadine

    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, not if they don't listen to the Virginia stations, they won't get it.
speaker="conrad_moss_shumadine" startTime="1818.876" stopTime="1837.775">
    Mr. Conrad Moss Shumadine 
    Well, that would be indeed a factual question. 
    But what we proved in this record, and we went though... in a very fact-specific inquiry we proved they were listening to Virginia t.v. stations, they were getting Virginia newspapers, and that we were overlapped by the other Virginia radio stations that were running the lottery advertisements. 
    There is--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="1837.775" stopTime="1845.834">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Nevertheless, as long as they're listening to North Carolina stations they're not going to be listening to ads.
speaker="conrad_moss_shumadine" startTime="1845.834" stopTime="1851.847">
    Mr. Conrad Moss Shumadine 
    --Justice White, your point is well taken that as long as someone listens only to our station they would get no lottery--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="1851.847" stopTime="1855.737">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Or even while they're listening to those stations they are not listening to ads.

    Mr. Conrad Moss Shumadine 
    --Well, that would certainly be true. 
    But whether that marginal, and I respectfully submit the term marginal, furthering of any interest, I respectfully suggest that is not enough of a furthering of any governmental interest to justify a total regulation of speech. 
    Because what we proved was that every other medium that was carrying lottery advertisements was overlapping us, that the people in North Carolina were, in the words of the Fourth Circuit, saturated with lottery advertising, advertisements, and that it did not further any governmental purpose to say that one speaker, my client, could not say what every other single speaker that we were competing with was saying--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1898.095" stopTime="1909.965">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist

    Well, why would they want to advertise otherwise?
speaker="conrad_moss_shumadine" startTime="1917.289" stopTime="1939.360">
    Mr. Conrad Moss Shumadine 
    --Generally... they certainly would want to spread their advertising over as many media as possible with the view that that gives them possibly some type of larger audience. 
    But there is no demonstration in this record that there would be a greater quantity of advertisements, a greater effectiveness of advertisements, and the only--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1939.360" stopTime="1951.276">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Almost by fourth grade addition, I would think, you could prove there would be a greater quantity of advertisements if one additional station is now permitted to carry advertisements that wasn't before.
speaker="conrad_moss_shumadine" startTime="1951.276" stopTime="1975.391">
    Mr. Conrad Moss Shumadine 
    --That I would respectfully submit is not correct, Your Honor, because advertising budgets are traditionally fixed. 
    What happened here and would almost always happen is that the Virginia lottery merely redistributed their budget. 
    They didn't buy additional advertisements. 
    Most people select advertising based on formulas as to effectiveness. 
    They don't increase advertising payments because there are more advertising mediums.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1975.391" stopTime="1983.514">

    I think you said a moment ago that advertisers budget on the basis of effectiveness.

    --Well, the fact that they want to have as many stations as possible carry the message does not necessarily mean that more people are going to get the message in any real sense.

    It's also not hard to imagine that there are a lot of law abiding citizens in North Carolina who don't believe in gambling. 
    And I don't know why Edge should have the right to carry lottery ads advertising something that's against the law in North Carolina. 
    I've been a big fan of the Edge station, but now I can't listen anymore, they're bombarding me with lottery ads.

    Your station comes into the FCC and says we want to be licensed to this Elizabeth City community in North Carolina. 
    We want to meet their local community needs, one of which is that they say we don't want gambling. 
    We think gambling is bad for our society.

speaker="conrad_moss_shumadine" startTime="2249.077" stopTime="2301.462">
    Mr. Conrad Moss Shumadine 
    There would be two. 
    In the Linmark case you specifically looked at the facts in that case distinguishing a Sixth Circuit case based upon a different fact. 
    In the SUNY case this Court specifically said, and I am quoting from pages 475 and 476 of that opinion, the court of appeals did not decide however whether the law directly advances these interests and whether the regulation it imposes is more extensive than is necessary for that purpose. 
    As noted earlier, it remanded to the district court for those determinations. 
    We think the remand was correct since further factual findings had to be made. 
    Now I would suggest to the Court that the only way you could make factual findings on a specific record is to deal with the individual case and not the nation as a whole.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="2301.462" stopTime="2316.018">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    How do you distinguish the Government's citation of Ward v. Rock Against Racism and its argument that the validity of the statute depends on the relation it bears to the overall problem the Government seeks to correct?
speaker="conrad_moss_shumadine" startTime="2316.018" stopTime="2379.898">
    Mr. Conrad Moss Shumadine 
    That was dealing with the fourth prong of the Central Hudson test which does have, where the Ward v. Rock Against Racism analysis has some meaning. 
    Ward obviously was a time, place, and manner case. 
    In time, place, and manner cases they are almost always effective. 
    You really don't reach the third prong of the Central Hudson test. 
    In dealing with the fourth prong this Court can always examine to see whether there are many other easier alternatives. 
    If you see there are many other easier alternatives that more rationally meet any governmental interest you can then reject the statute. 
    You can also take evidence to see, as was done in the Discovery Network, whether in fact the statute is narrowly tailored. 
    But in regard to dealing with the third prong of the Central Hudson test, I don't think this Court has ever said we totally ignore the facts of the individual case, we don't care about the individual speaker, because this Court has wisely recognized that speakers do have First Amendment rights.

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well, Mr. Shumadine, in SUNY wasn't that a dormitory regulation? 
    So we're not talking about any world scope of it. 
    We're talking just about factual findings that would look into the effect of the regulation throughout its scope, because it just wasn't a broad thing. 
    I don't see that as authority for the proposition when you're talking about an act of Congress you focus just on one particular incidence rather than the nationwide effect.
speaker="conrad_moss_shumadine" startTime="2408.215" stopTime="2457.899">
    Mr. Conrad Moss Shumadine 
    Well, Your Honor, it would seem to me plain that in reading SUNY, and that was what the district judge did because it came out immediately prior to our decision, he read it very carefully. 
    It would seem very difficult to say we're going to have factual findings in this context about the nation as a whole. 
    And I would note that it is the Government that bears the burden of justifying its restraint on speech. 
    And if that, even if that were the test it would be the Government's burden to come forward with some evidence that suggested that in the nation as a whole this was an effective program. 
    The Government really submitted no evidence in this record of any kind that I can find suggesting that this statutory scheme is really effective, and what the--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2457.899" stopTime="2462.303">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist

    Mr. Conrad Moss Shumadine 
    --It seems to me if the, as this Court has said, the test is directly advanced. 
    This Court has placed, I believe in Zauderer, in Fox, and in other cases, the burden on the Government to show that the regulation does directly advance a governmental interest. 
    Now it seems to me that places a burden on the Government to show something, and that something I would suggest according to SUNY must be in the empirical real world--

    Mr. Shumadine, empiricism meaning if I'm doing no more harm than other people are doing you can't really discern my contribution to the harm being done, therefore you can't stop me? 
    Suppose Elizabeth City has a law against prostitution and it could be shown that in fact it's easy to obtain prostitutes in Elizabeth City if you're of a mind to, that there are a lot of other avenues for advertising the availability of houses of prostitution in Elizabeth City. 
    Would you then come up here and argue well, therefore you cannot stop my station from advertising of prostitution because it would have no significant effect? 
    You wouldn't be making that argument, would you?
speaker="conrad_moss_shumadine" startTime="2599.904" stopTime="2605.418">
    Mr. Conrad Moss Shumadine 
    Well, it... I would not, I do not think I would be making that argument under those circumstances.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="2605.418" stopTime="2606.292">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Why?
speaker="conrad_moss_shumadine" startTime="2606.292" stopTime="2651.118">
    Mr. Conrad Moss Shumadine 
    If you, let me just... the reason is, the difference is if you said everyone in Elizabeth City except one could advertise prostitution I would be here making the very same argument today, and especially if I demonstrated that by everybody but one advertising that the effect, that there was going to be no incremental effect to banning one speaker from saying that which every other speaker in the world was saying. 
    I regard that as an important constitutional principle, that the Government cannot say who is going to speak about things that when they, the speech and the carrancy of speech is already in the public domain. 
    I think it is--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="2651.118" stopTime="2667.330">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    So you would say the same thing if this case involved prostitution or drug use or anything else, so long as there were stations outside of North Carolina that can get that same message to the individuals? 
    Your station is entitled to do that even though you're licensed to the community?
speaker="conrad_moss_shumadine" startTime="2667.330" stopTime="2737.240">
    Mr. Conrad Moss Shumadine 
    --I would say that if in the area where the message was being received we were overlapped by every other station carrying the same message that there would be no constitutional interest in suppressing our station's speech because the governmental interest would not be directly advanced by shutting up one speaker. 
    It simply has no direct advancement for any constitutional purpose. 
    It simply becomes, in my opinion, a naked and arbitrary abuse of power on the facts of that case. 
    Now I think those cases are very, very unlikely, but if, if the Government is going to license everyone else but one, then I think that raises an important and indeed significant constitutional issue. 
    And I think if it is established that by taking that one out of circulation as an advertiser that you do not accomplish anything in terms of preventing the transmission or dissemination of the message, then I think it is plainly unconstitutional--

    Mr. Conrad Moss Shumadine 
    We have not submitted based on the fourth prong, even though we have raised the fourth prong. 
    Our position has been essentially that the third prong is an empirical test, that it requires proof that it directly advances the governmental interest in an individual case, and that we assume the burden of proving it did not. 
    We respectfully suggest to the Court we met the burden of showing that as applied to Edge the statute--

    Yes, I think I understand you.

    Mr. Conrad Moss Shumadine 
    Justice Souter, as I remember your question it was asking about the fourth prong of the Central Hudson test, and I was starting to reply to say that it would obviously be more rational and more effective to utilize the audience served as opposed to the station of license. 
    If you wanted to prevent North Carolinians from receiving advertisements the Government obviously could prohibit the advertisements being broadcast to stations with audiences in North Carolina. 
    As you are aware, the FCC license has a filing that demonstrates both the strength of the signal and the area covered, and you can determine the audience from that if you wanted to with some degree of precision.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="2958.948" stopTime="2968.632">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    Well, that's true, but the fourth prong simply requires that the regulation not be more extensive. 
    This isn't more extensive, is it?
speaker="conrad_moss_shumadine" startTime="2968.632" stopTime="2979.706">
    Mr. Conrad Moss Shumadine 
    I think it is to the extent that it picks up stations like Edge where it has no effect or it doesn't accomplish any governmental purpose.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="2979.706" stopTime="3031.872">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    Well, I think this gets back to Justice White's colloquy. 
    Whether there might be ways in which the Government could accomplish that purpose more effectively is a different question. 
    It accomplishes something. 
    Assuming that there are people listening to the station at all, those people are not going to be listening to advertising about the lottery. 
    And it seems to me that given the fact that there will be some effect it's difficult to argue under the fourth prong that the regulation in the Central Hudson words is more extensive than is necessary. 
    It may not pick up much, but I'm not sure that it's more extensive than is necessary. 
    It just is, it is not... your argument is that it's ineffective, which it seems to me is a different concept.
speaker="conrad_moss_shumadine" startTime="3031.872" stopTime="3060.580">
    Mr. Conrad Moss Shumadine 
    I have conceded that my primary argument is that it is ineffective, but if you were to, as I read the Discovery Network case that just came down 2 weeks ago, I believe even there that statute was effective as to about 100 out of the 3,000, or 169 out of the 3,000 new racks, and that still was a poor fit. 
    So the fact that it has some marginal effect, I don't know if that saves it.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3060.580" stopTime="3087.989">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Yes, but it's only marginal because you're just talking about Edge, and if you talk about all the stations in North Carolina that are not permitted to carry these ads, why surely there's quite a direct service to the Government interest in protecting the interests of North Carolina.

speaker="conrad_moss_shumadine" startTime="3115.729" stopTime="3169.238">
    Mr. Conrad Moss Shumadine 
    I believe it is, Your Honor, and it's certainly the way that this Court has always approached constitutional questions. 
    There are any number of cases where this Court has said that you look at the statute as it is applied to a particular litigant to determine its constitutionality as to that litigant. 
    There are cases that say that's a wise and beneficent policy because it allows this Court not to overturn more of the statute than is necessary. 
    There are any number of cases we cited in the brief where this Court has overturned the application of a statute as applied to a particular litigant while it has allowed the statute to be applicable as to other litigants. 
    The fact that a statute may in general serve a governmental purpose does not mean that on specific facts and on a specific record the statute cannot have unconstitutional applications.

    But haven't we said, Mr. Shumadine, that when we're talking about commercial speech the legislature can enact a prophylactic rule which it couldn't in connection with straight First Amendment speech that may reach out a little more broadly than you could in First Amendment orthodox?
speaker="conrad_moss_shumadine" startTime="3188.214" stopTime="3207.722">
    Mr. Conrad Moss Shumadine 
    In a facial challenge this Court has said that it defers to a legislative judgment. 
    What I don't think this Court has ever said is that if a litigant proves that in a specific case the legislative judgment does not apply and the statute is really ineffective on a real record with real evidence that the statute can be applied to that case.

    Do you think in a commercial speech case that if a plaintiff can show that there is one in his particular example, the thing does not satisfy the four prongs, even though it does in 99 percent of the other cases, that litigant can have that statute struck down as to him?
speaker="conrad_moss_shumadine" startTime="3226.059" stopTime="3266.636">
    Mr. Conrad Moss Shumadine 
    That would be my belief, yes. 
    That is the teaching that I believe this Court has said when you struck down filing fees for indigents you did so not because filing fees are unconstitutional in 99.9 percent of the cases but because as applied to that individual class of litigants it was unconstitutional. 
    When you struck down the solicitation rules in NAACP v. Button you did not strike the lawyer solicitation rules down in general. 
    It is a well established, I suggest, rule of this Court that you can look at a specific record and look at the application of a statute to a specific litigant and protect that litigant's constitutional rights--

    Well, I thought your submission was that if the statute does not serve the interest in the particular case, that that particular litigant can challenge it.

    Mr. Conrad Moss Shumadine 
    --I did make that submission, and the only reason I did not endorse that example is that I think you would have to look at all of the facts in a record to see whether it was effective. 
    If it was totally ineffective, if you said everyone can have billboards except one person, and if you were going to have 10,000 billboards anyway and you were banning 20 additional ones, then I think there would be a real problem. 
    I think it's very important in an as-applied challenge, and we tried very carefully to say this, to stick to the record as made.

    Justice David H. Souter 
    Mr. Shumadine, it seems to me although you emphasize in answering Justice Kennedy's question the particularity of the exception that you're arguing for, at least in the context of FCC licensing if we accepted your argument it would be a very broad exception because you in effect would be saying that only, that this particular regulation would be enforceable only with respect to broadcasters over a geographical area which do not receive, as it were, the forbidden broadcasts from outside and which do not in turn broadcast to a substantial audience outside the area in which the activity is forbidden. 
    So that I suppose on your theory there might be some kind of enclave in the center of large states in which the regulation would be enforceable, but I'm not sure that it would be enforceable anywhere else.

    Mr. Conrad Moss Shumadine 
    That is not our submission, Your Honor. 
    What we submitted and proved to the trial court was if we could assume the burden of proving complete ineffectiveness, that is we were totally overlapped by virtually every dominant information source, then--

    Well, let's assume you've got 92 percent effectiveness. 
    That's as far as you've gotten, haven't you? 
    You concede 8 percent, don't you?

    Your Honor, I have nothing further to add unless the Court has any further questions.

    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    Is part of your submission, Mr. Larkin, that there is a waiver, an estoppel aspect to this case, to speak in loose terms, that this licensee really submitted itself to the jurisdiction of North Carolina and is stuck by its license, or does that drop out of the case and this is simply a case in which you win under Central Hudson?

    Mr. Paul J. Larkin, Jr. 
    We don't make an estoppel or a waiver type of argument. 
    We do think we win under Central Hudson, as well as the other arguments in our brief.
