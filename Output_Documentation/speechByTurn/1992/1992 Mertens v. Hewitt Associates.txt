Mertens v. Hewitt Associates

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    We'll hear argument next in number 91-1671, William J. Mertens v. Hewitt Associates. 
    Mr. Sigman.
speaker="alfred_h_sigman" startTime="64.744" stopTime="243.775">
    Mr. Alfred H. Sigman 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    This case presents the Court with the issue of whether a person who knowingly participates in a breach of fiduciary duty under ERISA is liable to restore losses suffered by a retirement plan. 
    In 1987, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation imposed a distress termination on the Kaiser Steel retirement plan because of what it described at the time as its gross underfunding. 
    Petitioners, and all other retirees similarly situated, suffered substantial losses in their retirement income. 
    Mr. Mertens, for example, suffered a reduction in his monthly benefit from $2,000 to $500. 
    Petitioners brought this action to recover all losses to the plan. 
    Petitioners sued the plan's fiduciaries, officials of Kaiser, for allegedly breaching their fiduciary duties to the plan, and also sued the plan's actuary, in a separate action which the district court consolidated, for allegedly knowingly participating in that fiduciary breach. 
    Essentially, plaintiffs allege that the Kaiser fiduciaries and Hewitt acted together to purposefully underfund the plan by failing to change the plan's actuarial assumptions to reflect Kaiser's decision to essential terminate its steel-making operations. 
    As a consequence of that decision, a great number of Kaiser employees were... were forced to take full early retirement benefits, which in turn greatly increased the funding costs to the plan. 
    Because Kaiser did not fund the plan in a manner to pay for the increased retirements caused by the closing down of its steel operations, the plan became insolvent. 
    I'd like to argue three points to the Court today, the first being that under ERISA section 502(a)(3), which provides for all appropriate equitable relief to redress violations of the act, that that statute is broad enough to encompass redress against a person who knowingly participates in a breach of fiduciary duty. 
    And that principle also is a fundamental principle of the common law of trusts, which should be incorporated into ERISA. 
    Secondly, I'd like to argue that when Congress in 1989 enacted the so-called OBRA amendment to ERISA, it made... which had explicitly referred to a preexisting underlying cause of action under section 502 for recovery of losses to a plan caused by any person who knowingly participates in a breach of fiduciary duty, that that amendment had confirmed that the right on the part of participants and beneficiaries to sue knowing participants in fiduciary breaches had always existed under section 502. 
    Finally, Your Honors, I would like to argue that the liability that we argue for here today is essential in order to further the remedial purposes of the statute, the primary function being to deter fiduciary breaches in the first place, so as to secure the interests of retirees in their pension benefits.

    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    If there were a suit under State law... and I think this question relates on all three of the points you want to bring up, or at least it... it gives me an initial grasp of the case. 
    If there were a suit under State law, what would your position be on whether or not there's preemption?
speaker="alfred_h_sigman" startTime="259.466" stopTime="301.164">
    Mr. Alfred H. Sigman 
    Well, in fact we did raise a claim under State law. 
    We sued Hewitt for malpractice under State law. 
    And after this Court granted certiorari, the district court denied Hewitt's motion to mission on preemption grounds. 
    I think that the answer to that question in part's going to depend on the resolution of this case. 
    I would point out to the Court, however, that ERISA does provide specifically that plans can be sued and can sue. 
    And there are many instances where district courts have held that malpractice actions against attorneys, against other service providers to plans, are not preempted. 
    But, once again, that issue is not presented by this case because Hewitt did not raise it until after the cert petition had been granted.

    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Mr. Sigman, what provision of ERISA did the respondent violate?
speaker="alfred_h_sigman" startTime="309.248" stopTime="336.126">
    Mr. Alfred H. Sigman 
    We contend that the respondent, Hewitt, violated... that... that the violation involved was the violation of the fiduciaries to adequately fund the plan. 
    And we contend that 502(a)(3) is broad enough, because it is an open-ended provision, to provide relief against Hewitt for aiding and abetting the fiduciaries in that violation.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="336.126" stopTime="343.292">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    And what's the section of ERISA that the fiduciary violated? 
    What would we look to?
speaker="alfred_h_sigman" startTime="343.292" stopTime="345.171">
    Mr. Alfred H. Sigman 
    That would be section 404 and 409, Your Honor.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="345.171" stopTime="347.643">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    404 and 409?
speaker="alfred_h_sigman" startTime="347.643" stopTime="377.203">
    Mr. Alfred H. Sigman 
    Right. 
    Section 404 broadly sets forth the fiduciary standards of ERISA and 409 is the provision of the act which provides for an action against fiduciaries on behalf of the plan. 
    Congress provided in section 502(a)(3) of ERISA that pension plan participants and beneficiaries could recover, in addition to the remedies explicitly set forth in that section, other appropriate equitable relief to redress ERISA violations. 
    The wording is very broad.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="377.203" stopTime="391.441">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Yes. 
    It's... it's very broad, but not universal. 
    It... it does say other appropriate equitable relief. 
    What do you deem to be excluded by that adjective equitable?
speaker="alfred_h_sigman" startTime="391.441" stopTime="401.459">
    Mr. Alfred H. Sigman 
    I would say that damages, for example, for emotional distress would be excluded from that... by that term.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="401.459" stopTime="405.022">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Well, that's simply because there's... that doesn't go to the relief, it goes to where there's a cause of action, doesn't it?
speaker="alfred_h_sigman" startTime="405.022" stopTime="407.252">
    Mr. Alfred H. Sigman 
    Yes, Your Honor.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="407.252" stopTime="426.006">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    What... what relief for an available cause of action is excluded by... by putting in the term equitable? 
    Now, the other side has... you know, has an explanation. 
    It says, you know, equitable relief doesn't include money damages. 
    But you say it includes any relief that could be provided--
speaker="alfred_h_sigman" startTime="426.006" stopTime="427.955">
    Mr. Alfred H. Sigman 
    To redress. 
    I think that that's--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="427.955" stopTime="440.074">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    --To... but... but to redress a breach of fiduciary duty since that breach would be sued for in a court of equity, and therefore any relief provided would be equitable relief. 
    So then why would you put in the adjective?
speaker="alfred_h_sigman" startTime="440.074" stopTime="455.455">
    Mr. Alfred H. Sigman 
    --Well, Your Honor, I think that the... that the limitation is, first, there must be a violation. 
    And I think that the limitation relates to... to the remedy. 
    In other words, the... the 502(a)(3) provides that--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="455.455" stopTime="462.160">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Well, tell me what remedy would otherwise be available but for this adjective equitable?
speaker="alfred_h_sigman" startTime="462.160" stopTime="471.586">
    Mr. Alfred H. Sigman 
    --Well, in this case we'd say make-whole relief, and we say that make-whole relief is encompassed within the adjective, within the term equitable relief, Your Honor.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="471.586" stopTime="474.558">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Yes, so... so you might as well have dropped the adjective.
speaker="alfred_h_sigman" startTime="474.558" stopTime="511.023">
    Mr. Alfred H. Sigman 
    Well, I don't think so, Your Honor, because equitable relief traditionally has encompassed make-whole relief in situations such as this. 
    Beneficiaries of a trust who are wronged by the fiduciaries have historically had the relief... had the relief available to them to be restored, to be made whole. 
    Exactly, Your Honor. 
    And I'd point out that we're not seeking money directly for the individuals affected. 
    We're seeking money on behalf of the plan. 
    We're seeking to restore losses to the plan, and that is an appropriate equitable remedy, one which Congress had intended the courts to apply when--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="511.023" stopTime="514.556">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    This is not make-whole relief. 
    You... you say make-whole relief is not available.
speaker="alfred_h_sigman" startTime="514.556" stopTime="516.969">
    Mr. Alfred H. Sigman 
    --We are saying that make-whole relief is available.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="516.969" stopTime="523.432">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    So all relief is available. 
    What isn't available? 
    I'm not looking for what is available. 
    What isn't?
speaker="alfred_h_sigman" startTime="523.432" stopTime="535.910">
    Mr. Alfred H. Sigman 
    Well, we're saying what would not be available would be relief available to the participants of the plan for the emotional injuries that they've suffered as a result of having their pension reduced so substantially, that that would be excluded, for example, Your Honor. 
    We're saying--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="535.910" stopTime="536.140">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Not because--
speaker="alfred_h_sigman" startTime="536.140" stopTime="537.850">
    Mr. Alfred H. Sigman 
    --That punitive damages would be excluded.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="537.850" stopTime="538.652">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    --Well.
speaker="alfred_h_sigman" startTime="538.652" stopTime="545.126">
    Mr. Alfred H. Sigman 
    We're saying that the limitation imposed is--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="545.126" stopTime="586.824">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    But they're excluded not... not because of the... the manner of relief, but because there... there's no cause of action for them. 
    I mean it seems... this is a remedial section. 
    It... it's talking about what kind of relief to address violations. 
    Well, nevermind. 
    I don't want to take too much of your time. 
    Well, a short answer, I suppose, is that inequitable relief is excluded. 
    [Laughter] 
    Or inappropriate equitable relief. 
    And what do you make out of the (a)(5), where it gives the Secretary the power to sue, doesn't it? 
    Isn't it (a)(5)?
speaker="alfred_h_sigman" startTime="586.824" stopTime="589.596">
    Mr. Alfred H. Sigman 
    --Yes. 
    (A)(5) gives the Secretary the power to bring a suit--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="589.596" stopTime="593.940">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    And it... it says "any other appropriate relief", doesn't it?
speaker="alfred_h_sigman" startTime="593.940" stopTime="601.715">
    Mr. Alfred H. Sigman 
    --No. 
    It's equitable relief. 
    I apologize to the Court. 
    The term equitable was mistakenly omitted from the... from our briefs.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="601.715" stopTime="602.516">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    So it's--

    On my part.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="603.097" stopTime="604.857">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    --Still is equitable relief.

    Mr. Alfred H. Sigman 
    Yes, yes. 
    (A)(3) and (a)(5), in terms of the release... relief available, is identical. 
    And equitable relief is provided for and I apologize to the Court for the mistake, the omission in the brief.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="615.573" stopTime="623.850">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, that's interesting. 
    I thought you were going... I thought we could make the big argument about Congress must have intended something different. 
    [Laughter]
speaker="alfred_h_sigman" startTime="623.850" stopTime="722.485">
    Mr. Alfred H. Sigman 
    I'm sorry to disappoint the Court. 
    [Laughter] 
    As this Court has stated in the Firestone case, ERISA's legislative history further demonstrates that Congress had intended Federal courts to develop Federal common law in fashioning the additional appropriate equitable relief described in section 502. 
    The legislative history also demonstrates that Congress intended to engraft traditional trust law principles into ERISA's remedial scheme. 
    Moreover, a fundamental concept of trust law is that courts will give to the beneficiaries of a trust those remedies which are necessary to... for the protection of their interests. 
    And it's also a fundamental concept and principle of trust law that a knowing participant in a breach of fiduciary duty is as responsible as the fiduciary for the breach. 
    In this particular case, the relief which we urged the Court to approve is essential in order to fulfill the act's remedial purposes, among the most important being to deter fiduciary breaches which frequently could not happen without the assistance of a knowing participant in that breach. 
    In addition, as I've stated earlier the fundamental and most important remedial feature of ERISA is to assure the interests of retirees in the pension benefits that they were promised under the terms of the plan. 
    Imposing the liability which we seek here on knowing participants would thereby further ERISA's remedial goals. 
    It would eliminate any incentive that a nonfiduciary might have to assist or to induce a fiduciary to breach his ERISA responsibilities. 
    I'd like to turn to the OBRA argument, if I may.

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Let... let me ask you, Mr. Sigman, if I may, section 409(a) talks about the liability of... of a fiduciary. 
    Is that correct?
speaker="alfred_h_sigman" startTime="736.474" stopTime="736.815">
    Mr. Alfred H. Sigman 
    That's correct.

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist

speaker="alfred_h_sigman" startTime="745.830" stopTime="752.325">
    Mr. Alfred H. Sigman 
    That's correct. 
    And I think that 409, Your Honor, also demonstrates that that relief can encompass monetary relief.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="752.325" stopTime="752.615">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well--
speaker="alfred_h_sigman" startTime="752.615" stopTime="761.291">
    Mr. Alfred H. Sigman 
    Because the... at the beginning of the section it says 
    "shall be personally liable to make good to such plan any losses to the plan resulting from each such breach. "
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="761.291" stopTime="762.471">

    Mr. Alfred H. Sigman

speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="770.878" stopTime="786.550">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    And then 502(a), section (1)(3), if the civil action brought by a participant benefit a fiduciary, that can be brought to obtain other appropriate equitable relief.
speaker="alfred_h_sigman" startTime="786.550" stopTime="787.489">
    Mr. Alfred H. Sigman 
    That's correct.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="787.489" stopTime="800.508">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    So that in one... in 509 it talks about equitable or remedial relief, then this section talks about appropriate equitable relief. 
    Do you think Congress was really being careful in the terms it used?
speaker="alfred_h_sigman" startTime="800.508" stopTime="813.566">
    Mr. Alfred H. Sigman 
    I would say that the statute could have been more carefully crafted. 
    For example, the... for the phrase "equitable or remedial relief", I don't really think, frankly, that there's much difference between equitable and remedial.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="813.566" stopTime="816.668">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    It just sounds like someone was talking off the top of their head that had been to first year law school.
speaker="alfred_h_sigman" startTime="816.668" stopTime="842.496">
    Mr. Alfred H. Sigman 
    It sounds... I believe that it's a redundant phrase. 
    But I do think, despite the sloppiness in the drafting of the statute, that 409 does establish that it's appropriate to seek relief which would provide all losses or restore all losses lost to the plan. 
    In the 1989 OBRA amendment to ERISA, which added a new subsection, 502(l), Congress--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="842.496" stopTime="856.878">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    May I just ask one question before you go on to the other argument? 
    Your claim is that the... the breach of fiduciary obligation, not exactly negligence but the work of the actuary in combination with the fiduciary, caused the plan to be underfunded.
speaker="alfred_h_sigman" startTime="856.878" stopTime="858.148">
    Mr. Alfred H. Sigman 
    --That's correct, Your Honor.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="858.148" stopTime="863.810">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    And is the relief that you're asking for that those individuals should pay the amount of the underfunding into the plan?
speaker="alfred_h_sigman" startTime="863.810" stopTime="881.802">
    Mr. Alfred H. Sigman 
    Actually, it... it could go beyond just the amount of the underfunding into the plan. 
    We're seeking to... relief which would make the plan whole. 
    And, in other words, we're seeking relief that would result in a full benefit, a full retirement benefit, as originally provided for in the terms of the plan, to the retirees of the plan.

    Mr. Alfred H. Sigman 
    --Well, because the PBGC has taken over the plan, the whole group has not suffered economic loss. 
    Of the approximately 2,000 participants in the plan, only 143 fell above the threshold that the PBGC has required... in other words, the PBGC will pay a full benefit to each participant or retiree--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="912.052" stopTime="916.587">

    Mr. Alfred H. Sigman

    Mr. Alfred H. Sigman 
    Once again, it's not in the record, but the best answer I can give you is that in the context of the litigation, the PBGC produced what it called a termination report, indicating that the losses to the plan were in excess of $50 million.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="958.842" stopTime="959.663">

    $50 million.

    My clients--

    Mr. Alfred H. Sigman 
    --Jointly and severally liable with the fiduciaries.

    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    With the... and all of whom are individuals, right?
speaker="alfred_h_sigman" startTime="970.400" stopTime="1070.425">
    Mr. Alfred H. Sigman 
    Correct. 
    The company itself, Kaiser, was also, we contended, a fiduciary of the plan. 
    But given the fact that Kaiser was in bankruptcy, we did not bring suit against Kaiser originally. 
    Just very briefly in terms of the OBRA argument, I wanted to point out to the Court that the OBRA argument provides that the Secretary may impose a civil penalty, not only on a fiduciary who commits a breach, but also on any other person who knowingly participates in such a breach. 
    The civil penalty was set at 20 percent of the recovery amount, which was defined in the statute as an amount recovered by the Secretary in an action brought by him under section 502(a)(2) or (a)(5). 
    The OBRA amendment, we contend, also confirms that the term appropriate equitable relief includes the remedy of restoring all losses to the plan. 
    Under OBRA the Secretary may reduce or waive the civil penalty if he finds that its imposition would impair the ability of the fiduciary or, in the language of the statute, the other person, to restore all losses to the plan. 
    We believe that that demonstrates that Congress' primary purpose was to assure that losses to the plan would be restored, and not only restored by the breaching fiduciary, but restored also by those who knowingly participate or participated in the breach of fiduciary duty. 
    In closing, I would urge the Court to reverse the decision of the court of appeals so as to leave these retirees in a position that is better than they would have been in, rather than worse than they would have been in prior to the enactment of ERISA. 
    Thank you.

   Argument of Ronald J. Mann
speaker="ronald_j_mann" startTime="1118.440" stopTime="1175.337">
    Mr. Ronald J. Mann 
    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    The question in this case is whether ERISA deprived beneficiaries of their traditional equitable remedies against parties who knowingly participate in a breach of trust. 
    In our view, the answer is found in the text of section 502(a)(3), which authorizes courts to award appropriate equitable relief to redress violations of ERISA and ERISA plans. 
    Although compensatory damages normally are considered legal relief, it is clear in the trust context that equitable relief includes a right to compensatory relief which accordingly should be available under section 502(a)(3). 
    That reading of the statute is bolstered by indications from related provisions of the statute, as well as the practical consequences of a contrary reading.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1175.337" stopTime="1193.487">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Mr. Mann, if you go to the subsection immediately before the one you're talking about, section 502(a)(1)(2), I guess, is where it talks about 
    "A civil action may be brought by the Secretary or by a participant for appropriate relief under section 1109. " 
    What does 1109 provide?
speaker="ronald_j_mann" startTime="1193.487" stopTime="1198.131">
    Mr. Ronald J. Mann 
    1109... I'm looking at the appendix to our brief, which is page la to the appendix of our brief.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1198.131" stopTime="1198.853">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    That's what I'm looking at.
speaker="ronald_j_mann" startTime="1198.853" stopTime="1231.204">
    Mr. Ronald J. Mann 
    Okay. 
    It has 409(a) and 502(a) on the same page. 
    409(a) is the provision which is in part 4, that deals with fiduciaries, that establishes the types of relief that can be secured against fiduciaries by the plan. 
    That is carried forward into 502(a) and 502(a)(2), at which you look. 
    I assume that you're referring to the phrase 409(a). 
    And as you noted, it is somewhat different from the phrase 502(a)(3), which is--

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well--

speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1232.874" stopTime="1251.456">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    --Yes, but then 502(a)(2) speaks simply about appropriate relief without using the term equitable. 
    So we have in 409(a) equitable or remedial used in the disjunctive. 
    In subsection (2), appropriate relief without any modifying adjective.
speaker="ronald_j_mann" startTime="1251.456" stopTime="1252.077">
    Mr. Ronald J. Mann 
    That--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1252.077" stopTime="1255.888">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    And then in (3) we have appropriate equitable relief. 
    Are we talking about three different things?
speaker="ronald_j_mann" startTime="1255.888" stopTime="1297.096">
    Mr. Ronald J. Mann 
    --No, no. 
    I think that... I think that what you look at is in... ERISA, traditionally, has been understood to refer to traditional principles of trust law. 
    If you look at traditional principles of trust law, the most likely source and the source this Court has looked at is the restatement of trusts. 
    And the restatement of trusts establishes two types of remedies. 
    There are some legal remedies and there are some equitable remedies, and they are described in different sections. 
    In our view, the relief under 502(a)(3), the reference to equitable relief should refer to the equitable remedies that were available at trust law. 
    In section 409 when they refer to equitable or remedial relief, we believe they also intended to include... include the legal remedies that were available at trust law.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1297.096" stopTime="1302.170">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    What does remedial relief mean that the word relief by itself wouldn't mean?
speaker="ronald_j_mann" startTime="1302.170" stopTime="1318.473">
    Mr. Ronald J. Mann 
    Well, I... I share your view that remedial relief is... remedial is probably not the best word. 
    I would assume, though, that what that word has to mean is a reference to legal relief, and what they're trying to say is equitable or legal relief. 
    It seems to me remedial is an adjective that means having to do with relief.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1318.473" stopTime="1318.893">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    It means relief.
speaker="ronald_j_mann" startTime="1318.893" stopTime="1332.394">
    Mr. Ronald J. Mann 
    But to make sense out of the statute, it seems to me that we should assume that when Congress says equitable in one place and equitable or remedial next to it, that we have to find some meaning of the word remedial. 
    And the most obvious meaning--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1332.394" stopTime="1333.906">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    You're just kind of throwing up your hands.
speaker="ronald_j_mann" startTime="1333.906" stopTime="1378.902">
    Mr. Ronald J. Mann 
    --Well, no, but I mean the most... the most obvious meaning of... of the word in context is those things that are not equitable, which is the legal relief described in the restatement. 
    And it also makes some sense because if you look at the types of things that are legal relief and are not equitable relief, they are actions that would lie solely against the fiduciary. 
    And so it would make some sense that when Congress drafted section 409 for remedies against the fiduciary, it would say you get not only equitable relief but also the very limited types of legal relief that were available at the common law. 
    In section 502(a)(3), which is not directed solely at fiduciaries, there would be no reason to... to have that included, because anything that you can get against a fiduciary has already been included in section 409.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="1378.902" stopTime="1390.781">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    What... what do you... what do you refer to when you say you... legal relief does not mean to you money damages; money damages against the fiduciary is not legal relief?
speaker="ronald_j_mann" startTime="1390.781" stopTime="1409.134">
    Mr. Ronald J. Mann 
    Ordinarily, money damages are legal relief. 
    But ERISA is a statute that is enacted in the trust context, and in the trust context it's extremely clear... it is extremely clear in the trust context that equitable relief includes compensatory... you can call it compensatory damages, because that's really what it is.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="1409.134" stopTime="1414.787">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Right. 
    But what... what is the legal relief that's available in the trust context then?
speaker="ronald_j_mann" startTime="1414.787" stopTime="1443.978">
    Mr. Ronald J. Mann 
    The... the restatement describes two types of legal relief. 
    One of them is for disbursement of money that is immediately and unconditionally due to the beneficiary under the terms of the trust. 
    For example, if you have a classic spendthrift trust under which the beneficiary is not supposed to relieve any... receive anything until he turns 25, and at 25 the corpus of the trust is to be disbursed to him. 
    If he files a lawsuit, he's 26 years old, he can go into a... could go to a court of law and get that relief. 
    And the second one--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="1443.978" stopTime="1448.540">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Well, but that's no longer available. 
    I... I mean the trust is over, the trust is at an end.
speaker="ronald_j_mann" startTime="1448.540" stopTime="1456.134">
    Mr. Ronald J. Mann 
    --But if the... but if the trustee refuses to give him the property, before ERISA was passed he would have a lawsuit to get the property. 
    Understandably--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="1456.134" stopTime="1460.458">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    It's not a lawsuit under the trust, however. 
    It's a lawsuit quite apart from the trust, so of course it's at law.
speaker="ronald_j_mann" startTime="1460.458" stopTime="1463.480">
    Mr. Ronald J. Mann 
    --That... that's... that is exactly right. 
    But that is the legal--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="1463.480" stopTime="1464.461">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Okay, what's... what's the second one?
speaker="ronald_j_mann" startTime="1464.461" stopTime="1474.129">
    Mr. Ronald J. Mann 
    --The second... the second one is actually quite similar. 
    The second one is if the... if the thing to be disbursed is not money but a chattel, which, I mean, has basically the same type of analysis.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1474.129" stopTime="1483.715">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    If the thing... but what was the common law legal remedy for breach of fiduciary duties such as... as alleged in this case?
speaker="ronald_j_mann" startTime="1483.715" stopTime="1623.856">
    Mr. Ronald J. Mann 
    There... you... you would have an action... in the restatement it's under section 199(c) and it's an action... an action which actually uses words very similar to section 502(a)(3). 
    It's an action to compel the trustee to redress a breach of trust. 
    This... and if you look at the... the commentary to section 199, it makes clear that the relief was compensatory relief. 
    One of the examples, for example, is if the trustee has invested money in a bank that he should have known would fail. 
    The bank fails, the money is no longer there, the trustee is personally obligated to make the trust whole for the loss. 
    In... this case involves a suit where the trustee did not breach the trust by himself, but there is a person who knowingly participated with the trustee in the breach of trust. 
    Now, at common law the understand... before ERISA, the understanding was we can't expect the trustee to sue the person who participated with him in the breach of trust, so we will allow the beneficiary himself to sue to recover the money for the trust. 
    And... and that is the action that's at issue here, and that's described in another part of the restatement, in section 326, and it's also referred to in the treatises cited in our brief. 
    We think that the statute very clearly was referring to this particular cause of action because section 502(a)(3) uses the word "redress", which is exactly the word that's used in the particular section of the restatement and the natural meaning of the word, if you look in dictionaries, is to compensate or to pay back. 
    One further point I'd like to make, which I think is one of the key considerations in this case, is the practical consequences of a contrary reading of the statute. 
    ERISA has its remedies for... civil remedies set forth in section 502(a), which this Court has described as very comprehensive. 
    Except for section 502(a)(3), there is no provision that generally allows a civil action to recover for a breach of ERISA. 
    There are quite a number of important provisions of ERISA for which there is simply no remedy outside of section 502(a)(3). 
    We could look at the provision at issue in Ingersoll-Rand, for example, which made it a violation of ERISA to fire an employee to prohibit his pension plan from vesting. 
    If individuals who are harmed by violations of those provisions cannot sue under section 502(a)(3) for compensatory damages, then ERISA has effectively left them without a remedy.

    Under 502(a)(3), it's for violations of a plan or a provision of this subchapter.

    Mr. Ronald J. Mann 
    --Right. 
    It's the duty of care for fiduciaries. 
    But as I was explaining, in considering the--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="1698.674" stopTime="1722.060">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    That is only a duty on the fiduciaries. 
    Where... where is the duty created on the part of the nonfiduciaries? 
    I mean you have a section 409(a) which creates a duty on the part of fiduciaries. 
    It gives a cause of action. 
    Where... where is the section that would be the equivalent creating a duty and a cause of action with respect to nonfiduciaries. 
    It just isn't there, is it?
speaker="ronald_j_mann" startTime="1722.060" stopTime="1767.041">
    Mr. Ronald J. Mann 
    --Okay. 
    There are... there two answers to that. 
    The first answer is if you look at section 502(a)(3), and in particular at 502(a)(3)(b)(i), this is on page la of the appendix to our brief, the... the relief is to redress the violation. 
    And we submit that in determining what is appropriate equitable relief to redress the violation, you should look to what relief was available before ERISA was passed under principles of equity, which includes relief against not only the fiduciary, but against a third party. 
    The second point, which is very important, is that section 502(l)(1)(a), (l)(1)(b), makes it a violation of ERISA for another person to knowingly participate in a breach. 
    So at least in this type of situation, the party has violated ERISA because, if nothing else, he's violated section 502(l)(1)(b).

   Argument of Steven H. Frankel
speaker="steven_h_frankel" startTime="1771.325" stopTime="1837.195">
    Mr. Steven H. Frankel 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    As you now have heard, the petitioners' and the Solicitor General's argument is based on two fundamental premises. 
    First, that equitable relief includes money damages. 
    And second, unless the 1989 amendment to the statute is read to provide that equitable relief includes money damages, it will be rendered, in essence, a nullity. 
    I will demonstrate why neither of those premises can be sustained, since they violate ERISA's language and are inconsistent with its structure. 
    One of the first things each of us learned as law students is that equitable relief does not include money damages. 
    Yet petitioners' and the Solicitor General's interpretation turns to the--

    But ERISA did not adopt lock, stock, and barrel, the exclusive jurisdiction of common law equity courts. 
    At common law, equity courts had exclusive jurisdiction over trust cases, and they were able to award both legal and equitable remedies because they had the exclusive jurisdiction over those cases. 
    ERISA, while influenced by the common law of trusts, only selectively incorporated certain of those principles.

    Mr. Steven H. Frankel

    Mr. Steven H. Frankel 
    Yes. 
    Yes, I can, Justice White. 
    And let me try to show that to you by contrasting what Congress provided for in assessing the liabilities of fiduciaries under section 409 with the relief provided for in section 502(a)(3), which does not apply to fiduciaries. 
    409 first says that a fiduciary is personally liable for making good to the plan any losses that the plan sustains as a result of a breach, restoring profits to the plan made through use of plan assets, and shall be subject to such other equitable or remedial relief as the court deems appropriate. 
    Conspicuously absent from section 502(a)(3) are any mention of the so-called make-whole remedy or any mention of the term remedial relief.

    Who... who can sue to enforce 409?

    Mr. Steven H. Frankel 
    Under section 502(a)(2). 
    Section 502(a)(2) says that plan participants, fiduciaries, and the Secretary of Labor can sue for appropriate relief under 409, which is the fiduciary provision.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2024.602" stopTime="2029.654">

    Mr. Steven H. Frankel 
    Section (a)(5) gives the Secretary of Labor the right to seek injunctive and other appropriate equitable relief, just as section 502(a)(3) gives plan participants the right to seek injunctive--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2044.884" stopTime="2058.351">
    Justice Byron R. White

speaker="steven_h_frankel" startTime="2058.351" stopTime="2101.833">
    Mr. Steven H. Frankel 
    --That's correct. 
    And money damages, make-whole relief, can only be obtained from fiduciaries, not against nonfiduciaries like Hewitt. 
    ERISA was enacted to establish standards of conduct, obligation, and responsibility for fiduciaries. 
    And in certain carefully circumscribed areas, it dealt with nonfiduciaries as well. 
    But what ERISA did, and really the fundamental distinction around which this whole statute is crafted, is the distinction that ERISA draws between fiduciaries and nonfiduciaries.

    Mr. Frankel, am I... am I correct... I don't recall whether you made the argument, I guess I should have asked the other side, but they have very little time left. 
    In... it would not have been... it would not have been necessary to mention the Secretary... in (a)(2), which says that the Secretary, a participant, or a beneficiary or fiduciary can sue under 409(a), it wouldn't have been necessary to mention the Secretary in... in 1132(a)(2) if (a)(3) and (a)(5) mean what the Government says it means.

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Because (a)(5) would automatically... if it included all relief, legal as well as equitable, the Secretary would have all the power he needed under... under (5) and he wouldn't have to have been given anything under (2).

    Mr. Steven H. Frankel 
    That's correct. 
    To contrast what ERISA did with fiduciaries as to what existed at common law, I think it's important to note that at common law only trustees were in a fiduciary relationship with a trust and its beneficiaries. 
    Under ERISA, on the other hand, not only are the trustees in a fiduciary relationship with the trust, but ERISA deems any person who exercises any discretion or control over a plan or its assets to also be a fiduciary. 
    What it does is it greatly expands the universe of accountable persons who can be liable for plan losses under the statute for a breach of fiduciary duty. 
    What it does, on the other hand, is work a concomitant reduction on the relief that can be obtained from nonfiduciaries. 
    And that is--

    But if the fiduciaries with whom the actuary is alleged to have conspired were parties, would... would there be a... would a cause of action have been stated against them under the statute, seeking relief in the nature of recoupment to the trust of the amount that was lost?

    And that is the... that is where ERISA crafts the distinction between fiduciaries and nonfiduciaries. 
    Congress recognized that plans would interact with professional service providers.

    Mr. Steven H. Frankel 
    We don't agree with that position, Justice Scalia.

    I didn't think you did.

    Mr. Steven H. Frankel 
    In fact, what your position really is is that what the petitioners and the Solicitor General are asking this Court to do is to take the words that appear in 409 and imply them into 502(a)(3). 
    That position cannot be sustained, since it will result in destroying a carefully comprehensive structure that Congress crafted. 
    It will destroy the distinction between fiduciaries, on the one hand, and nonfiduciaries on the other hand.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="3112.438" stopTime="3125.035">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    But you are willing to imply into... into 502(a)(3) the cause of action that's set forth in 409(a), just not the remedies.
speaker="steven_h_frankel" startTime="3125.035" stopTime="3273.535">
    Mr. Steven H. Frankel 
    That... that... that is not our... our position, Justice Scalia. 
    Our position is that the issue presented to the Court is what kind of relief can be obtained against a nonfiduciary. 
    What cause of action that may account for is really irrelevant. 
    I should note, however, that our amici did make a powerful argument that no knowing participation cause of action exists under the statute. 
    We don't take a position on that because our focus is on the relief that is available against a nonfiduciary. 
    With regard to the balance that ERISA struck, I just want to make a couple of points. 
    Like all statutes, ERISA was the result of a balance that was struck by Congress. 
    They sought to protect and promote the interests of plan beneficiaries and participants on the one hand, but they also, Congress, wanted to encourage the voluntary formation of employee benefit plans without unduly increasing costs. 
    Now while plan fiduciaries retain professional service providers, as the plan fiduciaries in this case retained Hewitt, the issue is where does the line get drawn between fiduciaries and service providers. 
    ERISA provides that answer. 
    ERISA says that a plan professional service provider is not a fiduciary, so long as the service provider exercises his normal professional functions and does not exercise any discretion or control over the administration or... administration of a plan or its assets. 
    Here, the courts below found that Hewitt was not a fiduciary. 
    What petitioners are asking this Court to do is to impose fiduciary liability on Hewitt, even though it's been determined as a matter of law that Hewitt was not a fiduciary.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="3273.535" stopTime="3310.841">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    May I state what I understand to be... I didn't understand from the briefs, quite frankly, but in response to my last question to Mr. Mann, he said the provision of the subchapter that they said was violated was 404. 
    And that... you then read 502(a) is saying 
    "A civil action may be brought by a participant. " 
    and so forth, 
    "to enjoin any act or practice that violates any provision of this subchapter. " 
    namely 404, "and to obtain", blank, blank, blank, "appropriate equitable relief". 
    Now, why can't that... why can't "appropriate equitable relief" in such an action include conspirators with the fiduciary?
speaker="steven_h_frankel" startTime="3310.841" stopTime="3314.253">
    Mr. Steven H. Frankel 
    For two reasons. 
    One--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="3314.253" stopTime="3315.954">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Ignoring 409 entirely.
speaker="steven_h_frankel" startTime="3315.954" stopTime="3361.114">
    Mr. Steven H. Frankel 
    --Ignoring... ignoring 409. 
    What... what... what ERISA says is that a person is either, in essence, a fiduciary or not a fiduciary. 
    And given that ERISA expands the universe of fiduciaries, it says that only fiduciaries can be held liable for losses sustained by the plan, while working a concomitant reduction on what relief can be obtained from nonfiduciaries. 
    And to accept a conspiracy or other theory, one would have to conclude that by conspiring with the plan fiduciaries, then in essence--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="3361.114" stopTime="3361.415">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    The became a fiduciary.
speaker="steven_h_frankel" startTime="3361.415" stopTime="3362.144">
    Mr. Steven H. Frankel 
    --That they became a fiduciary.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="3362.144" stopTime="3370.081">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Well either you have to conclude that or conclude that Congress meant by the words appropriate relief, relief that would have been appropriate under common law precedents.
speaker="steven_h_frankel" startTime="3370.081" stopTime="3375.793">
    Mr. Steven H. Frankel 
    That is a possible interpretation. 
    That is one with which we strongly disagree.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="3375.793" stopTime="3376.304">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    You disagree, of course.
speaker="steven_h_frankel" startTime="3376.304" stopTime="3388.971">
    Mr. Steven H. Frankel 
    And I think the whole structure of the statute shows that Congress didn't decide to take the common law of trusts and the exclusive jurisdiction of equity courts and import that into ERISA.

    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    What is your position on the preemption question that Justice Kennedy asked earlier? 
    Does a cause of action remain against the actuary at... under State law, or has it been preempted?
speaker="steven_h_frankel" startTime="3400.181" stopTime="3408.506">
    Mr. Steven H. Frankel 
    That... that issue has not been presented to this Court before, as to whether actions against nonfiduciary service providers are preempted.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="3408.506" stopTime="3411.879">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Do you have a position on the question... I know it hasn't... and I know it isn't before us, but it affects our thinking.
speaker="steven_h_frankel" startTime="3411.879" stopTime="3440.225">
    Mr. Steven H. Frankel 
    However, this Court may conclude if it holds, as we think it should, that money damages are not encompassed with appropriate equitable relief, that it would agree with the district court in this case, in an appropriate case, that professional malpractice claims or common law tort claims against nonfiduciary service providers may not be preempted by ERISA.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3440.225" stopTime="3479.743">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, Mr. Frankel, is it... we have ERISA cases coming out our ears these days. 
    [Laughter] 
    And I'm glad to find that there's a section here that is crystal clear. 
    Or at least allegedly so. 
    Mr. Frankel, clarify your last answer. 
    You... you are of the position that any... any common law State action against nonfiduciaries based on trust obligations are precluded.
speaker="steven_h_frankel" startTime="3479.743" stopTime="3486.686">
    Mr. Steven H. Frankel 
    I believe that that is a... is... would be consistent with existing law, although--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="3486.686" stopTime="3493.560">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    The only thing you're conceding is that there may be some tort claims against them or some extra trust claims remaining.
speaker="steven_h_frankel" startTime="3493.560" stopTime="3506.540">
    Mr. Steven H. Frankel 
    --Extra trust claims. 
    I mean, what obligations are imposed by the statute on fiduciary... nonfiduciary service providers? 
    I think there would a strong argument that claims based on that would be preempted.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="3506.540" stopTime="3512.234">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Of course, the question will be whether that action relates to an ERISA plan, the way this Court's been construing this.
speaker="steven_h_frankel" startTime="3512.234" stopTime="3558.687">
    Mr. Steven H. Frankel 
    I... I agree with you, Justice Stevens. 
    However, whether common law tort claims or other claims against nonfiduciary service providers fall within the conspicuous breadth of ERISA's preemption clause is really a matter that Congress may ultimately have to decide. 
    If, for example, this Court were to conclude in an appropriate case that such common law claims against nonfiduciaries would be preempted and would leave people without a place to go to get the money damages they might otherwise be entitled to, but with which they cannot obtain it under ERISA. 
    If there are no further questions, I have nothing further. 
    Thank you.
