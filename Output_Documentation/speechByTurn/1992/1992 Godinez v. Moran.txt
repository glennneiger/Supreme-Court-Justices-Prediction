    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    We'll hear argument next in No. 92-725, Salvador Godinez v. Richard Allan Moran. 
    Mr. Sarnowski.
speaker="david_f_sarnowski" startTime="45.751" stopTime="166.159">
    Mr. David F. Sarnowski 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    Thousands of cases are processed in our criminal justice system in both the state and Federal courts throughout this land each day. 
    The lesser number involve the issue of whether or not a defendant is competent to proceed to trial. 
    In this case the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in Federal habeas corpus review of a state court conviction and the imposition of three death sentences concluded that there is a heightened standard for the determination of whether a defendant may proceed to either waive counsel or to enter a plea of guilty, which occurred in this case. 
    We take exception to that ruling, and that is the issue that brings us here today. 
    However, there are some underlying findings by the state trial court that I would like to direct the Court's attention to, specifically they appear at page 21 of the Joint Appendix. 
    At that point the trial judge. 
    Judge Leavitt, determined that this petitioner, Richard Moran, was in fact competent. 
    He utilized language which tracked a Nevada statute on point, Nevada revised statute 178.400, which in turn is a formulation of this Court's pronouncement in Dusky. 
    He also made an express finding that Mr. Moran knew the consequences of his plea of guilty and that he can intelligently and knowingly waive his constitutional right to the assistance of counsel. 
    In 1988 the judge made additional findings which also appear in the trial record and are before this Court, particularly at the pages D-7 and D-8 of the petition.

    --Yes, Your Honor, that is a critical choice that each defendant if they choose to proceed to trial must make. 
    If they choose to proceed to trial they must decide whether or not they are going to have a jury trial or have a bench trial in those states which allow a defendant to waive a jury trial. 
    Those are critical determinations that the defendant has to make. 
    They are, in our estimation, equally important as to a defendant's cause as is the decision by a defendant to waive counsel or to plead.

    He must make a reasoned choice at all stages of the proceedings, and if he at some point in time does not meet a competency standard, then as an officer of the court it's up to his counsel or the prosecutor or up to the court sua sponte to ascertain whether the proceeding should be suspended or not.

    Mr. David F. Sarnowski 
    --Yes. 
    But in the sequence of events that may well happen a judge may proceed on a Boykin canvas or a Faretta canvas in terms of a defendant waiving counsel and ascertain that a further inquiry into competence is necessary. 
    The competence evaluation does not necessarily occur first in every instance. 
    Here the totality of the circumstances that faced the trial judge understandably did not peak any further inquiry once he had made his conclusion. 
    It has to be noted from the record that both trial counsel appointed to represent Mr. Moran in these two separate incidences were present in court up to the time that the judge made his finding that Mr. Moran was competent. 
    And in fact at the conclusion of the competence determination before the judge allowed them to be discharged the record clearly reflects that he asked them if they had anything to say to the court or to address the court and they chose not to and indicated that the judge had covered what was necessary. 
    At that point in time the judge had fulfilled the requisite requirements under Dusky. 
    However, the question before us is did the Ninth Circuit standard require a baseline of constitutional due process for those defendants either waiving counsel or pleading guilty which is higher than the baseline this Court established in Dusky. 
    It is our contention that no such standard is required by the pronouncements of this Court, nor should one be applied for there are several problems that ensue because of it, the first and not the least of which is if you require a defendant to be more competent to waive counsel in some instances you do not allow a defendant to exercise the parallel right to represent himself, which this Court clearly set out in Faretta.

    Mr. David F. Sarnowski 
    No, we would not. 
    As I indicated earlier, each defendant throughout the process has to make reasoned choices. 
    They may not be a choice you or I would make if we were standing in his shoes or they may not be the choice that with hindsight we would say was the best choice available to him, but it's the defendant's choice. 
    In fact in noting the opposition to our initial petition for certiorari the respondent in this case indicated that it was merely a matter of semantics as to the argument involved and that our petition did not present a question that this Court should consider.

    --Your Honor, the Ninth Circuit relied on a premise that merely because the state courts applied an incorrect standard as far as the law is concerned that its factual findings were not due any deference, and we would certainly take issue with that. 
    The facts are what they are, regardless of the applicable legal standard. 
    It is clear that this Court's pronouncements in Maggio v. Fulford and Miller v. Fenton require deference by the Federal courts to findings of historical fact for state criminal defendants. 
    That did not occur in this case, and in fact we would go so far as to say that the circuit court panel considering the case substituted its own facts for those not found to be weighty in the state court system. 
    For instance, they relied on certain extracts from a Physicians' Desk Reference and noted that certain medications that the defendant was using at the time of his plea had certain properties.

    Regardless of the standard to be applied they should not have substituted its judgment and allocated different weights than the state courts. 
    In this particular instance the state trial judge when he conducted the post conviction review hearing in 1988 expressly declined to find that the mere fact that the defendant was under the influence of some prescription medications had any significant weight, and as a matter of fact he found that the defendant had failed under state law to bear his burden of proof to show that that had any medical significance in that--

    Mr. David F. Sarnowski 
    That is the question presented. 
    However, the circuit court's conclusion in this case was inextricably bound to its own substituted facts. 
    And it is our position that had it not substituted the facts, even under the heightened standard, the defendant in this case could not prevail, and clearly he could not prevail under the standard that we espouse before the Court. 
    In this instance the trial judge looked at the totality of circumstances to assess the defendant's competence, and only when he concluded that he was competend did he proceed to a very thorough Faretta canvas which appears in this record. 
    And then and only then did he allow waiver of counsel, and then he proceeded into a very thorough plea canvas which comports fully with this Court's holdings in Boykin and the subsequent cases that ensued as a result of Boykin. 
    Although the defendant contested the knowing and intelligent quality of the pleas that he entered, those legal determinations were made in the state courts. 
    And truly the Federal courts never got to the issue because the Ninth Circuit's holding was grounded in its ruling that as a matter of law that the higher standard applied in this case. 
    It never got to the intelligent and knowing waiver issues. 
    However, in further response to Justice Kennedy's initial inquiry, once competence is ascertained it is our belief that there are protections built into the system, the requirements that those canvases in both Faretta instances and Boykin instances must be knowing and intelligent, and that together the Dusky standard, the Faretta standard, and the Boykin standard provide the minimal due process that each defendant should have in our system before they are held to account for their actions in a criminal court, be it state or Federal. 
    If the Court has no further questions I would like to reserve the remainder of my time.

    Very well, Mr. Sarnowski. 
    Ms. Wax, we'll hear from you. 
   
   
   
   Argument of Amy L. Wax
speaker="amy_l_wax" startTime="954.865" stopTime="1049.216">
    Ms. Amy L. Wax 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    The position of the United States in this case is that a valid finding of competency to stand trial suffices to establish competency to plead guilty or waive counsel. 
    This Court formulated a test of competence over 30 years ago in Dusky v. United States, and we believe that it is still a workable standard for determining competency to perform all of the functions that a defendant may be called upon to perform in the course of standing trial. 
    Now there are a number of reasons why this Court should reject the idea that a person can go to trial and yet be unable to waive constitutional rights. 
    First, that view seriously distorts the meaning of Dusky and the standard of competence to stand trial in this Court's cases. 
    That standard must be understood in light of other cases of this Court such as Jones v. Barnes that identifies certain decisions that are ultimately for the defendant to make in the course of trial. 
    Therefore in order to be competent to stand trial an individual must at least have the potential capacity for basic decision making in response to well explained alternatives. 
    And there is no difference in principle or practice between the choices that confront defendants routinely at trial and the decisions at issue in this case.

    Ms. Amy L. Wax 
    Right. 
    We would distinguish between the need to be competent to make these decisions and whether the decisions are knowing and voluntary. 
    We think they are two distinct inquiries. 
    Now, a waiver being knowing and voluntary presumes competence. 
    Competence is a subsidiary finding that needs to be made before a waiver can be knowing and intelligent.

    Yes, but we think that's very different from what the court said in this case. 
    The Ninth Circuit didn't really say anything about, they didn't question the need to find the waiver knowing and voluntary. 
    They said that you first need to do an additional inquiry into competence, you need to stop everything and start over again when it comes to competence, make a finding on a distinct standard and then go on and do the inquiry into whether the competency inquiry is, whether the waiver is knowing and voluntary.

    Ms. Amy L. Wax 
    --We think they could look, be looked at under both rubrics. 
    The Ninth Circuit happened to look at those factors when it questioned the competence finding, but certainly with medication you could argue that in fact it goes more to whether it's knowing and voluntary because if you stop the medication then the person might change, and so competence is sort of a baseline state of the person. 
    We agree with that. 
    Now, now only is the adoption of multiple tests of competence illogical and unnecessary because decision-making ability really properly is part of the Dusky inquiry, but it also will have tremendous adverse effects on the trial process. 
    First of all it will endlessly multiply procedures, the procedures that the trial court must conduct. 
    It will require the trial court to bring the proceedings to a halt and conduct a fresh inquiry into competence every time it looks like the defense needs to make an important decision. 
    And this will raise all sorts of opportunities for doubt and error--

    The way the Ninth, we would say that the way the Ninth Circuit decided the case, although they did fault the court for not holding a hearing, we think they did hold a hearing by the way, ultimately the rule of decision here was that there was an erroneous standard for competence applied, and the Ninth Circuit implied that if Dusky really was the standard the findings, at least at the post conviction stage, hearing stage, would have been sufficient to ground a finding of competence.

    Mr. Cal J. Potter, III 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    This case is a straight forward application of Westbrook v. Arizona concerning due process where a doubtfully competent defendant seeks to waive constitutional rights such as the right to counsel. 
    In this instance the general pate and query as to competency to stand trial, to assist counsel, and understand the proceedings is not enough. 
    Due process requires a specific determination by the psychiatrist as to the defendant's competency to waive counsel. 
    This is not a case of heightened standards, but context-specific inquiries into the competency to waive counsel.

 Well then why, why then doesn't your argument boil down to what was suggested a moment ago, that you're really not necessarily... number one, you're not defending the Ninth Circuit, and number two, your argument really goes not to the need for a new standard of competence in general but to the need for as particularized an inquiry when there is a waiver of counsel as there is when there is a plea of guilty. 
 Isn't that what you're really arguing for now?

    That's correct, Your Honor. 
    What we're saying is in this insuance that because Mr. Moran was on medication... the competency is already made before the colloquy takes place. 
    The court is aware that he is on medication, yet unbelievably does not ask what kind of medication he is on.

    We didn't argue a heightened standard. 
    We did not argue a heightened standard to the Ninth Circuit, nor did we necessarily argue a heightened standard at any juncture in this case. 
    What we were arguing was that we were entitled to a hearing, that the court, because they knew this individual was on medication, they had already made a determination as to competency--

    Mr. Cal J. Potter, III 
    The finding would be as to law on the due process issue, and that's the distinction. 
    There may be a finding as to competency, as to actual competency that might have some kind of deference in terms of the fact finding, but what occurred here was a double barrelled argument. 
    We were talking about the medication as to actual competency, but we were also saying that we were entitled to a hearing based upon the fact that there was a question as to whether this individual could waive his counsel and whether in fact he was acting in his own self interest. 
    Our argument was essentially that Johnson-Zerbst invokes a protection of the trial court when the accused is without counsel to assure the voluntariness. 
    What it said was that there's a mixed fact. 
    The protecting duty imposes serious and weighty responsibilities upon the trial judge of determining whether there is an intelligent and competent waiver. 
    And we look to Justice Frankfurter and Jackson statements in Von Moltke v. Gillies about a searching inquiry of the court that there must be an understanding choice. 
    Now in Westbrook the Court reiterated the distinction between competency to stand trial with counsel and competency to proceed uncounseled. 
    It required a separate inquiry because Dusky addresses a different question. 
    Although it may be the same standard, the context specific is what is important, whether in fact you can assist counsel. 
    Our argument is that the plea to be voluntary must be understood. 
    Dusky does not answer the same three questions about waiver of counsel, about plea, and the mitigating evidence. 
    We look to Pate v. Robinson and Drope. 
    It says that demeanor is not enough. 
    So the mere fact that the trial court had the individual before them was not enough. 
    In addition, this Court said in Pate that a 6-year old re-analysis was not sufficient. 
    Due process does not require this higher standard, but requires a separate inquiry.

    Our argument was that the Nevada Supreme Court had adopted Melacor, the Pate type situation, which required them to go through a hearing, that Pate required them under a context-specific situation to make an additional determination of competency, his competency at that time to waive counsel and enter a plea.

    Now I understand you to be saying something different. 
    I understand you now to be saying that the failure here was in fact a failure under existing law, the existing law being that there is a continuing duty on the part of the court to make an inquiry into competence whenever facts come to the court's attention that might put that competence in question, and that the facts in this case were facts brought to the court's knowledge about the drug use, the medication that the defendant was on. 
    And so that your claim of error here is that the court did not fulfill its affirmative duty under existing case law to make a thorough inquiry to find out whether the medication had in fact rendered the individual incompetent.

    Yes. 
    We had made a double argument that in fact in terms of the medication that he was incompetent as to actual competency. 
    We also made an argument that the court was required, upon already knowing that there was a question as to his competency to stand trial and assist counsel because of the fact that he had committed suicide. 
    So they did a preliminary psychiatric examination. 
    But in addition to that when they were made aware of the medication we were also entitled to an additional competency hearing. 
    What really occurred here was no competency hearing at the time that these pleas were entered and the waiver of counsel was made.

    Mr. Cal J. Potter, III 
    That's correct, Your Honor. 
    But the incidence in this situation is that they did, the state courts did apply the wrong standard. 
    We were essentially dealing with an argument about competency to waive counsel, Westbrook, and they were dealing with Faretta. 
    We were talking about actual competency and they stayed with actual competency and did not do anything with our argument about due process in terms of the Pate analysis. 
    And those were the arguments that were made.

    The Ninth Circuit clearly disposed of this case below by applying the heightened standard. 
    At page A-27 of the petition the lower court's decision is set forth in which it says that certain observations made by the trial court were inadequate to show that Mr. Moran was competent according to the higher standard of reasoned choice that the law requires.

    Mr. David F. Sarnowski 
    I suppose it would border somewhat on speculation on my part, but it would seem that's one reading of their decision. 
    In this case if the higher standard does not apply, deference must be afforded. 
    Mr. Potter's argument was that no hearing was held, and that's what they really proffered to the Ninth Circuit as a basis for relief, fails to recognize that a hearing was held. 
    And although this Court has said that it is not the preferred method of assessing competence to have a hearing after the fact, the fact of the matter is that the same trial judge conducted a hearing and applied the burden of proof to the same party who had the burden under Nevada state law, Doggett v. State, a 1977 case, to show that he was incompetent. 
    Of course this Court just said last term that it is not impermissible to require a defendant to bear that burden of proof, in Medina. 
    He didn't bear that burden of proof, and in fact the judge was singularly unpersuaded by his proffer of evidence and his failure to show how the medication impacted the defendant at the time of the entry of plea and waiver of counsel situation. 
    The Nevada Supreme Court affirmed that. 
    He had his hearing. 
    And this Court's recent pronouncement in Keeney v. Thomiel Reyes would seem to say the fact that he didn't present the evidence then requires him to make a showing of cause and prejudice, and he hasn't even argued that, much less shown it. 
    He should not be given the second opportunity in the Federal courts to do what he had the opportunity to do, but did not, in the state courts. 
    If the Court has no further questions, I have no further argument.
