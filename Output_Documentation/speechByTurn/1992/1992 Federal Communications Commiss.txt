    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    We'll hear argument first Number 92-603, the Federal Communications Commission and the United States v. Beach Communications, Inc.-- 
    Mr. Manning.
speaker="john_f_manning" startTime="12.299" stopTime="147.478">
    Mr. John F. Manning 
    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    A divided panel of the D.C. Circuit took the extraordinary step of invalidating a portion of an act of Congress, the Cable Act of 1984, on rational basis grounds under the Fifth Amendment. 
    In particular, the court rejected Congress' judgment that there is less reason for imposing a franchise requirement when cable facilities serve only commonly owned, controlled, or managed multiple-unit dwellings. 
    Instead, the court concluded that the only rational dividing line between franchised and unfranchised facilities in the use of public rights-of-way. 
    We submit that the court of appeals erred in redrafting the reasonable line drawn by Congress in defining the term, 1984. 
    The crux of the issue in this case is the proper classification of satellite master antenna television, or SMATV. 
    Unlike traditional cable systems, which pick up distant signals at a remote antenna and transmit them to the community through wires running under or over the city streets, an SMATV facility typically sets up a rooftop antenna and then transmits programming by wire to units in a building or group of buildings. 
    In enacting the Cable Act of 1984, Congress had to decide whether and when an SMATV system should be treated like a traditional cable facility and made subject to franchise requirements. 
    Contrary to the court of appeals' decision, the line drawn by congress was a reasonable one: an SMATV system is exempt from any franchise requirement if the system serves only multiple-unit dwellings under common ownership, control, or management, and uses no public rights of way.

    Mr. John F. Manning 
    Well, the crux of this case is what a cable system is, and a cable system determines... one's status as a cable system determines whether one is subject to franchise requirements, but there are also other Federal requirements that apply to cable systems as well, such as--
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="164.909" stopTime="165.929">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    There are other--
speaker="john_f_manning" startTime="165.929" stopTime="166.911">
    Mr. John F. Manning 
    --There are--
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="166.911" stopTime="172.844">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    --Requirements that these cable operators, that these small cable operators are subject to.
speaker="john_f_manning" startTime="172.844" stopTime="219.227">
    Mr. John F. Manning 
    --That's right. 
    There are, for example, technical requirements dealing with signal interference, with the quality of the signal, and there are other requirements pertaining to rate regulation and so forth that apply to cable systems, but the only thing that's at issue here is whether it's constitutional to impose a franchise requirement on an SMATV facility that serves only commonly-owned buildings. 
    In enacting the so-called private cable exemption with its common-ownership requirement, Congress made the judgment that it did not want to impose franchise requirements on a building owner or condominium association that decides to put a satellite antenna on the building and provide cable television to its residents, perhaps as an amenity.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="219.227" stopTime="232.714">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Mr. Mann, when you are talking about a franchise requirement, are you talking about a requirement imposed by Congress, or a requirement that... franchise that allows local governments to impose?
speaker="john_f_manning" startTime="232.714" stopTime="252.309">
    Mr. John F. Manning 
    Under 47 U.S.C. section 541, Congress has provided that with the exception of facilities that are grandfathered under subsection (b) of that section, a cable operator... that is, a person who operates a cable system... must obtain a franchise before beginning to provide cable service.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="252.309" stopTime="254.560">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    And a franchise from the Federal Government.
speaker="john_f_manning" startTime="254.560" stopTime="273.072">
    Mr. John F. Manning 
    Franchise... a franchising authority... it's not clear what they mean by franchise. 
    The act describes a franchise authority as a Federal, State, or local authority that has power to issue a license, but in practice what it means is a State or local franchise, not a Federal franchise, Your Honor.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="273.072" stopTime="282.670">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    So although the act may not be clear, that is in practice what happens. 
    If you're subject to this requirement you must get a franchise from a State or local government.
speaker="john_f_manning" startTime="282.670" stopTime="342.467">
    Mr. John F. Manning 
    That's correct. 
    That's correct, it's a State or local... in practice a State or local franchise requirement, and what Congress decided was that if a building owner or a condo association decides to put a satellite dish on the roof of the building and provide cable service to its tenants, then that would not be subject to a local franchise requirement. 
    Similarly, if the same building owner or condo association ran a couple of buildings, or ran a building complex and put a satellite antenna on the roof to provide cable television to all the residents in the complex, that also would not be subject to a local franchise requirement. 
    But where a satellite antenna is set up to serve multiple, separately-owned buildings, or if its wires run over or under the city streets, Congress made the determination that the facility looks more like a traditional cable system and should be subject to franchise requirements accordingly.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="342.467" stopTime="349.362">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Mr. Manning, is that the right-of-way criterion, whether it goes over city streets?
speaker="john_f_manning" startTime="349.362" stopTime="350.393">
    Mr. John F. Manning 
    That's correct, Your Honor.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="350.393" stopTime="356.735">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    So in New York City, you could wire up an entire city block without using city rights-of-way.
speaker="john_f_manning" startTime="356.735" stopTime="360.078">
    Mr. John F. Manning 
    That's correct, and it could be... as your question suggests--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="360.078" stopTime="360.839">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Which is a lot of people.
speaker="john_f_manning" startTime="360.839" stopTime="439.339">
    Mr. John F. Manning 
    --It could be quite a number of people, and the judgment that Congress made, that the common-ownership requirement in addition to the right-of-way requirement was a rational basis for distinguishing between franchised and unfranchised facilities, was a reasonable line. 
    The essence of the rational-basis test is that debatable policy judgments are left to Congress, not the Federal courts, and as this Court explained most recently in Sullivan v. Stroop, a classification in a piece of socioeconomic legislation must be sustained if any state of facts may reasonably be conceived to justify it. 
    Under that standard, the line-drawn by Congress in this case easily passes constitutional muster. 
    If a satellite antenna serves only a commonly owned building or set of buildings, a plausible legislator could think that it is more likely that the service is being provided as part of the package of services that management provides to its residents, that it's an incident of residency. 
    Equivalently, a reasonable legislator could conclude that the service provided by such a satellite antenna would be less likely to be run in the nature of an independent business venture, but even if you take a building complex--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="439.339" stopTime="445.804">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    What would be the virtue of that conclusion, that it would be less likely to be run as an independent business venture?
speaker="john_f_manning" startTime="445.804" stopTime="523.765">
    Mr. John F. Manning 
    --Well, you would think that if you were an owner of a building and you were putting up a satellite dish and providing the service to your tenants, that your primary interest would be in keeping your tenants happy, because you are making a lot more money from their rent, or from their condo fee, than you are from providing them with cable service. 
    So in that situation, you could conclude that there would be less need to interpose a franchising authority to provide consumer protection, when the building itself is really the provider of the service. 
    But even if you have a situation where the building is making a contract with an outside SMATV company to set up a satellite antenna on the building, to run the wires, own the wires, service the building, arrange for the programming, and bill the tenants separately, that company is still accountable to one set of owners for the service that it provides from that dish. 
    Every subscriber who gets service off of that satellite antenna can voice his or her complaints or desires to a single set of owners, and the ownership has a strong incentive to keep the subscribers happy, since there is a substantial interest in keeping the rental fees and the condo fees flowing.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="523.765" stopTime="549.182">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    Mr. Manning, is it correct, I guess almost as a matter of definition, that on the scenario you're just describing, every unit of buildings is going to have to have its own complete system? 
    I mean, there's going to have to be an antenna, and so on, so the... what I'm getting at is the investment is going to be much greater in the cases subject to the exception and the cancellation of the business would consequently be far more disastrous.
speaker="john_f_manning" startTime="549.182" stopTime="583.496">
    Mr. John F. Manning 
    That's correct, Justice Souter. 
    I mean, it wouldn't necessarily be a single business, but it would be a single... a single building... I'm sorry, a single building, but it would be a building or building complex. 
    And what you would do is, you would... it would involve the construction of a satellite head end, and it may or may not involve wiring the buildings, because a lot of these buildings have the old mater antenna television system wiring already in place, so you might or might not be able to use that. 
    So there is a substantial investment in building the satellite head end facility, and if you were serving a single set of buildings, and the ownership cancels that contract, then you've lost out a lot.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="583.496" stopTime="585.937">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    You simply have more at stake in keeping them happy.
speaker="john_f_manning" startTime="585.937" stopTime="618.117">
    Mr. John F. Manning 
    Right, whereas if you're serving 10 different buildings, then no one owner has that degree of leverage over your service. 
    And what's more, if a satellite antenna is not limited to serving commonly owned buildings, as Justice Scalia pointed out, it may well be expected, or a reasonable legislature could at least think that you would tend to have more subscribers served by that satellite antenna, because you could wire an entire city block in New York by running a wire from building to building. 
    In that case--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="618.117" stopTime="623.641">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    And the owner would have real monopoly power over that... at least over all the people within that block.
speaker="john_f_manning" startTime="623.641" stopTime="628.254">
    Mr. John F. Manning 
    --The owner would have substantial leverage, because the alternative for any of the buildings on that block--

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    --Right.
speaker="john_f_manning" startTime="630.126" stopTime="631.155">
    Mr. John F. Manning 
    And now, I would like to--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="631.155" stopTime="636.249">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    And therefore greater need for rate regulation, which the franchising authority would do.
speaker="john_f_manning" startTime="636.249" stopTime="687.992">
    Mr. John F. Manning 
    --That's exactly right, and you could have... a franchise authority with consumer protection jurisdiction could more profitably exercise control over the rates and consumer service of a satellite antenna that serves separately owned buildings. 
    And what's more, if you assume, as a reasonable legislator could, that the size of the market served by that facility, served by that head end satellite antenna equipment, is larger if the common-ownership requirement is not met, then the costs of franchising could be spread among a greater number of consumers, and so Congress could have reasoned that the cost-benefit ratio of imposing a franchise requirement on a facility that serves separately owned buildings would be more favorable.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="687.992" stopTime="698.521">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    There's a lot of reasons you can think of, aren't there? 
    I mean... but none of these really appears, as far as we know, in any of the debates.
speaker="john_f_manning" startTime="698.521" stopTime="788.489">
    Mr. John F. Manning 
    Well, Your Honor, this Court has made perfectly clear in a number of cases, most recently Nordlinger v. Hahn, but perhaps most clearly in the case of Railroad Retirement Board v. Fritz, that the rationale for a piece of legislation does not have to appear in the legislative history or even in purposes articulated on the face of the statute. 
    That issue was raised very clearly in the Fritz case, where the dissent said that the evidence in that case involved a question of line-drawing between those who would be eligible for dual benefits under the social security system and the railroad retirement system and those who would not be eligible for that double-dipping, and Congress drew a line based on whether one was serving in the... to summarize very sketchily, whether one was serving in the railroad industry or had a current connection in 1974. 
    The dissent said that that line disserved the purposes of the statute as expressed in the legislative history because it didn't provide all of the people who had vested railroad retirement benefits with their ultimate benefits, and this Court said that the purposes of a statute for purposes of the rational-basis test did not have to be reflected in the legislative history, and that it was 
    "constitutionally irrelevant whether the rational basis was articulated by the legislature at all. " 
    The Court also stated that the best evidence of the legislative purpose is the text of the statute itself.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="788.489" stopTime="799.078">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well, lots of times a bill starts out intending to do one thing and amendments are tacked on, so there may be several different purposes not necessarily consistent with one another.
speaker="john_f_manning" startTime="799.078" stopTime="861.679">
    Mr. John F. Manning 
    That's exactly right, Mr. Chief Justice. 
    It's very difficult... as this Court has explained many times, it's very difficult to know precisely why a legislator is moved to vote for or against a particular piece of legislation, and if the rationality of a statute were measured in terms of the reasons suggested by some legislators on the floor or by a committee in a report, it would be very difficult indeed to sustain the validity of much legislation, and it would be quite an impingement on the independence of the legislative branch. 
    In rejecting the rational justification, what we call the consumer welfare rationale, the court of appeals offered very little explanation in this case. 
    Consumer welfare rationale was suggested by Judge Mikva, Chief Judge Mikva in his concurring opinion, and endorsed by the FCC on remand. 
    Rather than addressing the substance of that justification, the court of appeals merely dismissed it by saying, we have no basis for assuming its validity, and by calling it a FCC has wholly failed to flesh out.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="861.679" stopTime="873.146">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Mr. Manning, can I ask you a question about the... I'm not quite sure I entirely understand your rationale. 
    Are you sort of assuming that one of these singly owned complexes is a separate market?
speaker="john_f_manning" startTime="873.146" stopTime="874.846">

    That's correct.

speaker="john_f_manning" startTime="880.750" stopTime="883.141">
    Mr. John F. Manning 
    There are a number of these condominium associations, but--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="883.141" stopTime="887.044">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Do they each negotiate separately, or is there a rate that generally applies to all of them?

    But if they're just part of a market, why are they a different part of a larger market if 10 buildings are owned by one person on the one hand and they're all owned by 10 separate people on the other?
speaker="john_f_manning" startTime="899.941" stopTime="921.736">
    Mr. John F. Manning 
    Well, I think the thing that makes them a market is that what you're talking about when you're talking about a facility, which is the unit that you use to measure whether something's a cable system, you're talking about the hardware, the satellite antenna system, and as Justice Scalia pointed out, if you have a building, you have a satellite antenna that's placed on a building, then the people who own that building and--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="921.736" stopTime="934.615">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Well, if it's just one building, I guess it doesn't matter, because if it's one building it would be owned by one person or one association, but isn't the only... doesn't the problem only arise when you've got a complex of buildings on the one hand owned by a single owner and on the other hand by separate owners?

    Mr. John F. Manning

    I mean, we may differ in what we think the right answer is to whether you'll get a better deal if you're served by a satellite antenna that only serves people in your building or if you're served by a satellite antenna that serves you and 10 other buildings, and we may disagree over whether the person in building 1 has more leverage because it's part of a collection of 10 buildings that negotiate as one for the service as opposed to 10 separate negotiators for the same service--

    Mr. John F. Manning

    The court said... the court upheld that classification on the ground that a legislator may well assume that those who advertise their own wares present less of a traffic safety concern given the nature and extent of the advertisements on their trucks. 
    There was no record support for that. 
    They didn't cite any scholarly treatises, they didn't cite any traffic reports, any economic textbooks.

    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    Is it your position that it's plausible in the situation put by Justice Stevens to say that in the case where there's single ownership there is more leverage and therefore the market is different?
speaker="john_f_manning" startTime="1127.161" stopTime="1200.860">
    Mr. John F. Manning 
    We think it's very plausible to think that. 
    We think that a reasonable legislator certainly could assume that when you have a satellite dish that's being put on a building that a) it's more likely that the satellite service is being offered as an amenity to the tenants, that it may not even be a separate market where the SMATV company comes in, puts on the satellite, bills the tenants and runs it separately. 
    But secondly, we think it's much more likely that when you have the negotiation focused between one set of owners for use of this very expensive piece of hardware and a satellite company, even if it runs a hundred of these satellite dishes around town, that the people who live within that building are more likely to have leverage over the product consumed than if you have the same company putting a dish on and running it to 10 buildings. 
    Not only is the accountability more focused, but if a satellite dish can only serve multiple-unit dwellings, it is more likely that you are going to have fewer subscribers, and that means that each subscriber is going to have more leverage over the product produced, and that the cost of franchising will be more significant for... per subscriber for subscribers who live in buildings under common ownership.

    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    Now, Mr. Manning, if you prevail on this argument, and in this case it's your position that we should remand to the court of appeals for the determination of whether or not some other more rigorous standard applies?

    Mr. John F. Manning 
    That's correct, Your Honor. 
    The court of appeals raised the question whether a fundamental rights equal protection analysis should be applied, but the court did not reach that question, and we believe that the Court should leave it for the court of appeals in first... in the first--
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="1226.135" stopTime="1233.120">

    --Well, the... this Court's cases suggest that... no, we... actually, we have not taken a position in that case, and we would prefer that the Court not address that issue because it has not been addressed by the court of appeals and we think it would be preferable to leave it for consideration by the court of appeals on remand.

    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    Well, two answers... number 1, it would be preferable, and number 2, you don't have a position.
speaker="john_f_manning" startTime="1257.865" stopTime="1352.346">
    Mr. John F. Manning 
    We don't have a position, no. 
    In... we believe that the court of appeals' error in this case stemmed largely from the fact that it perceived that the line drawn by Congress was different than the line traditionally applied by the administrative agency in deciding whether the franchise requirement should be applied... namely, the crossing of public rights-of-way. 
    The FCC's traditional basis for imposing franchise requirements on cable facilities, however, is irrelevant to the constitutional question before this Court. 
    Congress has no constitutional duty to adhere to agency precedent or even to give a reasoned explanation for departing from it. 
    In any case, it is wrong to say that the only dividing line for franchise requirements had been the use of public rights-of-way. 
    Under FCC regulations in the 1970's, a facility that did not satisfy the common-ownership requirement could be classified as a cable system and thus made subject to franchise requirements whether or not it crossed public rights-of-way. 
    That ruling is reflected in the FCC's Bayhead decision which is cited in footnote 26 of our brief. 
    In addition, the FCC's 1983 Earth Satellite decision confirms that the Commission never preempted franchise requirements for the type of facility at issue here... SMATV facilities that serve separately owned buildings by wire.

    Yes, but the common ownership control and management requirement generally means that you have a bunch of units that are joined by a common economic link, that the management is providing a number of services. 
    It collects garbage, it may provide plumbing services, it may provide an answering service at the front desk that serves all these units. 
    So there is an integrated economic unit. 
    There's something that holds these units together, and when that's the case, I think that what the common-ownership requirement does is, it gives some assurance the cable system is simply--

    But Congress doesn't have to draw perfect classifications, and what it decided was that it was going to use common ownership control and management in general as a proxy for those situations when all the tenants together have sufficient focus and accountability and bargaining power to get the services they want with the proper consumer responsiveness.

   Argument of Deborah C. Costlow
speaker="deborah_c_costlow" startTime="1702.448" stopTime="1766.979">
    Ms. Deborah C. Costlow 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    Of all interstate media of communications not using the public streets and rights-of-way to deliver their signal, only a single media... that is, an SMATV facility serving separately owned and managed multiple dwelling units by wire has to obtain a franchise from a municipality in order to enter the market and is subjected to treatment as a cable system. 
    No franchise is required of an SMATV facility serving a single multiple-unit dwelling. 
    No franchise is required for that same SMATV operator to install a series of separate satellite dishes in order to serve the exact same apartment dwellings throughout the municipality. 
    No franchise is required if an SMATV operator wishes to interconnect separately owned or managed buildings by means of an 18-gigahertz microwave link. 
    No franchise is required of an SMATV facility who seeks to interconnect those same separately owned or managed multiple dwelling units by means of an infrared link.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1766.979" stopTime="1779.778">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Ms. Costlow, what are the practical consequences when a franchise is required? 
    Does that mean that a cable operator will be subject to price regulation by the State or local government?
speaker="deborah_c_costlow" startTime="1779.778" stopTime="1817.663">
    Ms. Deborah C. Costlow 
    The burdens that would be imposed upon an SMATV facility that would have to obtain a franchise would be the same burdens that would be imposed upon traditional cable operators, but those burdens would not apply to any other interstate media of communications. 
    Those burdens would include, for example, having to get a license to speak at all. 
    If the license is denied, then you cannot speak. 
    Those burdens would include, on the local level, typically a requirement to wire the entire municipality, not simply to obtain a franchise to interconnect the particular separately owned multiple-unit dwellings that the operator wishes to interconnect. 
    It would also include--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1817.663" stopTime="1819.974">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    It would include some sort of the price regulation.
speaker="deborah_c_costlow" startTime="1819.974" stopTime="1901.827">
    Ms. Deborah C. Costlow 
    --Yes, it would include price regulation as a result of the '92 act, depending upon whether or not under the statute that particular market and the players within that market are subject to effective competition. 
    They would always be subject to potential regulation on the Federal level by treatment as a cable system because, as a result of the '92 act, any subscriber can bring a complaint to the Federal Communications Commission that the rates of the particular operator are unreasonable, and that kind of price and rate regulation is not imposed upon SMATV facilities serving a single building, serving commonly owned or managed buildings, serving those same buildings by means of microwave or an infrared link, leasing telephone company lines, for example, in order to interconnect those buildings, because you don't have to obtain a franchise to do that. 
    In other words, the only time a franchise is required to interconnect separately owned and managed buildings is when those separately owned and managed buildings are interconnected by a simple piece of wire, so the exact distinction here is that you cannot cross a public... a private property boundary line in order to serve separately owned or managed buildings by means of a wire, but you can cross that same private property boundary line to interconnect those same separately owned and managed multiple-unit dwellings by means of a wireless facility.

    The distinguishing characteristics here between the media who are subject to franchising requirements and the media who are not subject to franchising requirements, I do not believe that you should focus simply on an SMATV facility versus another SMATV facility, but must look at the entire interstate media that is potentially regulated as a result of the Communications Act and the Cable Television Acts which were a part of that act.

    Your Honor, it is true that Congress can act one step at a time, but if you look at the particular background and history and context of this particular regulation, the... neither the Federal Government nor Congress have ever subjected interstate media of communications operating by wireless, for example, to local franchising regulation. 
    They have not subjected to local franchising regulation SMATV facilities serving multiple-unit dwellings either singly or under common ownership management or control, so the step here... there is no indication that Congress is moving one step at a time to subject each of these interstate media to some sort of local franchising regulation. 
    The step is in the opposite direction. 
    All interstate media have typically been exempt from local regulation and exclusively under Federal jurisdiction and control, and only in a very rare instance has the Federal Government conceded or permitted local jurisdiction and control over an interstate media of communications.

    The FCC did not reach... it specifically did not reach whether or not it would at some point exempt also facilities serving separately owned and managed dwellings. 
    They didn't say that they couldn't. 
    They just didn't reach it, and in '84 Congress adopted that same exemption--

    --Your Honor, the purposes... I would submit that the purposes of the '84 act as confirmed in the 1992 cable act are a deregulatory purpose, and the purpose of... set forth and the objectives set forth in both those acts by Congress are that they sought to promote competition by free entry, not to impose regulations on system or entry barriers to system. 
    And I would submit that Congress could not have sought to promote competition in these acts by means of singling out only a particular medium for this kind of regulation as opposed to applying whatever justifies regulation of us justifies regulation of other like-situated media. 
    The system size rationale is the rationale that's relied upon by the Government here, and I would submit that that system size rationale was expressly rejected by Congress when it adopted the 1984 act.

    Justice David H. Souter 
    Well, it's resting on the assumption that certain systems will more likely be small and other systems will likely be larger, but the rationale ultimately on those assumptions is based on leverage, not a mere crude size cut-off, isn't that correct?
speaker="deborah_c_costlow" startTime="2823.980" stopTime="2836.840">
    Ms. Deborah C. Costlow 
    That is the Government's position, you are correct.

speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="2836.840" stopTime="2851.369">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    That may be so, but that's a different argument. 
    I mean, that is not an argument that Congress expressly rejected, and you started out by arguing that in rejecting the size rationale it had rejected the Government's argument, and I'm saying it's not quite that clear.
speaker="deborah_c_costlow" startTime="2851.369" stopTime="2937.175">
    Ms. Deborah C. Costlow 
    The distinctions between different media and who does and does not have to have a franchise, they did not determine that larger systems such as MMDS or DBS or any of the other private property systems would be subject to local franchising regulation. 
    I would submit that if Congress were concerned that larger, multichannel video programming distributors serving separately owned buildings because there would be less consumer leverage should be subject to local jurisdiction and control, that they would have subjected all larger systems to such regulation and not simply singled out this particular media. 
    The Government does not respond to that argument. 
    The Government says, well, what they meant to do there was simply encourage SMATV facilities, these kinds of SMATV facilities, to migrate to wireless spectrum, and I would submit, Your Honor, that it has never been telecommunications policy to encourage migration to scarce frequencies. 
    Rather, the policy has been to encourage migration away from such scarce frequencies, and the Government has never, in my mind, submitted a justification for the discriminatory classification between wired facilities and wireless facilities, and I submit that basing that on a migration to wireless spectrum analysis simply is implausible.

    Ms. Deborah C. Costlow

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Why isn't the distinction between wireless and cable simply the distinction that it cost more, that you do not... the single system that has sold its service to one building on the block has... if it can connect by wire, it has a monopoly over all the other buildings on the block. 
    Other cable systems cannot... other SMATV systems can't hope to get their business. 
    If, on the other hand, you made them do it by wireless, the other systems might well come in. 
    Isn't that enough of a distinction?
speaker="deborah_c_costlow" startTime="2993.031" stopTime="3151.944">
    Ms. Deborah C. Costlow 
    I find the fact that Congress would have intended to only harm the market entry and growth of SMATV facilities and not somehow... that they just... they wanted to advance and promote some technologies over others, or some speakers over others, not to be a plausible reason for Congress' actions here, because if you assume that Congress meant to impose, on purpose, greater cost on SMATV facilities that they did not mean to impose on other like-situated media, Your Honor, I have problems with that. 
    I do not believe that Congress meant to impose additional costs, and if, in fact, what Congress' objective was here was to ensure that these particular SMATV facilities had to be regulated if they got larger, then I submit they haven't achieved their purpose, because everyone can evade that regulation, including these SMATV facilities. 
    It may cost them to evade that regulation, but they can evade it, and they can get as large as they want, and it just simply doesn't make sense to me that if Congress had meant to subject larger systems to franchising regulation, that they wouldn't have subjected all larger systems to franchising regulation, and it wouldn't come down to the ownership of the building served, which isn't even a characteristic of those various interstate media, and it wouldn't have come down to whether or not it's interconnected by wire over a private property boundary line. 
    To me, that is an impermissible distinction, an impermissible line-drawing between like media of interstate communications. 
    That line was drawn with respect to traditional cable prior to the Cable Act because of cable's unique use and burden upon the public streets and rights-of-way. 
    What does a franchise get an SMATV facility here, Your Honor? 
    A franchise does not give them the right to speak on private property. 
    All that a franchise does is give them the right to install facilities in public streets and rights-of-way. 
    They do not seek to install facilities in public streets and rights-of-way. 
    They do not seek governmental benefits. 
    All they seek to do is install facilities on private streets and rights-of-way, so the franchise that Congress has dictated that these facilities must obtain does not even give them the right which they seek, which is to speak on private property. 
    What gives them the right to speak on private property is the private property owner. 
    Now, let's say the franchise--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="3151.944" stopTime="3179.383">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    I suppose you could... there is such a thing as franchising the ownership of television sets. 
    I mean, the way public television is supported in England is by... you have to get a franchise to own a television set. 
    I mean, I don't know that there's any necessary connection between franchising and public property. 
    You can franchise things that occur only on private property.

    I... any... I mean, where does your client want to have its services? 
    I mean, what geographical area?

    --The clients in front of this Court have these particular installations throughout the United States.

    Do you know without having applied for a franchise in San Diego what sort of requirements you would be subject to by that franchise?

    Ms. Deborah C. Costlow 
    Yes, Your Honor. 
    A State statute in California says to Pacific Cablevision that if you are going to obtain a franchise in San Diego, your franchise has to be the same as the first franchise, which would mean that Pacific Cablevision would have to provide universal service throughout the entire municipality.

    How about the other 49 States in which you might want to do business?

    Ms. Deborah C. Costlow 
    There are... with respect to a uniform franchise statute, Your Honor, I believe that there are about nine or ten of those in various States throughout the country.
