    Mr. Robinson O. Everett 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    As our complaint seeks to make clear, this case poses the basic issue of how far a legislature may go in seeking to guarantee the election to Congress of persons of a particular race. 
    Perhaps the best evidence is here in the form of the map, which is a reproduction in color of a map which was earlier lodged with the Court at page 133A of the jurisdictional statement in Pope v. Blue, and there are a number of copies of that which I believe are before the Court. 
    We proceed in a sense on the theory that while we are reluctant to use political pornography... and this has been described as political pornography, but really the only way to understand what took place in North Carolina is to look at the evidence thereof. 
    And our complaint seeks briefly to set forth the history of the developments in our State. 
    Basically the Attorney General in the summer of 1991 and in the fall made clear that it was necessary to have two majority-minority districts.

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Are you talking about the United States Attorney General?
speaker="robinson_o_everett" startTime="101.507" stopTime="108.581">
    Mr. Robinson O. Everett 
    Yessiree. 
    Yes, Your Honor. 
    Indeed, it was Attorney General William Barr at that particular time.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="108.581" stopTime="111.080">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Did he... the federal statute?
speaker="robinson_o_everett" startTime="111.080" stopTime="203.887">
    Mr. Robinson O. Everett 
    He was relying on the Voting Rights Act. 
    This was apparently an interpretation of the Voting Rights Act which, as we understand some of the recent opinions of the Court, was erroneous. 
    At least that's the way we interpret the Growe case and the Voinovich case. 
    But in any event, he set forth preconditions. 
    Basically, as we allege in the complaint, the precondition for clearing... for preclearing the North Carolina plan was that there be two seats which would be guaranteed for election of African Americans to the Congress of the United States so that here, in a sense, we oppose the issue of legal segregation of the congressional delegation of North Carolina. 
    Now, North Carolina is a State where the minority population is relatively dispersed. 
    Indeed, we have also lodged with the Court various data pertaining to the dispersion of the population throughout the 100 counties of the State. 
    Most of the black population is concentrated in the east and in the Piedmont, that is to say, along the coast and in the center of the State. 
    Interestingly, there are only five counties in the State and those, with one exception... and that's not a major exception... are relatively small counties, only five counties in which there is a majority of black persons. 
    And as a result, after the first plan was submitted to the Attorney General--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="203.887" stopTime="207.291">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    There are only five counties in which there's a majority of white persons?
speaker="robinson_o_everett" startTime="207.291" stopTime="208.557">
    Mr. Robinson O. Everett 
    --Of black persons.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="208.557" stopTime="209.041">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Of black persons?
speaker="robinson_o_everett" startTime="209.041" stopTime="278.404">
    Mr. Robinson O. Everett 
    Yes, Mr. Chief Justice. 
    And interestingly, those are counties of relatively small population in the northeastern part of the State. 
    There's one county which I would say is mid-sized. 
    So, as a result of that, the only way basically to achieve this objective of having two majority-minority districts... and indeed, these are super majority-minority districts because it's not 51 percent. 
    There's some margin for error, not 65 percent as in the U.J.O. case, but moving up into the mid-50's. 
    The only way to achieve that was to violate every one of the principles of redistricting and reapportionment which have heretofore been accepted by the Court, or at least as we understand it, which have been accepted by the Court. 
    We harken back to Reynolds v. Sims where there was a reference to a pattern of crazy quilts which in and of itself would be sufficient to invalidate the constitutionality of the reapportionment. 
    We harken back to U.J.O. itself where in one of the opinions... I believe it was the opinion of Justice White... there is a reference--

    Mr. Robinson O. Everett 
    We would submit that compactness and seeking a community of interest is a constitutional principle and that at least... put it this way, Your Honor... that it is not permissible to disregard everything else for the sole purpose of targeting that the seat will have a person of a particular race.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="325.636" stopTime="331.212">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Is... when you say everything else, do you include anything other than compactness in the concept of everything else?

    Mr. Robinson O. Everett 
    Well, I include contiguousness. 
    I include--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="334.288" stopTime="336.991">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Well, but this district is entirely contiguous, isn't it?
speaker="robinson_o_everett" startTime="336.991" stopTime="341.707">
    Mr. Robinson O. Everett 
    --Well, they're contiguous in a very marginal sense of the word. 
    I think--

    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    But it is entirely contiguous, is--

    Mr. Robinson O. Everett 
    --Contiguous... I think actually, Your Honor, one of the districts is cut in the middle by District 12, but we would view contiguousness as meaning more than a contact at a point so that we would suggest that if there's any significance to contiguousness other than, say, a point... one point where there is an infinitesimal contact, that it violates contiguousness. 
    Certainly compactness it violates no matter what the test is. 
    Community of interest it violates. 
    Take the 12th district, which is the one that has received quite a bit of attention and which stretches from Durham, my hometown, to Gastonia. 
    It snakes along Interstate I-85. 
    It's described by Judge Vorhees in his dissent in the lower court. 
    It snakes along. 
    At some points it is no wider than I-85. 
    In fact, at some points it's no wider than two lanes of I-85. 
    You can go from one side of the highway to another, and you go from one district to another.

    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    --Well, Mr. Everett, I guess this Court summarily affirmed in a previous case that came before us raising just these points.
speaker="robinson_o_everett" startTime="410.132" stopTime="452.974">
    Mr. Robinson O. Everett 
    Well, Your Honor, we think that we came at it from an entirely different viewpoint. 
    That was a case in which the assertion was predicated on political gerrymandering. 
    There was no assertion that this was done for the sole purpose of targeting two seats for persons of a particular race. 
    That we think is the fatal flaw. 
    We think that perhaps the issue of compactness could have been raised differently in that case and there might have been some constitutional issues before you. 
    But what we are saying is that even in search of diversity in the Congress, the legislature of North Carolina and the Attorney General can go only so far, but they cannot go as far as they went in this particular instance.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="452.974" stopTime="463.532">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    Well, that brings us back to the point Justice Stevens was beginning to discuss with you. 
    Isn't a State free to reject the idea of compactness if it chooses?
speaker="robinson_o_everett" startTime="463.532" stopTime="485.665">
    Mr. Robinson O. Everett 
    We would think there are some limitations even on how far the State can go in rejecting the principle of compactness. 
    We certainly would say this in answer to your question, that perhaps they can reject compactness, but not do so in the context of seeking to assure the election of a person of a particular race, whatever that race may be.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="485.665" stopTime="494.192">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well, isn't that your basic point, Mr. Everett, that that sort of intent or motivation on the part of the legislature is subject to strict scrutiny?
speaker="robinson_o_everett" startTime="494.192" stopTime="496.004">
    Mr. Robinson O. Everett 
    Exactly, exactly.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="496.004" stopTime="515.073">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    So that your argument really isn't... does not rest, I take it, at any point on the fact that any of these other principles have been mandated either by the authority of this Court or by any other authority that we would have to recognize. 
    Your case really rests simply on the motivation by which this particular configuration supposedly was justified.
speaker="robinson_o_everett" startTime="515.073" stopTime="535.003">
    Mr. Robinson O. Everett 
    That's the key to it, Justice Souter, that it rests on the motivation. 
    In a sense the distortions are a reflection of the motivation, and the distortions show what happens once we start down the path to what might be termed segregating the electoral process because--
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="535.003" stopTime="537.892">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    But none of them has independent constitutional significance.

    Mr. Robinson O. Everett 
    --We would think that is... that the motivation is the independent constitutional grounds for invalidating it. 
    We would contend that regardless... it goes beyond strict scrutiny, that anytime a motivation of this particular type is that which dominates the legislative purpose, anytime the legislature is thinking of choosing... of drawing boundaries for the specific purpose of assuring that persons of a particular race will be elected, then under those circumstances, it's invalid. 
    Now--

    Justice Byron R. White 
    Would you say... let's just assume for the moment that the Voting Rights Act either authorizes exactly what was done here or required what was done here.

    Mr. Robinson O. Everett

    --in requiring that there be the majority-minority districts. 
    As we understood the opinion in Voinovich, there is nothing in the Voting Rights Act which requires that there be particular types of majority-minority districts. 
    This is something that in a sense is the primary responsibility of the State so long as the State does not violate other principles in a manner that dilutes the vote. 
    Now, there has been no dilution of the vote in this particular instance. 
    Indeed, it's interesting to look at statistics presented in the brief by the appellees.

    Mr. Robinson O. Everett

    Mr. Robinson O. Everett 
    A number of them that are in the 12th district, which is the one we are particularly focusing on, are not subject to preclearance. 
    For example, Durham County is not subject, and indeed, Durham County is one which in the Thornburg case, in Thornburg v. Gingles, was accepted because the political process was not operating in a way that in any... that diluted the minority vote.

    Well, we brought up that... and we've consistently taken the position that to manipulate the preclearance requirement for the 40 counties, primarily in the northeast, as a basis for covering the entire State with a plan which is racially discriminatory, at least as we interpret it, is beyond the purview of the Voting Rights. 
    We took the position in our original complaint that what was done was not authorized by the Voting Rights Act, but in addition and more fundamental we take the position that what was done is not authorized by the U.S. Constitution.

    Mr. Robinson O. Everett 
    The principle to some extent can be related to factors such as those in the Gingles case.

    Justice David H. Souter 
    Well, what about a case like this in which you're not so much breaking apart a district in which a violation has occurred, you've simply got to come up with another district and, as a consequence, essentially a whole new configuration? 
    How do you... would one way to do it, on your theory, simply be to avoid a Gingles violation? 
    Would that sort of be your... or a violation of the Gingles principles.

    Mr. Robinson O. Everett

    Justice David H. Souter 
    I guess the trouble I'm having is you accept the principle that there can be some race consciousness, but I don't understand how you are willing to let that principle be applied in a concrete way at every point at which we or somebody might suggest, well, taking race into account, this might be a permissible way to do it or, a second step, this is probably the only permissible way to do it. 
    At that point you draw the line. 
    I don't understand how you can take race into account and draw the line as neatly as you're drawing it. 
    That's where I'm having my trouble.

    Mr. Robinson O. Everett

    Justice David H. Souter 
    But there again we're getting back to, it seems to me, to criteria which you conceded a while ago did not themselves have any independent constitutional significance. 
    And I think you're now coming back to the argument that race... when race is taken into account, although that may be permissible per se, it cannot be taken into account, in effect, without serving a series of other principles like compactness, community identification, and so on. 
    And yet, you've conceded that these don't have independent constitutional significance. 
    So, how do we derive your rule?

    Mr. Robinson O. Everett 
    --Well, I perhaps misspoke myself earlier because I was thinking of the corrective situation where something has been done on racial grounds adverse to a minority group as, for example, breaking apart a community of minority persons into two districts and thereby basically diluting the vote. 
    Then I think certainly some corrective action could be taken, and the corrective action would take race into account.

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Well, Mr. Everett, I mean, you say community of... communities of interest can be taken into account, but doesn't that necessarily mean that racial groups can be taken into account as well? 
    I mean, if in fact there's a community that's a religious community, a racial community or whatever, why can't that be taken into account by intelligent legislators in districting? 
    I thought you were making that concession before.

    --that assuming that all black people will vote for a black representative, and therefore drawing a district with a certain number of blacks in it on the assumption that since they're black, they will vote for a black representative. 
    That's using race not for community, but for the stereotypical conclusion that if you are white, you will vote for a white, and if you're black, you'll vote for a black, which is not very good for our society I assume.

    Mr. Robinson O. Everett 
    Well, it would seem to us that the political gerrymandering has been treated by the Court different than the racially... racial gerrymandering. 
    We think that the party lines, the party affiliations, are much less fixed. 
    We should note here, by the way, that what we are talking about is something that is being put in place for the rest of this decade, for the next 10 years, as a result of this stereotype, and the result of the stereotype is that it's being assumed that one black will vote always for another black and should always vote for another black. 
    There's a targeting.

    But the racial distinction, as I understand, is something that a war was fought to get rid of. 
    There are a line of opinions of this Court which in one way or the other have inveighed against racial classifications. 
    We take that very seriously. 
    We take the color-blind Constitution to be more than an idle aspiration, particularly under present conditions. 
    And the Court seems to be moving away from Federal supervision in such matters as integration of the schools, the Freeman v. Pitts case, the recent decisions dealing with... well, the Voinovich case and the Growe case seem to indicate a willingness to move things back to the local level. 
    Here we have a situation where a Federal official directed that the North Carolina redistricting be accomplished to achieve a particular objective for a purpose that was constitutionally invalid, and we submit that relief should be granted and the judgment of the lower court should be set aside.

   Argument of H. Jefferson Powell
speaker="h_jefferson_powell" startTime="1599.215" stopTime="1662.174">
    Mr. H. Jefferson Powell 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    This case is about the legal significance of two facts. 
    First, the North Carolina General Assembly intentionally created two majority-minority congressional districts. 
    Second, the General Assembly did so for the purpose of complying with section 5 of the Voting Rights Act and of securing preclearance of its congressional reapportionment plan from the Attorney General of the United States. 
    In their arguments before the district court and in their briefs to this Court, the plaintiffs' legal contention has been that the first of these allegations, that the State acted intentionally, is an adequate basis on which to make out a constitutional claim. 
    The fatal flaw in the plaintiffs' case is that they themselves have affirmatively described what the State's purpose was in so acting, and that purpose was the lawful one of complying with Federal voting rights legislation as interpreted and administered by the responsible Federal official.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1662.174" stopTime="1669.405">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Do you have a position, Mr. Powell, on the application of the Voting Rights Act when only 40 out of 100 counties are subject to it?
speaker="h_jefferson_powell" startTime="1669.405" stopTime="1672.638">
    Mr. H. Jefferson Powell 
    That question was not, in fact, presented to the district court.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1672.638" stopTime="1673.748">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Do you have a position on it?

    Mr. H. Jefferson Powell 
    We do, Mr. Chief Justice.

    Well, what is it?
speaker="h_jefferson_powell" startTime="1675.621" stopTime="1689.319">
    Mr. H. Jefferson Powell 
    And that is that given the distribution of the counties, it was necessary to preclear the entire plan and that, in fact, the proper focus in this case with the statewide redistricting plan is statewide. 
    When the State--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1689.319" stopTime="1692.380">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well, way should that be when only 40 counties are subject to preclearance?
speaker="h_jefferson_powell" startTime="1692.380" stopTime="1704.814">
    Mr. H. Jefferson Powell 
    --As the Attorney General administers the statute, he expects the entire plan to be submitted. 
    That makes pragmatic sense because State legislatures, when they draw up a statewide congressional reapportionment plan, they do it on a statewide basis.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1704.814" stopTime="1709.609">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    But what's the authority for that in the Voting Rights Act if only 40 counties are covered?

    Mr. H. Jefferson Powell 
    So long as the State's reliance is reasonable.

    We do indeed. 
    Of course, Voinovich was a section 2 decision, and Voinovich made two holdings of tangential relevance to this case.

    Mr. H. Jefferson Powell 
    It certainly is. 
    Implicit in the Attorney General's letter is... certainly is a suggestion that a second majority-minority district will go a long way towards meeting my concern because my concern is based in part on the fact you didn't create one.

    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, yes, but don't you... suppose you had turned... decided that you didn't want a second district and the legislature... well, I'll put it this way. 
    What does a plaintiff have to prove to show that the State has violated the Voting Rights Act in redistricting? 
    Do they have to prove a discriminatory intent?

    Yes.

    Mr. H. Jefferson Powell 
    Under section 5, I'm not sure a private right of action exists. 
    A constitutional claim in this context would have to include a claim of invidious intent as this Court has traditionally used that concept. 
    That's one of the things that's lacking in this case. 
    The plaintiffs have not alleged... indeed, the district court below said they could not plausibly allege... that the General Assembly chose this plan because it would impose an adverse impact on white voters or, indeed, any other racial group.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2066.324" stopTime="2081.553">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well, but certainly some of our cases have simply said that an intent to classify on the basis of race... the Croson case, for example... is subject to strict scrutiny, not that it's automatically out, but that it's subject to strict scrutiny.
speaker="h_jefferson_powell" startTime="2081.553" stopTime="2099.999">
    Mr. H. Jefferson Powell 
    Yes, Mr. Chief Justice. 
    But the Croson line of decisions is distinct from this Court's own vote dilution, race-based vote dilution, cases, White against Regester, Rogers against Lodge, and so on. 
    Those cases, which set out the test to be applied in this context, instruct the trier of fact to look for invidious intent.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2099.999" stopTime="2102.529">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Those were decided before Croson, weren't they?

    Mr. H. Jefferson Powell 
    That's correct, Your Honor. 
    We believe that they continue to be valid. 
    As recently as 1986 in Davis against Bandemer, the political gerrymandering case, seven Justices of this Court expressly reaffirmed the validity of the effects prong and the invidious intent prong--

    Mr. H. Jefferson Powell 
    --Our defense is that the State's purpose here was compliance with the Voting Rights Act, that what the State... what the Attorney General--

    What did the Voting Rights Act require that led you to think that you should have a second minority district?

    Mr. H. Jefferson Powell 
    --The Voting Rights Act--

    Justice Byron R. White 
    Don't talk about the Attorney General. 
    Just talk about the Voting Rights Act.
speaker="h_jefferson_powell" startTime="2144.746" stopTime="2164.755">
    Mr. H. Jefferson Powell 
    --The Voting Rights Act requires the State to demonstrate an absence of invidious intent and an absence of retrogressive effect. 
    That's a procedural requirement. 
    The burden lies on the State. 
    This Court has approved in a series of cases, going back 20 years, the use of majority-minority districts--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2164.755" stopTime="2173.766">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    And did the Voting Rights Act, therefore, sort of incorporate the constitutional test?

    Mr. H. Jefferson Powell 
    --Certainly. 
    You violate section 5 if you had the invidious intent necessary to violate the Constitution.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="2181.310" stopTime="2194.445">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    So, if this were a State that were not covered by the Voting Act... Voting Rights Act, would a State legislature be free, as a matter of policy, to draw a district such as this one?
speaker="h_jefferson_powell" startTime="2194.445" stopTime="2207.300">
    Mr. H. Jefferson Powell 
    We'd have a very different case. 
    The answer would depend on the application of section 2. 
    In appropriate circumstances, section 2, in order to avoid vote dilution as in the Gingles situation, might require majority-minority districting.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="2207.300" stopTime="2232.853">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    No, but take Justice Kennedy's question just one step further. 
    Supposing just as a matter of policy, forgetting the Voting Rights Act... assume no Voting Rights Act... could the State constitutionally decide that when... if 20 percent of the population is of a particular race, that it would be good policy to have two districts in which that race represented the majority of the voters in the district?
speaker="h_jefferson_powell" startTime="2232.853" stopTime="2235.648">
    Mr. H. Jefferson Powell 
    No, Justice Stevens. 
    However, something very close to that--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="2235.648" stopTime="2238.272">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Why? 
    Why would... what would make it unconstitutional?
speaker="h_jefferson_powell" startTime="2238.272" stopTime="2269.120">
    Mr. H. Jefferson Powell 
    --There would not be an appropriate basis on which to make use of the racial classification. 
    This Court in a number of... well, members of this Court in a number of opinions have suggested that where the State confronted a problem with racially polarized voting, that the State might be able to use race conscious redistricting to address that, but that's not this case. 
    The determining factor in this case is that North Carolina is subject to section 5 preclearance. 
    It met those affirmative obligations in ways that have been recognized repeatedly.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="2269.120" stopTime="2281.848">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    Well, just sticking for a moment with the hypothetical of the State where the Voting Rights Act is inapplicable, section 5, the only justification for a district of this kind then is that there was racially polarized voting?
speaker="h_jefferson_powell" startTime="2281.848" stopTime="2291.485">
    Mr. H. Jefferson Powell 
    Section 2 might require a State to use majority-minority districts, Justice Kennedy, in order to avoid vote dilution of minority voters.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="2291.485" stopTime="2305.418">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    So that a State that has racially polarized voting under the Voting Rights Act, as you are interpreting it, is required to employ methods which will continue racially polarized voting.
speaker="h_jefferson_powell" startTime="2305.418" stopTime="2308.167">
    Mr. H. Jefferson Powell 
    One hopes not, Your Honor.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="2308.167" stopTime="2312.087">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    But I thought that's the logical conclusion from your answer.
speaker="h_jefferson_powell" startTime="2312.087" stopTime="2325.159">
    Mr. H. Jefferson Powell 
    Only if the consequences of drawing majority-minority districts is to perpetuate racially polarized voting. 
    That's a question which we believe Congress has considered and addressed by amending section 2 to incorporate the results test.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="2325.159" stopTime="2340.356">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    So, if a district would either perpetuate or increase the possibilities of racially polarized voting, then the district cannot be drawn consistently with the Constitution based on race?
speaker="h_jefferson_powell" startTime="2340.356" stopTime="2362.831">
    Mr. H. Jefferson Powell 
    The State doesn't act free... xx understand the question correctly, the State doesn't act free of Federal voting rights legislation, and so that even if section 5 were not applicable, the State would... a conscientious State legislature would have to meet the requirements of section 2. 
    Section 2 may, depending on the particular demographics and the situation of the State, require majority-minority districting, but once again, that's not this case.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="2362.831" stopTime="2371.468">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Mr. Powell, can... this District 12 is a highly irregular shape. 
    I guess you agree with that.

    Yes, Your Honor.

    In places only as wide as a highway and stretching virtually the length of the State.

speaker="h_jefferson_powell" startTime="2388.478" stopTime="2415.232">
    Mr. H. Jefferson Powell 
    Yes, Your Honor, it could be. 
    In a case where plaintiffs were alleging that there was a variance between the State's purported purpose and its real purpose, which actually was the case in Voinovich I believe, that might be probative of the existence of this covert intent. 
    There's no dispute here over what the State's purpose is. 
    There's a dispute over how to characterize it legally, but we're not in disagreement over what the State legislature was trying to do.

    Our cases have held that you could do this to remedy a violation of the act. 
    You haven't established that there was a violation of the act which could only be remedied by this. 
    All you've established is that the State, rather than going to the D.C. court, accepted the Attorney General's determination that the easy way to get this thing done would be to draw up a second district. 
    I don't know how that has any remote resemblance to our cases that say where you've been in violation, you can do this to eliminate the violation.

    Mr. H. Jefferson Powell 
    With respect, Justice Scalia, we don't read the cases to hold that. 
    We think that in a variety of cases, including City of Port Arthur, this Court has insisted on or permitted States to use or make changes in their electoral laws, including majority-minority districting, in order to carry their burden of demonstrating compliance with section 5.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2678.577" stopTime="2687.918">
    Justice Byron R. White

    --which is constitutional. 
    Section 5 also forbids retrogressive effect. 
    In the end this case is about the Voting Rights Act. 
    At least up to this point, the plaintiffs' argument has been a pure argument that race consciousness is invidious and unconstitutional. 
    Section 5 and section 2, as amended, both authorize and in appropriate circumstances require race consciousness in governmental decision making. 
    Unless those provisions of the statute are unconstitutional, the plaintiffs' claim is incorrect. 
    We believe this Court's decisions upholding the act... the act's constitutionality are correct, and that the district court below should be affirmed.

speaker="edwin_s_kneedler" startTime="2736.992" stopTime="2801.184">
    Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler 
    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    It is the position of the United States in this case that the State of North Carolina was permitted to take race into account in order to ensure that its redistricting plan complied with the Voting Rights Act. 
    Several features of the Voting Rights Act will effectively require a State to do so in certain circumstances. 
    For example, the effects test under section 5, which this Court sustained in the City of Rome, requires a State to ensure that a districting plan not have a retrogressive effect on minorities, which will require a State, in order to ensure that its plan will comply, to look at the racial composition of the district. 
    The same is true under the results test in Gingles in which a court, in order to... in which a State, in order to guard against or to create assurance against vote dilution, will have to evaluate the racial composition of its districts.

    Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler 
    No, but in this Court's decision in United Jewish Organizations, the Court faced essentially the same situation we have here. 
    The facts were slightly different, but the essential thrust of that decision we think controls here, and that is that where a State is acting in an effort to comply, in a good faith effort to comply, with the Voting Rights Act, that in doing so, the State does not, at the same time, violate the very amendments that the Voting Rights Act is designed to enforce and constitutionally designed to enforce under this Court's decisions.

    Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler 
    The Court treated the challenge--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2848.729" stopTime="2849.729">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well, was there or wasn't there?
speaker="edwin_s_kneedler" startTime="2849.729" stopTime="2877.638">
    Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler 
    --There was. 
    Well, not in so many words, but the... Justice White's opinion for various Justices treated the challenge to the State's efforts to comply with section 5 of the Voting Rights Act as a challenge to the Voting Rights Act itself because if the State's efforts to comply were unconstitutional and those efforts were required by statute, then the act of Congress was necessarily unconstitutional. 
    Now, in this case, the basis for--

    Justice Byron R. White 
    That was just a plurality opinion, wasn't it?

    Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler 
    --Well, that's true, although there were two concurring Justices who would have taken--

    Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler

    In this case to the extent--

    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    Is it the policy, Mr. Kneedler, of the Justice Department and of the United States to encourage racial block voting?
speaker="edwin_s_kneedler" startTime="2904.113" stopTime="2908.096">
    Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler 
    --It is not, but as this Court has said--
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="2908.096" stopTime="2910.001">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    Is it a policy to discourage it?
speaker="edwin_s_kneedler" startTime="2910.001" stopTime="2950.079">
    Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler 
    --Yes, although the Voting Rights Act is premised on the unfortunate fact that racial block voting occurs. 
    And where racial block voting occurs, the result can be, as this Court has recognized, the dilution of minority votes and, to that extent, the abridgement of the right to vote that was supposed to be secured by the Fifteenth Amendment. 
    We did, indeed, fight a civil war over these issues, but 100 years after the Civil War, Congress determined in 1965 that the business of the Civil War was not done and that various efforts were used, either intentionally or not, to discourage blacks from registering and then to dilute their vote.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="2950.079" stopTime="2962.183">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    In this case, is it a plausible assumption that racial block voting is, A, encouraged and, B is the explicit premise for the design of this district?
speaker="edwin_s_kneedler" startTime="2962.183" stopTime="3022.191">
    Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler 
    Well, I... as to the latter, I think it's pretty clear that it's the premise. 
    In fact, I think it's the premise of appellants' challenge in this case because their claim of injury as white voters must be premised on the fact that voters will vote... that there will be racially polarized voting, or otherwise the injury of which they complain wouldn't occur. 
    Beyond that, this Court's decision in Gingles affirmed district court findings of what were referred to there as severe racial block voting. 
    So, in North Carolina, that was indeed the case, and in fact, in this case, the submission to the Attorney General indicated that there was still a substantial basis for that concern. 
    Now, as to the... I'm sorry. 
    The first part of your question I think went to the... whether that was the purpose or to encourage it. 
    I don't think there's any indication that it was the... was intended to encourage. 
    But where a government, be it Federal or State--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="3022.191" stopTime="3025.892">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Well, the whole thing wouldn't succeed unless they... unless the block voting occurred.
speaker="edwin_s_kneedler" startTime="3025.892" stopTime="3092.146">
    Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler 
    --Right, but if it doesn't succeed, then the harm that appellants are most concerned about is really not present. 
    But the Voting Rights Act specifically addresses the problem not of individual discrimination against... not only of individual discrimination against individual blacks, but the fear that a State either intentionally or through setting up districts that in concert with private behavior will have the effect of diluting the black vote. 
    And where you have racially polarized voting and a minority is submerged in a majority white district, that will be the effect. 
    And Congress determined that full effectuation of the voting rights protected by the Fifteenth Amendment required that that be addressed as well, and this Court in Gingles and in Beer and other cases has sustained... has applied the Voting Rights Act on that premise. 
    And we do not believe that the principle of the color-blind Constitution requires a State to be blind to the fact that its citizens regrettably may vote along racial lines and to take account of the fact that its own redistricting plans--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="3092.146" stopTime="3102.329">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Mr. Kneedler, what is your position that what if the State of North Carolina motivated by precisely the same considerations you've just described adopted this program on its own without there being a Voting Rights Act?
speaker="edwin_s_kneedler" startTime="3102.329" stopTime="3103.720">
    Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler 
    --We have not taken a position.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="3103.720" stopTime="3105.296">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    What is your position?
speaker="edwin_s_kneedler" startTime="3105.296" stopTime="3110.748">
    Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler 
    There would be much to be said for the State's ability to do that if there was--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="3110.748" stopTime="3114.512">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Just the same facts that you have that motivated the United States.
speaker="edwin_s_kneedler" startTime="3114.512" stopTime="3139.127">
    Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler 
    --No. 
    I think there would have to be... for a State to do it without the Voting Rights Act, there would have to be a basis in racial block voting for that because the State would have to be addressing... and this was the premise of a portion of the opinion in U.J.O. There would have to be a premise of some discriminatory conduct going on that the State would address. 
    So, to that extent, it would be something of the same motivation that Congress had for enacting the Voting Rights Act. 
    I wanted to address one point here.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="3139.127" stopTime="3141.392">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    And you say it would or would not be permissible constitutionally?
speaker="edwin_s_kneedler" startTime="3141.392" stopTime="3180.985">
    Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler 
    I think it would be permissible constitutionally if the State were addressing racial block voting, which it would be, in that respect, addressing private discriminatory conduct. 
    The Attorney General in this case did not require two districts. 
    What the Attorney General said is that the State had failed to carry its burden of proving the absence of discriminatory purpose because the State's proffered reasons for rejecting a second majority-minority district appeared to be pretextual. 
    This Court has upheld in Katzenbach v. South Carolina, the shifting of the burden of proof to the State to demonstrate that its plans are free of racially discriminatory purpose or effect.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="3180.985" stopTime="3192.950">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    As I understand your argument, though, Mr. Kneedler, you're not relying on the fact that the Attorney General turned this plan down. 
    You'd be making the same argument if the State had done this on its own before submitting it to the Attorney General.
speaker="edwin_s_kneedler" startTime="3192.950" stopTime="3304.717">
    Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler 
    That's correct. 
    States should be encouraged... far from being a suspect, States should be encouraged to conduct their districting in a way that comes into compliance with the Voting Rights Act, section 2 and section 5, although in this case, the Attorney General's objection letter furnished the State with a pretty firm basis for doubt as to whether it could carry its burden if it chose, for example, the alternative to go to court. 
    The State could legitimately believe it would have trouble carrying its burden of proving an absence of discriminatory purpose. 
    So, clearly the basis for the Attorney General's objection or the State's concern in this case, a fear that the burden could not be carried, was an authorized interpretation by the Attorney General. 
    The Attorney General is required to object where the State cannot carry its burden in that respect. 
    So, it is permissible for a State to take into account that it can't carry the shifted burden that this Court sustained in Katzenbach v. South Carolina, and therefore to devise another plan that will meet the Attorney General's concerns or the concern in section 5 of the Voting Rights Act as such that plans be free of racial discrimination. 
    We think it is the existence of the Voting Rights Act in this case and Congress' thorough examination of the need for the Voting Rights Act periodically that distinguishes this setting from the cases in which the Court has required strict scrutiny. 
    This Court has recognized that the Voting Rights Act was a drastic remedy in the section 5 preclearance setting, for example, to address the pernicious evil of voting discrimination, and rather than require case-by-case adjudication, Congress determined, and this Court held validly determined, that it was necessary to adopt broader measures to prevent, to hedge against purposeful discrimination. 
    And it's on that basis--

   Rebuttal of Robinson O. Everett
speaker="robinson_o_everett" startTime="3308.152" stopTime="3395.742">
    Mr. Robinson O. Everett 
    Let me respond first to the last remark by Mr. Kneedler, Mr. Chief Justice. 
    The position seems to be that if the Voting Rights Act authorizes something, then it is automatically valid. 
    And that might be the case in some situations, but we would submit not in the situation that is involved here. 
    Moreover, it's our contention that the Voting Rights Act did not cause this conduct, that it was done by misinterpretation, and it was done by a misinterpretation on all sides, that the Voting Rights Act leaves the parties free to choose districts other than majority-minority districts, but there's no compulsion, no authorization to have a majority-minority district. 
    And our complaint very basically sets forth in its... in the jurisdictional statement that we're complaining of a quota system of a proportional representation which was, in fact, being forced upon the congressional delegation. 
    And therefore, the questions that were asked of Mr. Powell are particularly appropriate because that's exactly what it was, to have a quota of a certain number of Members of Congress of a particular race. 
    We find no authorization for that in any of the jurisprudence of the Court, and the result of doing that is to--
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="3395.742" stopTime="3399.585">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Indeed, it's prohibited in the Voting Rights Act itself.

    Mr. Robinson O. Everett 
    --Section 2 has a specific proviso. 
    So, we maintain that it's not authorized by the Congress, that it is not authorized by the Constitution, that the result is to produce the type of distortion that was reflected in the map, and to produce a process that is inimicable to all the ideals of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendment and, indeed, of article I, section 2. 
    And accordingly, we submit that the--

    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    May I ask you just one question, if you do have a moment? 
    What if, say, a city like Chicago decided to create a certain number of wards where the Polish vote would control? 
    Would your standard be different?
speaker="robinson_o_everett" startTime="3437.038" stopTime="3443.161">
    Mr. Robinson O. Everett 
    --I would think it would be. 
    I don't think race is in the same category.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="3443.161" stopTime="3447.517">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    So, in a city they could have one rule for the Polish Americans and a different rule for the African Americans.
speaker="robinson_o_everett" startTime="3447.517" stopTime="3453.187">
    Mr. Robinson O. Everett 
    Well, I would say that race is a stereotype which is so much frowned upon--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="3453.187" stopTime="3454.968">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Treating Polish Americans is not a stereotype.
speaker="robinson_o_everett" startTime="3454.968" stopTime="3463.340">
    Mr. Robinson O. Everett 
    --Also, actually in the Chicago situation, they're living in neighborhoods. 
    It would probably be a situation of an actual community of interest. 
    I don't think anybody has ever said--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="3463.340" stopTime="3467.370">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Well, the blacks tend to live together. 
    Polish Americans tend to live together in Chicago.
speaker="robinson_o_everett" startTime="3467.370" stopTime="3482.473">
    Mr. Robinson O. Everett 
    --If I may finish simply the answer to this. 
    I don't think anyone has ever said that one Polish American necessarily does like another Polish American. 
    It's not the stereotype, which is what we're complaining of, the stereotype that one black thinks exactly like another and should be represented by another.
