    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    We'll hear argument first this morning in number 91-2024, Lamb's Chapel and John Stig... Steigerwald v. Center Moriches Union Free School District. 
    Mr. Sekulow.
speaker="jay_alan_sekulow" startTime="15.972" stopTime="44.991">
    Mr. Jay A. Sekulow 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court: 
    This case is about censorship of Lamb's Chapel's speech, which was entertained for the purpose of having a film series at the school facilities to show and discuss contemporary family issues. 
    The direct targeting of religious purpose as an exclusion under the access policy of the school district is both content based and viewpoint based, and does not meet Constitutional scrutiny.

    Unknown Speaker 
    Under what?
speaker="jay_alan_sekulow" startTime="48.282" stopTime="58.481">
    Mr. Jay A. Sekulow 
    Under... well first of all, we would assert that it's purely... this case is based purely on religious perspective, it's viewpoint based. 
    Most recently, R.A.V., but also under--
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="58.481" stopTime="58.992">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Well, so--
speaker="jay_alan_sekulow" startTime="58.992" stopTime="59.710">
    Mr. Jay A. Sekulow 
    --Yes, Your Honor.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="59.710" stopTime="62.501">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    --So what... what provision of the Constitution are you relying on?
speaker="jay_alan_sekulow" startTime="62.501" stopTime="65.944">
    Mr. Jay A. Sekulow 
    First Amendment, as applied to the States through the Fourteenth, freedom of speech.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="65.944" stopTime="66.334">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Which part of it?
speaker="jay_alan_sekulow" startTime="66.334" stopTime="67.165">
    Mr. Jay A. Sekulow 
    Free speech.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="67.165" stopTime="68.535">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Just free speech.
speaker="jay_alan_sekulow" startTime="68.535" stopTime="92.902">
    Mr. Jay A. Sekulow 
    Well, this case is based on three issues when it was originally brought fourth in the complaint. 
    The First Amendment's freedom of speech clause, there was an allegation that there was a violation of the establishment clause, and there was an allegation that there was violation of free exercise. 
    And, quite frankly, the nature of the discrimination that takes place here in the context of Lamb's Chapel's application being denied violates all three. 
    From the First Amendment perspective--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="92.902" stopTime="94.962">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    What did the... what did the court of appeals decide?
speaker="jay_alan_sekulow" startTime="94.962" stopTime="124.472">
    Mr. Jay A. Sekulow 
    --The court of appeals came to the conclusion that acknowledging that there were a wide diversity of uses, which the respondents have conceded as well, that, in fact, because there were no prior religious uses, the... the school district could then not allow Lamb's Chapel to meet. 
    They held, in fact, that it was a close question whether there was prior religious uses, but determined, based on review of the Salvation Army being there, the Southern Gospel Harmonizers, that it was no... there was no previous religious purpose in any meaningful way.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="124.472" stopTime="135.411">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, as the case comes to us, do we judge it on the basis that the court of appeals was correct in saying that... that this program had a religious purpose?
speaker="jay_alan_sekulow" startTime="135.411" stopTime="148.267">
    Mr. Jay A. Sekulow 
    The respondents have... petitioners have conceded Your Honor, Justice White, that yes, the... the movie series was dealing with contemporary family issues from a... a religious perspective and are quite up front that it is for a religious purpose.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="148.267" stopTime="148.738">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    All right.
speaker="jay_alan_sekulow" startTime="148.738" stopTime="220.785">
    Mr. Jay A. Sekulow 
    Our concern here, and I think what is evident here, is that the viewpoint discrimination that has been engaged in by the school district comes from their own admissions. 
    The respondents have stated that the decision... and I'm quoting from their brief. 
    "The decision to exclude petitioners was due to the admittedly religious nature of the film and the school district's prohibition against the use of school property for religious purposes. " 
    They then state that, and again quoting, 
    "Each of these applications were denied due to the decidedly religious perspective of the film. " 
    If Lamb's Chapel Church desired to utilize school facilities during noninstructional time in the evening, pursuant to the school's access policy, and if they determined to discuss the same issues, contemporary family issues, with the sole exception being that they do not make religious references or religious perspectives, then Center Moriches could not object to allowing the group to be there. 
    This isn't a case where we are arguing that a school district must open its facilities to a broad array of uses. 
    Here the school district, by policy, has stated that they are opening their facilities to community use for social, civic, recreational purposes and other uses pertaining to the welfare of the community.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="220.785" stopTime="222.615">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    What about political speech?
speaker="jay_alan_sekulow" startTime="222.615" stopTime="224.928">
    Mr. Jay A. Sekulow 
    They actually allow political speech, however--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="224.928" stopTime="227.721">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    What does the... what does the rule say?
speaker="jay_alan_sekulow" startTime="227.721" stopTime="248.625">
    Mr. Jay A. Sekulow 
    --The rule says this, that political speech could take place, political meetings could take place. 
    However if, in fact, the political meetings were partisan, if they were sponsored by a political organization, then there would have to be a vote of the district to determine whether, in fact, that group could meet, which I think presents another Constitutional issue which is not one that we're... we're concerned with today, but I think it points to the problem.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="248.625" stopTime="253.049">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, I know, but religious speech is not the only speech that is at least presumptively barred.
speaker="jay_alan_sekulow" startTime="253.049" stopTime="304.941">
    Mr. Jay A. Sekulow 
    Political speech by a party has to go through an admission process, if you will. 
    So... but here, and I think what's relevant here is this is not a question of where, Justice White, they've eliminated or construed their statute to remove the subject matter of family issues from the permissible speech. 
    This is not a question of whether the speech topic was permissible, nor is this really a question of whether the group was entitled to access. 
    Clearly the admission policy, the use policy of the school district states that it is open to not-for-profit outside groups. 
    Here the exclusion was based... as they have conceded, based on its content, the nature of the film, its viewpoint, its perspective. 
    And they've allowed, in other existing uses, several discussions on family issues. 
    For instance--
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="304.941" stopTime="305.642">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    Mr.... Mr. Sekulow--
speaker="jay_alan_sekulow" startTime="305.642" stopTime="306.213">
    Mr. Jay A. Sekulow 
    --Yes, Justice--
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="306.213" stopTime="319.381">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    --You would... on your view, you would also be entitled to win, wouldn't you, if we don't accept your characterization of it as viewpoint based, but held it to be content based. 
    On your theory, you'd still win, wouldn't you?
speaker="jay_alan_sekulow" startTime="319.381" stopTime="320.633">
    Mr. Jay A. Sekulow 
    --Yes, we do, Your Honor.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="320.633" stopTime="330.760">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    So that if we said what was excluded was simply discussions of religion or religious proselytization, you would still, on your viewpoint, win.
speaker="jay_alan_sekulow" startTime="330.760" stopTime="351.993">
    Mr. Jay A. Sekulow 
    Certainly, especially in the context of the policy that the school district has adopted here. 
    The... the school district has adopted a policy which, as I said, opens its facilities to social, civic, recreational use and other uses pertaining to the welfare of the community. 
    Our submission is quite clear that we believe the religious perspective, religious discussions, serve civic, social, and welfare of the community needs. 
    So--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="351.993" stopTime="365.843">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    But what if the school district had adopted a policy of excluding both religious and political speech on the grounds these tend to cause controversy and arguments and we'd just rather stay away from them?
speaker="jay_alan_sekulow" startTime="365.843" stopTime="385.975">
    Mr. Jay A. Sekulow 
    --I... I still would say, Mr. Chief Justice, that that would not... could not justify the exclusion. 
    Because the policy here, in its beginning, opens up facilities uses... that's again for social, civic, recreational purposes. 
    I think the religious view or religious perspective on social, civic, and welfare of the community needs is relevant, and there's no basis upon which--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="385.975" stopTime="386.376">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well--
speaker="jay_alan_sekulow" startTime="386.376" stopTime="388.096">
    Mr. Jay A. Sekulow 
    --Unless, of course, a compelling interest could be shown.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="388.096" stopTime="396.542">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    --Could... could... could the State exclude only partisan political speech and say that we just don't want to get into that sort of thing?
speaker="jay_alan_sekulow" startTime="396.542" stopTime="405.528">
    Mr. Jay A. Sekulow 
    I think that brings up a different question, but here the... the free exercise issue would come up and I think an establishment clause issue comes up in the context of our case.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="405.528" stopTime="408.330">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    How about the... how about the... how about the political question--
speaker="jay_alan_sekulow" startTime="408.330" stopTime="408.770">
    Mr. Jay A. Sekulow 
    I--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="408.770" stopTime="410.112">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    --You were just asked?

    Mr. Jay A. Sekulow 
    --I think that political--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="411.622" stopTime="412.393">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    But didn't answer, yeah.
speaker="jay_alan_sekulow" startTime="412.393" stopTime="426.822">
    Mr. Jay A. Sekulow 
    --Political speech is appropriate in the designation that the school district has adopted. 
    Could a school district adopt one that narrowly tailors and says no political speech because of our concerns? 
    Maybe they could, but that's not what they've done here. 
    And I... I think that maybe--
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="426.822" stopTime="428.693">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    Well, but what's the difference. 
    It... it seems to me--

    Justice Byron R. White 
    --You still haven't answered it.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="429.153" stopTime="431.106">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    It seems to me you haven't answered the question.
speaker="jay_alan_sekulow" startTime="431.106" stopTime="432.596">
    Mr. Jay A. Sekulow 
    --I don't think that you can say--
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="432.596" stopTime="445.035">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    You talk about free exercise. 
    We're talking about... just about speech. 
    If there is a... a prohibition against political speech, is that valid? 
    And if not, how is that different from the case we have here?
speaker="jay_alan_sekulow" startTime="445.035" stopTime="445.816">
    Mr. Jay A. Sekulow 
    --A prohibition--
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="445.816" stopTime="446.946">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    That's the question you've been asked.
speaker="jay_alan_sekulow" startTime="446.946" stopTime="467.367">
    Mr. Jay A. Sekulow 
    --Justice Kennedy, if there was a prohibition on just political speech, I think it suffers the same Constitutional defect. 
    It has... there has to be some type of compelling interest here to justify the exclusion, especially when the subject matter is a valid topic. 
    And I... I would also point out here that there were discussions of civic issues, political issues, meet-the-candidates nights.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="467.367" stopTime="475.853">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well... well then you're saying that if a school district opens up its forum to any outsiders, it's got to... up... open it up across the board.
speaker="jay_alan_sekulow" startTime="475.853" stopTime="477.285">
    Mr. Jay A. Sekulow 
    No... no I'm not, Mr. Chief Justice.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="477.285" stopTime="478.186">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well it seems to me that's what you're saying.
speaker="jay_alan_sekulow" startTime="478.186" stopTime="498.038">
    Mr. Jay A. Sekulow 
    No. 
    What we're saying is this. 
    The school district here has adopted a policy that states that social, civic, recreational uses and other uses pertaining to the welfare of the community can take place. 
    They've made the affirmative determination that, in fact, those type of activities can take place. 
    A school district certainly can... a school district could close its facilities. 
    They're not... they're not being compelled to open them--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="498.038" stopTime="501.030">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    But doesn't... doesn't political speech fall under that category, that... that... that--
speaker="jay_alan_sekulow" startTime="501.030" stopTime="503.153">
    Mr. Jay A. Sekulow 
    --I believe... I believe it does, Justice Scalia. 
    That's what I was saying too--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="503.153" stopTime="504.102">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    --Hum.
speaker="jay_alan_sekulow" startTime="504.102" stopTime="515.900">
    Mr. Jay A. Sekulow 
    --The question here is not whether political speech can take place, because under the policy political speech can take place. 
    The exclusion is if it's of a... from a partisan organization, and I think that suffers from Constitutional defects as well.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="515.900" stopTime="534.013">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    Also, by the same token would you say that if they... they could not exclude a... a religious service, for example. 
    If an outside group wanted to... to celebrate a mass or a baptism or something like that, could the... I presume, by a parity of reasoning, that could not be excluded.
speaker="jay_alan_sekulow" startTime="534.013" stopTime="570.057">
    Mr. Jay A. Sekulow 
    I think under the policy that's been adopted, Justice Souter, that removing a service, religious service, would suffer the same Constitutional problems. 
    And I would state that what this Court said in Widmar is... is relevant to that. 
    In Widmar the Bible group meeting of Cornerstone was in... in reality a service. 
    There were hymns, there was singing, there were discussions on biblical commentary. 
    That is a church service and I don't think that a school district that decides to open its facilities... as I said, they don't have to open their racilities, they've decided to open their facilities... can then parse the speech so closely to determine when religious speech crosses the line, if you will, to a religious service.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="570.057" stopTime="577.463">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    But are... are you accepting the... the ultimate premise of the other side that they can, in fact, define the extent to which they open it up?
speaker="jay_alan_sekulow" startTime="577.463" stopTime="585.136">
    Mr. Jay A. Sekulow 
    I think they can in the extent of speaker identification, clearly, and as regard to the subject matter of the discussion. 
    But to have an exclusion on--
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="585.136" stopTime="591.631">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    So the answer is there... quite clearly, they could exclude all political speech and they could exclude all religious speech.
speaker="jay_alan_sekulow" startTime="591.631" stopTime="597.405">
    Mr. Jay A. Sekulow 
    --Not when the... Justice Souter, not when the policy granting access says social--
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="597.405" stopTime="607.851">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    No, no. 
    But you were... you're just changing the premise of my question. 
    My... the premise of my question was that their policy granting access says no religious speech, no political speech. 
    On your view, that would be permissible.
speaker="jay_alan_sekulow" startTime="607.851" stopTime="616.948">
    Mr. Jay A. Sekulow 
    --Not in the context... well, if it was just a flat... there were no outside groups for other purposes. 
    I think the... the hypothetical that you're giving depends on... and I don't want to change the hypothetical--
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="616.948" stopTime="622.690">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    Yeah, there would be outside groups for other purposes, there just wouldn't be outside groups for political purposes and religious purposes.
speaker="jay_alan_sekulow" startTime="622.690" stopTime="625.402">
    Mr. Jay A. Sekulow 
    --I... I don't think that would... would be a valid exclusion.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="625.402" stopTime="638.431">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    Well, why not? 
    I thought your argument was proceeding on the fact that they've opened the doors wide and they cannot then pick and choose within the extent to which they have opened them. 
    But that apparently isn't your argument and you're now saying they've got to open the doors wide.
speaker="jay_alan_sekulow" startTime="638.431" stopTime="640.412">
    Mr. Jay A. Sekulow 
    Absolutely not, Justice Souter.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="640.412" stopTime="641.003">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    Then how do we draw the line?
speaker="jay_alan_sekulow" startTime="641.003" stopTime="675.935">
    Mr. Jay A. Sekulow 
    Let me make... let me make the position... what we're saying is this. 
    The school district here has elected to open its facilities and they've conceded to a wide diversity of uses. 
    They have targeted the religious purpose speech for exclusion. 
    They have conceded that the religious exclusion in our case is based on the perspective of the film series and its religious nature, that's their concessions. 
    Once you have an... a governmental municipality organization opening up its facilities to social, civic, recreational uses and other uses pertaining to the welfare of the community, they cannot then close it because of a religious perspective.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="675.935" stopTime="684.621">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Is your... is your theory, Mr. Sekulow, that you cannot pick on religion, that... that... that if religion is just one of many things excluded it's okay.
speaker="jay_alan_sekulow" startTime="684.621" stopTime="685.322">
    Mr. Jay A. Sekulow 
    No.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="685.322" stopTime="691.857">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    But if it's the only thing excluded or one of only a couple of things excluded, it's not okay.
speaker="jay_alan_sekulow" startTime="691.857" stopTime="704.415">
    Mr. Jay A. Sekulow 
    My position is... this is my position, that when you open up a school district... when a school district elects to open up its facilities for community use for such uses as social, civic, and welfare of the community needs, you cannot exclude the religious perspective.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="704.415" stopTime="706.135">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Why? 
    Because that includes too many needs.
speaker="jay_alan_sekulow" startTime="706.135" stopTime="709.108">
    Mr. Jay A. Sekulow 
    No, because the religious perspective is relevant to civic concerns.

    Oh--
speaker="jay_alan_sekulow" startTime="709.538" stopTime="716.393">
    Mr. Jay A. Sekulow 
    And that's... and that's where the viewpoint discrimination is here.

    Mr. Jay A. Sekulow 
    --No. 
    But that's the type of subject matter restrictions that a school district in this type of situation certainly... they could say just for bowling, just for tennis.

    No, they haven't.

    Mr. Jay A. Sekulow 
    Because this Court has said that viewpoint discrimination, even in a nonpublic forum, is not acceptable. 
    And I... I don't think that--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="809.072" stopTime="815.256">
    Justice Antonin Scalia

    Mr. Jay A. Sekulow 
    --I... I guess the argument could be made if there's a religious perspective on bowling. 
    But when you open up the topic and the subject matter to social, civic, and welfare of the concerns, and I think the record points to this. 
    The... there's two things that I think are... are extremely important with regard to the record. 
    Family Counseling Services, which was an organization that utilized the facilities for counseling, dealt with the... precisely the same issues that the school district would have dealt with... that the church would have dealt with in its film series.

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well, you don't... you don't have to defend some of these rather extreme hypotheticals to win your case. 
    Your position, I take it, is that since they have had family rearing matters shown and discussed, they can't exclude a family rearing presentation because of a religious perspective in it.
speaker="jay_alan_sekulow" startTime="866.402" stopTime="871.415">
    Mr. Jay A. Sekulow 
    That's correct.

    I have not, we've been dealing with the hypotheticals. 
    [Laughter] 
    But I will address... I will address the Widmar issue. 
    But let me say first... answer to the Chief Justice's question and then I will proceed to answer you, Justice White. 
    This is a case where the identical subject matter, family issues, child abuse, marital conflict, was discussed by Family Counseling Services and a number of other groups. 
    And the film series, if Lamb's Chapel was allowed to show it, addressed the same issues, albeit from a religious perspective. 
    And that is what is prohibited by the policy and that is the viewpoint discrimination when the subject matter is acceptable and the speaker's entitled to access, that this Court has said that type of viewpoint discrimination--

    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    May I give you one other hypothetical?

    Mr. Jay A. Sekulow 
    --Certainly, Justice Stevens.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="921.127" stopTime="935.977">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Supposing there's a group that thinks families would be much healthier and happier and get along better if they all smoked marijuana together, and they came and they want to advocate that under the subject matter of child rearing and family values. 
    Would they have to give that group access to the facilities?
speaker="jay_alan_sekulow" startTime="935.977" stopTime="946.165">
    Mr. Jay A. Sekulow 
    I think that, in that case, unless the school district could show a compelling interest to justify the exclusion, they would have the same problem. 
    And I'm... I'm not so sure they would. 
    This is not an educational--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="946.165" stopTime="947.675">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, the fact is it would be against the law.

    Mr. Jay A. Sekulow 
    --Well, that's... that's what I was going to say. 
    And the compelling interest would be--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="949.655" stopTime="953.959">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    And the law should be changed in order to accommodate this family value.
speaker="jay_alan_sekulow" startTime="953.959" stopTime="955.439">
    Mr. Jay A. Sekulow 
    --That's a different hypothetical. 
    [Laughter]

    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    It's the one I had in mind all along.
speaker="jay_alan_sekulow" startTime="957.863" stopTime="962.734">
    Mr. Jay A. Sekulow 
    The first... the second hypothetical is different. 
    You're talking about speech that is not advocating--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="962.734" stopTime="968.308">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Well say... or just say family value would be promoted by soak... by having the children learn how to smoke cigarettes at an early age.
speaker="jay_alan_sekulow" startTime="968.308" stopTime="1017.299">
    Mr. Jay A. Sekulow 
    --I think perhaps a school district would then have to assert that the health concerns... and now, again, this is another situation not precisely... or really very remote from our case... but where maybe the school district could come up with some compelling interest to justify medical exclusion based on that. 
    But that's not what happened here, and this is not a case where they're advocating illegal activity, although you would think from the New York Attorney General's perspective that's exactly what's going here. 
    They... they say religious advocacy is only good to those who already believe... already adherents of the faith. 
    But Widmar has addressed this issue precisely. 
    By policy, the school district... the University in Widmar encouraged student groups and stated that they would like... they encouraged student groups to meet and form for social, civic, political, recreational, and educational purposes. 
    Here, the Center Moriches School District has adopted a policy and--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="1017.299" stopTime="1023.824">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    But in Widmar... in Widmar, the group, the religious group that wanted to meet was a student group.
speaker="jay_alan_sekulow" startTime="1023.824" stopTime="1026.096">
    Mr. Jay A. Sekulow 
    --I don't think in this case--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="1026.096" stopTime="1027.968">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    It was a student group in Widmar.
speaker="jay_alan_sekulow" startTime="1027.968" stopTime="1029.829">
    Mr. Jay A. Sekulow 
    --That's correct. 
    And the school--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="1029.829" stopTime="1049.880">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Now I would... I would suppose that... I would suppose that if the school in this case had opened its... had opened its property just for student activities dealing with social and such, but no outside groups whatsoever, you probably wouldn't be here.
speaker="jay_alan_sekulow" startTime="1049.880" stopTime="1051.552">
    Mr. Jay A. Sekulow 
    --Correct. 
    Different case. 
    And--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="1051.552" stopTime="1053.345">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well yeah, but that... but that happens to be Widmar.
speaker="jay_alan_sekulow" startTime="1053.345" stopTime="1066.014">
    Mr. Jay A. Sekulow 
    --But the distinction, and I think the distinction cuts our way here, Justice White, is that in Widmar the university determined to open its school district up for student groups to use it. 
    Here, the school district determined to open up its school facilities for outside uses.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="1066.014" stopTime="1066.833">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Exactly.
speaker="jay_alan_sekulow" startTime="1066.833" stopTime="1104.228">
    Mr. Jay A. Sekulow 
    So I think the speaker identification restrictions in Widmar and what was adopted here, albeit different, cut our way. 
    Because what we have is a school district affirmly saying community groups, come in and use our facilities, for precisely the same policy in scope that was in Widmar. 
    The exclusion is the same as well. 
    In Widmar the exclusion was that they prohibited school district... university facilities to be used for the purposes of religious worship or teaching. 
    Here the exclusion states that school district facilities may not, or school premises may not be used for religious purposes, and the justification for the exclusion is the same as well.

    Well, on that narrow basis, you know, what you're asking us to do is relatively limited. 
    You're saying if... if you... if you allow the discussion of a certain topic you cannot permit a religious viewpoint on that topic. 
    But the next case just around the corner is... is a group that wants to come into this same... the same school district and they say we want to address the... the topic of religion, not... not family, we want to address separately the topic of religion. 
    And it's not a question of giving a religious viewpoint on some other topic which... which the rules allow, but rather the topic of religion in and of itself which is as a separate topic--

    Mr. Sekulow, if I were an attorney for a school board and was listening to your argument, I would go back to my board of education and say if you open your auditorium to two or three different lectures in the community, based on the argument I heard from Mr. Sekulow, you're going to have to allow a Catholic mass to be said in that facility. 
    Because I've heard him say nothing that would allow the Court to write a decision that gives any kind of reasonable assurance that we can design a category to prevent this use once we have two or three different lecture groups come in from the community at large.

    --I would have to concede, which I'm not going to, that a mass would be irrelevant to the community good or community welfare or civic, social concerns. 
    They could draft a policy to prohibit masses.

speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1426.790" stopTime="1430.032">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    You say you would have to concede it, but you're not going to.

    Mr. Jay A. Sekulow 
    --I would not-- 
    [Laughter] 
    I will... I said I will not concede it because... I'll make that very clear, I believe, and our perspective that we're taking here is that when you open it up to social, civic, and recreational uses and other welfare of the community, that a mass would serve the community. 
    That doesn't mean everyone has to go to the mass. 
    This isn't a captive audience. 
    This isn't a situation where students are there, during the day. 
    And I think this... what this Court said in Mergens is... is relevant to that. 
    If a... if high school students were mature enough to understand that a school district does not endorse everything it fails to censor, I think the adults in the community of Center Moriches could do the same. 
    And I don't think it presents the type of Constitutional dilemma that... that some have made it out to be, that we'll have to allow all religious services. 
    If allowing the religious service is going to be so divisive to the community that they now can justify the exclusion under this policy, no they can't.

    Justice David H. Souter 
    So you're saying a narrow categorization is possible, and I think you're also saying that if a... if a general categorization, including speech generally is allowed, there cannot be a specific exception to it for subject matter.

    Mr. Jay A. Sekulow 
    That is correct.

    So it... it simply boils down to a question of the precision with which they specifically identify the permitted uses.

    Mr. Jay A. Sekulow 
    Absolutely. 
    This ordinance, although maybe not suffering the same constitutional defect that the Board of Airport Commissioners were, wher it was, you know, no First Amendment activities in here, suffers from that same type of problem. 
    They have not chosen to narrowly tailor their restrictions. 
    Instead, what they've done is open it up t social, civic, recreational, and other uses pertaining to the welfare of the community, but say no if it's a religious perspective, no if it's religious content. 
    Mr. Chief Justice, I'd like to reserve--

    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    May I just make sure I understood on of your statements. 
    You mentioned Shakespeare if they opened up for drama. 
    Did you say yes or no to the question of whether they could limit it to Shakespeare?
speaker="jay_alan_sekulow" startTime="1531.891" stopTime="1558.118">
    Mr. Jay A. Sekulow 
    --I think they could limit it to Shakespeare if they had a... a standard which was specifi saying we're going to have Shakespeare. 
    But they cannot say we're going to allow drama groups and they exclude Handel's Messiah because we do not want a religious group or discriminate against a religious play if it was opened up to... to drama generally. 
    And that's what the difference is. 
    They've not chosen to limit to specifics. 
    They've been... they've chosen to open it to everything but religion.

    Mr. Jay A. Sekulow 
    Okay. 
    Well, if they're saying an X-rated movie's going to be shown at the school district facilities, this... the analysis I don't think changes Constitutionally. 
    Again, I think that in... in a real sense, a town... this is the meeting hall, the town hall that was discussed... mentioned in Lemon. 
    And I think that the interesting issue and the important issue here at bottom is not that school districts have to open its facilities up, not that they can't narrowly tailor them, but once they've opened them up to such a broad array of topics, they cannot exclude religious speech or religious purpose speech, as they have determined. 
    And here that's exactly what they've done and that type of viewpoint discrimination this Court should not tolerate. 
    Mr. Chief Justice, I'd like to reserve the rest of my time for rebuttal. 
   
   
   
   Argument of John W. Hoefling
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1637.500" stopTime="1641.251">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Very well, Mr. Sekulow. 
    Mr. Hoefling, we'll hear from you.
speaker="john_w_hoefling" startTime="1641.251" stopTime="1754.976">
    Mr. John W. Hoefling 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court: 
    It's the position of the respondent in this case, the Center Moriches School District and the president of the board, that they have denied access to the petitioners in this case based upon a well tailored State statute, the New York State Education Law, section 414, and a series of regulations promulgated under that statute. 
    We submit that the school district has essentially established a limited public forum, and it not an open public forum, in which certain uses are not permitted. 
    And we further submit that we have... in the course of using this facility and making it available to certain groups within the community, have been consistent in the uses that we have permitted. 
    We submit that the petitioner is erroneous... has taken an erroneous position in looking at this particular film series as being part of a larger picture, namely the use of the facility for social, educational, and community welfare activities. 
    In fact, if you... if you look at the record, both in the district court from the testimony of Pastor Steigerwald and the submission of Pastor Steigerwald in his third application for the use of the premises, in both of those instances he's indicated that he is not prepared to abide by the regulation of the district, and, in fact, he intends to use the facility for educational institution after... for educational... religious education after hours in the school setting.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1754.976" stopTime="1760.760">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well, what policy of the district was it that Paster Steigerwald said he couldn't or wouldn't abide?

    Mr. John W. Hoefling

speaker="john_w_hoefling" startTime="1766.865" stopTime="1777.749">
    Mr. John W. Hoefling 
    Your Honor, the... the policy of the school district with regard to this particular use was that the premises would not be used for religious purposes.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1777.749" stopTime="1783.924">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    And that meant any sort of a presentation that had a religious connotation to it.
speaker="john_w_hoefling" startTime="1783.924" stopTime="1813.113">
    Mr. John W. Hoefling 
    We submit, Your Honor, that that, as... as the school district has used that policy, means that to the extent somebody... someone is prepared to come forward and use the facilities for the purpose of proselytization or urging somebody to adopt a particular lifestyle which is based upon certain religious precepts, is an... an inappropriate use in our forum.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1813.113" stopTime="1821.310">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well, would the policy permit someone to come in and urge the adoption of a particular lifestyle that was not based on any religious precepts?
speaker="john_w_hoefling" startTime="1821.310" stopTime="1821.438">
    Mr. John W. Hoefling 
    Yes, it would, Your Honor.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1821.438" stopTime="1835.840">

speaker="john_w_hoefling" startTime="1835.840" stopTime="1836.679">
    Mr. John W. Hoefling 
    Yes, Your Honor, that's correct.

    Mr. John W. Hoefling 
    Yes, Your Honor, I do.

    That is not the case in our... in our scenario here.

    --But it... it is... it isn't... I mean I gather from what you say that a speaker could come in and urge the adaptation of a particular lifestyle so long as he was urging it on a secular basis, but that he... so that that subject matter is permissible. 
    But a speaker who urges the adoption of a lifestyle based on a religious theme or a religious passage could not do it.

    Mr. John W. Hoefling 
    That's correct, Your Honor. 
    And... and... and the focus of... of the district in looking at religion in this particular regard is that... and it's not just the religious exclusions that we've... that we've fashioned in our regulations and tracked in the State statute, but there are prohibitions in terms of commercial use of the premises and prohibitions with regard to political uses of the premises. 
    In doing that, the school district is attempting to avoid certain controversial areas which, in terms of religion, if you open the forum to a particular religious use, may well bring you into conflict with establishment problems and may result in entanglement problems which the school district would rather avoid.

    Mr. John W. Hoefling 
    It... the university, in and of itself as to the students, is an open public forum under Widmar.

    Justice David H. Souter

    Justice David H. Souter 
    Okay. 
    Now, do you... are you also suggesting that in order to win, we recognize... we must recognize in this case a... a fourth forum category, that is the... the limited designated public forum?
speaker="john_w_hoefling" startTime="2337.876" stopTime="2378.821">
    Mr. John W. Hoefling 
    Your Honor, I think that the language that comes out in our brief is... is a function of, as much of anything, the language that this Court has used and the language in the Second Circuit. 
    And we've tried to accommodate those two terms together. 
    I'm not sure that it's necessary to determine that there is specifically a fourth category of... of speech regulation, but that in our particular case it certainly... this forum, as to outside groups, takes on the appearance of a limited public forum or a designated public forum that has not been opened up to the petitioners.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="2378.821" stopTime="2389.229">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    Okay. 
    So you're... you're saying a... a designated public forum can have limitations, but it cannot in a university setting with respect to university students, considered in isolation.

    Mr. John W. Hoefling 
    As... as to those students, it is an open public forum, Your Honor. 
    Your Honor, I think that this Court has certainly hinted at that besides the case of Widmar. 
    There... in Perry, the language of this Court is the right of access extends only to other entities of a similar character, and there is nothing wrong with having some distinction in access on the basis of subject matter and speaker identification.

    Well, Your Honor, I think, again, that comes down to the focus of how... how narrow it is you look at the speech that's being engaged in.

    But when we get to the point where we are prescreening what they're going to show to see whether or not it's too religious or too close to a mass or a service, too close to proselytizing, that becomes a very difficult issue and really does create entanglement problems for the district.

    The problem is... is that if you define religion... a limited forum in terms of content, it can be self-defeating because the whole idea of limited... of... of a public forum of some kind is to allow for the expression of speech, so you have to be very careful that you're not just engaging in a circular definition.

Your Honor, Justice Kennedy, I think that if you look at the picture that this Court has drawn, the framework that this Court has put together through the years from Greer and Widmar and Perry and the cases that outline forum analysis, I think it is a useful framework for the school district and for other local government officials to govern what they can and cannot do without running into Constitutional problems in the free speech area.

    That does not... that does not mean, however, that there is some type of Constitutional compulsion to open the school district to a religious speaker simply because there is some moral force which religious speakers bring with them that otherwise betters the community.

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    However, there may be some compulsion to treat it... to treat religion like other civic goods. 
    And when you open up the forum to other social and civically beneficial things, you cannot exclude it to religion on the theory that religion, after all, is just private and only serves... only yields a benefit to those who already believe. 
    That certainly hasn't been our... our tradition in... in this country in viewing the role of religion in public life.
speaker="john_w_hoefling" startTime="3140.542" stopTime="3221.914">
    Mr. John W. Hoefling 
    I agree with that, Your Honor. 
    I have no problem with that, the position you've just stated. 
    I just don't think that, again, the fact that religion has a particular positive influence in the community that extends even beyond believers is, of itself, enough to require a school district to grant access to religious speakers. 
    Your Honor, Justice O'Connor asked a question about the reasonableness before. 
    There are... although, to be... to be honest with you, I don't think the record has developed this. 
    I think there are good reasons for the school district to have a distinction between religious speakers and nonreligious speakers in a limited public forum such as we've established here. 
    I think the same thing can be said for political speakers and in terms of avoiding controversy, allowing the school system to be about the business of... the principal business of educating the children entrusted to its care. 
    That those types of purposes are reasonable purposes and reasonable enough to support the invocation of this particular rule.

    I don't... I don't--

    --I don't really understand what the entanglement problems are, even if it were a matter of allowing religious services. 
    Let's assume that... that the... that the school district leases its building... it's just a building. 
    It's a building and once the kids are out and it's in the evening and they're nothing... it's a building that they rent out to anything. 
    Let's assume they rent it even to for-profit organizations for conducting sales meetings, training of sales representatives, or whatever, but there is somehow an... an entanglement problem if... if they would lease it to a religious group that wants to conduct a service there.

    Mr. John W. Hoefling 
    Your Honor, I submit that if... if this facility were leased to a religious organization that wanted to use it for its own services, you wind up with questions about the character and purposes of the institution that's benefitted, which becomes... becomes the religious institution itself, by virtue of having a space that it doesn't otherwise have available to it.

   Rebuttal of Jay A. Sekulow
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="3486.907" stopTime="3490.380">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Thank you, Mr. Hoefling. 
    Mr. Sekulow, you have 3 minutes remaining.
speaker="jay_alan_sekulow" startTime="3490.380" stopTime="3541.134">
    Mr. Jay A. Sekulow 
    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 
    The way I understand the respondents' argument, the atheists are in, the agnostics are in, the communists are in, the religion is not in. 
    In fact, even if it was a debatable point, as Justice Thomas just said, only one side of the debate is heard. 
    That's exactly what we've been asserting in our briefs and that's exactly what they've conceded in their briefs. 
    This is the type of viewpoint discrimination that this Court has not sanctioned. 
    And I'd also point out that this establishment clause concern has already been addressed. 
    This case is not in a vacuum. 
    Widmar is this Court's precedent, Mergens is this Court's precedent. 
    We're talking about a policy of equal access, and if the communists can come in and give their view on family life and others could give their view on family life, but you allow religion... I think if there's an establishment clause, it... it violates... their policy violates the establishment clause by interfering with religion.

    Justice Byron R. White 
    Do you think... that all... that the only exclusion with respect to religion was religious ceremonies, actually religious services?
speaker="jay_alan_sekulow" startTime="3554.133" stopTime="3557.456">
    Mr. Jay A. Sekulow 
    In the context, Justice White, of this existing policy?
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3557.456" stopTime="3558.394">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Yes.
speaker="jay_alan_sekulow" startTime="3558.394" stopTime="3581.860">
    Mr. Jay A. Sekulow 
    I think it's the same argument, because a religious service does have a religious perspective, especially if the sermon is addressing the family issues that were... that... in the debate, so to speak. 
    You had the secularist groups come in and give their view and then you had a religious service, they sang religious songs, they gave hymns, and then the sermon was family values and family issues from the Bible. 
    To deny that is viewpoint discrimination, to make... to make no Constitutional--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3581.860" stopTime="3584.423">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, what if it wasn't a sermon about family values?

    What if it was a... what if the... what if the only thing that happened was that they read from the Bible, they read from the scriptures?
speaker="jay_alan_sekulow" startTime="3594.268" stopTime="3626.602">
    Mr. Jay A. Sekulow 
    --I believe in that case the... the biblical admonition, whatever it might be, is still a religious perspective and probably, based on views of the Bible that people hold, would be valid as to civic, social, and recreational use. 
    The policy here is not different than Widmar. 
    Widmar limited it to student groups, the school district opened it to outside groups. 
    They've... the speaker identity is not an issue and the subject matter's not an issue. 
    There is one thing that is an issue. 
    The communists are in, the atheists are in, the agnostics are in, but religion's out because we don't like their viewpoint and that's what we're objecting to here.
