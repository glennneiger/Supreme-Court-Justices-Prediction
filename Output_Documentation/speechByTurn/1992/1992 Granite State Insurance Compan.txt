Granite State Insurance Company v. Tandy Corporation

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    We'll hear argument first this morning in Number 91-2086, the Granite State Insurance Company v. the Tandy Corporation. 
    Ms. Webb.
speaker="ann_e_webb" startTime="11.179" stopTime="154.144">
    Ms. Ann E. Webb 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    There is only one issue in this case which is truly uncontested. 
    Granite State and Tandy had been engaged in a significant coverage dispute for over 2 years beginning several months before Granite State filed suit. 
    In an effort to resolve an escalating problem, Granite State filed a declaratory judgment action in Federal court using a remedy expressly granted by Congress in the Declaratory Judgment Act. 
    Both jurisdiction and venue were proper in Houston. 
    Nonetheless, the district court stayed this action in deference to a later-filed State court action filed almost a month later by Tandy in Fort Worth, Texas. 
    The Fifth Circuit affirmed. 
    By giving the district court virtually unfettered discretion to defer to the State courts, the Fifth Circuit has judicially eviscerated an affirmative legislative remedy. 
    Granite State is here today asking this Court to reinstate the Declaratory Judgment Act. 
    There are two questions presented by this appeal. 
    The first is whether a district court with unquestioned jurisdiction can abstain from hearing an action validly before it simply because of the presence of a later-filed State court action. 
    The second issue is whether the abstention decision of the district court is reviewed de novo or for abuse of discretion. 
    Because of the importance of the comity and Federalism issued presented by abstention decisions, it is important that courts of appeals stringently address... stringently review the decision of the district court. 
    The pendency of a parallel action is always a consideration in an abstention decision. 
    There is no abstention decision unless there is a parallel State court action. 
    This cannot be an exceptional circumstance which will justify abstention from a Federal court's unflagging obligation to exercise its valid jurisdiction. 
    In determining whether an abstention decision is appropriate, a Federal court must begin with one of the fundamental precepts of our Federal judicial system, and this Court has stated that Federal courts have no more right to decline the exercise of valid jurisdiction than to usurp that which is not given. 
    The one or the other is treasonous to the Constitution. 
    Abstention is an extraordinary and narrow exception to a Federal court's unflagging obligation to exercise its valid jurisdiction.

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well, Ms. Webb, are you assuming that an action for a declaratory judgment in that respect is the same as an action for an injunction or for damages because the declaratory judgment statute which you set forth in your brief at page 3 says that the district court may declare the rights. 
    It certainly suggests discretion to do so or not to do so, doesn't it?
speaker="ann_e_webb" startTime="179.191" stopTime="226.101">
    Ms. Ann E. Webb 
    Your Honor, there seems to be some discretion in the declaratory judgment statute. 
    We believe the discretion is not whether or not a district court may hear the case, but whether or not the district court may grant the release asked for. 
    There are many occasions in which declaratory relief is sought, but declaratory relief isn't appropriate for one reason or another. 
    For example, in the Grow case, it's... the Voting Rights Act precludes the granting of declaratory relief. 
    The State legislative prerogative precludes the granting of declaratory relief. 
    A case cited by my co-counsel, Mansour v. Green, the Eleventh Amendment barred the granting of declaratory relief. 
    We believe that is where the discretion lies. 
    The courts do not have discretion whether or not to decline jurisdiction. 
    Jurisdiction is mandatory.

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    What do you do with the Brillhart case?
speaker="ann_e_webb" startTime="228.222" stopTime="254.520">
    Ms. Ann E. Webb 
    We believe that the Brillhart case, a decision almost 50 years old at this point, cannot be read in a vacuum. 
    It must be read in light of this Court's intervening decisions, in Colorado River, Moses Cone, and most recently in the NOPSI decision, in which this Court has applied a different type of analysis to cases involving the Declaratory Judgment Act. 
    They have not relegated declaratory judgment cases to the unfettered discretion of the district judge as Brillhart seemed to do.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="254.520" stopTime="260.904">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well, were all of the cases that you described as the more modern cases, did those all involve declaratory judgments?
speaker="ann_e_webb" startTime="260.904" stopTime="276.725">
    Ms. Ann E. Webb 
    Colorado River did not. 
    Moses Cone was begun as a declaratory judgment action seeking a declaration that the Arbitration Act applied. 
    NOPSI, the New Orleans public service case issued by this Court in 1989, was expressly seeking declaratory and injunctive relief.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="276.725" stopTime="308.565">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Ms. Webb, I don't quite understand how you express... how you expect this to work. 
    After hearing all the evidence the district court says, well, in light of the fact that there is a State court action pending, I don't think it's a good idea to issue the declaratory judgment you want and therefore, exercising the discretion I have not to issue the declaratory judgment, though I don't have any discretion whether to take all the evidence, I won't give you the declaratory judgment. 
    Is that how it works?
speaker="ann_e_webb" startTime="308.565" stopTime="311.116">
    Ms. Ann E. Webb 
    I don't believe so. 
    In the first place--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="311.116" stopTime="317.320">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    I hope not, because that would be an awful waste of time if they have discretion not to issue it, why don't they have discretion not to hear it?
speaker="ann_e_webb" startTime="317.320" stopTime="325.425">
    Ms. Ann E. Webb 
    --Well, in the first place you have to start with the proposition that jurisdiction is unflagging, and you have to go from there into--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="325.425" stopTime="331.190">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    We've never said its unflagging. 
    We've said it's virtually unflagging and really haven't even behaved as though it was.
speaker="ann_e_webb" startTime="331.190" stopTime="343.488">
    Ms. Ann E. Webb 
    --Well, certainly in Moses Cone and NOPSI this Court has reversed abstention decisions in declaratory judgment cases, which... and the Court has continuously emphasized the importance of the obligation to exercise jurisdiction. 
    The--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="343.488" stopTime="366.792">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Well, you must take the position, then, that after taking all of the evidence and proceeding with the trial, the district court does not have the discretion to deny the declaratory relief, either, if the reason he's going to deny it she's going to deny it that there's a State action pending, right?
speaker="ann_e_webb" startTime="366.792" stopTime="372.316">
    Ms. Ann E. Webb 
    --I don't believe that the fact that there's a State action pending is a sufficient reason to deny declaratory relief.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="372.316" stopTime="373.848">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Why do you say that?
speaker="ann_e_webb" startTime="373.848" stopTime="380.043">
    Ms. Ann E. Webb 
    Because this Court has continuously emphasized that the presence of a parallel action is no bar to the Federal court's ruling on an issue.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="380.043" stopTime="402.095">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    It seems to me a very good reason to deny the declaratory relief, that there's a prior action pending, comity, consideration for the State. 
    Why isn't that a perfectly valid equitable consideration? 
    If it's a valid consideration for not issuing the injunction for the declaratory relief, certainly it's a valid consideration, it seems to me, for not accepting jurisdiction in the first place.
speaker="ann_e_webb" startTime="402.095" stopTime="473.973">
    Ms. Ann E. Webb 
    Well, we would certainly disagree with your position that it's a valid reason for declining to issue the requested relief, but the issue is not whether or not the district court... I'm sorry. 
    The State court action was the second action filed in this case. 
    Granite State filed first in Federal court using an affirmative remedy under the Declaratory Judgment Act. 
    The presence of a later-filed State court action is not a reason to decline to hear a first-filed declaratory judgment action. 
    It makes no sense, and it certainly does not comport with the obvious congressional purpose in giving Federal litigants a right to a declaratory judgment action when they have valid jurisdiction to say that a litigant who comes to a Federal court seeking help, a litigant who says, I don't know... I'm between a rock and a hard place here. 
    I have a choice. 
    I can pay my assured $10 million on the one hand with no hope of ever getting it back, or I can deny coverage and get nailed with a bad faith lawsuit in State court. 
    Granite State being faced with that position chose what we believe to have been the prudent course of asking the Federal court for help.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="473.973" stopTime="477.005">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    What if the State court action had been filed first?
speaker="ann_e_webb" startTime="477.005" stopTime="481.247">
    Ms. Ann E. Webb 
    In that case, Your Honor, there is a good argument for leaving it in the State court.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="481.247" stopTime="488.061">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    So then it's not an unflagging obligation. 
    There may be considerations based on State court litigation.
speaker="ann_e_webb" startTime="488.061" stopTime="512.297">
    Ms. Ann E. Webb 
    We would suggest that the Declaratory Judgment Act represents such an important congressional intent that litigants who have Federal jurisdiction be allowed to retain their Federal jurisdiction and proceed in Federal court, that abstention would not be appropriate even in a later-filed State court action. 
    The argument is much stronger that the Federal court should defer if there is a first-filed State court action.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="512.297" stopTime="515.479">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    But you don't... you would say they shouldn't defer even then.
speaker="ann_e_webb" startTime="515.479" stopTime="517.052">
    Ms. Ann E. Webb 
    I would say they shouldn't defer even then.

    Justice Byron R. White 
    Wasn't there just a stay in this case?
speaker="ann_e_webb" startTime="521.722" stopTime="523.525">
    Ms. Ann E. Webb 
    There was just a stay in this case, but because--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="523.525" stopTime="526.606">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    So it really isn't an abstention case in the sense that you dismissed the case.
speaker="ann_e_webb" startTime="526.606" stopTime="530.559">
    Ms. Ann E. Webb 
    --It has the same effect as an abstention case because res judicata--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="530.559" stopTime="537.796">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    But it isn't an abstention case. 
    It's just a stay. 
    They are retaining their jurisdiction. 
    They did not dismiss.
speaker="ann_e_webb" startTime="537.796" stopTime="552.044">
    Ms. Ann E. Webb 
    --They did not dismiss. 
    The district court stayed, but because of the presence of res judicata... because of the doctrine of res judicata, any ruling by the State court is going to effectively keep Granite State out of its Federal forum. 
    We will not be able to relitigate our issues in the Federal forum.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="552.044" stopTime="583.605">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    Well, then you go back to the question that Justice Scalia raised initially. 
    I don't really understand what the rule is you're proposing. 
    If a district judge finds, after looking at the face of the pleadings, that it's most unlikely that he will enter this declaratory judgment, then it seems to me that he should stay the action, but you seem to think that he has to proceed through the motions of hearing evidence and come right up to the time when he's ready to issue his decision. 
    That doesn't make sense.
speaker="ann_e_webb" startTime="583.605" stopTime="592.573">
    Ms. Ann E. Webb 
    What we are suggesting is that the district court has to engage in abstention analysis before they can make a decision whether to abstain or not.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="592.573" stopTime="593.832">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    But it's not--

    Not that he has--

    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    --But you call it abstention analysis. 
    Suppose he calls it declaratory judgment statute analysis. 
    There are factors that indicate whether or not it's prudent, under the declaratory judgment statute, for me to make this ruling, for me to make this expenditure of time and resources of the courts and the parties, and those factors indicate to me that I should not do this. 
    I'll just let the case hang on the docket and see what happens in the State proceeding.
speaker="ann_e_webb" startTime="622.351" stopTime="634.671">
    Ms. Ann E. Webb 
    --That's exactly what the district court has done in this case, and we believe that the district court's analysis was incorrect, because he ignored the court's unflagging obligation to exercise jurisdiction. 
    We think that the--
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="634.671" stopTime="639.024">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    Well, to begin with, he hasn't dismissed the case. 
    He is retaining jurisdiction.
speaker="ann_e_webb" startTime="639.024" stopTime="669.522">
    Ms. Ann E. Webb 
    --It does not matter in... certainly not in the Moses Cone analysis, which was also a stay, and which this Court decided resolved under the Colorado River plus two additional factors. 
    The Moses Cone-Colorado River analysis involved stays, not dismissal. 
    I don't recall whether NOPSI was a stay or a dismissal at this point, but the functional effect of a stay in a case such as this one is of a dismissal. 
    There should be no difference in the analysis.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="669.522" stopTime="677.848">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Do you agree that the Colorado River factors should govern?
speaker="ann_e_webb" startTime="677.848" stopTime="711.601">
    Ms. Ann E. Webb 
    In the first instance, we would prefer to say that the legislative policy of the Declaratory Judgment act, coupled with valid Federal jurisdiction, means that the Federal court cannot dismiss or stay a case of this nature. 
    However, we recognize that this Court has indicated in Colorado River and Moses Cone in a declaratory judgment case that there may be some certain circumstances in which there is an extraordinary state interest or other exceptional circumstances in which there is an extraordinary State interest or other exceptional circumstances in which abstention is appropriate, and we suggest that those factors come from Moses Cone and Colorado River and must be analyzed.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="711.601" stopTime="721.389">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    So if the Colorado River factors happen to balance out against you, why, you wouldn't be here, I guess.
speaker="ann_e_webb" startTime="721.389" stopTime="739.698">
    Ms. Ann E. Webb 
    Well, the Colorado River doctrine states, when it's coupled with Moses Cone, that the obligation to exercise jurisdiction is unflagging, and the factors must be exercised or weighed in light of that unflagging obligation. 
    In other words, if the factors are evenly balanced, or if the factors do not apply, such as jurisdiction over property--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="739.698" stopTime="747.545">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    My proposition was that let's assume that the Colorado River factors clearly balance out against you.
speaker="ann_e_webb" startTime="747.545" stopTime="750.117">
    Ms. Ann E. Webb 
    --If the factors--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="750.117" stopTime="751.095">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    You would say you would lose the case.
speaker="ann_e_webb" startTime="751.095" stopTime="752.167">
    Ms. Ann E. Webb 
    --Yes, sir.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="752.167" stopTime="758.842">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Which is to say it's not really an unflagging obligation. 
    You would say the obligation flags--
speaker="ann_e_webb" startTime="758.842" stopTime="759.813">
    Ms. Ann E. Webb 
    But only--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="759.813" stopTime="761.723">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    --If you lose on the Colorado River factor, right?
speaker="ann_e_webb" startTime="761.723" stopTime="808.574">
    Ms. Ann E. Webb 
    --The obligation only flags if extraordinary circumstances exist, and the Court has identified those extraordinary circumstances in the various abstention doctrines... Pullman, Burford, Younger... and the factors of Colorado River and Moses Cone. 
    I think the NOPSI decision, which was quite straightforwardly a declaratory and injunctive relief lawsuit in which this Court did not defer to the district court's discretion but instead analyzed it de novo in light of the Burford and Younger abstention doctrines, indicates clearly that the declaratory judgment cases are not committed to the unfettered discretion of the district court but rather must be analyzed under traditional principles of the Federal court's jurisdiction is mandatory unless exceptional circumstances exist, and no exceptional circumstances were identified by the district court.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="808.574" stopTime="824.363">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    And you think that that call is different from the call as to whether you issue the declaratory relief. 
    You must acknowledge that whether you will issue the declaratory judgment is not governed by any jurisdictional principles--
speaker="ann_e_webb" startTime="824.363" stopTime="824.863">
    Ms. Ann E. Webb 
    Yes.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="824.863" stopTime="825.946">

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Okay.

    That's correct.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="836.052" stopTime="850.542">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    So then we are confronted with the problem that troubled Justice Kennedy and me that you're going to make judges go through a whole trial, even though it's very clear that at the end of it, by virtue of their equitable discretion, they are not going to issue the declaratory judgment--
speaker="ann_e_webb" startTime="850.542" stopTime="851.723">

    I think that's--

    --I'm not sure that there's no way to avoid that. 
    For instance, if the Eleventh Amendment sovereign immunity controls, and you have a declaratory judgment action against a State, there's no reason why that can't be addressed on summary judgment immediately. 
    There's nothing to prevent that issue from being resolved before a full-blown trial on the merits.

    --But that's not an equitable issue. 
    You're talking there a legal issue with respect to jurisdiction.

    Ms. Ann E. Webb 
    --No, I'm not saying he would have discretion. 
    In fact, that raises a point that I'd like to address briefly. 
    If Granite State had filed this lawsuit not as a declaratory judgment action but as a breach of contract lawsuit seeking to have the policy rescinded under traditional contract principles, the Court would have had no discretion to have abstained. 
    The Court would have had to have taken it up, and Granite State chose to file this as a declaratory judgment action because we did not want to further escalate the hostilities between the parties. 
    That judgment call, whether it be a declaratory judgment action or a breach of contract suit should not make the difference in whether or not this case gets to stay in Federal court. 
    There is nothing to prevent... there is no reason why equitable relief in the form of declaring the policy void ab initio should not be entered in this case.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="971.660" stopTime="999.149">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    But that's contrary to a long line of authority at common law, that the issuance of an injunction and the declaratory judgment statute indicates that you use the same principles there as... is a matter of discretion with the court. 
    There are all sorts of reasons why you may not issue an injunction even though the party has made out a good case on the law, as opposed to the common law claim for damages where there isn't any discretion.

    The district court said, I don't want to hear this court... this case because Granite State raced to the courthouse, because Granite State took advantage of a proactive, preemptive remedy which is expressly designed to get litigants into court before another lawsuit is filed, and because Tandy filed a second lawsuit you're not entitled to be in a Federal forum.

    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    If this action had been in State court... there's no Federal court. 
    Just assume that Granite had gone first to a State court and asked for equitable relief, declaratory relief, rescission of the contract, there had been a counterclaim for damages. 
    I think it would have been perfectly in order for the State trial judge to say well, we have legal issues here and equitable issues here, I'm going to let the jury make the first determination. 
    Depending on what it does, it may or may not be necessary for me to make further orders. 
    And it seems to me that in all likelihood the trial judge would let the jury hear the case initially, and it seems to me that in effect that's all that's happening here. 
    You just have two courts where the claims for relief are divided, rather than being all in one, and it seems to me perfectly sensible for the district court to say, oh, I'll wait for the legal action to proceed.
speaker="ann_e_webb" startTime="1119.931" stopTime="1147.408">
    Ms. Ann E. Webb 
    It may be sensible for the district judge to have done that, but we believe that Congress has given an affirmative remedy in the Declaratory Judgment Act which is designed to give litigants... Granite State has never denied coverage in this lawsuit, yet nonetheless we are facing a significant, substantial exposure of $110 million in the State court action because Tandy has sued us for bad faith failure to pay them the $10 million they want. 
    We believe that the--

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Ms. Webb, would you have felt better if the district judge here, after hearing the same arguments that it heard with regard to the jurisdictional point, had decided the case not on a jurisdictional ground, but rather, on the merits, and said after hearing all this argument about this pending State action, I am going to decline to issue a declaratory judgment while this State act is pending, and therefore I dismiss this lawsuit without prejudice. 
    You can refile it for declaratory judgment after the State proceeding is completed. 
    I've accepted jurisdiction, I am denying you your declaratory judgment on the merits. 
    Would you have any problem with that?

    Ms. Ann E. Webb

    No--

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    --No, but he has decided on the merits of whether equity calls for the issuance of a declaratory judgment. 
    He's not deciding on a jurisdictional ground. 
    He's saying, I've accepted jurisdiction, I have on my hat as a court of equity, and as the chancellor, I decide this is not the kind of a case in which a declaratory judgment should issue... on the merits.
speaker="ann_e_webb" startTime="1219.556" stopTime="1235.378">
    Ms. Ann E. Webb 
    --I would feel better in that situation, although we would still be probably before this Court appealing it.

    Ms. Ann E. Webb 
    I believe what we're trying to do is get... give district court some guidelines as to what they're supposed to in declaratory judgment cases.

    Justice Byron R. White 
    And we usually don't overturn statutory construction cases very readily. 
    We leave it up to Congress. 
    If they don't like it, they change it, and this was an authoritative construction of this statute that Congress has left standing all these years.
speaker="ann_e_webb" startTime="1308.804" stopTime="1369.815">
    Ms. Ann E. Webb 
    --The Brillhart court stated specifically that they did not in that case pretend to enumerate all the factors that go into this district judge's discretion. 
    That's one of the last paragraphs of the decision. 
    We do not now intend to enumerate all factors the district court should consider in exercising his discretion. 
    We believe that this Court's opinions in later abstention-type cases, specifically Colorado River and Moses Cone, and then NOPSI put on top of that, indicate that declaratory judgment cases have been interpreted by this Court to be the same type of case as any other case validly within the Federal jurisdiction, and they must be viewed with a light toward the Court's unflagging obligation to exercise jurisdiction and in light of the Moses Cone-Colorado River factors. 
    That does not require overruling... overturning Brillhart. 
    I believe that it is a fair assessment... or fair statement that the intervening decisions of Colorado River and Moses Cone and NOPSI just show... just expand upon the Brillhart analysis, but do not overturn it.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="1369.815" stopTime="1386.655">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    But you don't think... you're suggesting, however, I suppose, that in light of the later cases the degree of discretion that a district judge has in a declaratory judgment case is not the discretion that Brillhart suggests.

    Ms. Ann E. Webb 
    Brillhart I believe reversed an abstention decision and sent it back to the district court, but yes, I would agree with you that the discretion imposed by Moses Cone, Colorado River and NOPSI is different from the one--

   Argument of Lynne A. Liberato
speaker="lynne_a_liberato" startTime="1605.182" stopTime="1677.059">
    Ms. Lynne A. Liberato 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    At the heart of this case is an understanding of the purpose of declaratory relief under the Declaratory Judgment Act. 
    The purpose of a declaratory judgment is to settle and to clarify legal issues. 
    It is to provide relief from uncertainty and from insecurity. 
    But here, what Granite State is trying to do is to turn these wholesome purposes of declaratory judgment relief on its head, and instead of simplifying the issues, declaratory relief in this case would complicate. 
    Instead of clarify, it would confuse. 
    To have a declaratory judgment action take place in this case would increase costs, and it would waste judicial resources and personal resources and the resources of the parties. 
    This is an attempt to forum-shop by Granite State. 
    It is a tactical attempt to, if you will, divide and conquer, and to seek safe harbor, to use an admiralty term, but to seek safe harbor in the Federal courts.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="1677.059" stopTime="1678.051">
    Justice Antonin Scalia

    Ms. Lynne A. Liberato 
    It's okay--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="1679.771" stopTime="1685.515">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    I mean, that's why we have Federal courts, because some people don't trust State courts, so do we get mad when they come into Federal court?
speaker="lynne_a_liberato" startTime="1685.515" stopTime="1727.824">
    Ms. Lynne A. Liberato 
    --We don't, but there are times when it's appropriate to consider that and times when it's not, and in this particular case it's a misuse of the declaratory judgment action to seek that safe harbor. 
    Certainly it's not inappropriate to seek it under the right circumstances. 
    This just isn't one of those circumstances, because the declaratory judgment relief is discretionary, and we know it's discretionary because it's specifically provided for in the Declaratory Judgment Act, where Congress says that any court of the United States may declare rights and other legal relationships. 
    It doesn't say that it has to... that it may declare rights, and so whenever--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="1727.824" stopTime="1735.129">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Well, why shouldn't it do it here, other than the reason that there's forum shopping, because I frankly don't find that a very persuasive one. 
    Are there any other reasons?
speaker="lynne_a_liberato" startTime="1735.129" stopTime="1777.195">
    Ms. Lynne A. Liberato 
    --Well, there are many reasons, and... for example, the danger of piecemeal litigation, the application of State law rather than Federal law, all of these types of factors that you hear frequently discussed in cases using Moses Cone and using Colorado River, and even using abstention, those kinds of analysis also apply to the determination of whether there should be declaratory relief granted, at least the declaratory judgment heard. 
    But it's also easy to kind of mix up apples and oranges, because even though those common sense factors go into the determination of whether it's appropriate--

    May I ask you a question, just so...

    [Laughter] 
    Would that be a factor that the judge should weigh in deciding whether to dismiss?

    Looking at the claim and not the claimant we have a right, I believe, to pick our forum, and in certain instances certainly the Federal plaintiff in this case, Granite State, has the right to pick its forum, but then once it picks its forum, then the district judge has the discretion under Brillhart to determine whether that and balancing all the other factors that are appropriate in making that determination whether the State or the Federal... well, not really the State is appropriate, but whether the Federal forum is appropriate and whether that Federal action should go forward.

    Ms. Lynne A. Liberato 
    Right.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2054.217" stopTime="2057.780">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Do you think... and you say it needn't have.
speaker="lynne_a_liberato" startTime="2057.780" stopTime="2130.670">
    Ms. Lynne A. Liberato 
    I say it needn't have, except to the limited degree that those are logical factors for a trial court to consider in exercising its discretion. 
    The principles underlying the unflagging obligation of the court to consider a case are different, because this is a declaratory judgment action and a declaratory judgment action is discretionary, and there's a specific legislative mandate that makes that discretionary, and that's why it's different, that the whole difference in this case is the fact it's a declaratory judgment action. 
    If it were not, we wouldn't disagree that the court has an unflagging duty to exercise jurisdiction, but the fact of the matter is, this is a declaratory judgment action, and Congress has said that that is discretionary, as has this Court in Brillhart. 
    And so if I may come back to your question, Justice White, only to say that yes, the factors apply in the sense of making a common sense determination, but as far as using the standard, the unflagging obligation standard in applying those factors, that does not apply to this case.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2130.670" stopTime="2156.245">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, I suppose if the district court had come out the other way, and had applied the Colorado River factors against you, and you had appealed, the court of appeals probably would have said, well... would have reversed, because the Colorado River factors shouldn't decide the case.
speaker="lynne_a_liberato" startTime="2156.245" stopTime="2186.867">
    Ms. Lynne A. Liberato 
    Well, I agree to the point that I think that if the district court had agreed to hear this case and granted declaratory relief, that the Fifth Circuit would have reversed, because I don't think it's necessary to go that far in this case, but I think it would be a fair policy to say that the presumption is against the district court exercising its declaratory judgment relief authority if there is a parallel State court action, and so I do believe--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="2186.867" stopTime="2189.178">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    You say they would have reversed, but there wouldn't have been an appealable order, would it?

    Ms. Lynne A. Liberato 
    --Only after final disposition of the case.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="2193.432" stopTime="2196.654">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Well, they wouldn't have reversed after the whole trial, would they, and have said you shouldn't have the trial?
speaker="lynne_a_liberato" startTime="2196.654" stopTime="2300.162">
    Ms. Lynne A. Liberato 
    Well, there are... they could have granted, I guess, arguably, a summary judgment. 
    I think it's possible that that could arise. 
    There are some cases that have come through the circuits where the court has actually reversed the case based on an abuse of discretion for hearing the case after the district court granted the declaratory judgment relief. 
    As a matter of fact, most of those cases you'll find in the petitioner's brief, because they use that in support of their contention that de novo is a proper standard of review, and perhaps I could address that for just a moment. 
    It seems logical, and perhaps going back to what Justice White was talking about, about the Fifth Circuit's view of this, and just a great deal of discretion, but it seems logical that if there is discretion to grant declaratory relief, or to hear a declaratory judgment case, then that should be reviewed on an abuse of discretion standard. 
    But just in looking at the cases as they reach the circuits and they apply a de novo review, they apply that review to cases where the court did indeed hear a declaratory judgment action and then the circuits reverse on a de novo review of the granting of the declaratory relief, and I think that's significant. 
    I think it supports our position, because our position is that this is a case in which... and this type of case is a case in which the court should not have granted and should at least properly exercise its discretion and refuse to hear the declaratory judgment relief request.

    Ms. Lynne A. Liberato 
    More often than not, it's reviewed de novo. 
    I don't know of a pronouncement from this Court, but it appears to me in reading the cases from the different circuits that there is a variance, but more often than not they use a de novo review.

    Well--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="2403.662" stopTime="2425.518">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    It seems strange to me. 
    You know, that the judge can decline to take the case entirely and it's pretty much up to him, but if he takes the case and finds no equity in issuing the declaratory judgment, we're going to review that as an original matter, just as though the question is for us and not for him. 
    It seems to me just backwards, if anything.
speaker="lynne_a_liberato" startTime="2425.518" stopTime="2459.249">
    Ms. Lynne A. Liberato 
    --Well, part of it may well be that in applying the factors it may be a distinction without a difference. 
    I understand, of course, that de novo review is very different than abuse of discretion, but in looking at the factors, the common sense factors that results tend to be the same in most of the cases that use de novo review whether it's on the front end or the back end. 
    After the determination on the merits the result comes out to be the same, and that is a great deference to the discretion of the trial judge.

    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    In the State court proceedings, if the insurer alleges that there was nondisclosure on the part of the insured, or misrepresentations in procuring a policy, does the State trial judge have the choice or the discretion to hear the equitable claims for rescission first before the case is submitted to the jury?
speaker="lynne_a_liberato" startTime="2481.723" stopTime="2485.976">
    Ms. Lynne A. Liberato

    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    Does the trial judge in Texas often exercise the discretion that way, or does he usually submit all the issues to the jury?

    Ms. Lynne A. Liberato 
    He submits all of the factual issues, certainly, to the jury, and I would say tends to submit the issues to the jury. 
    If there's going to be a jury trial the judges tend to submit the whole case to the jury, but all of those kinds of questions still have to be, I think, couched in terms of what is the purpose of a declaratory judgment action.

    This case involves a warehouse endorsement to an open... marine open, cargo marine policy. 
    It is the endorsement. 
    It covers... and this is what... the only damage was... that we're seeking to be paid for damage that occurred in an inland plant and damage to inventory and work in progress.

    The best I know, it's uberrimae fidei. 
    But the other part of it, even assuming, to go back to the issue that Judge White raises about... Justice White, about whether there is a Federal question here based on uberrimae fidei, even if you assume that there were... was, it is a defense only. 
    It wouldn't even be enough in this particular case to raise Federal question jurisdiction if they were properly a plaintiff.

    Well, that's sort of important as to whether, you know, we think Texas law is really going to be at issue in this case.

    --Well--

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    I mean, if it's not admiralty law, it may not be Texas law. 
    I don't want Texas figuring out English law. 
    I think probably the Federal courts are as good at that as the Texas courts.
speaker="lynne_a_liberato" startTime="2969.969" stopTime="3090.260">
    Ms. Lynne A. Liberato 
    --Well, but all of the dispute here goes to the contract formation and all of the action that took place that relates to this determination definitely occurred in Texas. 
    I don't believe that they have argued that English law applies other than uberrimae fidei. 
    I'm sure Ms. Webb will correct me on that if I'm wrong, but by and large the controversy is going to be governed by the laws of the State of Texas, and insurance law, which necessarily... or, not necessarily, but which have actually been left specifically by Congress through the McCarran-Ferguson Act to the States. 
    This is peculiarly an issue of State court interest, because that's what is being construed, is a provision in the contract, and the resulting bad faith claims that we have, breach of contract, all of those are peculiar to the State and State court law, and that is another factor, I believe, that the court decides in exercising its discretion to grant the declaratory judgment action. 
    There are many factors the court can apply. 
    The Fifth Circuit emphasized forum shopping and inconvenience. 
    Judge Hittner in the district court emphasized the piecemeal litigation aspect, the forum shopping aspect, and needless decisions of State law. 
    It would be possible, and certainly Judge Hittner did that to a degree in analyzing the Moses Cone and Colorado River factors, to look at other things, like the order in which jurisdiction was acquired and some of the other factors that are found in other cases, but the point is that if, in the exercise of its discretion, the court doesn't fulfill the purposes of the Declaratory Judgment Act, that relief, to provide relief to simplify and to clarify issues, then that declaratory judgment is not appropriate, and for these reasons... yes.

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Before you wind up, I want to come back to whether review is de novo or not. 
    You concede... it seems to me it is a concession for your side that it is de novo on review of injunctions, or at least declaratory judgments when they're issued on the merits, but the cases that you rely on for that, aren't they... if I understood your discussion earlier, aren't they cases in which declaratory judgment was issued?
speaker="lynne_a_liberato" startTime="3117.866" stopTime="3120.046">
    Ms. Lynne A. Liberato 
    Yes, Your Honor. 
    Yes, that's correct.

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Don't you think it's a little bit different if you decline to exercise your equitable powers? 
    Might there not be a different rule, when you decline to issue an injunction as to the rigidity of the review as opposed to when you issue the injunction, which raises a lot of legal issues?
speaker="lynne_a_liberato" startTime="3139.511" stopTime="3148.527">
    Ms. Lynne A. Liberato 
    Well, it seems to be that in fact that's a distinction that the circuit courts have made not specifically but in fact.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="3148.527" stopTime="3161.153">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Well, I have a good deal of doubt about whether the ordinary rule for review is de novo on refusal to exercise equitable discretion. 
    It seems to me it ought to be an abuse of discretion standard.
speaker="lynne_a_liberato" startTime="3161.153" stopTime="3182.038">
    Ms. Lynne A. Liberato 
    Well, I agree with you, and that is what the Fifth Circuit held in this case, but my point, which I did not make very artfully, that in either event, that the presumption is in favor of the court exercising its jurisdiction, so I would believe that what the Fifth Circuit did was correct and that the district court was proper in issuing the stay.

   Rebuttal of Ann E. Webb
speaker="ann_e_webb" startTime="3187.003" stopTime="3214.481">
    Ms. Ann E. Webb 
    The first thing I'd like to comment on is Ms. Liberato's pronunciation of utmost good faith. 
    On our side of the bench we say, uberrimae fidei, but utmost good faith works just as well and it's a little bit easier to follow. 
    The choice of law provision in the contract says specifically all questions of liability arising out of this policy are to be governed by the law and customs of England except in the United States and its possessions.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="3214.481" stopTime="3217.834">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    I repeat, wow. 
    Who wrote that, I wonder?
speaker="ann_e_webb" startTime="3217.834" stopTime="3347.161">
    Ms. Ann E. Webb 
    It's a form policy. 
    We believe that, since it doesn't say whether the loss arises in the United States or whether the lawsuit arises in the United States, it's ambiguous and it needs to be construed. 
    We believe the appropriate construction is to give a consistent application regardless of where the loss occurs, be it Korea, Australia, Singapore, Texas, Seattle, any one of the States that has a water port. 
    The only consistent application is to apply the law that is equivalent to the law of England, which is Federal maritime law, and we don't believe that the McCarran-Ferguson Act, and 
    "the insurance regulation belongs to the State. " 
    applies here, because the doctrine of utmost good faith is a well-entrenched maritime good doctrine, and it is not one of those cases where State insurance law should fill the cracks. 
    I'd like to comment briefly about the district court never... about some of the points raised by Ms. Liberato. 
    We're talking about the making of a policy of insurance. 
    The place of the loss has nothing to do with the making of the policy, and the policy itself says the choice of law is English, and we believe that gets you to maritime. 
    The place of the loss in Korea has nothing to do with the choice of law that should apply to the formation of the policy. 
    With regard to the several questions about the standard of review, abstention doctrine is a question of law, which is customarily reviewed de novo. 
    It is further important that this type of decision be reviewed de novo because of the comity and federalism concerns that are raised. 
    We believe that both the decision whether or not to keep a case within the Federal jurisdiction as well as the decision on the merits should both be reviewed under a legal standard de novo. 
    The district court partially reviewed the Colorado River factors. 
    He did not review the choice of law issue, and he failed to weigh any of the issues in favor of the unflagging obligation to exercise jurisdiction. 
    We further believe that he did not correctly evaluate some of the ones he did. 
    For instance, the minimal inconvenience between Houston, Texas and Forth Worth, Texas, when there were something upwards of 50 flights a day between the two cities, between the Dallas-Fort Worth area and Houston, cannot be justified in this modern era.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="3347.161" stopTime="3369.046">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    So I guess, if I'm right about what the review of the failure to issue a declaratory judgment is, a district judge would always be wise to accept jurisdiction and deny the declaratory judgment instead of simply saying, I won't take jurisdiction. 
    I mean, you could do it the same way the same day, but you're better--

    Ms. Lynne A. Liberato 
    In terms of getting reversed, I guess that's correct, but we believe that unless the traditional concerns precluding a declaratory judgment exist, the district court should maintain jurisdiction.
