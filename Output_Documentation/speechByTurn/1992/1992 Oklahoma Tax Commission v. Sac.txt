    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    We'll hear argument now in No. 92-259, the Oklahoma Tax Commission v. the Sac and Fox Nation. 
    Mr. Miley.
speaker="david_allen_miley" startTime="12.108" stopTime="62.074">
    Mr. David Allen Miley 
    Thank you, Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    This case involves whether the State of Oklahoma may tax the income of a tribal member who is employed by the tribe, the Sac and Fox Nation, and whether Oklahoma may impose motor vehicle taxes on automobiles owned by tribal members of the Sac and Fox Nation. 
    The Sac and Fox Nation imposes its own income and motor vehicle taxes, as the State does. 
    The lower courts have enjoined the... Oklahoma from collecting these taxes, and the State feels that this injunction is improper for two reasons. 
    There is no Federal law which preempts State law in this area, and the State law--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="62.074" stopTime="67.216">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    But this involves State taxation of tribal members.
speaker="david_allen_miley" startTime="67.216" stopTime="69.369">
    Mr. David Allen Miley 
    --This involves State taxation of tribal members, yes.

    Justice Byron R. White 
    Who are living where?
speaker="david_allen_miley" startTime="71.320" stopTime="77.534">
    Mr. David Allen Miley 
    Who... some of the tribal members live on Indian country and some do not live on Indian country.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="77.534" stopTime="83.759">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    And the... but it involves both... all of those members.
speaker="david_allen_miley" startTime="83.759" stopTime="110.318">
    Mr. David Allen Miley 
    All tribal members. 
    We were enjoined from taxing all tribal members who worked for the tribe or any tribal members who properly license their car with the tribe. 
    And those tribal members, some live off the Indian country and some live on Indian country. 
    Of course, we have a situation where Indian country is scattered among several... is scattered among small plots in an area that is otherwise under State jurisdiction.

    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    What are you including in the term Indian country when you refer to it?
speaker="david_allen_miley" startTime="115.541" stopTime="126.598">
    Mr. David Allen Miley 
    That would be trust land, that is, land that is held in trust by the United States of America for the benefit of the tribe itself or for the benefit of an Indian tribal--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="126.598" stopTime="126.759">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    An individual.
speaker="david_allen_miley" startTime="126.759" stopTime="127.870">
    Mr. David Allen Miley 
    --An individual person.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="127.870" stopTime="137.887">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Are all of the so-called allotted lands here lands that are held in trust by the Government for tribal members?
speaker="david_allen_miley" startTime="137.887" stopTime="150.025">
    Mr. David Allen Miley 
    Yes, they would be or they'd be held under an allotment deed, but the allotment deeds are quite old. 
    But mainly we're talking about trust land, but we are talking about allotted land also in this area.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="150.025" stopTime="157.521">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    If it's allotted, deeded, and not held in trust, do you count that as Indian country as well?
speaker="david_allen_miley" startTime="157.521" stopTime="168.407">
    Mr. David Allen Miley 
    Yes. 
    Under the Federal definition under the Federal statute, 18 U.S.C., section 1151(c), that land... an Indian allotment is included in the term.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="168.407" stopTime="172.091">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    That's as long as the-- 
    --The Government holds title. 
    That is as long as the--
speaker="david_allen_miley" startTime="172.091" stopTime="173.200">
    Mr. David Allen Miley 
    The Government.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="173.200" stopTime="178.433">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    --Until they... if it has been transferred to a non-Indian.
speaker="david_allen_miley" startTime="178.433" stopTime="187.329">
    Mr. David Allen Miley 
    Now, that's true. 
    It could be... an original allottee may have transferred that or it may have been devised to a non-Indian--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="187.329" stopTime="187.970">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    So, that's not--
speaker="david_allen_miley" startTime="187.970" stopTime="188.581">
    Mr. David Allen Miley 
    --and BIA--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="188.581" stopTime="189.553">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    --That's not Indian country there.
speaker="david_allen_miley" startTime="189.553" stopTime="191.135">
    Mr. David Allen Miley 
    --Correct. 
    If the BIA--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="191.135" stopTime="193.386">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    So, it still has to be in the hands of a member.
speaker="david_allen_miley" startTime="193.386" stopTime="199.663">
    Mr. David Allen Miley 
    --Correct. 
    And it has to be... most land we're talking about is held in trust by the United States Government.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="199.663" stopTime="210.118">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    What if the Government has conveyed the patent to the allottee, but the allottee is an Indian? 
    Is that land still Indian country?
speaker="david_allen_miley" startTime="210.118" stopTime="225.088">
    Mr. David Allen Miley 
    Well, if the Indian tribal member owns deed land, just the fee title to the land, and there is no trust or restricted status to the land, then that would not be Indian country just because the Indian would own it.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="225.088" stopTime="231.613">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    So, when you refer to Indian country, you are not referring to fee lands owned outright by individual Indians.
speaker="david_allen_miley" startTime="231.613" stopTime="260.956">
    Mr. David Allen Miley 
    Correct. 
    And even fee lands that are owned by the tribe itself would not be Indian country. 
    That land would have to be accepted into trust by the Bureau of Indian Affairs. 
    Many times... and tribes do in Oklahoma acquire parcels of land and hold it in fee. 
    BIA has complete discretion whether to accept that land in the trust if the tribe requests it. 
    Sometimes the BIA accepts it into trust, and sometimes the BIA does not. 
    So, it must be held in trust to be Indian country.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="260.956" stopTime="275.557">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    Go ahead. 
    If you should lose with respect to Indians who are living on trust lands, should you also lose with respect to those who are not living on trust lands? 
    And if the answer is no, why is the distinction important?
speaker="david_allen_miley" startTime="275.557" stopTime="305.441">
    Mr. David Allen Miley 
    Well, I don't think the distinction... we can make a distinction. 
    But if I lose with respect to the Indians on the trust lands, that would have to be because they are within some sort of tribal jurisdiction that is exclusive of State jurisdiction so that outside of that territory on non-Indian country lands, then the State of Oklahoma would have complete jurisdiction over that individual. 
    And we're talking about the taxation of an individual person, not the tribe.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="305.441" stopTime="314.616">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    So, you're saying the criterion strictly is a territorial jurisdiction criterion, and therefore you would not have to lose with respect to those nontrust lands.
speaker="david_allen_miley" startTime="314.616" stopTime="316.919">
    Mr. David Allen Miley 
    Correct, but--
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="316.919" stopTime="319.250">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    Is there any other competing theory of jurisdiction?
speaker="david_allen_miley" startTime="319.250" stopTime="391.038">
    Mr. David Allen Miley 
    --Well, here the tribe does not have exclusive jurisdiction because I think we've got to look at the Federal statute, the relevant Federal statute, so that in this case even on Indian country within Oklahoma, individuals living on Indian country are taxable by the State in Oklahoma. 
    Now, that is because the allotment agreement, if we... which is the McClanahan case, set up the idea that... that case dealt with the Navajo reservation in Arizona. 
    And that Navajo reservation was set up exclusively for the tribe, and the tribe was allowed to exclude non-Indians or impose conditions on those that were allowed to enter. 
    Here the Sac and Fox Nation did have a reservation which was established about the same time, in the... 1867, about the same time the Navajo reservation was established. 
    However, in 1891, the Federal Government... Congress passed the allotment agreement or enacted the allotment agreement which allotted all the lands of the reservation to the tribal members at that time.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="391.038" stopTime="392.026">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Or the tribe.
speaker="david_allen_miley" startTime="392.026" stopTime="395.379">
    Mr. David Allen Miley 
    The tribe got about 800 acres.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="395.379" stopTime="396.180">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Yes, all right. 
    Go ahead.
speaker="david_allen_miley" startTime="396.180" stopTime="433.355">
    Mr. David Allen Miley 
    This is a fairly... this was a fairly large reservation in central Oklahoma. 
    But even giving acreage to the tribe, even giving a quarter section to each tribal member, they had huge amounts of land left over, and they opened that up. 
    President Harrison opened that up to the legendary land runs and all people of all kinds came in and took the land. 
    And the tribe was not allowed to exclude those or impose any conditions on them. 
    And so, implicit in the terms of that allotment agreement, the relevant statute in this case, we find that the tribe has lost the autonomy that the Navajo Nation has.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="433.355" stopTime="439.928">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    So, you say this case only concerns Indians that are living on trust lands?
speaker="david_allen_miley" startTime="439.928" stopTime="442.582">
    Mr. David Allen Miley 
    Well, it concerns--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="442.582" stopTime="447.695">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    In terms of what the State is... you think that if they're living off the trust lands, the State may--
speaker="david_allen_miley" startTime="447.695" stopTime="448.984">
    Mr. David Allen Miley 
    --Well--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="448.984" stopTime="450.426">

    --impose taxes?
speaker="david_allen_miley" startTime="450.426" stopTime="456.721">
    Mr. David Allen Miley 
    --Correct. 
    These are tribal members who work for the tribe. 
    Now, I think many tribal members don't work for the tribe.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="456.721" stopTime="456.911">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Right.
speaker="david_allen_miley" startTime="456.911" stopTime="457.382">

    They work for--

    Justice Byron R. White 
    Right.

    Mr. David Allen Miley 
    --various places, and they... there is no argument that they are taxable, but here we have tribal members--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="463.517" stopTime="466.278">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Who are not living on trust lands who are working for the tribe.

    Mr. David Allen Miley 
    --Who are working for the tribe, and some--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="468.351" stopTime="469.951">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    And they are at issue here.
speaker="david_allen_miley" startTime="469.951" stopTime="479.126">
    Mr. David Allen Miley 
    --They are at issue because the lower courts held that if you... if the Indian or the tribal member works for the tribe, they do not owe taxes. 
    Period.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="479.126" stopTime="493.626">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Now, what about tribal members who do not live on trust land, but who are working for the tribe But does the same... you run into the same problem about the automobile tax?
speaker="david_allen_miley" startTime="493.626" stopTime="495.469">
    Mr. David Allen Miley 
    Right. 
    That's correct.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="495.469" stopTime="495.937">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    You do.
speaker="david_allen_miley" startTime="495.937" stopTime="504.736">
    Mr. David Allen Miley 
    That's correct. 
    The way the tribal scheme is set up... well, you don't even have to be a tribal member to get a tribal tag necessarily.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="504.736" stopTime="505.314">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, I know. 
    I know.

    Mr. David Allen Miley 
    But the--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="507.407" stopTime="516.611">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Unless you're a tribal member, the State has no barrier to insisting on their paying the excise tax.
speaker="david_allen_miley" startTime="516.611" stopTime="533.986">
    Mr. David Allen Miley 
    --Right. 
    Yes, in terms of our own taxes, we feel that even though you pay tribal taxes in either instance, you owe the State taxes also. 
    Now, so we're talking about the tribal members on Indian country and off that are tagging their cars with the tribe.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="533.986" stopTime="551.332">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    What is the significance of... as to the first tax, income tax, why is it significant that the Indian who is living on the trust land works for the tribe? 
    What if the Indian doesn't work for the tribe, works for somebody else on the trust land? 
    Is there any contention that that Indian does not owe income tax?
speaker="david_allen_miley" startTime="551.332" stopTime="557.217">
    Mr. David Allen Miley 
    Well. 
    I think this case started out much broader, and the tribe would argue that would be the case.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="557.217" stopTime="557.886">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Yes, I thought they would.
speaker="david_allen_miley" startTime="557.886" stopTime="583.053">
    Mr. David Allen Miley 
    I would argue that... well, and the Tenth Circuit did not see it so broadly. 
    They felt that in order... in this circumstance, where we do not have this exclusive type statute, that the fact that they were working for the tribe was the deciding factor as to whether they were taxable or not because our tax somehow infringed on tribal self-government.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="583.053" stopTime="601.475">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    It seems to me that the theory of getting off is either a tribal self-government theory, in which case you ought to get off whether you're on or off trust land so long as you're working for the tribe, or else the theory is a territorial theory, in which case you ought to get off so long as you're living on trust land whether or not you're working for the tribe.
speaker="david_allen_miley" startTime="601.475" stopTime="662.840">
    Mr. David Allen Miley 
    Okay, but this case does not fall very neatly into the on/off dichotomy because people are constantly going on and off the Indian country because you cannot conduct your daily affairs of life in Oklahoma on strictly Indian country. 
    You have got to proceed outside of Indian country to do that because you've got 160 acres of Indian country here and 160 acres down the road. 
    And so, if you're living on Indian country, you're necessarily going to have to go off to take care of any business. 
    So, you have... what we have here is a situation where Indians are going off Indian country to work and to shop. 
    And what the tribe is saying in this instance is, well, if they work for us, they don't owe any taxes, and if they happen to buy something that they're going to take back to Indian country like a car, then they don't owe taxes either. 
    Well, that--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="662.840" stopTime="669.962">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    What does the tribe say about people who don't work for the tribe, but who live on Indian country and go off and buy an automobile?
speaker="david_allen_miley" startTime="669.962" stopTime="679.149">
    Mr. David Allen Miley 
    --Well, they would say that just because they live on Indian country, they're within the tribal jurisdiction, you see, and that they would not be responsible for--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="679.149" stopTime="680.431">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, how about on income tax?

    Do they claim that Indians who live on trust lands, but who don't work for the tribe, and... but live off of trust lands, away from trust lands... do they claim that the State may not tax those Indians... income tax those Indians?

    Mr. David Allen Miley 
    --The Tenth Circuit did not... the Tenth Circuit ruled that only those tribal members who work for the tribe were eligible for this exemption in this case because I believe they were having a little trouble with the fact that we can't find an existing reservation here. 
    For instance, in the McClanahan case, the tribal member did not work for the tribe in that case. 
    She lived on the reservation. 
    She worked on the reservation. 
    She earned all her income on the reservation, and because the Federal Government, in their statute that created the Navajo reservation, granted the tribe the exclusive jurisdiction over that land--

    Mr. David Allen Miley 
    But in terms of the income tax here, I believe this Court has already ruled... well, the Supreme Court has ruled in the 1930's that... in the case of Leahy v. State Treasurer, which relied on Choteau v. Burnet, where you had the situation of an Indian, an Osage Indian, who lived on Indian country and earned income from the tribal mineral resources, and he was taxable on the income that he earned on those tribal mineral resources in that case because there was not this type of reservation that you have in the Navajo cases. 
    And then coming a few years later in Oklahoma Tax Commission v. U.S., the Supreme Court also ruled that members of the five civilized tribes would owe Oklahoma estate taxes on their estates which included Indian country, where they lived, their homestead allotments.

    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    Just one more question on this preliminary part of your argument. 
    If we rule for you... pardon me. 
    If we rule against you on your point, does the case still have to go back to determine whether or not you have jurisdiction to tax people that are in Indian country, or do we have to... we can remand for that, can't we?

    Well, I don't--

    Mr. David Allen Miley 
    --Yes.

    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    --which I take it you don't, and McClanahan says that's that the key for taxation, and if the Tenth Circuit didn't reach that, we don't necessarily have to reach that issue in this case, do we? 
    We can remand.
speaker="david_allen_miley" startTime="928.675" stopTime="971.534">
    Mr. David Allen Miley 
    Well, I don't think I agree with your reasoning that you've got to have civil and criminal jurisdiction. 
    I think the whole basis of the McClanahan case was that the Navajo treaty preempted State law. 
    And so, in this case, we have an allotment agreement that did away with that exclusive treaty and implies that State law now applies, and we have cases, Supreme Court cases, that suggest... that I believe are applicable to this situation, that conclude that State law, State tax law, does apply for an individual's income.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="971.534" stopTime="973.646">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    All right. 
    So, we think we should resolve that issue here in this case.

    Mr. David Allen Miley 
    Yes, I do.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="974.467" stopTime="974.647">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    All right.
speaker="david_allen_miley" startTime="974.647" stopTime="1065.165">
    Mr. David Allen Miley 
    So, I think, though, that one of the things that the lower courts did not... declined to do was resolve the reservation issue of whether what... to what extent the reservation exists, and I believe that is a necessary part of a finding in this case. 
    I believe that in order to reach the conclusion, if in fact State law infringes on tribal self-government, you've got to find the reservation where it is acting on, and I think you'd have to have an exclusive reservation in order to... if in fact the State law will be an infringement on the tribal government in this case. 
    And I don't think that was what Congress intended when they passed the allotment agreement. 
    I think we've got to give the allotment agreement as broad a sweep as the Congress intended that passed the act, and in that case, they were terminating the reservations in the State of Oklahoma to, in fact, create the State. 
    And I think it... in reading in the accounts in the case of the case that I cited, Woodward v. DeGraffenried--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="1065.165" stopTime="1081.487">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    --Mescalero case? 
    Mescalero held that if a tribe sets up a business off the reservation, it's subject to the State gross receipts tax.
speaker="david_allen_miley" startTime="1081.487" stopTime="1084.569">
    Mr. David Allen Miley

    In that case--

    Justice Byron R. White 
    Do you suppose that would cover... that would control a case of an individual Indian working off the reservation earning income?

    Mr. David Allen Miley 
    --Well, that's correct. 
    It would. 
    And I think that case did rely on the earlier Oklahoma cases to some extent. 
    I... the Mescalero case, however, dealt with a tribe off of a reservation--

    Justice Byron R. White 
    Yes, well, I'm talking about--

    --and an individual--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="1110.926" stopTime="1115.220">

    --an individual Indian, and certainly the tribe is located on the reservation.

    Mr. David Allen Miley

    Most definitely.

    Mr. David Allen Miley 
    Well, in that case, I believe it stands for the fact that when Indians within Oklahoma... the tribes do not have the autonomy that reservation tribes in other States do. 
    I think the Court in that case was recognizing the fact that Indian governments do exist in Oklahoma. 
    Indian country does exist in Oklahoma, but that's not the determining factor. 
    That's not what we're trying to determine here. 
    We're trying to determine what... how Congress treated these tribes. 
    They did not give these tribes the exclusive autonomous situation that they gave the Navajos.

    Mr. David Allen Miley 
    They did not deal with it in their opinion. 
    I believe it is fairly much squarely opposed to their opinion in my view. 
    So, they instead relied on the later case of McClanahan to support their position. 
    But I think the problem with, you know, relying on the McClanahan case is that they quoted the language in McClanahan that said the Federal statute requires that the State law be excluded in this area, and the Tenth Circuit did not point to any Federal statute that excludes law for Oklahoma in regards to the Sac and Fox Nation. 
    I think that relevant statute is the allotment agreement and it does... nothing in that allotment agreement would presume to exclude State law. 
    I think it was the intent of that agreement to terminate the reservations and to include State law.

    So, go ahead.
speaker="edwin_s_kneedler" startTime="1490.898" stopTime="1567.770">
    Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler 
    Yes. 
    We... there are two possible theories. 
    Under one of them, the territorial theory, essentially the principles synthesized by this Court in McClanahan, we think the court was mistaken. 
    The court of appeals seemed to believe that it was sufficient if the Indian earns his income within Indian country irrespective of where he resides. 
    In McClanahan itself, however, the Indian both lived and worked on the Indian reservation. 
    It's common for States... and Oklahoma is one of these States... to tax income on the basis of either where the individual resides or works, and as long as that statute is applied in an evenhanded manner, the territorial principles, McClanahan would not bar the tax if the individual either resided or worked off the reservation. 
    We do think it's significant, however, that Oklahoma affords a credit to a resident who works in another State, but does not afford a comparable credit to a resident who works for the Indian tribe. 
    So, in the example of someone who... an Indian who lives off the reservation, but works on the reservation, we would think a parallel to Oklahoma's own State taxing scheme would suggest that a credit might be given. 
    And that's... that is we think something that could be decided on remand. 
    But because the court of appeals--
speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="1567.770" stopTime="1573.895">
    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    Is that... Mr. Kneedler, is that something that has been ruled upon or is that just practice that you're referring to?
speaker="edwin_s_kneedler" startTime="1573.895" stopTime="1584.581">
    Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler 
    --It's... Oklahoma's own tax code provides that, and the amicus brief filed in this case by a number of States identifies that as a common practice.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="1584.581" stopTime="1599.260">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    But it's never... you don't know of any case that says that Oklahoma automatically does that for the person who is taxed by an Indian tribe.
speaker="edwin_s_kneedler" startTime="1599.260" stopTime="1622.157">
    Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler 
    Oklahoma does not do that for an Indian tribe. 
    And we think this case should be remanded because the... a necessary aspect of the McClanahan analysis is where the individual resides and works. 
    We think the case should be remanded insofar as the McClanahan analysis is concerned to determine exactly where the tribal employees do live and work.

    It seems to me, Mr. Kneedler, in that case the tribe could tax them 100 percent, and then get a 100 percent deduction from their... because they all work for the tribe. 
    So, the income is paid by the tribe to them. 
    Then take some of it back in the form of taxes. 
    Could they just tax 100 percent and then say that we want a credit from the State income for that amount?

    Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler 
    --This is the second theory. 
    Because the individuals here are actually employed by the tribe, there is a substantial argument we think that the income tax would be preempted irrespective of where the individuals live because any taxes paid by the tribal officers and employees to the State necessarily has an impact on the amount of money--

    Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler 
    --Well, because just as a matter of economics, we think that in order to compete in the labor market, if the individuals whom the tribe employs have to pay both a State tax and on top of that a tribal tax, the tribe's ability to operate a government in the same way that a local government or a State government would be operated outside the reservation, they would be competitively disadvantaged.

    Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler 
    --Under McClanahan. 
    We think it's significant that in DeCoteau, for example, where this Court held the reservation was disestablished, the Court was at some pains we think to show that that would not adversely affect the Indians themselves on Indian country outside the reservation. 
    It said even within Indian country, which the Court pointed out specifically included allotments, a State may have jurisdiction over some persons or types of conduct, but this jurisdiction is quite limited. 
    And the Court specifically cited McClanahan after that recitation, indicating that the immunity from State taxation should apply even though the reservation was disestablished wherever you have Indian country and, thus, we think wherever the individual is residing and working within Indian country, as long a there is a functioning tribal government with jurisdiction over that particular land. 
    Here we think that the compact of tribal self-government entered into between the Sac and Fox Nation and the United States demonstrates the tribal self-government, contrary to the view of the State of Oklahoma, is alive and well in the State.

   Argument of G. William Rice
speaker="g_william_rice" startTime="2060.289" stopTime="2153.244">
    Mr. G. William Rice 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    We believe that this case can be resolved by straightforward application of this Court's per se rule and the rules of stare decisis. 
    The Court has ruled previously in several cases, in which the Court did not recognize that there was an existing Indian reservation, that State taxes, at least as to tribal members within Indian country were not applicable. 
    Those cases include Rickert, the Kansas Indians, the New York Indians, several other cases cited in the brief. 
    Now, the State would have you believe that the tribe here is totally subject to State law, that the Indian reservation of the Sac and Fox Nation was abolished back in 1891, and that the tribe is not a tribe in the normal sense of the word. 
    I don't believe that any of those are true. 
    Now, the per se rule that this Court has developed has been applied in the early cases I just mentioned. 
    In Montana v. Blackfeet, the State... the Court said that the States may tax Indians only when Congress has manifested clearly its consent. 
    That is clearly a different analysis, a different type of rule, than the State would bring forward here where they say the question is not has Congress said they... Oklahoma can tax the tribe. 
    They're trying to advance the theory that the State may tax unless Congress has said they cannot, and as that court has simply said... as the Court has simply said that's--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2153.244" stopTime="2174.648">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Are there some other... are there prior cases covering the situation about a State trying to tax a member of a tribe who does not live in Indian country, but works in Indian country?
speaker="g_william_rice" startTime="2174.648" stopTime="2177.981">
    Mr. G. William Rice 
    --Your Honor, I don't believe there's anything exactly on point.

    Justice Byron R. White 
    What is your position on that?
speaker="g_william_rice" startTime="2179.083" stopTime="2186.920">
    Mr. G. William Rice 
    My position on that is that the line, if you will, or the bright line rule that should be applicable here, is the Indian country line. 
    What we have is--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2186.920" stopTime="2189.461">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, Indian country. 
    You mean if he's working in Indian country--
speaker="g_william_rice" startTime="2189.461" stopTime="2189.721">
    Mr. G. William Rice 
    --Yes, sir.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2189.721" stopTime="2191.091">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    --or if he's living in Indian country?
speaker="g_william_rice" startTime="2191.091" stopTime="2200.550">
    Mr. G. William Rice 
    If he's working in Indian country. 
    The action of the Indian inside the Indian country should be the determining question. 
    It's basically the opposite of Mescalero Apache Tribe v. Jones.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2200.550" stopTime="2202.500">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, does that cover the automobiles too?
speaker="g_william_rice" startTime="2202.500" stopTime="2225.074">
    Mr. G. William Rice 
    It covers the individual, for instance, who would go to a automobile dealership and have a car delivered to him and title transferred within the Indian country. 
    That's Central Machinery v. Arizona Tax Commission. 
    That exact thing happened in that case, only it was a tractor dealership who was being taxed on a gross receipts tax, which is kind of an income tax.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2225.074" stopTime="2244.208">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    What if the Indian in this particular case lived on nontribal land, went to an automobile dealer that was on nontribal land, not Indian country, bought an automobile, and said I'll take delivery of it at the 800-acre reservation?
speaker="g_william_rice" startTime="2244.208" stopTime="2300.456">
    Mr. G. William Rice 
    I think the answer to that is when he brings that automobile from the reservation or from his allotment back out, let's say, to Norman outside the Indian reservation, outside the Indian country, at that point, since he's a resident there, he becomes obligated to pay the State tax there. 
    If he bought that piece of property to leave it in the Indian country and, you know, to operate it there... and the good example, the classic example, is the individual who spends the summers in Colorado and works back home during the school year as an educator, for instance. 
    If he leaves all his furniture, his car, et cetera on his allotment within the Sac and Fox Indian country during the school year, that's between him and the tribe. 
    That's what is set aside by the whole Indian country concept to the tribe and the Federal Government. 
    On the other hand, when it comes May and he gets out of school and he flies up to Colorado and picks up that car, now he owes State taxes on that car.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2300.456" stopTime="2304.427">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    But he could drive his own car up there without being taxed by a State.

    Mr. G. William Rice 
    He could, sir.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2305.168" stopTime="2312.294">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Yes. 
    But the key in your view is where the person works, not where the person lives?
speaker="g_william_rice" startTime="2312.294" stopTime="2332.437">
    Mr. G. William Rice 
    The key... excuse me... the key is the conduct of the Indian in the Indian country. 
    The Indian country has always been defined by Congress by court decision as that area that's set aside for tribal self-government for Indian occupancy and Indian use. 
    That has been the theory behind the concept of Indian country from the beginning days--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2332.437" stopTime="2345.684">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    But we have no... but you've got no... we haven't got any square cases on that, living off the reservation, but working on.

    Mr. G. William Rice 
    --Not to my knowledge.

    --Yes. 
    The cases you mentioned, the Kansas case--

    Mr. G. William Rice 
    The Kansas Indians and the New York Indians.

    Justice Byron R. White 
    --They were living on and working on.
speaker="g_william_rice" startTime="2362.087" stopTime="2368.410">

    --What we had there was a situation where the tribe's reservations had been abolished.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2368.410" stopTime="2368.720">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Right.
speaker="g_william_rice" startTime="2368.720" stopTime="2399.702">
    Mr. G. William Rice 
    And the claim made there was basically the same claim that's being made here. 
    These Indians are assimilated into the State community and you can't tell the difference and so forth. 
    The Court came back and said no. 
    As long as the political branches of the government, as long as the Congress and the executive recognize these as a people with the tribal government, having the right to make and enforce their own laws and maintaining a governmental relationship with the United States, they're outside the authority of the State to levy taxes even though their reservation had been abolished--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2399.702" stopTime="2402.464">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    But they were living in Indian country.

    Mr. G. William Rice 
    I mean, that's the outgrowth of those cases.

speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2417.988" stopTime="2421.370">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    And stayed and continued to live off of it.
speaker="g_william_rice" startTime="2421.370" stopTime="2422.650">

    That's correct.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2422.650" stopTime="2426.412">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    But your position is that the same rule ought to apply.
speaker="g_william_rice" startTime="2426.412" stopTime="2450.448">
    Mr. G. William Rice 
    My position is the same rule of McClanahan should apply because what McClanahan, when you get back to page 179 and 180 of the opinion down at the bottom, basically says that this person was an Indian and the income they earned came from the Indian reservation. 
    And I think those are really the two penultimate issues in McClanahan, is the person an Indian, and did they earn it in the Indian country.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2450.448" stopTime="2464.720">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Yes. 
    And the territorial rationale doesn't exactly work out, but I suppose you would argue with the Federal Government that perhaps it's an interference with tribal self-government.

    Justice Byron R. White 
    It was 72, 767?
speaker="g_william_rice" startTime="2528.683" stopTime="2634.435">
    Mr. G. William Rice 
    72 United States 667. 
    As previously indicated, the Court has adopted a per se rule against the taxation of Indians in the Indian country. 
    I think simple straightforward application of that rule resolves this case. 
    The per se rule, as it was stated last term in County of Yakima v. Yakima... and this has been stated in California v. Cabazon and Montana v. Blackfeet... is really a penultimate outgrowth of the preemption rule of Federal preemption. 
    The problem here is that we're trying to apply the allotment agreement in a vacuum. 
    It's as if the first time there's a relationship between the Sac and Fox Nation and the United States came about in the allotment agreement. 
    That's simply not the case. 
    There has been a treaty relationship between the United States and the Sac and Fox Nation since 1789. 
    The early treaties between the Sac and Fox Nation and the United States are exactly the same type of treaties that Worcester v. Georgia held to preempt all State action by the State of Georgia. 
    Now, the Court has gone then from a per se rule to a preemption analysis and has come back, at least in the tax situations, to the per se rule. 
    The thing... one thing that is happening here that I think is important in this context is the redevelopment or the reaffirmation by Congress, if you will, of the rights to tribal self-government, and I refer specifically to the Sac and Fox Nation's self-governance grant and compact that they have entered into now with the United States Department of the Interior.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="2634.435" stopTime="2690.653">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Mr. Rice, I don't... how is this possibly administrable in a State, especially like Oklahoma, where there are just a lot of isolated pockets of Indian territory? 
    Your position is if the money is earned by an Indian in Indian country, it's exempt from State tax. 
    So, what do you do with somebody that, you know, drives to work... let's assume he's a carpenter. 
    He does part of his work on the Indian country, part of his work off of the Indian country. 
    How can you possibly administer a scheme like that? 
    I mean, I can see if you're limiting it to income received from the tribe, you can identify it. 
    But how is Oklahoma going to identify what income is earned on Indian country and what is earned off Indian country? 
    There's a whole... I can see whole volumes of law being written about this when Indian income is earned.

    Mr. G. William Rice 
    I don't think it's that difficult to identify what the Indian country is.

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Well, that's true.
speaker="g_william_rice" startTime="2694.567" stopTime="2698.971">
    Mr. G. William Rice 
    That's a fairly a simple analysis based on 18 U.S.C. 1151.

    Right.

    Mr. G. William Rice 
    You can identify a reservation, a dependent Indian community, or an Indian allotment, and you immediately know where that is.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="2706.165" stopTime="2713.782">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Okay. 
    But let's assume I'm a delivery... my business is delivering newspapers and I deliver newspapers to somebody in Indian country. 
    Okay?
speaker="g_william_rice" startTime="2713.782" stopTime="2714.259">
    Mr. G. William Rice 
    Okay.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="2714.259" stopTime="2722.285">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Part of my delivery is in Indian country and part of my route is outside of Indian country. 
    What do I do? 
    Divide my salary by 2 and--
speaker="g_william_rice" startTime="2722.285" stopTime="2741.477">
    Mr. G. William Rice 
    Well, no more than you would if you were selling things inside the State and outside the State, for instance. 
    You would... or the same type of situation occurs when you have taxable income and nontaxable income. 
    You simply report that part that's taxable to the State of Oklahoma, and you report that part that's taxable to the Sac and Fox Nation.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="2741.477" stopTime="2750.476">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    --Yes. 
    I think the situation is a lot rarer in the interstate situation than it is with people living in the State of Oklahoma and driving in and out of Indian country all the time.
speaker="g_william_rice" startTime="2750.476" stopTime="2805.304">
    Mr. G. William Rice 
    Well, it's not really a case I think of driving in and out of the Indian country all the time. 
    The more rational situation is going to be where you have a fellow who works all day, for instance, at the tribal office, drives back to a area outside of the Indian country and goes to a second job in the evening as a checker at the grocery store or, you know, some other type of employment. 
    I don't think that would be any trouble at all to decide what part of that income goes to the State authority and which one doesn't. 
    And that's the straw man really is the McClanahan... Roselyn McClanahan who works for the Navajo legal services during the daytime, is not taxable on that income, and yet if she drives over to Gallup off of the reservation and works an evening job, then under the McClanahan rule, I presume she's taxable on the income that she earned at Gallup. 
    And that's the case that's going to come up.

    Justice Byron R. White 
    Mr. Rice, did I gather you said that the State may not only not tax Indians who live off Indian country and work on Indian country, but they also may not tax non-Indians who live off the Indian country and work on Indian country?

    Well, let's assume there's a non-Indian who lives off the reservation or lives off Indian country, but works on Indian country. 
    Maybe that's just a figment of... maybe that's just... because it may be that nobody who's a non-Indian ever gets to work on--

    Mr. G. William Rice 
    Well--

    Mr. G. William Rice 
    --I think there's two answers to that. 
    One is--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2860.413" stopTime="2866.159">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, I know, but you can either say the State may tax him or may not.
speaker="g_william_rice" startTime="2866.159" stopTime="2885.350">
    Mr. G. William Rice 
    --Well, I think the State may not tax him for two reasons. 
    One is that as long as he is working for the tribe or engaged in conduct which is subject to regulation and if the State interferes by taxing him with tribal self-government to the point that they are trying to use their tax to regulate conduct--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2885.350" stopTime="2887.490">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Did the Tenth Circuit decide against you on that?

    --No, they did not. 
    They decided that adversely to us.

    Yes.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2894.288" stopTime="2895.520">

    And we denied cert on that.
speaker="g_william_rice" startTime="2895.520" stopTime="2896.021">
    Mr. G. William Rice 
    You denied cert on that.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2896.021" stopTime="2900.232">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Yes. 
    So, that isn't at issue here. 
    We know what your position is.
speaker="g_william_rice" startTime="2900.232" stopTime="3001.979">
    Mr. G. William Rice 
    That's the position that we had because of the treaties and the other. 
    Now, in addition to the per se rule and the preemption, we also have the stare decisis questions. 
    McClanahan squarely holds that Indians, I think, in the Indian country are not subject to State income tax. 
    Moe v. Confederated Salish &amp; Kootenai and Washington v. the Colville tribes provide the same type of background for automobile taxes. 
    The taxes here are property taxes, pure and simple. 
    They're based on the value of the car. 
    The Oklahoma courts, as shown in exhibits 18 and 27 through 32 in the Tenth Circuit exhibits, have ruled against the Tax Commission on exactly this issue. 
    It was interesting in the Solicitor General's letter lodged with the court that the Oklahoma Court of Appeals has now ruled against the Tax Commission on the issue of the income tax in Core v. Oklahoma Tax Commission. 
    The stare decisis situation here is such that the Court all... really just needs to simply apply those cases to this situation. 
    Those cases apply in the Indian country, and since they are applicable in the Indian country in my view, the Court need go no further. 
    Now, if the Court chooses to take the next step, then the question becomes whether the original boundaries of the Sac and Fox Indian reservation have been extinguished, and that's an issue that neither the district court nor the Tenth Circuit chose to address. 
    It would be our position in that case that you could either remand for that decision or you could go ahead and decide it on the record that's here.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3001.979" stopTime="3002.949">

    The Nation brought this suit, the Sac and Fox Nation.

    Yes, sir, it was.

    --destroyed? 
    And none of the lower courts decided it?
speaker="g_william_rice" startTime="3018.029" stopTime="3088.788">
    Mr. G. William Rice 
    They did not decide that issue at all. 
    The reference is continuously to the abolished reservation or the old reservation or the reservation that's not there anymore. 
    The fact of the matter is no court has ever ruled that way. 
    That was part of the complaint. 
    That was part of the argument all the way up. 
    That was never ruled on. 
    The courts below simply did what we said is the only thing that this Court really needs to do, and that was to apply the per se rule and the rules of stare decisis and say that these cases, McClanahan, Moe, Colville, and Central Machinery, apply, pure and simple, within the Indian country. 
    Because of that, we have Indian country where the tribal trust land is because all our reservation has ever really been is land that has been set aside under the superintendence of the Government for Indians. 
    That's what our reservation turns out to be. 
    We have dependent Indian communities. 
    We have allotments that are still in trust. 
    Now, because we have that situation, we don't have to decide the reservation boundary issue. 
    We've got the tribe on trust land. 
    We've got most of the people that work there on trust land, and we can let the reservation boundary issue go--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3088.788" stopTime="3092.632">

    --Yes, sir.

speaker="g_william_rice" startTime="3103.669" stopTime="3107.981">
    Mr. G. William Rice 
    No, I don't think under their analysis that it would have come out any differently--

speaker="g_william_rice" startTime="3212.892" stopTime="3307.006">
    Mr. G. William Rice 
    I would say the large majority of those live on Indian country. 
    Now, we are I suppose back to the bright line rule. 
    We think that that is what Indian country is, is the place that Congress has set aside the tribe, if you will, behind the law, and they have said in 1151, which basically codified decisions of this Court and the understanding that Solicitor Cohen had in his handbook of Indian law in 1942, that the Indian country is the place for tribal self-government. 
    It's a place where State law only applies when Congress says that it does. 
    Now, that has been the concept of Indian country. 
    You don't have to decide the reservation boundary issues to decide the case if you adopt and apply the McClanahan, Moe, Colville series of cases through stare decisis or through the per se rule. 
    On the other hand, it seems to me that if you do not apply those cases to the Indian country generally, as it has been defined by Congress and 1151, then in order to rule against the tribe on the part of the case on which certiorari was granted, you have to overrule that line of cases because it's kind of an either/or proposition. 
    If our reservation is there, then those cases ought to apply. 
    If those cases apply to all Indian country, regardless of reservation status, we don't have to get to that issue, but if the reservation is there, then the only way that these cases don't apply would be to overrule.

    Yes.

    Mr. G. William Rice 
    The difference, though, with the Indian conduct in those areas that have still retained reservation status is Mattz v. Arnett, and those cases say that the Indian work... the Indian activity there, their actions, are still within the Indian country. 
    I think I want to make it very clear that our position in the brief and here also is that there's three fallback positions basically on the Indian country issue. 
    One of those is... and the first one I think is that the original boundaries are still there. 
    The second one is that regardless... if you read the allotment agreement and the legislative history, which is in the exhibits that were in the Tenth Circuit--

    But--

    Mr. G. William Rice 
    --we've got a diminished one, not a big one.

    Justice Byron R. White 
    --But if the reservation were still there and was not abolished, you wouldn't say that every acre of ground within the bounds of the reservation would be Indian country.

    Mr. G. William Rice 
    Yes, sir, it is Indian country because 1151(a) says that it includes all Indian reservations notwithstanding the issuance of any patent, and Seymour v. Superintendent says a patent to anybody, whether that's a patent to an Indian or a patent to a non-Indian.
