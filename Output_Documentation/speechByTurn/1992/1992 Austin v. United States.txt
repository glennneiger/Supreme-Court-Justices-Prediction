Austin v. United States

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    We'll hear argument next in No. 92-6073, Richard Lyle Austin v. the United States. 
    Mr. Johnson.
speaker="richard_l_johnson" startTime="30.440" stopTime="176.728">
    Mr. Richard L. Johnson 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    The issue in this case is whether the Eighth Amendment and specifically the Excessive Fines Clause applies to the concept of... applies to the civil forfeiture under 21 U.S.C., section 881(a)(4) and (a)(7). 
    Mr. Richard Lyle Austin is the owner of the Garretson Body Shop and also the 1972 mobile home that were seized by the Government under the... these appropriate statutes. 
    The facts of the case show that he transferred 2 grams of cocaine to someone in the body shop, and that he obtained this from the mobile home. 
    A subsequent search of the mobile home and body shop indicated there were small amounts of cocaine, some paraphernalia, and some small amounts of marijuana. 
    Mr. Austin pled guilty in State court. 
    He was sentenced to 7 years. 
    The Government seized his mobile home and his body shop, which was his livelihood, and he had been in the auto body shop for about 25 years. 
    The affidavit in the record indicates he intended to return to that job, that type of living, the body-shop living, when he got out of prison. 
    The district court granted summary judgment. 
    The court of appeals reluctantly affirmed indicating that the technical legal distinctions regarding in personam and in rem prohibited it from reaching the issue of the Eighth Amendment applicability. 
    It also indicated that clear court decisions by this Court and other courts do not require proportionality in the civil proceedings for the forfeiture of property. 
    I want to make three points in this oral argument. 
    First is that where the Government stands to gain monetarily the Excessive Fines Clause should apply and Eighth Amendment proportionality should apply. 
    Secondly, the in rem fiction shouldn't bar the application of the excessive fines/proportionality analysis when the civil forfeitures are quasi-criminal or punishment in actual character. 
    Thirdly, under this Court's decisions in Halper and Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez, those tests actually show that this civil forfeiture is punishment. 
    First of all, regarding the first point, the Court's decision in Browning v. Ferris provides a basis for applying the Eighth Amendment Excessive Fines Clause to civil actions and to forfeitures.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="176.728" stopTime="179.633">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    I thought we rejected the application there.
speaker="richard_l_johnson" startTime="179.633" stopTime="315.298">
    Mr. Richard L. Johnson 
    You indicated that you rejected the application to actions between private parties. 
    You left open the possibility that when the Government is involved, that the Excessive Fines Clause could also be applicable. 
    And, in fact, you suggested in, I think, a footnote quoting Halper that it might give rise to the Eighth Amendment analysis when the Government stood to gain punitive damages. 
    And in Justice O'Connor's concurring and dissenting opinion, there was a substantial analysis of the historical development of the Excessive Fines Clause and the fact that fines and forfeitures are equivalent, and that, in fact, the Eighth Amendment should apply to civil actions. 
    Your quote in Browning v. Ferris regarding the court of Vermont also indicated... the Supreme Court of Vermont also indicated that in certain circumstances you felt that the Excessive Fines Clause or the Eighth Amendment could be applicable. 
    In your case Harmelin v. Michigan, Justice Scalia's footnote also indicated that it makes sense to scrutinize governmental action more closely when the state stands to benefit. 
    It's clear that under 21 U.S.C. 881(a)(4) and (a)(7), the Government has stood to benefit. 
    We cite in our brief an article from Newsweek which indicates that since 1985 the Government has obtained about $2.6 billion through this forfeiture proceeding. 
    There's also a quote by the Director of the Asset Forfeiture Branch of the Attorney General's Office. 
    It says that civil forfeiture is the goose that laid the golden egg. 
    There's another quote also that we indicate from a American Criminal Law Review article in which it indicates that in August of 1990, the U.S. Attorney General warned U.S. attorneys that the Department was far short of its projected $470 million in forfeiture deposits and urged them to increase the efforts in order to make the budget goal during fiscal year 1990. 
    And this was in August of 1990, and Mr. Austin's property--

    Mr. Richard L. Johnson 
    --Well, it shows I think that there should be some sort of check on the Government, just as Justice Scalia says it makes sense to scrutinize Government actions more closely. 
    What it indicates is that there is a possibility for overreaching.

    And there is the possibility of it under this forfeiture statute.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="350.243" stopTime="359.639">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    Well, what do you do with a case like Calero-Toledo which says that even an innocent owner... and no one contends, I take it, that your client is innocent.
speaker="richard_l_johnson" startTime="359.639" stopTime="360.008">
    Mr. Richard L. Johnson 
    No.

    Even an innocent owner can... the property can be taken under traditional forfeiture law.
speaker="richard_l_johnson" startTime="364.262" stopTime="372.006">
    Mr. Richard L. Johnson 
    Calero-Toledo needs to be distinguished and possibly even looked at again I think. 
    Number one, in--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="372.006" stopTime="375.158">
    Chief Justice Rehnquist 
    Well, what's the matter with it? 
    It always struck me as a perfectly good case.
speaker="richard_l_johnson" startTime="375.158" stopTime="411.041">
    Mr. Richard L. Johnson 
    --Well, Calero-Toledo, the Eighth Amendment wasn't raised. 
    That would be one point. 
    Secondly, although Calero-Toledo indicates, as you said, that in rem forfeiture really shouldn't deal with the guilt or innocence of the owner, in fact, it does establish an innocent owner exception. 
    And thirdly, forfeitures at the time of Calero-Toledo weren't the same as they are now. 
    The forfeitures that the Government is having under 21 U.S.C. 881 (a)(4) and (a)(7) are far in excess of what was happening back at the time of Calero-Toledo.

    --Then there should be proportionality, but it should be analyzed under a series of factors. 
    That's what proportionality is as we advocate it. 
    There should be many factors or several factors that are applied, factors such as the circuit courts have applied in criminal forfeiture cases in order to determine whether all of the property should be forfeited, whether some of it should be forfeited, or whether none of it should be.

    If the person has done nothing wrong it seems like, then it would be punishment if the person would have their assets taken. 
    I guess that's what I would say. 
    The Excessive Fines Clause also should apply because the Government is able to use this forfeiture procedure without the traditional safeguards, procedural safeguards, that would apply in most criminal cases. 
    The Government needs only to establish probable cause. 
    It can establish hearsay evidence, and then the claimant has the burden to prove the claimant's innocence or some other defense that might be applicable in the case.

    Well, I think the Halper case is on our side, at least as far as the punishment issue. 
    We're arguing mainly that the Eighth Amendment should apply to this case.

    Mr. Richard L. Johnson 
    The Whalers Cove case from the Second Circuit applies it, although the Whalers Cove case on the facts finds that it does not apply. 
    And strictly speaking I guess it was an Eighth Amendment application. 
    It said that the Excessive Fines Clause argument had been abandoned. 
    So, it applied I think the Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause and found that under the proportionality analysis that it wouldn't make any difference.

    But as far as the Excessive Fines Clause, it doesn't.

    Mr. Richard L. Johnson 
    Not that I'm aware of, Your Honor. 
    No. 
    The Halper case indicates that a civil sanction that cannot fairly be said solely to serve a remedial purpose, but rather can be explained only as also serving either retributive or deterrent purposes, punishment, as we have come to understand the term. 
    I don't think there's any question that civil forfeiture serves a retributive or deterrent purpose in addition to whatever remedial purpose it might serve. 
    Because it also serves that, it's punishment within the... under the understanding of that term. 
    Because it is punishment, the Excessive Fines Clause should apply. 
    The in rem/in personam distinction also should not bar the Court from considering this issue. 
    The Court's past cases, first of all, are instructive. 
    One 1958 Plymouth Sedan, Boyd v. the United States, U.S. v. Coin and... U.S. v. U.S. Coin and Currency all see through the in rem/in personam distinction and apply the Fourth Amendment and Fifth Amendment protections to in rem actions. 
    The statute themselves, as I indicated, establish that this is punishment rather than just remedial. 
    They have innocent owner exceptions. 
    They're tied to a violation of the criminal law punishable by more than one year's imprisonment. 
    There are procedures for remission or mitigation of forfeiture, and they are based on violations of the Controlled Substances Act.

    I forget where the cocaine was found, but I mean, there's a bag of cocaine either in the body shop or the mobile home. 
    I mean, I just am finding the distinction based on remedial versus punitive a pretty ethereal distinction, and what bothers me about it is if we go your way on the theory that there is, in effect, a punitive function going on here by virtue of the innocent owner defense, then we have to face the fact that despite that variation, we're still dealing with two kinds of in rem actions, one against the guilty owner and one all other varieties of in rem action. 
    And we would have put ourselves in the position of saying that the guilty owner has a proportionality objection. 
    The innocent owner has none whatsoever in those cases which make no distinction between innocent and guilty owners. 
    And I suppose the next step down the road, if we go your way, is going to be the due process argument, that one cannot go against an innocent owner in an in rem action simply because the Government has no justifiable purpose under the Due Process Clause when at the same time the guilty owner is allowed to contest it.

 I forget where the cocaine was found, but I mean, there's a bag of cocaine either in the body shop or the mobile home. 
 I mean, I just am finding the distinction based on remedial versus punitive a pretty ethereal distinction, and what bothers me about it is if we go your way on the theory that there is, in effect, a punitive function going on here by virtue of the innocent owner defense, then we have to face the fact that despite that variation, we're still dealing with two kinds of in rem actions, one against the guilty owner and one all other varieties of in rem action. 
 And we would have put ourselves in the position of saying that the guilty owner has a proportionality objection. 
 The innocent owner has none whatsoever in those cases which make no distinction between innocent and guilty owners. 
 And I suppose the next step down the road, if we go your way, is going to be the due process argument, that one cannot go against an innocent owner in an in rem action simply because the Government has no justifiable purpose under the Due Process Clause when at the same time the guilty owner is allowed to contest it. 
 And it seems to me that you're setting us off on rather a steep slope if we buy your argument, and I'm trying to see if there's a way out of it.

    I guess again it depends on what the Court sees, the different factors. 
    But if a person is innocent and hasn't done anything, well then certainly that should be a defense. 
    It should be something the Court should consider in deciding whether or not it was proper to forfeit property or not.

    Mr. Miguel A. Estrada 
    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    The issue in this case is whether the Eighth Amendment requires that civil in rem forfeitures be proportional to the criminal culpability of the owner of the property. 
    Seven of the eight courts of appeals that have ruled on that question, including the court of appeals in this case, have concluded that the Eighth Amendment does not require that type of proportionality review, and because the majority view is correct, the judgment of the court of appeals in this case should be affirmed.

    --I think the fee interest was forfeited. 
    The facts of the case were that the claimant had leased the interest to someone who then used it for the purpose of a distillery business, and the person who was so using it was putting it to a lawful use so long as he kept records and paid taxes, which he failed to do. 
    Now, as a result of the acts of the lessee in not doing what he was supposed to do, the property, including the tract of land, was forfeited to the Government. 
    And the statute in that case was very clear that the tract of land was to be forfeited. 
    It was a statute passed by Congress I believe on July 20, 1868 and is found at 15 Stat., page 133. 
    There was no indication in the Court's... in how the Court dealt with the case that it thought of this as being in any way unusual.

    --Distillery, which is cited in our brief, Mr. Chief Justice. 
    Now, this Court has long understood the Eighth Amendment with its references to bail, fines, and punishments, to be directed to the criminal law function of the Government. 
    And consistent with that understanding, this Court in Brown and Ferris concluded that the word fine, as used in that amendment and as understood by the Framers, meant a payment to a sovereign as punishment for some offense. 
    Our claim here is that civil in rem forfeitures are not fines under the Eighth Amendment and do not otherwise implicate the Eighth Amendment because they have never been considered punishment for an offense.

    Mr. Miguel A. Estrada 
    I think Halper indicates that there are certain cases in which the Court will disregard the label that Congress has chosen to put on a given exaction, but under certain very limited circumstances. 
    Both Halper and the case of Bell v. Wolfish, which is cited, do what is in essence an as-applied challenge to a specific Government conduct; that is a claim that even though a statute is civil in the usual case, as applied in the case, it should be considered forbidden punishment. 
    But in the type of as-applied challenge, both Halper and Bell concentrated on the seventh Mendoza-Martinez factor, which is whether the Government conduct seems excessive in relation to the nonpunitive purpose as being claimed for it. 
    The theory of both cases, which was a theory that won in Halper and lost in Bell v. Wolfish, was that if the Government exaction in the specific case is so patently out of kilter with the stated nonpunitive purpose, then the court may safely infer that the true purpose was something else, i.e., the desire to use the sanction in the specific case, not to further the purpose of the statute, but to inflict what is, in essence, punishment. 
    Halper makes very clear that the road to that level of... lack of rationality is very long and there are very few cases in which the specific invocation of--

    --I think every case in which the Government conduct is challenged can be subjected to a Halper inquiry. 
    We think that this class of cases, including this specific case, is of such a nature that the inquiry should never be successful because since the whole point of the in rem forfeiture statute is to make the property unavailable for further unlawful use and to compensate the victims of the unlawful use, it will never be a case in which the specific invocation of the forfeiture statute will exceed the bounds that the Court outlined in Halper.

    Mr. Miguel A. Estrada 
    --Yes. 
    I think this Court would have to conclude under the tests that this Court has always applied in similar inquiries like the Mendoza case that in fact what this statute does is to inflict punishment in the constitutional sense. 
    And if that were the case, then it would follow that you could, in fact, look at what the Government is doing under the Eighth Amendment. 
    Our principal claim in this case is that something of this type, by reason of history and by reason of the fact that the history still serves a purpose to this day, should not be considered punishment in the constitutional sense.

    No. 
    No, and I think when the Court went over the history of the excessive fines language in the Eighth Amendment in the Brown and Ferris case, the Court concluded that to the Framers the excessive fines... that the fines that are mentioned in the Eighth Amendment were payments to the sovereign as punishment for some offense because then and now fines are assessed in criminal cases.

 So, the answer historically would be if a fine is payable to the sovereign as a fine, if it's as punishment, it doesn't make any difference that it's a civil case.

    Mr. Miguel A. Estrada 
    That is right, Justice White. 
    I should say that in looking at the issue of whether this is, in fact, punishment in the constitutional sense, there are tests that this Court has always applied, most notably the Mendoza-Martinez factors. 
    And using that very test, this Court only a few years ago ruled that a very similarly worded in rem forfeiture statute was not punishment under the Mendoza-Martinez factors. 
    That case is One Assortment of 89 Firearms, which is cited in our brief, and in that case, the statute in question mandated forfeiture of all firearms used or intended to be used in violations of the Gun Control Act or any other criminal law of the United States.

    Mr. Miguel A. Estrada 
    Yes, Justice Scalia, in a very limited sense. 
    Not innocence of the crime as such. 
    There is an 1808 case written by Chief Justice Marshall that was cited in this Court's opinion in Calero-Toledo, and the name of the case is Peish v. Ware, which is cited at page 689 of Calero-Toledo and is reported at Fork Ranch 347. 
    That was a case in which a ship had been wrecked on the coast of Delaware. 
    The goods were taken to the coast, and the Government brought a forfeiture action claiming that shortly after the ship was shipwrecked, the goods had been found in Delaware without tax stamps. 
    The Government lost that case, Chief Justice Marshall saying what seemed to be a statement of the common law of forfeiture, that a forfeiture wouldn't lie at common law in a case where there was nothing that the person, on whom the forfeiture would work, could have done to keep it from happening. 
    And we would take that as being part of the common law of forfeiture. 
    This Court's case in Calero-Toledo cited that and in addition said that invoking a forfeiture under those facts would likely be a violation of due process. 
    In addition, footnote 27 in Calero-Toledo pointed out... excuse me... that since 1790 the Federal Government has had statutes that provide for the remission of forfeitures as a matter of administrative grace when the owner can show that he was without intent or without willful negligence, and that goes back to 1790. 
    We think that Congress' decision to include something very much like that in this statute, as a matter of statutory right rather than as a matter of grace, really doesn't change what the nature of the action--

    Throughout the history since 1790, there have been some statutes that actually vest that type of claim with the court and there are some statutes now where a claimant can go to a court and ask that the forfeiture be mitigated rather than going to an agency, but that has always been there since 1790.

    Just looking at it from the other side, that sort of provides an answer to the question that I asked your brother, and that is, assuming we do find that there's something punitive here and we don't classify it as immune from review merely as a remedial forfeiture, there seems then to be a historical basis for us not to have to worry about the case of the truly innocent owner subject to the classic historical forfeiture because that person, based on your case from Fork Ranch, may very well have had a defense to the forfeiture all along.

    Mr. Miguel A. Estrada 
    I think we have to... yes, but I think we have to distinguish two meanings of innocence in this context. 
    When the Court has always said that innocence is not relevant, what it had meant as the cases make clear is that you needn't be guilty of a crime. 
    However, it is still possible and, indeed, likely that you haven't been very careful with your property.

    Mr. Miguel A. Estrada 
    --Correct, and I think that that is, in fact, what we think has historically justified civil forfeitures. 
    The civil forfeiture statutes go on the really common sense premise that there are certain uses of property that are so harmful and so socially undesirable that the law must place every incentive on the owner of the property to make sure, even if that takes taking affirmative steps, that no one, whether the owner knows about him or not, will inflict those harms on society with the owner's property.

    Mr. Miguel A. Estrada 
    --There were two types of forfeiture at early common law, Justice Kennedy. 
    One of them was the so-called forfeiture of estate, which really was in personam and really only came into play when the Government proved with a judgment of conviction that the person had, in fact, been convicted of a crime. 
    The other type of forfeiture really didn't have anything to do with the crimes that were hurting the king's bench. 
    It was in a completely different court system, the Court of the Exchequer, and that type of forfeiture, which is, in essence, what is at issue here, didn't partake of the rationale that you just gave I think.

    Mr. Miguel A. Estrada 
    Right, but it is not the same type of forfeiture that is at issue here, Justice Kennedy. 
    If this were a case in which the forfeiture could only be had upon the conviction of a crime, we don't... we would not be here because we would concede that the essence of that sort of action is on the person. 
    What we do have here is a statute that really doesn't need the criminal law other than to state a... other than to set a standard of conduct and, taking that as the standard of conduct, then says if your property has been used or is intended to be used for this purpose, then we will make sure that that harm doesn't come to pass by placing the property in the hands of someone who can give surety to society as a whole that these harms won't happen. 
    And I think that's a very different type of forfeiture than the forfeiture that you have in mind, Justice Kennedy.

 But you say you would apply the same standard in a case like that as if just an ordinary landlord rented a flat somewhere to a party and had no reason to believe it was to be used for anything but a residence, and it turned out that the tenant dealt in drugs in the flat without any knowledge of the landlord. 
 Would you say that the fee interest of the landlord would be forfeitable equally as... on those facts as in the distillery case?

    Mr. Miguel A. Estrada 
    --I think the mode of looking at the question would be the same in the sense that you would ask the same questions, i.e., whether the owner did everything that he physically could to ensure that this didn't happen. 
    I think if the owner, for example, never was around to see all of the suspicious people come and go and really made no effort whatsoever to stop by and look at the property, it is possible that that person would lose. 
    Someone who did take those steps, we would think that as a matter of common law, he would have exercised every care that the law could ask of him. 
    And if after every care and physically... and after physically doing everything that he could, the harm still came to pass, we would understand the common law as giving that person a defense. 
    Unless the Court has any further questions, we'll rely on our briefs.

    Mr. Richard L. Johnson 
    Thank you, Your Honor. 
    Counsel for the Government talks about the Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez criteria. 
    Applying that criteria to this case, it's clear that the actions of the Government in this case do constitute punishment. 
    First is whether it creates an affirmative disability or restraint. 
    Obviously, the loss of Mr. Austin's business and his home was a disability on him. 
    Whether it historically has been regarded as punishment. 
    We'd argue that this type of forfeiture that occurred in this case has historically been regarded as punishment because we argue that it goes back to the time of the Framers and prior to that what they understood as punishment to be.

    Mr. Richard L. Johnson 
    --If it was 600 grams, there's more of a chance that probably the place was being used to store drugs too. 
    That very likely could be the case, but again, that's a... it's a... an analysis that has to be determined I think by the court in the first instance, by the district court. 
    In other words, all the factors have to be taken into consideration. 
    The third factor is whether it comes into play on a finding of scienter. 
    In this case, the statutes themselves indicate that scienter is a factor. 
    In other words, if the owner does not know of the drug use, then it's a defense. 
    Four, whether the operation will promote the traditional aims of punishment, retribution, and deterrence. 
    In fact, that is the case here too. 
    This civil forfeiture under 21 U.S.C. 881(a)(4) and (a)(7) does promote--

    Mr. Richard L. Johnson 
    --Well, one of the factors of whether or not it's punishment is whether or not scienter is involved, and that... in this particular case, if you are an innocent owner, then that is a defense to the civil forfeiture. 
    So, that's... that is one of the factors in this case. 
    Next, whether the behavior to which it applies is already a crime. 
    As I indicated, the statutes do tie the civil forfeiture to the violations of the controlled drug statutes.
