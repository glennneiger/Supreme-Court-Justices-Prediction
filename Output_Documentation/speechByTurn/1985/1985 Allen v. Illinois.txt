Allen v. Illinois
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="0.000" stopTime="9.772">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    We will hear arguments first this morning in Allen against Illinois. 
    Mr. Meinz, you may proceed whenever you are ready.
speaker="verlin_r_meinz" startTime="9.772" stopTime="53.468">
    Mr. Verlin R. Meinz 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, as I speak to the Court this morning, the petitioner, Terry Allen, is incarcerated in a maximum security penal institution in the State of Illinois. 
    He is there with persons who have been formally convicted of crime, and like them, receives the mental health treatment that is available in that facility. 
    The petitioner, though, has not faced trial. 
    The state of Illinois could have pursued traditional prosecution against him, but chose not to. 
    Instead, the state chose an alternative. 
    They sought to have him declared a sexually dangerous person under Article 105 of the Illinois Code of Criminal Procedure.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="53.468" stopTime="60.305">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Is that a criminal procedure or a civil procedure? 
    You cite it as under the Criminal Code.
speaker="verlin_r_meinz" startTime="60.305" stopTime="71.262">
    Mr. Verlin R. Meinz 
    It is under the Criminal Code, Your Honor. 
    The statute itself carries a civil label. 
    We are arguing, though, that it is criminal for purposes of the Fifth Amendment. 
    That is our precise argument here.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="71.262" stopTime="76.916">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    But you concede the legislature has described this as a civil proceeding.
speaker="verlin_r_meinz" startTime="76.916" stopTime="86.470">
    Mr. Verlin R. Meinz 
    It has in the statute itself. 
    The state pursued this adjudication of Allen as a sexually dangerous person. 
    It conducted--
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="86.470" stopTime="90.838">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Excuse me. 
    Did he have preponderance, or did he have reasonable doubt?
speaker="verlin_r_meinz" startTime="90.838" stopTime="99.194">
    Mr. Verlin R. Meinz 
    --That is the proof beyond a reasonable doubt. 
    The state must make its case that Allen is a sexually dangerous person beyond a reasonable doubt.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="99.194" stopTime="101.062">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Is that possible in a civil case?
speaker="verlin_r_meinz" startTime="101.062" stopTime="120.207">
    Mr. Verlin R. Meinz 
    That was the thrust of the decision in Statulak versus Coughlin, a Seventh Circuit case in 1975: which ruled that the proceeding, though denominated civil, was sufficiently criminal as to require the imposition of a burden beyond a reasonable doubt. 
    That is an opinion, by the way, upon which we rely.
speaker="lewis_f_powell_jr" startTime="120.207" stopTime="131.981">
    Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. 
    Will you elaborate a little bit on the type of institution in which these persons are confined? 
    I think you said they were confined also with people convicted of crime. 
    Is it a state prison?
speaker="verlin_r_meinz" startTime="131.981" stopTime="133.783">
    Mr. Verlin R. Meinz 
    It is a state prison, Your Honor.
speaker="lewis_f_powell_jr" startTime="133.783" stopTime="140.437">
    Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. 
    Is it indistinguishable from other prisons that do not have psychiatric cases?
speaker="verlin_r_meinz" startTime="140.437" stopTime="165.421">
    Mr. Verlin R. Meinz 
    It is indistinguishable in our judgment, Your Honor, from other institutions. 
    Indeed, it is simply a part of a larger institution, the Menard Correctional Center in Illinois. 
    In 1933, the Menard Psychiatric Center was set off as a separate institution. 
    A new wall was constructed between it and the rest of the minority correctional center. 
    Mental health treatment is available there.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="165.421" stopTime="166.688">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    It is a hospital.
speaker="verlin_r_meinz" startTime="166.688" stopTime="176.610">
    Mr. Verlin R. Meinz 
    It is a mental health treatment center. 
    It is not a hospital as such. 
    It is certainly not a mental health hospital, as one might imagine a hospital to be.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="176.610" stopTime="182.981">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    This person confined in there is just not an outpatient. 
    He is an inpatient. 
    He stays there.
speaker="verlin_r_meinz" startTime="182.981" stopTime="185.566">
    Mr. Verlin R. Meinz 
    He stays there. 
    He stays there indefinitely, Your Honor.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="185.566" stopTime="198.309">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Are the persons in the psychiatric wing or whatever the building is segregated completely from persons in the criminal part of the structure?
speaker="verlin_r_meinz" startTime="198.309" stopTime="201.427">
    Mr. Verlin R. Meinz 
    No, they are not, Your Honor. 
    Within the Menard--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="201.427" stopTime="202.577">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Do they dine together?
speaker="verlin_r_meinz" startTime="202.577" stopTime="205.846">
    Mr. Verlin R. Meinz 
    --Yes, they do. 
    Within the Menard Psychiatric Center--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="205.846" stopTime="211.133">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Do the psychiatric people, are they required to occupy cells at night?
speaker="verlin_r_meinz" startTime="211.133" stopTime="212.033">
    Mr. Verlin R. Meinz 
    --Yes, Your Honor.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="212.033" stopTime="213.069">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    They are?
speaker="verlin_r_meinz" startTime="213.069" stopTime="267.470">
    Mr. Verlin R. Meinz 
    Yes, Your Honor. 
    Perhaps I should clarify this just a bit. 
    Menard Psychiatric Center houses about 300 some inmates. 
    About 30 to 35 of those at any one time will be sexually dangerous persons, persons adjudicated under Article 105 of the Code of Criminal Procedure in Illinois. 
    The remainder of the population, obviously, the majority of the population are convicted criminals, convicted felons who have been sent to the Menard Psychiatric Center for psychiatric care. 
    There are convicted sex offenders there who are sent to the center for the sex offender treatment program, which is also available to the sexually dangerous person. 
    Also sent to the Menard Psychiatric Center are inmates from other institutions, also convicted felons, who have been found to be in need of short-term psychiatric care.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="267.470" stopTime="283.229">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Mr. Meinz, do I understand from your response that Justice Marshall's question about the burden of proof that the source of the beyond a reasonable doubt burden was not the Illinois legislature but a Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit decision?
speaker="verlin_r_meinz" startTime="283.229" stopTime="324.389">
    Mr. Verlin R. Meinz 
    Yes, Your Honor. 
    Originally the statute, and certainly the case law under it, specified a preponderance of the evidence standard. 
    That was litigated in a habeas corpus action, and in 1975 in Stachulak versus Coughlin, an opinion by Chief Judge Fairchild at that time, the Seventh Circuit ruled that there must be proof beyond a reasonable doubt. 
    That standard must be applied. 
    After that decision, the Illinois Supreme Court in People versus Pembrock also ruled, albeit independently, they said, that there was a reasonable doubt standard. 
    The legislature picked up the cue and incorporated a reasonable doubt standard in that legislation in its revision in 1981.

    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    Mr. Meinz, Mr. Allen was indicted, wasn't he?

    Mr. Verlin R. Meinz 
    Mr. Allen was indicted.
speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="330.626" stopTime="332.093">
    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    Is that indictment still outstanding?
speaker="verlin_r_meinz" startTime="332.093" stopTime="363.264">
    Mr. Verlin R. Meinz 
    Yes, it is, and it will be until such time as Mr. Allen can prove that he has recovered from the sexually dangerous person condition. 
    At that time, and only at that time, will the underlying charge against him be dismissed. 
    But it isn't likely that he will ever be tried for that crime? 
    It is not likely that he will ever be tried for the crime, a crime of deviant sexual assault and--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="363.264" stopTime="369.435">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    As long as he is not cured, he won't be tried, and when he is cured, it will be dismissed.
speaker="verlin_r_meinz" startTime="369.435" stopTime="383.845">
    Mr. Verlin R. Meinz 
    --That is true. 
    The question is, and one significant focus of our argument is that we may be talking about... we are certainly talking about an indefinite period of time before he can prove that he has recovered and before that charge is dismissed.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="383.845" stopTime="385.511">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    And he may never be able to prove it.

    Mr. Verlin R. Meinz 
    He may never be able to prove that he has recovered.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="387.844" stopTime="389.213">

    So he will be there until his death.
speaker="verlin_r_meinz" startTime="389.213" stopTime="389.479">
    Mr. Verlin R. Meinz 
    That is true.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="389.479" stopTime="390.863">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Like in a civil commitment.
speaker="verlin_r_meinz" startTime="390.863" stopTime="395.700">
    Mr. Verlin R. Meinz 
    That is possible, except we argue there are very real distinctions.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="395.700" stopTime="398.152">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, I know, but in that respect it is the same.
speaker="verlin_r_meinz" startTime="398.152" stopTime="420.815">
    Mr. Verlin R. Meinz 
    Yes, Your Honor, but there would be periodic review available in such a civil mental health commitment that is not available in a sexually dangerous person commitment. 
    The state will be obliged to come back to court time and time again to prove that the commitment to a secure institution is the least restrictive alternative placement that is appropriate for treatment.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="420.815" stopTime="422.100">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    You mean in a civil commitment.
speaker="verlin_r_meinz" startTime="422.100" stopTime="422.784">
    Mr. Verlin R. Meinz 
    In a civil commitment.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="422.784" stopTime="425.636">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    And here who has the burden?
speaker="verlin_r_meinz" startTime="425.636" stopTime="429.956">
    Mr. Verlin R. Meinz 
    The defendant... excuse me, the accused. 
    He is called the respondent in the proceeding.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="429.956" stopTime="432.256">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    How often can he raise the question?
speaker="verlin_r_meinz" startTime="432.256" stopTime="458.273">
    Mr. Verlin R. Meinz 
    He can raise the question as often as he wants and as soon as he wants upon being committed to the Menard Psychiatric Center. 
    He could come in within six months. 
    He could come in in a year. 
    He could come in every three months if he wanted to. 
    Importantly, though, at that time he has the burden of proving his entitlement to release. 
    He must show that he is entitled to release. 
    If he fails, he simply goes back to the Menard Psychiatric Center, where he has been.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="458.273" stopTime="461.242">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Is the hearing held in the institution or in the court?
speaker="verlin_r_meinz" startTime="461.242" stopTime="567.078">
    Mr. Verlin R. Meinz 
    In the committing court, Your Honor, the court in which he was originally found to be a sexually dangerous person, and that court must make the decision whether or not the respondent, the accused, remains a sexually dangerous person. 
    If I could, I would like to say just a few more words about the sexually dangerous person process. 
    The statutory definition I should get to first of all. 
    The statute defines a sexually dangerous person as a person who has a mental disorder existing for a year or more, as a person who also has criminal propensities to the commission of sex offenses, and a person who has demonstrated those propensities towards acts of sexual assault or molestation. 
    The Illinois Supreme Court in this case, as a matter of fact, gave us a definitive construction of the third element of that definition. 
    The court said that as to the third element, the demonstrated propensity, the state must show that respondent has committed at least one sexual offense. 
    Clearly, then, the definition involves both a mental condition and past misconduct. 
    A petition to have a person adjudicated a sexually dangerous person must be filed in a criminal case. 
    There must be an underlying criminal charge. 
    It is not an independent process in any way, once again, unlike the civil mental health process. 
    Such petition seeking SDP adjudication can only be filed by the prosecutor, not by the accused, not by the court, not by a friend or a relative on the accused's behalf. 
    Only the prosecutor can trigger this SDP process.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="567.078" stopTime="573.064">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Does Illinois provide for a civil commitment that might be brought by family or next friend?
speaker="verlin_r_meinz" startTime="573.064" stopTime="590.960">
    Mr. Verlin R. Meinz 
    Yes, it does, as does every other treatment program that I am aware of, Your Honor, in the state of Illinois. 
    If it is a treatment program, if it is a mental health commitment, in Illinois, then the court importantly, or any friend or relative on behalf of the accused, or the accused himself can petition for treatment.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="590.960" stopTime="602.016">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    So if the family became aware of the potentialities, they, the family might proceed independently of the civil action and ask that the person be committed. 
    Is that right?
speaker="verlin_r_meinz" startTime="602.016" stopTime="642.326">
    Mr. Verlin R. Meinz 
    In the civil area. 
    They could not do so, however, Your Honor, in a sexually dangerous person. 
    They could not ask to have someone adjudicated a sexually dangerous person. 
    Let's assume, for example, that a friend or relative saw the accused now unfortunately charged with his third or fourth sex offense. 
    They said, well, he has pled guilty before, he has done this before, he did a short stretch in prison. 
    We need treatment. 
    There is a Sexually Dangerous Persons Act. 
    Let's try to get him some help. 
    They can't do it. 
    Only the prosecutor can make the decision that the accused should be adjudicated or treated as a sexually dangerous person.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="642.326" stopTime="646.111">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, the issue here is the Fifth Amendment, I take it.

    Mr. Verlin R. Meinz 
    Yes, it is. 
    Yes, it is, Your Honor.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="648.280" stopTime="659.954">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    And since whether or not a psychiatrist's opinion based on statements that he is making from the respondent is admissible?

    Mr. Verlin R. Meinz 
    Yes.

speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="668.543" stopTime="674.030">
    Justice Byron R. White

    Yes, Your Honor.

    Mr. Verlin R. Meinz

    Not for jury trial.

    Justice Byron R. White 
    Why are you claiming... what makes the Fifth Amendment so... why do you think you are entitled to the Fifth Amendment privilege, but not the jury trial?
speaker="verlin_r_meinz" startTime="723.028" stopTime="738.287">
    Mr. Verlin R. Meinz 
    Because this is a criminal case within the scope of the Fifth Amendment, which is construed more broadly than the criminal case provisions of the Sixth Amendment, in our judgment. 
    We make, once again, no claim as to an entitlement to a jury trial.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="738.287" stopTime="760.784">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    I know, but surely the Fifth Amendment can be claimed in a civil proceeding, but it can't if it isn't incriminating, and these statements certainly can't be used in any criminal case, a wholly criminal case.

    Mr. Verlin R. Meinz 
    We believe they can, Your Honor.

    Mr. Verlin R. Meinz 
    After the sexually dangerous person or the person alleged to be a sexually dangerous person had spoken to a psychiatrist, and was compelled to speak for that psychiatrist, it is our judgment that the statements could thereafter be used in a criminal prosecution.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="786.518" stopTime="789.136">

    Mr. Verlin R. Meinz 
    If the state fails to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a person is a sexually dangerous person, we believe that the state can return to the underlying criminal charge. 
    We also believe that--

    Mr. Verlin R. Meinz 
    No, Your Honor. 
    It is not even equivalent to the immunity that is required for a waiver of the Fifth Amendment. 
    It is not coextensive with the waiver of the privilege. 
    We need a derivative use. 
    As a matter of fact, in Illinois we have as a general matter a transactional immunity. 
    We are not given transactional immunity here. 
    We are not even given derivative use immunity, which is our most important point.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="837.284" stopTime="852.059">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    What you say is that your client ought to have the same sort of privilege as a defendant has in a criminal case, and he can't even be called to the stand against his will, and no amount of immunity would do him any good unless it is full transactional immunity.
speaker="verlin_r_meinz" startTime="852.059" stopTime="868.053">
    Mr. Verlin R. Meinz 
    We are insisting that he not be called to the stand, which under our judgment is also possible, given the ruling of the Illinois Supreme Court that he has no privilege against self-incrimination. 
    In our judgment, that is the only thing keeping him off the stand.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="868.053" stopTime="877.861">

    Mr. Verlin R. Meinz 
    They have to prove once again a mental condition and past misconduct. 
    How is past misconduct most often proved? 
    By reference to prior convictions which the Sexually Dangerous Person Act specifically contemplates, the introduction of other crimes evidence. 
    The Sexually Dangerous Persons Act contemplates the introduction of lay witnesses who have been the victims perhaps of past sexual assaults, who have been the victims of the persons--

speaker="verlin_r_meinz" startTime="928.793" stopTime="945.088">
    Mr. Verlin R. Meinz 
    --The mental condition could be derived from psychiatric observations of the defendant, of the respondent, rather, at a proceeding, or from past records, prior records of one sort or another.

I should point out where they emphasize where the state's evidence emphasizes past criminal conduct of the respondent, and where the state's case emphases the alleged underlying offense, and where the psychiatric testimony was merely a by-product was merely only another portion of the evidence that was introduced. 
    I have certainly seen that type of case. 
    In terms of the difficulty of proving, it indeed may be more difficult for the state to prove that an individual is sexually dangerous if the person within that proceeding has privilege against self-incrimination.

    It is announced by the legislature to be civil. 
    It must be distinguished, though, from the civil mental health process. 
    That is Charter 91 and a half. 
    That is the Mental Health Code in Illinois. 
    This is Chapter 38, the Criminal Code. 
    It has two processes, formal, traditional prosecution and the sexually dangerous person proceeding.

    Mr. Verlin R. Meinz 
    No, not the mere placement of this particular piece of legislation in the Criminal Code as opposed to the Mental Health Code or elsewhere. 
    We are looking at everything that is involved here, the entire process from the fact that it can only be initiated in a criminal prosecution to the point that it can only be initiated by the prosecutor, to the point that it involves a formal hearing, rules of evidence, and proof beyond a reasonable doubt that involves--

    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    How strong is your argument to include proof beyond a reasonable doubt when that was really imposed by the Seventh Circuit? 
    They just took a view similar to the one you are arguing here, that this proceeding was a criminal one, but that doesn't indicate that the legislature independently would have come to that conclusion.
speaker="verlin_r_meinz" startTime="1203.469" stopTime="1206.587">

    Mr. Verlin R. Meinz 
    And the Illinois Supreme Court had done so as well without regard to Stachulak versus Coughlin on the grounds that they recognized that there were very serious consequences. 
    I should point out that Stachulak versus Coughlin in our judgment was well reasoned, and they took a look, the court in that case took a look at decisions of this case, two types of cases from this Court, the sexual psychopath legislation cases--

    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    --However well reasoned it may have been, I thought you were arguing that here Illinois has incorporated a number of elements into this type of case, and therefore Illinois must have intended it to be a criminal case, because it has put so many criminal protections into it, and all I am saying is that it seems to me that the argument about reasonable doubt is somewhat different because that really didn't start with the Illinois legislature.

    Mr. Verlin R. Meinz

    Mr. Verlin R. Meinz 
    Then perhaps I have misspoken, and especially in light of Justice Rehnquist's question. 
    Perhaps I have misspoken. 
    We do not focus particularly strongly at all on the fact that there is a burden here beyond a reasonable doubt. 
    We focus on other aspects of the proceeding. 
    We focus particularly on the commitment that is involved here, a commitment that is vastly different from the commitment that was involved in Addington versus Texas. 
    That is vastly different from the commitment undergone by a civil mental health committee under the Mental Health Code in Illinois. 
    They don't go to Menard Psychiatric Center. 
    They don't go to a maximum security penal institution like sexually dangerous persons do. 
    Those committees, the mental health committees, unlike the sexually dangerous person, has his situation periodically reviewed. 
    The SDP does not. 
    The state has a burden, a repeated burden to show the need for secure commitment. 
    There is no such process involved here. 
    A civil committee, one who is in a... even one in a secure institution, has a bill of rights under Illinois law.

    Mr. Verlin R. Meinz 
    Yes, but we would argue that the sexually dangerous person proceeding, while it lies between the middle of the traditional criminal prosecution and the civil mental health commitment, is skewed to one side, and is skewed very drastically toward the criminal side, and that is why we argue that the proceeding must be considered so far criminal in nature as to warrant the privilege, the application of the privilege against self-incrimination, and we urge this Court to find such privilege. 
    If it does, then there is no question but that the petitioner's adjudication and commitment as a sexually dangerous person must be reversed.

   Argument of Mark L. Rotert
speaker="mark_l_rotert" startTime="1548.040" stopTime="1614.150">
    Mr. Mark L. Rotert 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, there are several points on which respondents differ significantly from the petitioner on both the facts and the law that are relevant to this particular inquiry this morning. 
    One of the most important differences that I would like to emphasize at the outset is that the immunity provision as provided by the Illinois Supreme Court in this very case is coextensive with the privilege against self-incrimination which the respondent to a Sexually Dangerous Persons Act should have. 
    There is no question that the respondent to a sexually dangerous persons proceeding has the ability to claim a Fifth Amendment privilege in any proceeding, but there is also no question that in this case the Illinois Supreme Court has immunized that person. 
    Nothing that Terry Allen said to any psychiatrist at any point in time can ever be used against him in any criminal prosecution for the underlying sex offenses. 
    The Illinois Supreme Court has made that very clear. 
    And this is coextensive with the Fifth Amendment privilege, and this Court has recognized that repeatedly, that transactional immunity is not what the Fifth Amendment requires.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1614.150" stopTime="1624.355">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    But of course his claim is that because this was so much like a criminal proceeding, it shouldn't have been used against him in this proceeding, that he shouldn't have been callable for any purpose, I guess.
speaker="mark_l_rotert" startTime="1624.355" stopTime="1673.688">
    Mr. Mark L. Rotert 
    That is certainly true, Justice Rehnquist, and I think that leads us to the second major fundamental distinction between the parties, and that is the position of the state of Illinois that this is a civil statute. 
    It is a civil statute because the legislature that drafted it and enacted it said it was civil. 
    It is a civil statute because the Supreme Court of Illinois, which has had the opportunity to evaluate it, has concluded it to be civil. 
    And it is a civil statute because in its effect and in its purpose it does what a civil statute is designed to do. 
    Now, I admit that it does it in the context of due process safeguards which are often found in criminal cases, but we point out in our brief how ironic it is that the state of Illinois provides more due process safeguards to a civil proceeding and the result is that people therefore identify it as a criminal prosecution, and I think that that is the ironic result that is proffered to the Court this morning.

    In point of fact, the American Correctional Association in 1980 made the Menard Psychiatric Institution the first state facility of its kind among the 50 states for accreditation for its psychiatric care unit. 
    It has been reaccredited since in 1983. 
    It is a place where people receive treatment from health care professionals who want to provide treatment. 
    I won't deny that their liberty is restrained, but I will vigorously resist the implication that they are just... good as being in jail.

    Mr. Mark L. Rotert 
    That is true. 
    There are psychiatric problems that have been referred from within other institutions of the Department of Corrections, but they got there on the basis of a felony conviction. 
    I think it is important to understand that if the state of Illinois is going to provide treatment for the sexually dangerous person, treatment for those who commit forcible sex offenses, we have got to narrow the statute in some reasonable fashion. 
    We have narrowed it from the class of all citizens in Illinois, narrowed it further than the class of all citizens in Illinois to the mentally... mental problems, narrowed it further than those with mental problems of a psychosexual nature, and narrowed it down to that class of persons with psychosexual disorders who are going to act out on those disorders against others. 
    That narrowing process is what the statute reflects by saying that it will be an underlying criminal prosecution that will initiate these proceedings. 
    That is how the state's attorney in an individual county learns that the person may well be sexually dangerous.

    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor

    Mr. Mark L. Rotert 
    --The Illinois regulations under which the Department... the Illinois regulations that the Department of Corrections had imposed on the Menard Psychiatric Institute quite specifically and unambiguously require that the director of the Institute every six months will evaluate every person there because of the sexually dangerous persons finding. 
    He will make a written report on that person. 
    He will submit that report to the committing court, to the committing county attorney, and to the attorney who represented that person as a respondent in the sexually dangerous persons proceeding. 
    Every six months this person's attorney in the free society learns of that person's progress, and the word indefinite as applied to the commitment to a sexually dangerous persons respondent, it may be a semantic difference at first, but--

    Mr. Mark L. Rotert 
    Justice O'Connor, it differs in the sense that it is done... it doesn't differ in the sense that there is automatic review. 
    That is available to the judicial and civil committee and to the sexually dangerous persons respondent. 
    It does differ in that a person committed civilly, under the Civil Mental Health Code, the state will bear the burden of showing by a preponderance that his continued confinement is justified.

speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="2371.678" stopTime="2382.736">

    Mr. Mark L. Rotert 
    No, I do not, Justice O'Connor, for the reason that the burden that the respondent shares in filing such a recovery application has to be evaluated in the grasp of the statute which requires that he be given all the procedural protections that we have discussed already. 
    That is something that is not available to the civil committee, who may be at his own in dealing with the Department of Mental Health and seeking release. 
    Here we have someone who has demonstrated a propensity towards highly antisocial conduct. 
    That is not something that is necessarily true of a civil committee. 
    They may be eccentric. 
    They may be suffering from the infirmities of age or some-other form of retardation, but they may not be any dancer.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="2438.656" stopTime="2449.029">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Well, your involuntary commitment in Illinois, is it not necessary to prove that the person is dangerous to himself or others to be involuntarily committed?
speaker="mark_l_rotert" startTime="2449.028" stopTime="2609.166">
    Mr. Mark L. Rotert 
    The language differs significantly in that at some future time there may be some potential for problem, whereas the sexually dangerous person statute requires that there has been a demonstration within a specific time period in the recent past, and I do have a significant problem with the use of the word "indefinite" commitment. 
    I concede that this is indeterminate commitment. 
    I don't know how it could be anything other than indeterminate commitment. 
    The state legislature has clearly designed this statute with the hope and the goal that treatment will be provided for those with psychosexual disorders. 
    It would be highly artificial for the legislature to say that an individual will be cured within a given period of time. 
    The fact of the matter is that Terry Allen need net spend any more time in the Department of Corrections at the Menard Psychiatric Institute than is required for him to be receiving treatment and responding favorably. 
    The briefs consistently talk about the requirement that Terry Allen be cured. 
    That's not in the statute. 
    That's not an element for his release. 
    What is an element is that he is no longer dangerous to others in the opinion of psychiatrists. 
    That is the extent of the state's interest insofar as others in society are concerned. 
    If he can live without being a danger to others, then the state will give him his release, and if there are doubts, the state will resolve them in his favor, give his conditional discharge, let him live in a free and unstructured environment and prove that he's no longer a danger to others. 
    If the Court would look at the principal factors or the interests of society that we think we foster with the application of the Fifth Amendment and would lock to see whether they are actually fostered in the context of a Sexually Dangerous Persons Act proceeding, I believe the Court will very quickly conclude that the logical underpinnings of the Fifth Amendment itself have no application to these proceedings. 
    The Petitioner identifies as one of the most serious goals that's to be achieved the enhancement of accuracy of factfinding. 
    How can we get note reliable and accurate diagnoses when the psychiatrist isn't sure that he's going to get responsive answers from the person whom he's evaluating. 
    The Petitioner says that we want to be free of coercive techniques. 
    For almost 30 years the State of Illinois has allowed coersion in the taking of statements to be brought before a court in a Sexually Dangerous Persons proceeding and resolved pretrial. 
    There's no element of coersion in this case. 
    Terry Allen has never said that he was the subject of coercive practice. 
    Terry Allen has never even said that the psychiatric data on which he was found to be sexually dangerous was less than accurate.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2609.166" stopTime="2621.073">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well, but there's coersion in the sense that you say he may be required to testify against his will, and the Supreme Court of Illinois has said so, too, hasn't it?
speaker="mark_l_rotert" startTime="2621.073" stopTime="2626.460">
    Mr. Mark L. Rotert

    Mr. Mark L. Rotert 
    There is compulsion. 
    Now, the spectre of potential abuse of the statute is raised in one of the briefs. 
    Well, that just doesn't work when you look at the way the statute works. 
    The brief says what if we've got a recalcitrant witness. 
    The prosecutor will use this method to get rid of problem cases that he couldn't prove criminally in the court. 
    Well, when we recall that the problem is going to be the same, he's still going to have to bring in some proof that there was sexual misconduct, he's still got to bring in some witness to testify, as Christine Ray did in this case, he's not going to get around recalcitrant witnesses by going to a statute that requires more proof than the actual criminal felony requires. 
    There's... the idea is put forth in the brief that people under 91 1/2 in Illinois, the civil commitment procedure, are admonished, but the point of the matter is that they can claim their proceeding in any proceeding, they can claim their privilege. 
    They don't have counsel appointed to them. 
    They may well be exposing themselves to other criminal prosecutions. 
    That doesn't mean that they've got a right to silence in the civil mental health treatment context. 
    It means that they've got the right to claim the privilege in any proceeding.

    Right.
speaker="mark_l_rotert" startTime="2778.740" stopTime="2787.361">
    Mr. Mark L. Rotert 
    But what does the traditional criminal prosecution want to accomplish? 
    The two traditional aims, according to this--
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="2787.361" stopTime="2789.797">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Not to be convicted out of his own mouth.
speaker="mark_l_rotert" startTime="2789.797" stopTime="2823.970">
    Mr. Mark L. Rotert 
    --That's the Fifth Amendment. 
    The criminal prosecution accomplishes two goals: one, retribution or punishment; two, deterrence. 
    The Illinois legislature could not have had either of those goals in mind when it enacted this statute, because if you are talking about punishment, the numbers in the briefs reflect that this person was... could have been subjected to a penalty of up to 60 years in prison. 
    As a minimum, he was going to get six years in prison. 
    The American Psychiatric Association reflects that the average mean time for a Sexually Dangerous Persons respondent is about 2.2 years.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="2823.970" stopTime="2826.338">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    When you say prison, you mean the same prison that he's in?
speaker="mark_l_rotert" startTime="2826.338" stopTime="2830.290">
    Mr. Mark L. Rotert 
    Justice Marshall, I'm talking about the imprisonment--
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="2830.290" stopTime="2830.706">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    The same prison.
speaker="mark_l_rotert" startTime="2830.706" stopTime="2831.106">
    Mr. Mark L. Rotert 
    --on a conviction for felony.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="2831.106" stopTime="2831.656">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    The same prison.
speaker="mark_l_rotert" startTime="2831.656" stopTime="2935.373">
    Mr. Mark L. Rotert 
    It's... I understand that that's the Court's opinion, but it's not the same facility, and it's not a prison. 
    But in any event, the punishment aspect can't be found here. 
    If the State of Illinois wants to punish Terry Allen, we have the weaponry to use in a criminal prosecution to far more severely sanction him for his conduct, and if you're talking about the deterrent effect, if you look at DSM 3 or any psychiatric manual, you will find that the psychosexually disordered are impulsive personalities, and the idea that we're going to deter an impulsive sex offender is inherently illogical. 
    This could not have been the intent of the legislature of Illinois. 
    The legislature showed its intent in 1955 when they amended the Sexually Dangerous Persons statute and they said that if you proceed as a county prosecutor against a person as a sexually dangerous person and he receives treatment from the psychiatrists and is discharged from custody as a sexually dangerous person, you may not proceed on the underlying indictment against him. 
    They couldn't have been more clear in saying that the Sexually Dangerous Persons statute provides a treatment alternative to criminal prosecution. 
    If we want to punish and deter people like Terry Allen, we send thousands of people for sex offenses to the prisons every year. 
    But for those 30 or so people we send to the Menard Psychiatric Institute for treatment, we have the right to provide that treatment in a civil context, and the fact that we erect procedural safeguards around that civil procedure does not mean that it shall be labeled for Fifth Amendment purposes a criminal prosecution.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="2935.373" stopTime="2950.217">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Mr. Rotert, does In Re Gault provide the tests that we should employ in determining whether it should be treated as a criminal proceeding for purposes of the Fifth Amendment?
speaker="mark_l_rotert" startTime="2950.217" stopTime="3022.181">
    Mr. Mark L. Rotert 
    I don't believe that Gault is a particularly helpful case in this context, Justice O'Connor, for the reason that I think that Gault involved a juvenile statute, and the language of the Court involved quite clearly indicates that it considered the actual effect of the statute involved on the juvenile to be indistinguishable from a criminal effect that a person would suffer, and in Gault, for example, it was noted that an adult convicted of the same offense would have received a petty fine whereas the juvenile was subjected to incarceration until he reached the age of majority under certain circumstances. 
    So the Court was concerned that the apparent intent of the statute was to punish criminals, and I think that Gault is very much like Specht and some of the cases in the Petitioner's brief where a conviction is obtained, and then there are benignly labeled treatments given contingent upon conviction as alternatives to sentencing, and if we required Terry Allen to be convicted of a sex offense before we offered this treatment, perhaps the issue in analysis would be different. 
    But I think here the fact that Illinois not only doesn't proceed on the criminal prosecution but actually quashes the underlying charge removes this from the ambit--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="3022.181" stopTime="3030.604">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Well, but you do have to find the underlying criminal offense was committed.
speaker="mark_l_rotert" startTime="3030.604" stopTime="3118.829">
    Mr. Mark L. Rotert 
    --We have to find that at one point within the past year. 
    For example it wasn't necessary... if the State's Attorney got a police report that Victim A had been molested by the Defendant, there's nothing that requires him to bring in Victim A to show that within the past year there has been a demonstration of a sexual propensity. 
    He could bring in any person who would give testimony that within the past year there had been a sexual forcible misconduct. 
    So there isn't this unbreakable link between the underlying criminal charge and a sexually dangerous persons finding. 
    There is a very inextricable and unbreakable link between sexual forcible misconduct and the filing of the petition and the finding of the petition. 
    If the Court analyzes every one of the interests of the Fifth Amendment that are identified by the Petitioner as those which will be promoted by application of the Fifth Amendment and then in a very logical and common sense fashion applies those goals and those ideals to the actual litigation of a Sexually Dangerous Persons Act proceeding, the Court will determine that you have taken the Fifth Amendment out of its context of applicability to a criminal prosecution and thereby undercut the efficacy and logic of the Fifth Amendment and deprived the State of Illinois of an opportunity to provide humane and enlightened treatment for people with psychosexually impulsive disorders.

speaker="mark_l_rotert" startTime="3133.137" stopTime="3148.948">
    Mr. Mark L. Rotert 
    Yes, I do, because first of all, Terry Allen would have a constitutional right to get psychiatric examination, but where would the state be able to rebut his expert testimony? 
    We would fight expert testimony with lay testimony, and do you think that the witnesses for the state would be cross examined about whether they were experts?
speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="3148.948" stopTime="3152.550">
    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    Oh, they often prevail over psychiatric testimony. 
    You know that.
speaker="mark_l_rotert" startTime="3152.550" stopTime="3206.785">
    Mr. Mark L. Rotert 
    In front of a jury with a beyond-a-reasonable-doubt standard where I'm fighting a psychiatrist with a lay person, now, who are the lay people? 
    Since we know that most sexual misconduct is furtive in nature, we're not going to get a great number of witnesses to these events. 
    We're going to get people with obvious biases, yes, he victimized me. 
    Well, your bias as a witness against him is pretty patent. 
    Yes, he's my son. 
    Your bias is very patent. 
    When you look at what the state would have to do, the prosecutor would be well within his discretion to say if I'm going to go through all of that trouble, I'm going to go for felony conviction, and to heck with sending him to a psychiatric institute. 
    The point is that you've placed in unnecessary fashion the Fifth Amendment in a context where it doesn't apply and provided a disincentive for the provision for treatment. 
    The idea that we can use circumstantial evidence to prove something as private as a mental disorder is very, very difficult to accept.
speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="3206.785" stopTime="3209.053">
    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    I wouldn't describe it all as circumstantial evidence.
speaker="mark_l_rotert" startTime="3209.053" stopTime="3235.537">
    Mr. Mark L. Rotert 
    Well, there is direct evidence of the psychiatrist that he has examined the individual and drawn certain conclusions. 
    We couldn't provide such direct evidence from a psychiatric examination. 
    We would have to provide secondary resources: because he did this, he must have been psychosexually disordered. 
    But Justice Blackmun, isn't there also another problem that the jury is going to make less reliable findings when it doesn't have the ability to evaluate psychiatrists from both sides?
speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="3235.537" stopTime="3239.339">
    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    Well, I can't join your suffering for the State of Illinois.
speaker="mark_l_rotert" startTime="3239.339" stopTime="3299.729">
    Mr. Mark L. Rotert 
    Well, I think that the persons who suffer here are the respondents to sexually dangerous persons proceedings. 
    It's not that the State of Illinois believes that it's being grievously wounded by this. 
    It's that we don't think we're going to be able to continue on what we thought was an enlightened path under these circumstances. 
    We believe that in the long run, respondents are less likely to receive treatment and more likely to be criminally prosecuted and convicted under the analysis offered by my opponent. 
    It's not a matter of us not being willing to extend the privilege. 
    The Supreme Court of Illinois, if the Court is familiar with the cases, the Supreme Court of Illinois has been so solicitous of the procedural and substantive rights of the sexually dangerous persons respondent, and if I've indicated to the Court that we're annoyed by the application for privilege, it's not my intent to do so. 
    But we fear that application of the privilege in this context will work a disservice both to the Fifth Amendment and to the people like Terry Allen.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="3299.729" stopTime="3314.156">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    May I just ask you, I suppose of course he could always waive the privilege if he wanted to to avoid that particular danger, but I notice the statute provides that he has a right to counsel at the proceeding. 
    If he's unable to pay for his own lawyer, does the state provide him a lawyer?
speaker="mark_l_rotert" startTime="3314.156" stopTime="3340.573">
    Mr. Mark L. Rotert 
    Absolutely, at the very first opportunity, Justice Stevens. 
    For all these reasons, I urge the Court to consider the Illinois Sexually Dangerous Persons Act to be civil, as does the General Assembly which drafted and enacted it, and as does the Supreme Court which construed it. 
    Based on the idea that it is a civil statute, I ask the Court to follow its own well-established precedent in determining that the Fifth Amendment privilege is not available in such a context.

    Mr. Verlin R. Meinz 
    Thank you, Your Honor, and just briefly, the State argues again about the difficulty of proving a person to be a sexually dangerous person if the respondent in that proceeding is granted a privilege against self-incrimination. 
    They do have a burden beyond a reasonable doubt. 
    They have a lesser burden in a civil mental health proceeding, and yet, an individual in a civil mental health proceeding in Illinois is accorded a privilege against self-incrimination, and the State in fact in that case is obliged to prove its case by its own--

    I can't speak, and counsel has addressed the benevolence hear. 
    They hope to have a program like this for criminal defendants. 
    I speak for Allen more so than I do for other criminal defendants in Illinois, I suppose, but I know I wish that Allen had been prosecuted criminally as opposed to adjudicated--

    Mr. Verlin R. Meinz 
    This would be a generalization. 
    I should point out in that regard that the 2.2 year statistic that was cited by the State is a nationwide statistic, and that statistic simply does not reflect the average length of commitment of a sexually dangerous person in the State of Illinois.

    These offenses here... and we can assume that class X felonies would be involved... would be determinant sentence of between six and thirty years, barring extreme brutality or such and such prior record.
