    Mr. DeFranks, I think you may proceed whenever you are ready.

    Mr. John J. DeFranks 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    The present case on a writ of certiorari to the New York Court of Appeals involves the warrant seizure of 13 videocassette recordings including eight titles alleged to be obscene under New York's obscenity law. 
    The issue as we see it, before this Court, is twofold: firstly, whether the New York Court of Appeals has elevated the standard of proof necessary to support the evidentiary seizure of presumptively protected material, and secondly, whether the Constitution of the United States requires such an elevation in light of the circumstances of the present case and the available First Amendment safeguards. 
    Now, although it is here disputed, I think the record provides firm support for our contention that the standard has in fact been elevated. 
    In the words of the majority, there must be enough proof before the Magistrate to allow him to judge the obscenity of the films and to determine that they are not entitled to constitutional protection.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="142.109" stopTime="144.226">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    And you think that's the function of the jury in the trial of the case?
speaker="john_j_defranks" startTime="144.225" stopTime="198.629">
    Mr. John J. DeFranks 
    Yes, sir. 
    It was mere than imprecise language on the part of the Court of Appeals, and this is clear upon reading the dissent. 
    In the third paragraph of the dissenting opinions he points out to the majority that they have required an unambiguous demonstration of obscenity in order to support the present seizure. 
    He advised them that the standard has been universally rejected by the courts of the United States. 
    The majority responds in footnote 3, not to deny the elevated standard but in essence to confirm it, chiding the dissent for not having provided any case authority for his claim of universal rejection. 
    The dissenter took four more opportunities to point out to the majority that they have elevated the standard of proof. 
    All four references were ignored. 
    They certainly were not denied.

    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Mr. DeFrank, do we have, to read the dissent to understand the majority opinion, do you think?
speaker="john_j_defranks" startTime="202.914" stopTime="287.520">
    Mr. John J. DeFranks 
    No, I don't believe you have to, but the dissent makes it very clear. 
    The majority speaks for itself on the unequivocal standard where they say, we look at this information and we can see it being inculpatory, or another interpretation where it may be less inculpatory. 
    So, the majority makes clear what they are doing. 
    In its legal analysis the Court of Appeals committed a fatal flaw which probably resulted in the elevated standard. 
    They relied upon the scrupulous exactitude requirement of Stanford to raise the standard of proof, yet in this case the Magistrate made the probable... cause determination. 
    He designated only certain films for seizure, and only those films were taken. 
    Further, the term "scrupulous exactitude" seems to be contradictory to the term "probable cause". 
    How can we ever be exact about what supposedly is Appeals probable, and that was the question the Court of was determining. 
    More importantly, the Court of Appeals aired in applying a prior restraint analysis to this case. 
    No prior restraint was demonstrated. 
    No substantial restraint was demonstrated. 
    And in fact, the record indicates that there ware available safeguards to prevent any type of substantial restraint.

    Mr. John J. DeFranks 
    Or even one, if it's the only offering of a movie theater, I would suggest, that might--

    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    There's some suggestion in respondent's brief, that could have been the case here, that this was the only copy or something?
speaker="john_j_defranks" startTime="312.783" stopTime="356.246">
    Mr. John J. DeFranks 
    Indeed, 85 days after the seizure there was an assertion that, "these were our only copies". 
    There was no demonstration, though, that they couldn't have been replaced, that others could not have been made available through the distributor. 
    These videocassettes are mass production items. 
    They come in mass produced boxes with descriptions and pictures on the outside. 
    It's clear they're not unique. 
    We are not talking about a first-run film, in this particular case. 
    It's important to note that no injunction or order against further dissemination was ever contemplated, nor was an order of destruction ever contemplated in this case.

    In preparation for trial he requested, 30 days after the seizure, inspection and/or copying to prepare for trial. 
    It had nothing whatsoever to do with continued dissemination. 
    Of course, it came some time after the seizure. 
    We responded by saying, what you want, if you want inspection you're welcome to come and inspect it any time you want. 
    But he never, upon our response, said, 
    "Well, I have to have copies to disseminate, to provide the public with access to these materials. "

    Mr. John J. DeFranks 
    For the warrant to be sufficient, I would contend that the affiant should indicate that he's reviewed the entire film. 
    He should attempt to describe--

    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor

    Does every element of the crime have to be supported by probable cause?

    Mr. John J. DeFranks 
    --At least an inference.

speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="518.580" stopTime="525.667">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    And I Guess the argument here focuses on whether in fact all the elements of this offense have been met?

    Mr. John J. DeFranks 
    Yes, and I would submit that they have.

    By inference?
speaker="john_j_defranks" startTime="529.369" stopTime="558.888">
    Mr. John J. DeFranks 
    By inference, yes. 
    With respect to the safeguards, I did want to point out one more safeguard because it goes to the question of whether or not something material might have been left out of this film. 
    It was the focus of the Court of Appeals' decision and the focus of my opponent below, at least with regard to one of his arguments, that perhaps one of the elements had not been proved by the affidavit. 
    Perhaps it could not even infer... something, what they were suggesting was something--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="558.888" stopTime="562.940">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    By the way, can you help me find the affidavit?
speaker="john_j_defranks" startTime="562.940" stopTime="573.148">
    Mr. John J. DeFranks 
    --Yes. 
    The affidavits were talking about are in the... attached to the dissenting opinion of the Court of Appeals. 
    They would be at 825.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="573.148" stopTime="578.533">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Thank you.
speaker="john_j_defranks" startTime="578.533" stopTime="702.247">
    Mr. John J. DeFranks 
    As I was saying, the focus of the Court of Appeals was that something might have been left out in this case. 
    We would submit that this Court's decision in Franks versus Delaware operates as the perfect safeguard for that type of complaint, because under Franks he could have demonstrated that something material had been left out, relative to one of the elements of the crime. 
    It would have forced a viewing of the film, based upon his contention that there was a reckless disregard for the truth. 
    It's interesting, in New York we have three reviewing courts concerned with this case. 
    No court, up to this point, has ever seen the materials that are the subject of this petition. 
    We submit that nothing in this case justifies the elevated standard required by the Court of Appeals. 
    There was no prior restraint. 
    There was no substantial restraint. 
    There was no mass seizure as is contended. 
    There was not even a violation of anyone's privacy interest. 
    We submit that in light of those factors, probable cause should be the standard, probable obscenity, and we contend that the affidavits in this case demonstrate probable obscenity as to the three prongs of the Miller test. 
    First, the affidavits are introduced by the statement, 
    "The following describes the content and character of the films. " 
    All the films are denominated as adult films, indicative of their strong sexual content. 
    From eight to 15 sexual acts found offensive by any constitutional standard by the New York Court of Appeals are described in these affidavits. 
    The Court of Appeals had no problem with respect to the second prong of the Miller test. 
    Common sense indicates that where there are so many acts performed in the course of a film, and that these arts must consume a substantial period of time, the film must have as its predominant appeal the prurient interest in sex.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="702.247" stopTime="707.834">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, the affidavits purport to describe each scene in succession.
speaker="john_j_defranks" startTime="707.834" stopTime="737.186">
    Mr. John J. DeFranks 
    Yes, they do, but there are affidavits we are concerned with which do not go in succession either. 
    At one point the affiant says, another scene rather than the following scene, et cetera, Your Honor. 
    These films... these affidavits, excuse me, give not a single clue as to any redeeming literary, artistic, political or scientific value, and indeed none could be expected based on the predominance of the sexual activity in the affidavits.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="737.186" stopTime="750.578">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Mr. DeFranks, assume for a moment that the warrant was not supported by probable cause here. 
    Is it clear from the record that the officers acted in good faith in executing the warrant?
speaker="john_j_defranks" startTime="750.578" stopTime="751.429">
    Mr. John J. DeFranks 
    Yes, it is.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="751.429" stopTime="759.951">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Do you think then that, under the Leon case, that the material could be seized in any event?
speaker="john_j_defranks" startTime="759.951" stopTime="777.311">
    Mr. John J. DeFranks 
    I would think that under Leon this warrant and seizure would be upheld. 
    My problem is that the New York Court of Appeals has rejected the good faith exception to the warrant requirement. 
    Thus, if the case were determined on a good faith basis and I remanded, I'd be a loser.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="777.311" stopTime="778.744">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    As a matter of state law?
speaker="john_j_defranks" startTime="778.744" stopTime="865.183">
    Mr. John J. DeFranks 
    Yes. 
    Given that the Magistrate credited the assertions of the affiant in this case, and there being no reason for anyone to suggest that something was left out of these affidavits, I think it's fair and it's reasonable to conclude that the films demonstrated probable obscenity. 
    Lastly, in conclusion, I assert and we request that affidavits be accepted as a legitimate basis upon Which to found a probable cause determination in an obscenity case. 
    Mandatory viewing of every frame of every film would severely tax an already overladen judiciary. 
    Further, the affidavits can be supplemented by inquiry by the Judge. 
    He can make inquiry of the affiant. 
    This Court's determination that the review of obscenity requires a focused search implies that there should be interrogation, in fact, when the Magistrate has some concern as to the sufficiency of the affidavits. 
    I think more importantly, though, the existence of the safeguards to prevent substantial restraint, in this case render reasonable the use of affidavits to determine probable cause, in conclusion, I ask this Court--

    Mr. John J. DeFranks

    Justice John Paul Stevens

speaker="john_j_defranks" startTime="976.837" stopTime="1004.804">
    Mr. John J. DeFranks 
    All right. 
    I would submit that page... the top paragraph of page A-7, the Court there indicates that the affidavits are ambiguous, equivocal. 
    We submit that to determine probable cause there always is going to be some equivocalness of the information because we can't determine, at least to a prima facie standard or to a proof beyond a reasonable doubt, that the films are obscene.

   Argument of Paul John Cambria, Jr.
speaker="paul_john_cambria_jr" startTime="1089.603" stopTime="1175.043">
    Mr. Paul John Cambria, Jr. 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    I believe that the decision below is simply a reflection, first of all, of the Court's interpretation of its own rules. 
    As you'll notice when you read their decision, they rely substantially upon decisions of the New York State Court of Appeals, and they discuss, and I think in line with Maryland v. Macon, they discuss the federal cases as guidance and they take the federal law of Roaden and Lee and so on from the standpoint of saying that there has to be a presumption of protection under the First amendment, that there is a higher hurdle that must be achieved when we're analyzing this kind of material, but basically th bedrock of this decision is state law. 
    And in answering Mr. DeFranks, he says that they do not, the majority, answer the dissent, and the dissent cites no authority, they cite no state authority. 
    They rely from time to time upon federal cases which I think, when you analyze them, we determine just how low and how easy it has become throughout all these federal jurisdictions to obtain a warrant, to stop a publication which happens naturally in every case where a search warrant is issued. 
    There is a chill that occurs. 
    I think that the language of the Chief Justice in the Roaden case, and speaking on behalf of the Court indicating that when you take a film it's the equivalent of taking a number of books and magazines, and that holds true here, and that's what's happened.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1175.043" stopTime="1178.211">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    What was the chill here, in your view?
speaker="john_j_defranks" startTime="1178.211" stopTime="1234.600">
    Mr. John J. DeFranks 
    The chill here, Your Honor, is the fact that once A... this is not, first of all, an adult Bookstore. 
    This is not a yellow front bookstore. 
    This is a place where films are rented to the public from Stagecoach and Citizen Kane, all the way to some of films that are listed here in this piece of litigation. 
    And so, when someone is given a search warrant and they take not simply one copy for evidentiary purposes but all the copies that they could find, and in this case you'll see and the record shows that they took two copies when they found two copies, and they took one copy when they found one copy, and the police had already copied themselves all of these tapes prior to the time they executed their search warrant. 
    They had no reason to take these particular tapes if they were simply interested in evidence versus interested in something beyond evidence which would necessitate them taking all the copies that were available.

    Did you make this argument to the New York Court of Appeals?
speaker="paul_john_cambria_jr" startTime="1256.279" stopTime="1311.395">
    Mr. Paul John Cambria, Jr. 
    We did not make an argument, a prior adversary hearing argument, because we don't believe that prior adversary hearing is... this isn't the Heller case, I submit, because in Heller this Court didn't do away with the necessity of the scrupulous exactitude. 
    It just said that once the Magistrate has been satisfied and once the higher hurdle has been achieved, if you accomplish a mass seizure then you must give a post-seizure hearing. 
    But, it doesn't do away with the initial step which requires the scrutiny, and what this Court said below is that, we think there are three parts to the test. 
    There isn't just one part. 
    And this particular police officer concerned himself... and frankly he wasn't a police officer, he was someone from the District Attorney's office, he concerned himself only with attempting to describe the sexual conduct part, the second part of the Miller test. 
    He did nothing to address the other two parts of the test, and I think that this Court--

    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Well, under Illinois versus Gates, doesn't the Court ordinarily defer to reasonable inferences drawn by the issuing magistrate, even though they aren't the only inferences that might be drawn?
speaker="paul_john_cambria_jr" startTime="1326.323" stopTime="1337.676">
    Mr. Paul John Cambria, Jr. 
    --I think the two things, yes, I think that under Illinois versus Gates that is a fair reading of the opinion there. 
    Secondly, that has not yet been applied in the State of New York and I reaffirm the fact that we have--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="1337.676" stopTime="1346.718">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    So, it's your position that we just shouldn't apply the Illinois versus Gates standards of reviewing what the Magistrate did, is that your position?
speaker="paul_john_cambria_jr" startTime="1346.718" stopTime="1423.932">
    Mr. Paul John Cambria, Jr. 
    --Yes, and particularly in this First Amendment area. 
    If these cases mean anything, that were decided by this Court over a long stretch of our history, saying, "scrupulous exactitude", and "higher hurdle" and "focus searchingly on the question" and so on, all of those words, if they mean anything then it seems to me that what we don't do is, we don't fill in the blanks and assume that the other two prongs exist, as this Court last term was not willing to fill in the blanks in the Spokane Arcade case. 
    There the argument was made on behalf of the Government that prongs B and C supply... or the test that was given there in Washington... supply prong A, and that fills the bill, and this Court took the position that... I think I'm accurately reflecting it... that they're separate, that they're independent, that you can't have one slosh over, if you will, onto the other. 
    And what the Court below said was, and I submit this is the most important part of it, you must pay attention and deference to all three parts of the test. 
    Now, when we look at this affidavit, this particular investigator from the District Attorney's office never even claims that he read the obscenity statute, that he even knew that there were three parts to it, that he even appreciated that there was more than one--

    Mr. John J. DeFranks

Delaware, don't I have to show that there's a reckless disregard for the truth or that there's an intentional misstatement of the facts? 
    Now, if I'm in a position where they have a person who goes in, who doesn't even recite in his affidavit that he's familiar with the fact that there are three prongs to statute, then how can I attribute to that individual the reckless disregard for sensitivity to the three prongs, or an intentional statement on the part of that individual that they left out information which would have borne upon the other two prongs of the test?

    I don't believe that that's so, Your Honor. 
    I believe that when you analyze this decision, that this case is one State Court decision after another that does not have to rely upon, an does not rely upon federal precedent in order to be self-standing.

speaker="paul_john_cambria_jr" startTime="1610.936" stopTime="1667.257">
    Mr. Paul John Cambria, Jr. 
    I agree, and I said that in my petition, in my opposition to the petition, because when you look at this case and you look at the main cases, the Podbora case, it relies on another New York State case and that New York State case chronicles all the state decisions. 
    And when you look at the opening salvos, the state Constitution is involved, all the state cases are discussed, and those are the things that the Court dwells on, the Court of Appeals. 
    They don't dwell on the federal cases and say that it's a federal standard. 
    They use the language of their own cases and they say it's a state standard. 
    And, I think what the problem is, is when the court found there was an ambiguity here, and the ambiguity was because there was no addressing of the other two prongs of the test, and they said that in this particular very important area where we've used all these words, that they don't consider platitudes like "scrupulous exactitude" and so on, that in this area we can assume and conjecture the various elements, that... I am sorry.

    Where is the clearer statement in the case which we require to go off on the adequate and independent state grounds, in light of the Court's language dealing with application of the Fourth Amendment in the citation of Roaden, Marcus versus the search warrant, Stanford versus Texas, Maryland versus Macon? 
    There is no clear and plain statement that the Court was relying on state law.

    Mr. Paul John Cambria, Jr. 
    I think that when we analyze the decision at A-4 of the record, they start off by talking about it in parallel terms. 
    They say, New York Constitution, Article 1, Section 12, they cite that first. 
    They then go on to the Fourth Amendment. 
    They talk about reasonable cause under Article--

    Mr. Paul John Cambria, Jr. 
    --Well, I think that it meets it in this sense. 
    I think that Michigan versus Long says, and later on decisions of this Court, Upton, in the concurrence in Upton, indicated that it would be better, and there should be a definitive statement, so a lot of time is not wasted by reviews back and forth. 
    But I don't believe that this Court said that if, in fact, the State Court does not specifically make a statement but makes it quite clear from their determination that the federal cases are guideposts and benchmarks but not what they're relying on in making the decision. 
    They really use the federal cases for propositions such as, items are presumptively protected, or there's a higher standard for books than there are for weapons.

    Take a look at A-4 and A-5, Mr. Cambria, the sentence beginning in the... it says, 
    "Thus, in applying the Fourth Amendment to such items the Court must act with "scrupulous exactitude",. " 
    and it cites Stanford versus Texas, a case from this Court, see also Maryland versus Macon, a case from this Court.
speaker="paul_john_cambria_jr" startTime="1781.696" stopTime="1855.993">
    Mr. Paul John Cambria, Jr. 
    Yes, I think that that's true in connection with that general principle which no one disagrees with, I hope, that there must be scrupulous exactitude. 
    But in fashioning what the Magistrate's duty is down below they rely specifically and only on the New York State cases. 
    They say here, and the nub of the decision is, the Magistrate below, given all the platitudes of scrupulous exactitude and other things, the Magistrate below should have gotten involved. 
    It could have been the simplest thing, simply ask a question. 
    Would it be too much to ask that we had a procedure where the Magistrate simply said to the police officer, did you leave anything out? 
    Was there dialogue? 
    Was there a story? 
    I mean, a few pointed questions like that. 
    Affidavits would be sufficient. 
    There wouldn't be an, bogging down of the warrant process. 
    It would just be true to the New York State precedent by saying, you've got to get involved, we can't just assume that these points are established. 
    We can't assume that these other facts will be established. 
    Because, really, when you look at the three-part test of Miller, the most important and the most difficult parts, R-A and R-C, the middle part is the easiest part.

    Mr. Paul John Cambria, Jr. 
    Well, I think that we have to define what it is and what happened here is... forgetting the Miller case, taking the statute which the Court refers to, 235, it incorporates the definition of Miller.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1874.455" stopTime="1883.145">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    All the things you were referring to from the Miller holding had to do with decision on the merits of the case, had nothing to do with the warrants, isn't that so?
speaker="paul_john_cambria_jr" startTime="1883.145" stopTime="1926.640">
    Mr. Paul John Cambria, Jr. 
    If we look at... well, I think that interprets that statutes and you have to have... when you're finding probable cause you have to start somewhere and I submit, Mr. Chief Justice, you must start with the statute and say, what are the elements that I as a judge am attempting to find probable cause to issue a warrant for. 
    And once you do that, you say there are three, and in this case I'm submitting that the court below is recognizing the two most important elements are the first one and the last one. 
    Everybody can describe the sexual conduct. 
    That's easy. 
    Butwhere the judge is the most important critical factor is analyzing the pruriency part and analyzing the value part, and we see that when we look at our cases.

speaker="paul_john_cambria_jr" startTime="1974.821" stopTime="2203.785">
    Mr. Paul John Cambria, Jr. 
    --There's no case which says that. 
    It was left open in Lee Art, and it's been talked about a number of times in other cases but there's no case that I know of from this Court that says that you must see the film. 
    As far as I can determine the circuits are everywhere, in the sense that if we look at a catalogue of what some of the circuits have done as far as sufficiency of warrants... I mean, we can find the Fifth Circuit, for example, saying... and the Second Circuit saying that a simple picture and a few words description uttered by a police officer in an affidavit is enough to issue a search warrant. 
    Now, I submit that absolutely in no way takes into account the first and the third prong of the test, and I'm not saying there should be guilt or innocence, it shouldn't be a screenplay attached to the warrant, shouldn't be any of those things. 
    But we must in some way discuss these prongs because they are part of the offense involved, and in addition to that if we're going to be true to all these statements we've made about the higher hurdle which must be achieved, or the scrupulous exactitude, then what does it mean if it can be satisfied by simply saying, there is a picture, I saw it, it shows this sexual conduct, and there was a brief description on the box and therefore the warrant should be issued. 
    I submit that what this case below has meant, what it does mean, is that it's the procedure which is important. 
    If we take this procedure and we applied it to Tropic of Cancer or Capricorn, and I made reference to this in my brief, if we took this procedure and applied it to that, we could take the language that you find at page 145 of the decision written by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in Capricorn and Tropic of Cancer, and in that case the words of the Judge were that, 
    "Practically everything that the world loosely regards as sin is detailed in vivid, lurid, salacious language of smut, prostitution and dirt, and all of it is related without the slightest expression of an idea of abandonment, consistent with the general tenor of the book even human excrement is dwelt upon in the dirtiest words. " 
    "The author conduct the reader through sex orgies and perversions of sex organs and always in the base language of the bawdy house. " 
    "Nothing has the grace of purity or goodness. " 
    I submit that this... that the cases that we cited in our brief, talking about the low threshold that's emanated because of no stringent decision that there ought to be in this area, would take that language which was written by a federal judge in the Ninth Circuit and would say that that was enough of a description of Tropic of Cancer and Capricorn, Henry Miller novels which are all accepted now, to make them the subject of a search warrant for purposes of scrutinizing them with regard to obscenity. 
    It would be the same way if we paid no deference to the first and third prongs of the test, if I were to review Hair or one of the other accepted Broadway plays and just describe the sexual conduct that I saw with no reference to the music, no reference to the story line or the political satire, we'd be in the exact same position and I submit that a judge, following this laid-back approach, this lax approach, could simply issue a warrant, and where would I be under a Franks versus Delaware argument to say that the person who reviewed Hair, for example, didn't read the obscenity statute, never declared that they did. 
    Usually officers in their affidavits may say they have a background, if they're in drug work and they're asking for a search warrant with regard to drugs, they iterate that they had some kind of experience in the past so that you'd have some way of putting what they say into context. 
    We don't have that here, and if I gave you an affidavit from Hair, untaught as--

    Mr. Paul John Cambria, Jr. 
    I suppose that if you were a district attorney and you murdered an author because you were trying to silence what he was writing at the time, that that could be a First Amendment matter and we could have an argument with regard to it.

    --Yes.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="2319.543" stopTime="2343.291">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Because the question presented in the cert petition, I'm trying to figure out some way where I don't have to decide whether there's probable cause in all these affidavits, because that doesn't seem to me to be something I should have to do in a case like this. 
    Do you agree the issue is just what standards should be applied in reviewing the affidavits that we have to decide under the questions presented, and if so, do you think the Court of Appeals applied... required more than a showing of probable cause?
speaker="paul_john_cambria_jr" startTime="2343.291" stopTime="2383.933">
    Mr. Paul John Cambria, Jr. 
    I think that the question here is, under New York State, as they perceive their laws, their statutes, their laws, their cases, did the Judge here, given these facts, have a sufficient basis to try to make a probable cause determination and only a probable cause determination. 
    The Court says on page A-5, consistent with these rules, the task of the issuing Magistrate in this case was not to decide guilt or innocence but to determine in a preliminary way from the information submitted and available to him, whether there was probable cause to believe that the material to be seized was obscene within the tripartite definition of the statute.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="2383.933" stopTime="2402.228">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    I recognize that, buy what about the sentence at the bottom of A-4, because there was seizure based upon ideas, that was based upon ideas, they contain... there is a higher standard for evaluation of a warrant application seeking to seize such things as books and films as opposed to--
speaker="paul_john_cambria_jr" startTime="2402.228" stopTime="2469.621">
    Mr. Paul John Cambria, Jr. 
    I think what that means is this: as this Court said in Roaden and Heller and Lee Art and all the cases we've talked about today, there's a higher standard in a sense that the judge must focus searchingly on the question of obscenity, and even this Court used the word, on the question of obscenity, in Marcus, as opposed to probable obscenity. 
    So, what we're saying, I think is what we've said in all these First Amendment... all these search and seizure cases that the Court has decided. 
    There is a higher hurdle in the sense of analyzing probable cause, because we do require this scrupulous exactitude and we do require it at the seizure stage. 
    That's the would be involved. 
    Other than that, only time the judge we'd have a decision on the merits. 
    So, Roaden and Lee and all these cases which dealt with search and seizure couldn't have meant anything else except that in restraining the material ex parte which is what happened by the search warrant, there must be a higher hurdle, not guilt or innocence but a higher hurdle in how you evaluate probable cause. 
    So that it must--

    Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. 
    --You rely on Roaden, and my recollection of that case is that there was no warrant involved. 
    They arrested the theater owner and took the film with them.
speaker="paul_john_cambria_jr" startTime="2479.744" stopTime="2481.179">
    Mr. Paul John Cambria, Jr. 
    --That's true. 
    I say Roaden--
speaker="lewis_f_powell_jr" startTime="2481.179" stopTime="2482.196">
    Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. 
    That case is--
speaker="paul_john_cambria_jr" startTime="2482.196" stopTime="2484.048">
    Mr. Paul John Cambria, Jr. 
    --Well, I take this position--
speaker="lewis_f_powell_jr" startTime="2484.048" stopTime="2486.048">
    Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. 
    --several times--
speaker="paul_john_cambria_jr" startTime="2486.048" stopTime="2561.112">
    Mr. Paul John Cambria, Jr. 
    --Roaden, in the sense that Roaden seems to chronicle all the cases in this area, because Roaden takes us back to Marcus and says we have a higher hurdle. 
    It then talks about Lee Art Theater which was a case with a warrant where there was a perfunctory or a conclusory showing, and so it's really a number of cases all together, and in New York it's a whole number of separate cases all together. 
    Roaden didn't have a warrant but Lee Art had a warrant. 
    Marcus had a warrant. 
    A Quantity of Books had a warrant. 
    Heller had a warrant. 
    And in all of those cases the Court always said that in this preliminary warrant procedure we must have this higher hurdle, and that's all the Court was saying below, was that we must have this higher procedure not to establish guilt or innocence but have the Magistrate make the findings and have an adequate basis to make the findings, and I believe that's all they're saying. 
    They're not saying, we've got to try the case before we ever have a trial, in essence, that we do it. 
    And the procedure that they suggest here is not elaborate. 
    It's not cumbersome. 
    It's simply, if you're going to rely on affidavits as an issuing magistrate, get involved. 
    Ask some questions when there are ambiguities, under our state log of cases. 
    Ask some questions. 
    It's as simple as that. 
    I think we're entitled to that.

    --May I ask you another question that puzzles me about this litigation. 
    I wonder what you accomplish by your Motion to Suppress. 
    Supposing you won your Motion to Suppress and they suppressed the stuff pursuant to a warrant, and then you still go to trial. 
    Can't they just go rent the movie and put it in evidence?

    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Respondent... these people who made up the affidavit know what the movies are, and I guess they're on the market. 
    I don't understand why you have to have such a big fight to suppress this stuff.
speaker="paul_john_cambria_jr" startTime="2596.282" stopTime="2597.218">
    Mr. Paul John Cambria, Jr. 
    --Well, the problem--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="2597.218" stopTime="2598.968">

    From either side, I mean, I don't know what you gained.
speaker="paul_john_cambria_jr" startTime="2598.968" stopTime="2622.584">
    Mr. Paul John Cambria, Jr. 
    --What we gained is this: the minute that that warrant hits that store, which again is not the yellow front store, that sends a chill up the spine of those individuals that's heard from coast to coast, and I mean that with all sincerity, because each time this warrant hits a store and some presumptively protected material is taken off the shelf pursuant to the warrant, that constitutes a chill which every one of us--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="2622.584" stopTime="2628.653">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Would it be as much of a chill as being found guilty or the basis of... I assume some of it--
speaker="paul_john_cambria_jr" startTime="2628.653" stopTime="2706.135">
    Mr. Paul John Cambria, Jr. 
    --Your Honor, that issue was brought up in the Hair case, Southeastern Promotions, and of course this Court found there that the punishment after the crime such as in penal law situations is one thing, but punishment pre-crime which is the restraint situation is something more onerous, and I take the position that it is. 
    And I submit what happens, is, this procedure is important to us, and it's very important as to how it affects not just these books, magazines, films, what have you, but all the others, the Tropic of Cancers of tomorrow, the Hairs and other cases of tomorrow. 
    How low can the threshold be, is what it amounts to. 
    In New York this Court has said that the Magistrate should be involved. 
    There should be this focused inquiry and so on. 
    I submit that's fair, it's reasonable, and we're all entitled to it, and I ask you to affirm the decision below based upon the fact that we are entitled to that much since it will not stifle the criminal process-- 
    It will not in any way hamper prosecutions. 
    It will simply protect us from overzealous individuals who come forth with warrants based upon applications like these where the Magistrate clearly was not involved and wasn't true to the New York State decisions that he's mandated to be bound by. 
    I thank you very much.

    Mr. John J. DeFranks 
    I would like to just make one point, with regard to Franks versus Delaware. 
    If the affiant were to leave out the music of Hair, the dancing of another particular film, that would qualify as a reckless disregard, he couldn't be faithful to a performance and leave out something like that, and that's the way the third prong is proven, by omission. 
    Even when the Magistrate reviews the film there's nothing that lights up the screen and says there are are no literary, artistic, political of scientific value. 
    It's one that's done by omission.
