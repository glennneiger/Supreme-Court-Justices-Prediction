    Mr. Bruce N. Kuhlik 
    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    This case is here on certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. 
    The decision of the Court of Appeals requires the Farmers Home Administration to reopen and accept applications now for an emergency loan program intended to tide farmers over the immediate difficulties posed by heavy rains in north Florida in 1973. 
    Such a result is wholly inconsistent with the purpose of the emergency loan program which was to enable farmers to make good their losses on crops that were damaged at that time and then to resume their operations with regular credit from other sources. 
    The loan program provided substantial government benefits, including an outright grant of $5,000 to each farmer at an interest rate of one percent. 
    These funds, however, could not be used to produce new crops in 1974 or subsequent years, but only to reimburse farmers for their 1973 losses so that they could remain in business at that time. 
    At this late date, the relief ordered by the Court of Appeals would amount to a government give-away to persons who could not reasonably have unmet needs from so long ago. 
    The Court of Appeals decision is insupportable. 
    It bars the agency from enforcing a valid regulation that established April 2, 1974 as the deadline for applying for these loans. 
    That result conflicts with this Court's many cases that forbid application of estoppel against the government, at least absent extraordinary circumstances that are not present here. 
    Moreover, the basis of the Court of Appeals decision that the agency violated a self-imposed obligation to publicize the loan program is plainly wrong. 
    Finally, neither this purported violation nor the violations found by the district court could support an application of estoppel in this case, especially on the classified basis ordered by the courts below. 
    Heavy rains struck north Florida in early April of 1973. 
    The area was declared a disaster area a short time later which allowed farmers to apply for emergency loans from a number of government agencies, including the FMHA, the Small Business Administration. 
    At the time FMHA loans carried an interest rate of five percent. 
    It could only be made to farmers who were unable to obtain credit elsewhere and they carried no forgiveness principal, no grant aspect to the loans. 
    Loans from the SBA, on the other hand, carried an interest rate of one percent, included a substantial forgiveness of principal, and could be made without a showing of unavailability of credit elsewhere. 
    During the time that the initial application period was open for these loans, a number of farmers obtained SBA emergency loans, they obtained regular, operating loans from the FMHA. 
    In January 1974, however, Congress passed Public Law 93-237, which included a grandfather clause extending the favorable terms that were previously available from the SBA, and also had been available from the FMHA for earlier disasters, to disasters up through April 20, 1973, a time period that included the north Florida flooding that is at issue in this case. 
    At the time, in the statute, the Congress directed the Secretary of Agriculture to extend for 90 days the application period for applying for loans under this new, more favorable emergency loan program. 
    Accordingly, the Secretary promulgated a regulation establishing April 2, 1974 as the deadline for applying for emergency loans under this program. 
    The deadline was published in the Federal Register. 
    At the same time, the Secretary also promulgated a regulation providing that publicity of the provisions of Public Law 93-237 would be provided to the local news media and when he issued the staff instruction that first embodied this requirement, the Secretary issued to the state FMHA officials a sample press release to be distributed to the local media. 
    In fact, in this case, that sample press release was distributed to the state FMHA officials and by them to the local county FMHA officials. 
    It was forwarded by the local officials to the local media. 
    It was, in fact, carried in at least two local newspapers. 
    Respondent filed this lawsuit in August of 1976, well over two years after the expiration of the application deadline. 
    With the exception of the name class representative and a few other farmers, no class member had applied for a loan, either before or after expiration of the loan application deadline. 
    All of the persons who had, in fact, applied for loans had done so before the deadline and had received emergency loans under the program. 
    Following a bench trial in 1981, the district court order the Secretary to reopen the loan program and to accept applications at that time without regard to their untimeliness under the April 2, 1974 deadline. 
    Reaching this conclusion, the district court relied primarily on publicity that was given... or lack of publicity that was given to the earlier, less favorable loan program, and in particular the district court relied on Section 1832.3 of the regulations which provided that the Secretary would make such public announcements as appear to be appropriate. 
    The Court of Appeals affirmed, though it did not rely on that regulation but a later one, the one that provided the FMHA would inform the news media of Public Law 93-237. 
    Reaching the conclusion that the FMHA violated this regulation, the Court of Appeals did not consider the fact that the sample press release that had accompanied the regulation was, in fact, distributed to the local news media. 
    The Court of Appeals distinguished this Court's decision in Schweiker versus Hansen which the Court had refused to allow an estoppel against the government on the ground primarily that this case does not involve an adverse impact on the public fist. 
    In reaching this conclusion, the Court of Appeals failed to consider the $5,000 grant aspect of the loan program and the below-market interest rate of one percent that accompanied the loans. 
    We submit that the Court of Appeals decision is wrong for a number of independent reasons. 
    We would point out that the fundamental error of the Court of Appeals was that it failed to recognize the limitations that sovereign immunity places on judicial remedies for alleged governmental wrongdoing. 
    It is quite clear the courts, once they find a violation of some regulation or other provision by government personnel, are not free to roam at will and impose whatever remedies they feel are equitable against the government.

    Mr. Kuhlik, can I ask you right there, one of the things that is troubling about the case is its age. 
    It is such an old case and I guess it took about five years just to get to trial even which is kind of puzzling to me, but, anyway, supposing the case had been brought promptly, within 30 days after the deadline, they just discovered it and so forth.

    It is true that very few applications were made, however, we don't believe the reasons for that are relevant. 
    I think that it is clear from the record that during the initial loan application period the loan terms were simply were not sufficiently favorable to attract enough farmers. 
    They went to the SBA to obtain the loans that were available from that agency for physical losses and they determined to use regular operating loans which were not in any real relevant respect less favorable than the emergency loans at that time.

speaker="bruce_n_kuhlik" startTime="730.498" stopTime="1016.375">
    Mr. Bruce N. Kuhlik 
    That is right. 
    I would like to point out that the statute, Public Law 93-237, that established these favorable loan terms made no mention of publicity whatsoever. 
    And, the FMHA... The Secretary determined to provide a certain quantum of publicity and that publicity is stated in the sample press release which is at pages 50 to 51-A of the Appendix to the Petition. 
    And, that sample press release did specify the loan application deadline. 
    It was forwarded to the news media. 
    And, I submit that this sample press release constitutes a contemporaneous construction of the regulations by the agency that promulgated them and that there were was no warrant for the Court of Appeals to suppose that there had been a violation of this regulation. 
    We would also note that without reaching the main estoppel question in the case that there can be no estoppel here because there has not been an adequate showing of reasonable reliance, certainly not on behalf of the class as a whole nor on behalf of any individual class member. 
    The fact is that regardless of whether or not this particular press release could have said more it did make clear the key fact that there was a new emergency loan program. 
    It was up to farmers to make further inquiries if they needed emergency credit under the terms of that program. 
    And, moreover and perhaps more fundamentally, the complete terms of the emergency loan program were published in full in the Federal Register. 
    And, as this Court's cases such as Community Health Services and Federal Crop Insurance Corporation against Merrill make clear one cannot support an estoppel against the government in a case where the true facts are there for the reading in the Federal Register of the statutes at large. 
    Most fundamentally, the Court of Appeals decision clearly conflicts with this Court's many cases establishing that the government cannot be estopped from enforcing a valid statutory or regulatory condition of the receipt of public benefits. 
    It is exactly what the Court of Appeals did here whether it was willing to admit it or not. 
    It has barred the government from enforcing a valid regulatory deadline that was promulgated pursuant to the Secretary's substantive rulemaking authority and has not been suggested by Respondents or any court that that regulation was defectively promulgated. 
    The Court of Appeals has barred us from enforcing that deadline on the basis of alleged misconduct by governmental agents and that is an estoppel and that is what this Court's cases plainly make clear simply cannot be done. 
    The Court of Appeals gave a number of reason for disregarding this Court's estoppel cases, but in our view, none of them are substantial. 
    For example, the Court of Appeals on remand from this Court purported to draw a distinction between acts and failures to act which we believe is irrelevant, and, similarly, the distinction between the fault of one employee and several also are irrelevant under this Court's cases. 
    The Court of Appeals purported to rely quite heavily on the Accardi doctrine, that agencies must follow their own regulations. 
    We would submit, however, the doctrine is irrelevant for the following reasons: The issue in this case is not whether an agency must follow its procedures. 
    Of course, it should. 
    The question is what remedies are available when an agency has not followed its procedures. 
    And, in all of the Accardi line of cases, the Court invalidated agency action whose validity depended on following the precise procedure that was found to have been violated. 
    It was for simply a matter of logic quite a short step to say that the ultimate agency action was invalid. 
    But, here, as I was mentioning earlier, the substantive validity of the loan application deadline was not made to depend in any way on the quantum of publicity that was given by the agency or in compliance with the regulation that established... compliance with the regulation that provided for publicity in the local news media. 
    I think it is quite clear under the Court's estoppel cases that it would be inconsistent with well-established notions of sovereign immunity to deny a valid legal defense to the government based only on the Court's own notions of what would be equitable in a particular case. 
    The Court of Appeals also--

    Mr. Bruce N. Kuhlik 
    I doubt very much that any of them do. 
    There is two different kinds of notice here though that it is important to separate. 
    There is notice of the application deadline which we contend, as long as that was provided in the Federal Register, and, therefore, as long as the loan application deadline was properly promulgated under the APA, as long as that notice was given, then that deadline is a valid legal requirement that cannot be set aside by the courts. 
    The separate question is the notice of the loan program as a whole and we would simply submit, as I have been saying, that the amount of publicity given to that governmental program is simply irrelevant to whether the government can enforce the application deadline.

    Mr. Bruce N. Kuhlik 
    --Well, I think the record shows a couple of things. 
    First, that the emergency did not turn out to be as serious as people expected originally. 
    It also shows again that the original FMHA loan terms were simply not all that favorable and that people went to other sources to obtain loans and by the time that this program was reopened in early 1974 with more favorable terms, very few people had emergency credit needs at that point. 
    But, again, that question, we believe, is irrelevant to the determination of this case. 
    Finally, the Court of Appeals attempted to seek support for its decision under the APA. 
    They suggested, I believe, that the regulation could be waived and that it would be reasonable to do so here. 
    The point isn't whether... If this regulation were waivable, the point would not be whether the Court's own notion of equity supported a waiver in this case, but whether a failure to waive would be arbitrary and capricious. 
    And, we would submit that given the emergency nature of the loan program, that there wouldn't have been any basis for reaching such a conclusion here. 
    But, moreover, this is not a waivable regulation. 
    There is nothing in the regulation to suggest that it is.

    The Secretary has long taken the position that this sort of regulation cannot be waived administratively under any circumstances. 
    We would submit that that provides a further reason why the Court of Appeals could not rely on the APA to require a waiver in this case.

   Argument of Theodore L. Tripp, Jr.
speaker="theodore_l_tripp_jr" startTime="1399.031" stopTime="1558.934">
    Mr. Theodore L. Tripp, Jr. 
    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    Justice Stevens, I think, has hit upon the issue in this case and that is that the agency asks this Court to rule that a federal court is powerless to provide a remedy for the gross failure of an entire agency to provide notice required by binding regulation. 
    We believe that the Administrative Procedure Act mandates the use of equitable remedies, to compel agency action, in this case notice, which was not provided, and to set aside agency action, in this case, the application of the administrative deadline, until the agency observes the procedures required by law. 
    First of all, this is not a challenge to the contents of a press release. 
    The district court made findings which I believe are crucial to understand the context of the issue before this Court. 
    This was a natural event which gave rise to losses and under 7 USC 1961 provided that natural citizens who were full-time farmers, who were engaged in farming activities and suffered losses, were entitled to apply for government benefits. 
    That program had been statutorily proceeding for many years until 1972. 
    In 1972, the Secretary of Agriculture decided for executive budgetary reasons that he would decrease the availability of those programs that he felt was least essential. 
    That is the backdrop for the enactment of Public Law 93-24 which amended Section 1961 and instead of saying the Secretary may make loans available in these circumstances, the language was changed by Congress to provide that the Secretary shall make those loans available. 
    We believe that at the time Congress made that change Congress was aware that the Farmers Home Administration had binding regulations, Justice Rehnquist, that required certain types of notice be afforded so that the agency would carry out this statutory mandate to make loan benefits available to farmers who suffer loss.

    Not directly to the existence of the regulation. 
    The legislative history indicates that the Congress intended to change it from a discretionary function, may make loans available, to a mandatory function, precisely so that the loan benefits would be made available. 
    We would suggest that to allow an application of an administrative deadline cannot be considered, therefore, in the abstract.

    It has been an on-going deadline that applies not just to this disaster but to each and every disaster. 
    They have said 90 days for property damage and nine months for production losses. 
    It is not a regulation that only applies to us. 
    But, in 1973, when Congress believed that eligible farmers were not making application because of confusion over the benefits, they, in 93-237, required an extension for 90 days. 
    We believe that was a minimum extension and did not mean by Congress you may not extend it any further.

    Mr. Theodore L. Tripp, Jr. 
    No, sir, I do not believe that Congress has spoken again to that subject. 
    The notice, however, that was required to be provided by the Farmers Home Administration was not simply that they advise the news media of the provisions of 93-237. 
    The district court found that there were other specific types of notice required to be provided to state and county USDA defense board chairmen, to other agricultural lenders, to the county governing bodies for the purpose of insuring that during this administratively set application period those who were eligible would have an opportunity to come in an apply. 
    In each and every instance, the district court found, and we do not understand the Solicitor General to dispute, that the Farmers Home Administration breached a mandatory, self-imposed duty to provide notice to eligible farmers. 
    It is in that context that the district court considered the validity of the 90-day deadline. 
    We believe that the district court found that these farmers were clearly prejudiced by the failure of the Farmers Home Administration to provide this notice. 
    The district court found that more farmers would have applied had the Farmers Home Administration provided the notice, and, in fact, the only loans that were afforded were afforded as a result of the fortuity that Mr. Payne received a letter from Senator Gurney which outlined the program. 
    He took it to his Farmers Home Administration county supervisor, who at that time... this was now some two or three weeks before the 90-day deadline that Congress required. 
    At that time the county Farmers Home Administration supervisors were not even aware that Congress had enacted this extension. 
    To suggest, as the Solicitor does, that the publication of these regulations somehow gives notice to Carbie Ellie, as I suggest, contradicted by the evidence in this case which says that the farmers went to the Farmers Home Administration county officials and were affirmatively told there are no emergency loan benefits for which to apply. 
    It is rebutted by the district court's findings that the efforts of the Farmers Home Administration to make such public announcements as appear appropriate consisted entirely of one press release which stated that the deadline was some 70 days hence, when, in fact, there was a nine-month application period for crop loss. 
    And, participation in the Live Oak meeting at which farmers who went for the express purpose of inquiring about the availability of emergency loans were told if you are a farmer there is nothing for you to apply for because there are no benefits available to farmers. 
    In fact, the Farmers Home Administration had actual knowledge of existing FMHA borrowers who suffered losses as a result of this disaster and who needed these emergency loans. 
    They visited those farms and they did not inform the farmers of the availability of the FMHA loan benefits. 
    We believe under these circumstances, the Administrative Procedure Act has empowered the federal court to remedy this failure to act.

    Mr. Theodore L. Tripp, Jr. 
    --The third distinction that I would suggest, Justice Rehnquist, between the Merrill case and this case is that the Merrill case did not present a situation where an agency has, through misrepresentation or inaction, frustrated a congressional intent. 
    I believe that the clear... the circuit court and the district court all found that the clear intent behind the statutory scheme which established the right of emergency loan benefits and these farmers was frustrated and, in fact, was completely nullified by the agency's refusal to provide this notice. 
    So, while the Merrill court was presented with a situation where, if the relief had been granted, then government monies would be expended for a purpose contrary to statute or regulations. 
    Here, you have a situation where applicants are eligible for benefits, where the benefits are going to be spent for purposes intended by Congress and where the only thing that is thwarting the intent of Congress in this case is the agency's failure to provide the notice required by the regulations.

speaker="theodore_l_tripp_jr" startTime="2233.014" stopTime="2425.906">
    Mr. Theodore L. Tripp, Jr. 
    Justice O'Connor, there are four aspects to the publicity regulations. 
    First, the notice to the state and county USDS defense board individuals and we had direct testimony from a member of the board who testified that the Farmers Home Administration did not apprise him of the existence of this emergency loan program. 
    With regard to the duty to inform other agricultural lenders, we had the testimony of the Chairman of the Board of the Federal Land Bank, Mr. Welch, who testified that he was a farmer, he needed emergency loans, and he was not aware of it. 
    And, nobody ever told the primary commercial agricultural lender in this area. 
    With regard to the requirement that they notify the county governing bodies, I believe that the record shows a stipulation that that notice was not afforded. 
    So, I would suggest to the Court that there is certainly confident and substantial evidence and it is not clearly erroneous to suppose that both the initial application period and the extended application period required by Congress, those four specific types of notice were not, in fact, afforded. 
    And, the testimony showed from the farmers that when they attempted to determine what benefits might be available, they went first to the FMHA and were told that nothing was there for which to apply and then consulted with other agricultural lenders, USDA officials, and county governing bodies. 
    So, the failure to provide all of those notices, we believe, is supported in the record and shows that as a result these eligible benificiaries were deprived not only of the notice but of the opportunity to apply for these benefits. 
    I would like to point out that we are not dealing here with an order which requires the expenditure of funds. 
    The district court awarded only the ability to apply. 
    Consistent with this Court's holdings that it keenly observe the requirements, the valid requirement for charging the public fist, the Farmers Home Administration is directed to apply the eligibility requirements and the restrictions on the utilization of those funds when and if any eligible farmers can demonstrate their ability, their entitlement to receive the funds. 
    So, we are not overriding in this case any statutory regulation with regard to the expenditure of these benefits. 
    We are not, unlike Heckler or the other cases in which this Court has been asked to require expenditures of funds which have lapsed or no longer available. 
    This is a revolving fund. 
    The monies were available in 1973 and they continue to be available today. 
    Finally, we believe that--

    Not under 93-237. 
    There was in the initial loan application period and if you could obtain credit elsewhere you were not entitled to participate in that program. 
    But, as amended, that program removed the requirement that you show the non-availability of credit elsewhere. 
    So, we believe it is the event of loss to which Congress directed itself and not whether or not you have a current financial hardship. 
    In fact, if you look at the regulations of the Farmers Home Administration, you will see that you are authorized under the regulations to spend those monies for seed, for fertilizer, for rent, for family expenses, for a variety of things that are not necessarily tied directly to the waters and the damage caused by the waters.

    Mr. Theodore L. Tripp, Jr. 
    The interest rate initially under the first application period was five percent which would have been the same as operating loans. 
    We submit... The district court found by the way that the prejudice in the switching and there was testimony that when a farmer came to inquire about emergency loans, he was switched to an operating loan, which also drew interest at five percent. 
    However, the more beneficial terms of 93-237, which reduced the interest rate to one percent and which provided for the $5,000 forgiveness, was that if someone had applied for an emergency loan during the original application period and had been turned down, they would have received and would have been required to receive under the Farmers Home Administration regulations individual letter notice, saying we now have a more beneficial program available, you may come down and reapply and the availability of other credit no longer precludes your participation in this program. 
    Because the Farmers Home Administration in some circumstances switched farmers from emergency loans to operating loans, the district court found that they were deprived of the individual letter notice, because while the letters were provided and while the Farmers Home Administration continued to send routine mailings to its farmer clients during the scope of this application period, they never provided the letter notice to anyone because no one had applied for the emergency loans which they were told were not available.

 Then the regulation said, well, we really ought to publicize all this stuff to the farmers and they never did and they just failed to live up to their own regulations. 
 Do you think the Court has authority to set aside that--

    Mr. Theodore L. Tripp, Jr. 
    Absolutely not, Justice White. 
    I think that... When you are dealing with a statutory termination you get into a different area. 
    Here you have an administratively set regulation. 
    It is not set for this particular disaster. 
    They are seeking to apply this deadline, the courts below found, to frustrate the intent of the congressional scheme. 
    Obviously, if Congress itself says that we are going to give $5,000 to each and every farmer who applies before July 1, Congress is free to make that distinction. 
    We suggest that the difference is an executive agency has never been thought to be empowered to frustrate the intent of Congress by failing to provide notice that it is required to afford under the applicable regulations and then applying the deadline which we submit is contingent upon and its validity rests upon their compliance with the procedure required by law, that is the notice. 
    If there are no other questions, thank you very much.

    Very well. 
    Do you have anything further, Mr. Kuhlik?

    Mr. Bruce N. Kuhlik 
    Yes, Mr. Chief Justice. 
    I would submit that Respondents' answer to Justice White's question decides this case. 
    Respondents admit that if this were a statutory deadline there would be no authority for a court to override it. 
    The fact of the matter is this was a properly promulgated regulatory deadline that was recognized by the Court of Appeals as a legitimate time restriction. 
    This Court's many cases under the Administrative Procedure Act and its estoppel cases as well make very clear the regulations that are promulgated in accordance with the APA have the force and effect of law just as if they were statutory eligibility requirements. 
    That is language directly from the Court's opinion in Merrill. 
    There is simply no basis for overriding the regulatory application deadline--

    Mr. Bruce N. Kuhlik 
    --No, we are not, but the fact is that they are the same thing. 
    There is no ground for treating them any differently. 
    I would like to return to some questions that were asked earlier by Justice Powell and Justice Stevens concerning the publicity of the program. 
    There is no requirement under the APA or in any statute that as a matter of law publicity must be given of governmental benefit programs just in general. 
    There is certainly no requirement that that publicity be given as a pre-condition to the validity of an application deadline. 
    There was a regulation here that provided that the agency would give publicity, but it did not specify nor did the application deadline specify that the loan application deadline would depend on the amount of publicity that was given. 
    I think it is very clear that if the publicity regulation had said the agency will inform the news media of this loan program, but its failure to do so shall not in any way affect the validity of the loan application deadline. 
    I can't believe that we would be here. 
    It would be clear that the loan application deadline would be effective. 
    But, that is exactly the same as this case. 
    There is nothing in the regulations, nothing in the statute at all which even speaks publicity that would in any way suggest that the validity of the loan application deadline somehow depended on whether this regulation concerning publicity was followed. 
    We would suggest that that is enough to decide the case. 
    If there is nothing further, thank you.
