speaker="john_j_de_franks" startTime="96.562" stopTime="220.989">
    Mr. John J. De Franks 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the present case on a writ of certiorari to the New York Court of Appeals stems from an action under New York's public health law to abate a nuisance allegedly occurring at respondent's book store premises. 
    In the trial court, respondents moved for summary judgment, arguing that the closure provision of the public health laws constituted an impermissible prior restraint. 
    The motion was denied. 
    The denial was affirmed by the intermediate appellate court. 
    The New York Court of Appeals, however, found the law, the closure provision, that is, to constitute an unlawful prior restraint upon respondents' First Amendment right. 
    The issue as we see it before this Court is twofold: firstly, whether the closure provision amounts to any regulation of speech: and secondly, if it does, is it not a valid time, place, or manner restriction? 
    We argue initially that closure does not restrict speech in any form, oral or written, pure or symbolic. 
    Closure would be the result of criminal conduct which my opponent concedes has no expressive element. 
    Neither the complaint nor the law generically is concerned with control of any content, and the Court of Appeals specifically so found. 
    The exercise of First Amendment rights could never bring this law to bear against the respondents, and that is exactly what distinguishes this case from every other case cited by both sides in this controversy. 
    In all of those other cases, it was the exercise or intended exercise of First Amendment rights that put the individual on a collision course with the law. 
    In this case, no matter what he says, no matter what he sells, legal or illegal, it could never result in a proceeding for closure.

    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Mr. DeFranks, would you mind explaining how New York interprets this law? 
    Would a single occurrence of an illegal act on the premises of a business without the knowledge or consent of the owner amount to a violation so that it could be declared a public nuisance?
speaker="john_j_de_franks" startTime="239.867" stopTime="251.859">
    Mr. John J. De Franks 
    No, it would not. 
    The New York courts have interpreted this law to require proof of a continuing course of conduct. 
    Both courts, the Appellate Division and the Court of Appeals, have agreed in that.

    No, under the law the closure is mandatory at the conclusion of a successful prosecution.

    That's correct, Your Honor. 
    The present case is like that of a publisher, say, who is incarcerated for conduct unrelated to his publishing activity. 
    Surely his incarceration incidentally affects his freedom to publish, but would anyone suggest that he be entitled to an O'Brien analysis on the date of sentencing? 
    I would think not, because the penalty is unrelated to his First Amendment activity. 
    There is no causal connection.

    Yes, the law does not indicate that there has to be knowledge by the owner, but only that the premises is being used for the conduct. 
    It requires the owner... it puts a burden on the owner to know what is going on at his premises.

speaker="john_j_de_franks" startTime="383.294" stopTime="528.101">
    Mr. John J. De Franks 
    --In this case it was a premises open to the public, so in this case it was open and notorious, because the undercover officer was able to observe it from the position he was in which was in the area of the movie projectors, the booths. 
    As I was suggesting earlier, there is no causal connection, and in this case the exercise of their right to disseminate sexually explicit materials could never bring the law, the closure provision down, against them, and this closure provision does not prohibit relocation. 
    In and of itself, it is not concerned with where the respondents move to to continue in their operation. 
    Respondents deny this. 
    They say we are left with no option. 
    We must remain there. 
    They cite an ordinance that they never raised in the Court of Appeals below, the Kenmore adult use ordinance. 
    However, that ordinance on its face indicates that he may move to an alternative location, and as the maps we have provided indicate, the alternative locations are ample and reasonable in light of the fact that the village of Kenmore is a ten-by-eighteen-block village, wholly consumed within the town of Tonawanda, which is 15 times its size, and which also allows alternative sites for adult uses. 
    That the sites wight cost respondents sore than they are willing to spend is of no moment. 
    As this Court stated in Renton, economic impact, which is the only real impact here, economic impact is simply irrelevant to a First Amendment inquiry, but if we would have assumed that economic impact somehow translates into a restriction on speech, we would argue that this is a legitimate time, place, or manner restriction, a legimitate place restriction. 
    The law is content neutral. 
    It is unconcerned with content. 
    It is interesting that when the law went to the Court of Appeals, it was neutral in all respects. 
    When it returned from the Court of Appeals, the bookstore had been accorded a privilege that we assume might not he accorded to a car dealership or a pharmacy.

    So for purposes or the case before us, we assume that those were the facts.
speaker="john_j_de_franks" startTime="561.924" stopTime="577.867">
    Mr. John J. De Franks 
    Right, in this particular case, and it was very clear that the managers and higher ranking officials with the company were well aware of what was going on. 
    They allowed it because they indicated that it gave them the opportunity to make money off the machines--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="577.867" stopTime="579.084">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Those are the allegations.
speaker="john_j_de_franks" startTime="579.084" stopTime="622.563">
    Mr. John J. De Franks 
    --Those are the allegations in the complaint. 
    As I mentioned, the closure provision does not block alternative channels. 
    The government's interest is strong here, and the Court of Appeals so found. 
    The government sought to control criminal activity and the spread of transmissible sexual diseases. 
    The law is found under the public health law. 
    The closure provision is narrowly tailored. 
    It controls the premises in this case. 
    However, it does not bring under its ambit the prostitution-free premises of others, nor does it infringe upon the constitutional Eights of the respondents nor any other individual. 
    In reality--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="622.563" stopTime="632.870">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    You take the position that it isn't a First Amendment case at all, so we wouldn't be concerned with narrowly tailored or substantial interests?
speaker="john_j_de_franks" startTime="632.870" stopTime="803.376">
    Mr. John J. De Franks 
    --Exactly. 
    Under our first analysis, we would contend this is not a First Amendment case at all, and this would only be our secondary position. 
    In fact, the closure here would have no more effect on respondents than the termination of their lease, the taking of the property though eminent domain, or a tax foreclosure. 
    The place restriction has a rational basis. 
    It works to controvert the price use pattern of the premises and rehabilitate the situs. 
    It doesn't take the property for all time, and it allows for a discretionary release of the property for good cause. 
    Now, if that release is denied in New York, that denial would be reviewed by an appellate court, if the respondents so desired. 
    As this Court has stated in Albertini, if a time, place, and Banner restriction meets the prerequisites I spoke of, it will be determined to be legitimate if the government's interest is accomplished in a better manner with it than without it. 
    I think in this case it is clear that the government's interest would be served better with closure than without it, because closure prevents the recurrence of the conduct, whereas injunction would admit the possibility of recurrence and punish after the fact. 
    My opponent's suggestion that there exists a state constitutional basis for this decision is simply not proven by the opinion. 
    The Court of Appeals decided this case on the basis of your decision in O'Brien. 
    They did not cite the New York State constitution at all as authority. 
    They mentioned it once in reference, but that related to a restatement of respondent's arguments in the court of first instance. 
    This is contracts that by the 19 references to the First Amendment to the United States Constitution and Footnote 3 where the Court of Appeals specifically stated, we are adjudicating the First Amendment question, and as this Court is aware, there is no First Amendment in the state of New York, speech is accorded protection under Article I, Section 8. 
    In conclusion, I point out to this Court that the law does not seek to control or censor the content of any of the materials the respondents are disseminating. 
    It does not deny him access. 
    There are alternative channels. 
    It is simply not a prior restraint. 
    The Court of Appeals was wrong, and we urge that their judgment be reversed.

   Argument of Paul J. Cambria, Jr.
speaker="paul_j_cambria_jr" startTime="811.415" stopTime="886.548">
    Mr. Paul J. Cambria, Jr. 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, initially I think that it is important to again emphasize the record that we come up here on. 
    We have a complaint only, and for purposes of a motion for summary judgment, of course, the allegations are admitted to be true. 
    That is the law in New York State and most other jurisdictions. 
    We do not have in that complaint, however, an allegation by the people that closure of the store is necessary to abate the nuisance. 
    They allege in the complaint that the activities themselves of which they complain, the prostitution activities, et cetera, should be restrained. 
    They do, of course, ask in their wherefore clause that the closure provisions and so on he applied, hut they never allege that closure is necessary in order to abate this nuisance. 
    In addition to that, they do not allege and there is no proof on this record that there are indeed ample other locations available. 
    In each case by this Court where ample locations has come up as an issue, most recently Renton, through Justice Rehnquist--

    Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. 
    May I ask this question?

    Mr. Paul J. Cambria, Jr. 
    --Yes, Your Honor.
speaker="lewis_f_powell_jr" startTime="888.532" stopTime="899.623">
    Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. 
    Am I mistaken? 
    I was under the impression that under the statute, if the nuisance was found to exist, the Court had no alternative. 
    It must order closure.
speaker="paul_j_cambria_jr" startTime="899.623" stopTime="902.408">
    Mr. Paul J. Cambria, Jr. 
    That is the way the statute is written.

    Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. 
    Yes.
speaker="paul_j_cambria_jr" startTime="902.958" stopTime="946.337">
    Mr. Paul J. Cambria, Jr. 
    And the way it has teen applied by the Court of Appeals is to make this a permissive rather than a mandatory closure, and the reason that that was done was to say that based on this record, this would not be justified. 
    It would not be the least drastic means or the narrowest means, and the way the Court of Appeals arrived at that, and I think that it makes sense, because historically if you look at nuisance cases, we always see a broad area of discretion given to the trial court to fashion a remedy, whether it be First Amendment or just a factory, to fashion a remedy that supposedly fits the nuisance as it is found and as it is defined by the record.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="946.337" stopTime="958.145">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    But your opponent here says that the New York statutory scheme does not give trial courts that sort of discretion here, that upon a showing of this kind, closure is mandatory.

speaker="paul_j_cambria_jr" startTime="958.145" stopTime="977.289">
    Mr. Paul J. Cambria, Jr. 
    That is what the statute says literally, and the way that the Court of Appeals interpreted that to be permissive versus mandatory was to analyze the record, analyze the law from this Court and from the state court and make the determination that--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="977.289" stopTime="991.332">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    The court below, as I understand it, said the First Amendment in effect forced it to make that decision, because it thought there were First Amendment values at stake here. 
    Isn't that right?
speaker="paul_j_cambria_jr" startTime="991.332" stopTime="1065.664">
    Mr. Paul J. Cambria, Jr. 
    --I think that is partly right. 
    There's two things the court did. 
    The first thing the court did was say that it wasn't necessary in order to effectuate, if you will, the legislation here, to close the store based on this record, and I think that what happens by that statement is that the court interprets, first of all, what the intent of its legislation is, which I submit is legitimate for the highest court of the state to do, and I might add, this is the first time this has ever arisen in the state of New York with regard to application of this statute. 
    This statute by all history is a house of prostitution statute. 
    Now it is being applied in this case for the first time in an area where there is undeniably and admittedly on the part of the prosecution lawful speech conduct occurring on the premises, so what the Court of Appeals did was say first of all in viewing our piece of legislation we say that it is not necessary in order to carry out the force of the legislation on this record, and they emphasize under these circumstances, on this record it is not necessary to have closure, that to do so would, because of the First Amendment implications here, constitute a restraint, and I--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="1065.664" stopTime="1073.001">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Do you think the sane analysis would be required if a bookstore were closed because of violation of some safety--

    Mr. Paul J. Cambria, Jr. 
    --No, and I think there is an obvious distinction there, and that is this. 
    If I failed to pay taxes, and I had a publishing concern, a newspaper, if I failed to pay taxes, or if I had some zoning problem, the narrowest remedy available would be for me to pay the taxes or to correct the zoning problem. 
    That is the narrowest remedy, and the moment that I do that, there is no cessation beyond my satisfying that narrowest remedy to my publishing, but in this case--

    Mr. Paul J. Cambria, Jr.

    That is what you have to do. 
    That is the least drastic remedy. 
    There is no other. 
    And so therefore once you do that you are able to open. 
    In this case the Court of Appeals, and I believe rightfully so, and I think it is reasonable, said, the least drastic remedy on this record is to at least in the first instance have an injunction or attempted injunction.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="1146.597" stopTime="1150.251">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    But you are assuming it is a First Amendment case.
speaker="paul_j_cambria_jr" startTime="1150.251" stopTime="1246.312">
    Mr. Paul J. Cambria, Jr. 
    And I think for good reason, and I might say this is the reason. 
    If we look at the history of the decisions of this Court, whether it be Healy v. James or Procunier or Schaumberg or Schad or American Mini, and a lot of other cases that have come down from this Court, the Court has said that even in a situation where motivation is not considered, or where content is not considered, the Court must consider the effect of legislation on expressive conduct on expressive conduct by an individual, the effect of the legislation. 
    Otherwise, I submit, Justice O'Connor, we would be in a situation where if a community could simply pass a law and it could tremendously affect a newspaper, motion picture studio, what have you, but if they simply said, it is content neutral, completely, they would have total immunity from any scrutiny by this Court or any other court on the position that we are not saying anything at all about your theater or about your newspaper, whatever. 
    We have a fire code, for example. 
    I think that since it would affect, and any time it does affect, and I believe this Court's decisions say that, that when legislation affects speech, it is subject to some kind of scrutiny by the court, whether it be O'Brien or whether it be the time, place, and manner, and I might say that in some cases it looks as if, for example, in the Creative Nonviolence situation, we start off with an O'Brien observation, and it goes into a time, place, and manner, and sometimes these seem to overlap one another.

    This is a situation where... this is a situation where there is a total closure here of a lawful, legitimate aspect of a business before the reasonable step under this record is being taken, which is to attempt an injunction or to have an injunction, and I submit that all the Court of Appeals said was this. 
    It never said that closure wasn't a valid remedy. 
    It said that on this record it was overly broad. 
    This Court has said on a number of occasions and talked about overly broad remedies in First Amendment areas, in areas where you found that narrower means could be used in order to vindicate the purpose of a piece of legislation, and I submit that it is only reasonable for the Court of Appeals to say in this case, why is it unfair, why is it unreasonable when we have a legitimate aspect of a business, not simply sex books, but all kinds of books and magazines, why is it unfair to say to the court below that the narrowest means, which are already in the statute, they don't have to be made up by anybody, they are in the statute, that the narrowest means here is an injunction.

    Mr. Paul J. Cambria, Jr. 
    Yes, there is in the statute a provision. 
    However, the problem with the statute is that when it was amended, and it was amended over the years, an additional provision was added sating that there shall be an abatement. 
    Now, what the Court of Appeals has done here is basically what the state of California has done through its Supreme Court, and it is to make it a permissive closure versus a mandatory one, and they simply took the position that where we have this effect, you should follow the narrowest means, and not the most drastic means, but the narrowest means.

    Let me read this statement to you from the New York Court of Appeals opinion on Page A-19 of the petition, where just before they reached the end and Judge Jason starts dissenting, the Court of Appeals says, 
    "Under these circumstances, we conclude that closure of defendant's bookstore is not essential to the furtherance of the purposes underlying Title 2, and is thus an unconstitutional restraint on defendant's First Amendment rights. "

    Yes, and under these circumstances they felt the legislation could not be constitutionally applied.
speaker="paul_j_cambria_jr" startTime="1683.411" stopTime="1772.405">
    Mr. Paul J. Cambria, Jr. 
    Under these circumstances, because it wasn't the narrowest means available. 
    If we look at all the other cases coming out of this Court, for example, the recent one, Creative Nonviolence, Albertini, and the other cases, if we look at those cases, we find that there are and there is on the record, a finding on the record of ample other outlets for the distribution of the material or the speech that is involved. 
    Creative Nonviolence on the mall, all types of things were able to he done there to make the speech. 
    With regard to this case, however, we do not have that. 
    There is nothing in this record to demonstrate that. 
    In fact, because the District Attorney had made a statement in the brief, they could simply move across the street, that is what compelled us to have to file an appendix in this case showing that they were there under a prior nonconforming use in this particular area, and it is extremely restrictive, but I think the point is that if we look at Renton, and we look at Schad, and we look at American Mini Theaters, in each case there was a specific finding there relied upon by this Court to say that there were ample other outlets. 
    The Court said, we find that. 
    In Renton they found the District Court had ruled that way. 
    In American Mini, in Footnote 35, the Court there said that we find myriad other locations, and so on, and as a matter of fact when we look at these other cases, we can see that each one of those individuals could still have an outlet for speech. 
    In American Mini, for example, they could have shorn other types of movies, or in Schad, they could have had other kinds of books, magazines, or what have you.

    We have on where there is conduct, mixed conduct and speech, which would be like O'Brien, for example. 
    In O'Brien, the position taken by the individual was that burning the draft card was symbolic speech, The Court disagreed with that, and found, of course, that it could be regulated under this test. 
    In Healy v. James, we had a status thing, where they would recognize or not the SDS on a campus. 
    And in that particular case they certainly argued that this was an infringement on their speech not to be recognized, and the Court rock the position, we have to now go through this measuring test, and in a whole raft of cases the Court has always taken the position that where speech is involved and affected, and the words used by the Court repeatedly have been affected, that then this measuring test takes place--

    Mr. Paul J. Cambria, Jr. 
    --No, and if, however, there was a law that said that if you are convicted of speeding or arrested for speeding, then you cannot act as an anchorperson for a year after that time, then I would submit we are involved in an overly broad regulation, because in the case you pose, the thing that needs to be addressed is the actual conduct that is against the law, and I think that is what the Court of Appeals has said here. 
    The conduct against the law is the activity of the patrons or some patrons over the short period of time on the premises. 
    And that should be addressed.

    Mr. Paul J. Cambria, Jr. 
    Not in this community, they are not. 
    That is why we have had a lodging here with the Court, because there was a statement made by the state that they could simply move across the street or next door, and we demonstrated that we had litigation over that. 
    They are in this location as a prior nonconforming use. 
    There is a little strip that has been provided for in part of the city which they say is the area where adult uses can go, and that particular strip at this point is not applicable because of the grandfather rights. 
    There was litigation in this case, but there was no... there is not even an allegation in the complaint, which is our record here, that other avenues are available, and the Court has always required that if somebody is imposing a time, place, and manner restraint, that it is their burden to demonstrate that all the requirements are there, including ample other avenues, and in each one of these cases where the Court has upheld effect legislation on speech, they have found specifically proof of other ample avenues, and we just don't have that here. 
    I submit it is not unfair in a nuisance case and unreasonable for the Court to simply say, it is like if you have a rash on your hand, the most efficient remedy would be to put the person to death. 
    That is certainly the most efficient remedy, but is it reasonable? 
    The reasonable thing would be to at least in the first analysis... and I submit, expression is entitled to this. 
    This is a clearly, admittedly lawful expressive area. 
    Isn't it entitled to first have the part of the statute that provides for the injunction to be applied first before the door is slammed shut? 
    It is not like being attested for... there was a statement made in the opening remarks, it is similar to being arrested. 
    It is not similar to being arrested for a crime or even for the crime of obscenity if that were to be applied, because with the arrest you certainly could punish that individual. 
    If that person owned a newspaper, when you arrested him and convicted him of that particular crime, you wouldn't simultaneously go to their newspaper and put a padlock around the front door, and that is exactly what happens here, and that is the difference, and that is why arrest, penal law provisions, tax abatement, and so on, are not the same, because in those cases, once you take care of that ill, that problem, it does not have a spillover effect on the First Amendment expression part, and that is the problem here.

    So the Court of Appeals gets this case with nothing having occurred in three years, no arrest of a single patron at any time for any conduct, and no injunction gotten by the District Attorney, no trial had, and there has been no stay in this case. 
    Up until the time we had the decision by the Court of Appeals, nothing preventing them from having a trial in this case.

    I thought the law that the District Attorney was faced with, though, wouldn't permit him just to get an injunction.

    Mr. Paul J. Cambria, Jr. 
    They... no, I don't believe that is true at all. 
    The final relief provides for the abatement. 
    Interim relief is unrestricted, and interim relief here, there was never a sufficient showing, and they made two--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2332.315" stopTime="2333.348">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Did they try to get an injunction?
speaker="paul_j_cambria_jr" startTime="2333.348" stopTime="2341.587">
    Mr. Paul J. Cambria, Jr. 
    --Yes, and what the trial court found was that they didn't demonstrate that there were not adequate legal remedies, that in addition they didn't--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2341.587" stopTime="2344.389">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, on that basis you would never get an injunction.
speaker="paul_j_cambria_jr" startTime="2344.389" stopTime="2346.241">
    Mr. Paul J. Cambria, Jr. 
    --No, I submit no, Your Honor. 
    for example--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2346.241" stopTime="2355.097">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, why, if there are adequate legal remedies like indicting somebody. 
    That is the end of the injunction--
speaker="paul_j_cambria_jr" startTime="2355.097" stopTime="2359.149">
    Mr. Paul J. Cambria, Jr. 
    --Your Honor, in the Village of Schaumberg case, which you wrote the decision in--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2359.149" stopTime="2360.499">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    --That was a Court opinion.
speaker="paul_j_cambria_jr" startTime="2360.499" stopTime="2377.843">
    Mr. Paul J. Cambria, Jr. 
    --you looked to the fact of using penal laws in an area for lesser or more direct means than using equitable remedies, or using other remedies that weren't as narrow, and I submit they legitimately did that here, and further, I submit this, that if they demonstrated below--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2377.843" stopTime="2382.414">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    The District Attorney tried to get an injunction, and the court wouldn't give it to him.
speaker="paul_j_cambria_jr" startTime="2382.414" stopTime="2451.841">
    Mr. Paul J. Cambria, Jr. 
    --Because they didn't have a sufficient showing, not that it wouldn't be proper with a sufficient showing, but they didn't have a sufficient legal showing, and the decision is here from the lower court about the fact of the hearsay nature of it and the fact that they tried never to have an arrest... I mean, in these other cases we look at Croaton and Allouwill and so on. 
    They had arrests in those cases. 
    They attempted to have a direct legal remedy be imposed, and it failed, and then they had a proper record to show they could get a closure, and I submit in this case that the area of expression is important enough that it is not unreasonable to say that under the right case, under the right circumstances pled and proved, they can get a closure order, but under this case the record does act substantiate that. 
    We have no attempt whatsoever to try legitimate, viable interim remedies here in a substantial or sufficient way, and if they had all of the pervasiveness and so on, I have to assume they would have moved under those grounds and said that, in fact, even had alleged in their complaint that they needed closure in order to stop the activity on the store, which they never even allege in their complaint. 
    So I submit--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="2451.841" stopTime="2464.532">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    But I guess it is their legal position that they don't have to show that it is necessary or that there is some other place you can move if the statute means what it says, and closure follows automatically from proof of this kind of activity.
speaker="paul_j_cambria_jr" startTime="2464.532" stopTime="2465.484">
    Mr. Paul J. Cambria, Jr. 
    --Well, but I don't think that's--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="2465.484" stopTime="2466.384">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    That's their legal position.
speaker="paul_j_cambria_jr" startTime="2466.384" stopTime="2475.757">
    Mr. Paul J. Cambria, Jr. 
    --I don't think that's... they have not said that, because they would have to allege it so that we could at least deny it, so that then there would be an issue of fact foe someone to--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="2475.757" stopTime="2478.626">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    No, they can just say the statute means what it says.
speaker="paul_j_cambria_jr" startTime="2478.626" stopTime="2479.526">
    Mr. Paul J. Cambria, Jr. 
    --The statute simply says--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="2479.526" stopTime="2483.612">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    And the Court of Appeals said it did. 
    They said, we have to construe the fact because of the First Amendment.
speaker="paul_j_cambria_jr" startTime="2483.612" stopTime="2580.989">
    Mr. Paul J. Cambria, Jr. 
    --Right, the statute says there is one and only one remedy basically no matter what the facts are, and I submit that is the problem here. 
    One and only one remedy without regard to what the facts are is the problem in this case, and it is not unreasonable, I submit again, to say in this case where we have a fetal cessation of this outlet without any demonstration of other adequate outlets available, to say that it is worth it and it is worth it to our system of free expression to say attempt the injunction or get the injunction, because they could certainly, from what they allege here, take the position they could get a permanent injunction at the end of a trial. 
    If it doesn't work like it didn't in Croaton and it didn't in... it did in the other case, but not in Croaton, then they would be entitled to closure, and I think that is why this statute isn't emasculated at all. 
    It is just simply a reasonable response, saying let's just tailor it like we do any other nuisance. 
    If we had a factory that was emitting pollutants, it seems to me if we had a law that said any pollutants emitted would require bulldozing down the factory, that this Court would take a hard look at that and say, well, wait a minute. 
    Isn't there a lesser means, a filter on the stack system or what have you? 
    Do we have to bulldoze it down? 
    And I submit, that is what is happening here. 
    We have an all or nothing blunderbust kind of remedy, a machete versus the scalpel that ought to be used in the First Amendment area, and I just submit that that response below is a reasonable one, and it is one that deserves to be employed, and it may be that when they have the trial in this case they can demonstrate that it is not effective to simply have an injunction, that there must be a closure, and if that is so, then I submit that would be proper. 
    If not, I ask the decision below be affirmed.

    Mr. John J. De Franks 
    Just one thing, Your Honor.

    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Wait. 
    Mr. DeFranks, I really don't understand your Baking this argument, because am I not correct that your position is, you don't have to prove anything like that, that you are simply entitled to closure?
speaker="john_j_de_franks" startTime="2608.290" stopTime="2610.658">
    Mr. John J. De Franks 
    On a first analysis, correct.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="2610.658" stopTime="2619.514">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    So it seems to me that you should he saying to us, don't bother looking at alternatives. 
    We have a right to closure. 
    It is an effective remedy, and so forth. 
    So I just don't understand you--

    Mr. John J. De Franks 
    Right. 
    It is only on our secondary analysis, time, place, and manner.
