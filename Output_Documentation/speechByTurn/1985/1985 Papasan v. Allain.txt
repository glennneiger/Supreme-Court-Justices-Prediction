    Mr. Freeland, I think you may proceed whenever you are ready.

    Mr. T. H. Freeland, III 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, there is a line drawn across the State of Mississippi, an arbitrary line that divides the school children of that state into two classes. 
    The school children in the southern 59 counties of Mississippi receive the entire income from the federally created school lands trust in our state, while the school children in the Chickasaw Cession, the 23 counties that we represent, receive not a nickel of this trust income, but instead a pittance in the form of an annual appropriation which the Mississippi legislature may or may not make each year.

    Justice Byron R. White 
    Could I ask you right now, do you claim that it is contrary to federal law or the Constitution for the state to allow this school land money to be allocated to the counties in which the land is? 
    Do you think they must administer for the state as a whole and distribute it equally?
speaker="t_h_freeland_iii" startTime="91.530" stopTime="97.955">
    Mr. T. H. Freeland, III 
    I think it is contrary to federal law, Justice White, for them to do as they are doing. 
    In other words--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="97.955" stopTime="99.838">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, that doesn't answer my question.
speaker="t_h_freeland_iii" startTime="99.838" stopTime="104.659">
    Mr. T. H. Freeland, III 
    --I think it is contrary... yes, to answer your question in a word.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="104.659" stopTime="115.887">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Good. 
    So you think they should take the total trust income from trust lands and divide it among the counties in accordance with the number of students or some other neutral standard?
speaker="t_h_freeland_iii" startTime="115.887" stopTime="119.799">
    Mr. T. H. Freeland, III 
    I think that they could do that as part of the relief that we seek, yes.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="119.799" stopTime="137.892">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    I know, but I thought you said that it would be contrary to federal law to let the counties in which the land is located have all the money generated for that land.
speaker="t_h_freeland_iii" startTime="137.892" stopTime="152.181">
    Mr. T. H. Freeland, III 
    Not precisely. 
    What I said was that it is contrary to federal law to allow all of the trust income to go to 59 counties, and at the same time none of it to go to the 23 that we represent.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="152.181" stopTime="183.930">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, suppose there wasn't this Cherokee land involved at all, and every county in the state had that section of land or whatever it was, those sections of land, but that those lands in the different counties produced different income, different levels of income, and some counties from the school land would be getting X dollars per child, and other counties would be getting one-tenth that per child. 
    Now, would that be permissible?
speaker="t_h_freeland_iii" startTime="183.930" stopTime="185.713">
    Mr. T. H. Freeland, III 
    Well, in the first place--

    Would it be, or not?

    Mr. T. H. Freeland, III 
    --Yes, yes, indeed, it would be, and that is the situation that does in fact exist in lots of state, where the state has not done--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="193.518" stopTime="199.522">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    So you do not attack allocating the income to the counties in which the land is located.

    Mr. T. H. Freeland, III 
    --As a matter of fact, the language of the trust says that that is what is to be... in other words, the land is to be maintained for the benefit of the township in which the land is located, but we have gone beyond that in Mississippi.

    I understand.

    Mr. T. H. Freeland, III 
    That is my point.
speaker="lewis_f_powell_jr" startTime="215.523" stopTime="238.387">
    Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. 
    Mr. Freeland, I am not sure I understand the facts. 
    My understanding was that the counties you represent were owned by an Indian tribe, and when the United States government took that land over and sold it, they gave the proceeds to the State of Mississippi. 
    The state then invested the proceeds in bonds of a railroad that went broken during the War Between the States. 
    Is that correct?
speaker="t_h_freeland_iii" startTime="238.387" stopTime="240.558">
    Mr. T. H. Freeland, III 
    No, Justice Powell, that is--
speaker="lewis_f_powell_jr" startTime="240.558" stopTime="241.860">
    Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. 
    That is incorrect?
speaker="t_h_freeland_iii" startTime="241.860" stopTime="242.972">
    Mr. T. H. Freeland, III 
    --That is incorrect.
speaker="lewis_f_powell_jr" startTime="242.972" stopTime="244.364">
    Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. 
    All right. 
    Tell me what the facts are.
speaker="t_h_freeland_iii" startTime="244.364" stopTime="281.325">
    Mr. T. H. Freeland, III 
    All right. 
    What happened was this. 
    First of all, the entire school lands trust was created at one time in 1817 in Mississippi's enabling Act and the Land Sales Act. 
    The Land Sales Act provided that the 16 section lands were to be retained throughout the state in trust for the schools. 
    Then, in the sale of the lands in what is called the Chickasaw Cession, the 23 counties that we represent, rather than retain the lands in trust, as was supposed to be done, they sold them and gave the money to the Indians, and not to the state.
speaker="lewis_f_powell_jr" startTime="281.325" stopTime="283.679">
    Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. 
    The United States Government did that, didn't it?
speaker="t_h_freeland_iii" startTime="283.679" stopTime="391.129">
    Mr. T. H. Freeland, III 
    That is correct, and of course the United States government realized what it had done, subsequently passed a statute that said, we are going to give the state 177,555 acres of new lands to replace these lands that we wrongfully, if you will, sold to the Indians. 
    Thereafter, after this happened, the State of Mississippi first leased these lands. 
    They are in the Mississippi Delta, some of the richest farmland in the world. 
    They leased these lands, and following that, the Congress in 1852 passed a statute that said, you can now sell the lands provided you retain the funds, proceeds of the sale in trust for the schools, or as an alternative you can lease the lands, but if you do, if you do sell the lands, you have got to get permission of the counties where... that would benefit from the lands in order to do so. 
    Of course, the state never did do this. 
    In 1856, the state comes along. 
    They... well, first, in 1854 they gave away the reversionary interest in the land. 
    They had the lands leased for 99 years. 
    They said, we will give you a fee simple title for no additional charge, which they did. 
    This was Delta land. 
    Subsequent to that, in 1856, the state said, okay, we have got something over $1 million in a fund in the state treasury. 
    They by statute converted that to the use of the state, and put it in the general fund, and spent it just like they would any other money in the general fund. 
    In other words, the trustee gave away the corpus of the trust or converted it. 
    Now, the same statute that you are referring to, I believe, does talk about lending money to the railroads, a highly speculative venture in Mississippi in 1856, but that was done after the money was converted to the use of the state.
speaker="lewis_f_powell_jr" startTime="391.129" stopTime="395.180">
    Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. 
    Did they put all of that money in the railroads?
speaker="t_h_freeland_iii" startTime="395.180" stopTime="410.020">
    Mr. T. H. Freeland, III 
    No, as a matter of fact, if you read the statute, I believe they put about $400,000 of it into the railroads, railroads, incidentally, that had no rolling stock, had not been built, and to add insult to injury, they were in south Mississippi, not in north Mississippi where our 23 counties are.
speaker="lewis_f_powell_jr" startTime="410.020" stopTime="415.656">
    Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. 
    And no suit has been brought against the state in all the years that have passed since then?
speaker="t_h_freeland_iii" startTime="415.656" stopTime="417.647">
    Mr. T. H. Freeland, III 
    Until this day.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="417.647" stopTime="439.650">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Mr. Freeland, I assume as far as you are concerned that we could take judicial notice of the matters in the public record such as the annual report of the superintendent of public education to the state legislature from Mississippi.
speaker="t_h_freeland_iii" startTime="439.650" stopTime="443.804">
    Mr. T. H. Freeland, III 
    Certainly, Justice O'Connor. 
    I certainly hope the Court will do that.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="443.804" stopTime="461.925">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    And in looking at that report, it appears that there are other state funds that go toward the pupil costs of public education in the State of Mississippi other than the 16th Section and lieu lands revenue.
speaker="t_h_freeland_iii" startTime="461.925" stopTime="469.328">
    Mr. T. H. Freeland, III 
    Is the Court referring to general appropriations or are we talking about--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="469.328" stopTime="475.132">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Appropriations that go to the costs of public school education.
speaker="t_h_freeland_iii" startTime="475.132" stopTime="477.175">
    Mr. T. H. Freeland, III 
    --Aside from the school lands trust.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="477.175" stopTime="482.188">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Yes, aside from the 16th Section and the lieu lands revenues.
speaker="t_h_freeland_iii" startTime="482.188" stopTime="483.540">
    Mr. T. H. Freeland, III 
    That is precisely correct.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="483.540" stopTime="501.430">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    What percentage of the funds per pupil would you say comes from other funds, local, state, and possibly federal, other than these moneys you are worried about, the lieu lands and 16th Section?
speaker="t_h_freeland_iii" startTime="501.430" stopTime="521.664">
    Mr. T. H. Freeland, III 
    May I illustrate in dollars? 
    In dollars, in the Chickasaw Cession 63 cents per student, moneys in lieu of trust funds prior to 1985; outside the Chickasaw Cession, $75 per student.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="521.664" stopTime="531.880">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Well, my question goes to what other revenues go toward public school education. 
    Those figures, of course, are in your brief, but the other figures are not.
speaker="t_h_freeland_iii" startTime="531.880" stopTime="560.781">
    Mr. T. H. Freeland, III 
    The fund represents outside the Chickasaw Cession approximately 20 percent of the total school funds available to the schools in the State of Mississippi. 
    This is outside the Chickasaw Cession. 
    That is less teachers' salaries. 
    In other words, these are basically used as discretionary funds. 
    So if you discount teachers' salaries, the fund represents approximately 20 percent of the total school funds available in the State of Mississippi.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="560.781" stopTime="562.461">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor

    Mr. T. H. Freeland, III 
    I believe that's correct.

    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    I share Justice O'Connor's concern. 
    Don't you end up in a situation where the children in the Chickasaw Cession lands get about the same overall as those in the southern part of the state?
speaker="t_h_freeland_iii" startTime="584.655" stopTime="592.291">
    Mr. T. H. Freeland, III

    Mr. T. H. Freeland, III 
    No, they certainly do not. 
    In other words, against 60, a little better than 60 cents per pupil in the Chickasaw Cession prior to '85; in the rest of the state, $74.
speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="613.466" stopTime="619.480">
    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    I know, you say that, but we are asking, overall, with all other funds available, what is the answer?
speaker="t_h_freeland_iii" startTime="619.480" stopTime="623.831">
    Mr. T. H. Freeland, III 
    The answer is the same. 
    That difference is not made up with these other funds.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="623.831" stopTime="640.042">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    But what order of magnitude are we talking about? 
    Is it a correct interpretation of your answers to Justice Blackmun that about 80 percent of the public funds from everywhere in Mississippi for schools come from sources other than these lieu lands?
speaker="t_h_freeland_iii" startTime="640.042" stopTime="642.724">
    Mr. T. H. Freeland, III 
    Outside the Chickasaw Cession. 
    That's correct.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="642.724" stopTime="647.737">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    And how much comes in... much more than 80 percent, perhaps approaching 100 percent?
speaker="t_h_freeland_iii" startTime="647.737" stopTime="656.402">
    Mr. T. H. Freeland, III 
    No, no, no. 
    In the Chickasaw Cession, less than 3 percent because of the amount of moneys that we get. 
    In other words, again, you are talking about a difference.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="656.402" stopTime="678.357">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Counsel, what we are interested in is, what is the disparity, when you add all the figures together of all sources for public education? 
    What is the disparity between the southern part of the state and what you refer to as the Chickasaw Cession? 
    Is it roughly 100 percent to 80 percent?
speaker="t_h_freeland_iii" startTime="678.357" stopTime="689.665">
    Mr. T. H. Freeland, III 
    It is... if I have got my mathematics correct, Justice Rehnquist, it is... yes, roughly, I would say that would be correct.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="689.665" stopTime="700.292">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    And is it your position that the 80 percent funding does not give a minimally adequate education?
speaker="t_h_freeland_iii" startTime="700.292" stopTime="719.073">
    Mr. T. H. Freeland, III 
    It is our position that the lack of a minimally adequate education, and as the Court understands, we are here on a 12(b)(6) motion, is the effect of the denial of the rights that we claim under this trust, and not the cause. 
    The cause, we say, is denial of these rights under this federally created trust.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="719.073" stopTime="730.460">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    And you say that the absence of the cession lands revenues makes the difference between a minimally adequate education and not?

    Mr. T. H. Freeland, III

    We are not attacking school funding in Mississippi as a general proposition. 
    That is not our lawsuit as we view it. 
    Our lawsuit as we view it is simply this trust created by the federal government is being violated because our clients, or the schools that they attend, I should say, are not getting their rightful share of the trust income. 
    That is the basis for our lawsuit. 
    Now, as far as the overall school funding of the State of Mississippi is concerned, we are not... that is not the thrust of our lawsuit in the least.

    Mr. T. H. Freeland, III 
    Not the violation that we are suing on. 
    Now, Justice Rehnquist. 
    The violation that we are suing on is the violation that occurs each year when this trustee, who either converted the trust corpus or gave it away, and owes us a continuing duty.

    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well, but that is, you know, that is the way everybody tries to get around the statute of limitations, is to say, well, this didn't just happen in 1868.

speaker="t_h_freeland_iii" startTime="913.104" stopTime="938.510">
    Mr. T. H. Freeland, III 
    This Court has said that where there is a trust and the trustee converts the corpus of the trust, and thereafter continues to admit, as the State of Mississippi has done in this situation, that the duty is owed to continue paying income, that the statute of limitations doesn't run. 
    The only way the statute commenced to run is if the trustee repudiates the trust, which the trustee didn't do. 
    It didn't say the trust was void--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="938.510" stopTime="946.464">

    Ha is under a continuing duty, a trustee is, to pay income for the trust intended purpose, and the purpose of this was to educate children. 
    The way he has converted the trust corpus, the trustee has to continue paying income after the conversion.

    Mr. T. H. Freeland, III 
    Well, let's say at the minimum it would be something that would raise the pupil above the level of a functional illiterate, and we literally have schools in Mississippi where they are being denied even that, and a lot of them are not... Tunica County,... I keep going back to that. 
    The poorest county in the whole United States. 
    The only poorer place in the whole country is the leper colony on Molokai. 
    The point, though, of the matter is that here we are dealing with a federally created trust. 
    We are not just dealing with appropriations of school money for the State of Mississippi. 
    We are dealing with a trust created by the federal government. 
    We are dealing with a trust that the state admits it has violated over these years and has continued to violate, and it comes down to this, to say that a suit such as we have here on the basis of this continuing violation is barred by the Eleventh Amendment, and that is the state's primary argument, is to say that there is no trust at all. 
    There is no continuing duty at all, in other words. 
    If there is a trust, there is a continuing duty. 
    Now, of course, this Court has repeatedly and recently upheld the school lands trusts, in Lassen versus Arizona, Arizona... Alamo Land and Cattle Company versus Arizona.

    Mr. T. H. Freeland, III 
    And we submit, Justice Rehnquist, the Eleventh Amendment is no bar to prospective injunctive relief, which tells these trustees to cease violating the terms of this trust in the future, to do your duty in the future, and that is what we are asking here. 
    Of course, we don't... the entire thrust of our case is not just the trust. 
    Assuming arguendo there is no trust, we still say that the way these schools are being financed has no rational basis whatsoever.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="1315.770" stopTime="1317.223">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    This is an equal protection case?
speaker="t_h_freeland_iii" startTime="1317.223" stopTime="1587.679">
    Mr. T. H. Freeland, III 
    Yes, it certainly is. 
    What is the basis for it? 
    Well, an accident of land value is a basis, the state says. 
    There is no land to put a value on in North Mississippi. 
    They are trying to make a Rodriguez argument. 
    We want to have local administration of local schools. 
    That is the basis for it. 
    There is no school lands trust to administer in Northern Mississippi. 
    The state either gave it away or took it. 
    Contrast this case with Rodriguez. 
    For example, there you have a facially neutral situation. 
    You do have a difference in land values. 
    It is just one section of San Antonio had a higher value of land than another. 
    Here we have a discriminatory act the way this money is divided up and no basis for it. 
    The relief that we seek is simple enough, an adjudication that the trust is valid, that it is governed by federal law, that it is violated annually by the respondent state officials, and that it the recurring violations are a derogation of the equal protection clause as well as the contracts clause of the Constitution. 
    We seek prospective injunctive relief to stop these trustees from doing what they have been doing with these kids in the future, to give them a chance, and see that their schools receive the support for which the trust was created in the first place, and which is now being denied. 
    What we say about this trust is certainly consistent with the decisions of this Court dealing with school lands trusts generally. 
    For example, we are asking the Court to apply certain common law principles to this situation just as the Court did in Oneida II. 
    There you had a trust created by the Non-Intercourse Act of 1793, and the Court said, well, we don't have any law to look to here, there was no regulatory scheme for enforcing the trust, so we are going to apply common law principles. 
    These same principles apply here. 
    We are asking this Court to declare that this is in fact the trust, something that the court has done each and every time it has ever had an opportunity to rule on the question, and that the law governing the trust, because it is created by federal law, is, of course, federal law, and the trust is enforceable. 
    In other words, the short answer to what we want is for the trustees to honor their obligations in the future. 
    To argue, as the state does, that the Eleventh Amendment bars any such remedy or the trustee's diminution of the trust corpus is to say that there is no trust at all, contrary to the statutes which created it, that there is no enforceable continuing duty, nothing that can be enforced in federal court, that any claim under federal law would have to be left to the tender mercies of the state court. 
    The Fifth Circuit's holding is nothing less than that this trust is simply not there because they said there is no continuing duty. 
    Granted, says the Fifth Circuit, there was a valid compact created 130 years ago. 
    What we are looking at now is some weird creature that has to do with Mississippi trust law, and they flatly refuse to enforce the continuing duty, and really that is what this lawsuit is about. 
    If this is a trust, and we certainly contend that it is, the it follows as the night the day that the trustees of this trust, and those are the people that we are suing, are obliged to honor it, and as part of that they are obliged to pay or see that the trust income is properly divided or paid in the future from some source, and they can be made to do that because they are acting in derogation of federal law and they are acting in derogation of the equal protection clause. 
    We submit that they could be made to do that by this Court, and that indeed they should be made to do that by this Court. 
    Are there any other questions? 
    May I reserve the rest of my time?

    Mr. Richard Lloyd Arnold 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, initially I would like to correct some misstatements by counsel as to the Chocktaw Cession counties, and that is the way it is referred to. 
    There was the Chocktaw Indian Tribe in basically the southern two-thirds of the state, the Chickasaw Indian Tribe in the northern one-third, relatively speaking. 
    Every school district, and let's talk school districts and not counties, because school districts are the geographical areas, every school district in the southern part of Mississippi in the Chocktaw Cession does not receive income from 16th Section lands. 
    It is just simply not the case. 
    For instance, the Meridian Public School System receives from 16th Section lands zero. 
    It has no 16th Section lands. 
    The Greenwood Municipal Separate School District, located in the Mississippi Delta, which has been referred to earlier, receives some 16th Section land zero. 
    It has no 16th Section lands there. 
    There are at least 20 school districts in the southern half of the State of Mississippi which receive less than the Chocktaw... the Chickasaw Cession districts, the lowest Chickasaw District receives from the State of Mississippi.

    Mr. Richard Lloyd Arnold 
    They seem to think, Your Honor... we think the issues come down very simply in this case. 
    They are saying either raise the amount that is in the corpus, the principal amount, or raise the interest that is paid. 
    That appears to us to be the issue here in this case. 
    That is the reason for the Eleventh Amendment jurisdictional bar we have made in the District Court, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals before this Court, but be that as it may, I don't... they seem to think that the principal should be raised or the interest should be raised. 
    And we think the Eleventh Amendment jurisdictional ball would prohibit that.

    His duty is to check and see two primary things, that the land is not disposed of because our constitution now which was adopted in 1890 prohibits the sale of 16th Section lands. 
    They cannot be sold. 
    Before that time there was no prohibition as to the sale of these lands. 
    One, he sees that. 
    Two, he sees that the lands are administered in such a way that a reasonable income is derived therefrom, and that they are not donated. 
    The law in Mississippi on 16th Section lands underwent a dramatic change in 1978. 
    Up until that time they had been very loosely administered in that regard. 
    The legislature proposed a constitutional amendment, changed it around, gave the Secretary of State much more power. 
    The Supreme Court of Mississippi affirmed this power to go out and check on these counties and see if they were in fact getting the highest amount they could from the lands there. 
    So he has that duty.

    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Mr. Arnold, do you agree with the statements of Mr. Freeland about the amount of money that goes per pupil for education from all sources other than these 16th Section and lieu lands moneys?
speaker="richard_lloyd_arnold" startTime="2186.947" stopTime="2254.772">
    Mr. Richard Lloyd Arnold 
    Your Honor, I do not agree with some of his statements there. 
    I do not have an exact figure or percentage as to the amount. 
    However, much like Texas had done in the San Antonio versus Rodriguez case, the State of Mississippi, every child, every school district in the state as far as an appropriation is concerned from the State of Mississippi, gets the exact same amount of money per teacher unit. 
    There is no distinction, whether it runs from Tunica county all the way to Jackson County on the opposite end of the state. 
    This money also goes... Mr. Freeman says it does not go for teachers' salaries. 
    On the contrary, it does. 
    The money can be used for teachers' salaries, and this is separated, divided up when it goes to the schools there, teachers' salaries, superintendent and principals' salaries, separate services such as salaries for art and music teachers, librarians, guidance counselors, as well as providing for nurses and lunchroom personnel together with the funds for textbooks, audiovisual equipment, building improvements, and cost of transportation.

    As I understand it, the discrepancy with regard to the trust fund income is the difference between 63 cents and $75 per pupil, and as I understand what you are saying now, the additional money supplied by the State of Mississippi are the same per pupil, whether it is $50 or--

    What would be the... is that $75 per student, is that the average per student in the school districts that get something, or does that average out through all of the school districts?

    Justice Byron R. White 
    Including the ones who don't get anything?
speaker="richard_lloyd_arnold" startTime="2447.560" stopTime="2764.750">
    Mr. Richard Lloyd Arnold 
    --Yes, Your Honor, and of course that is inflated. 
    Some school districts have vast mineral wealth under them, under their 16th Section lands, and they have leased that. 
    Of course, prices have been falling lately. 
    I think these figures may change around based on some changes in the economic pattern here in the last few months or years for that matter. 
    Another point I would like to make is the Chickasaw Cession counties are getting an appropriation from the state, albeit it only $66,000, 66 percent of the corpus on the trust. 
    They are getting something that not another county or school district in the state gets. 
    They are getting, as we say, a land... something they are getting that no one else is getting there from the state-- 
    So I think that when we look at it from the standpoint that the state allows the local school districts to manage their own 16th Section lands subject to state oversight to make sure there is no donation of the land or disposition of the land that is not permitted under state law under the constitution, that there is no unequal treatment here. 
    This Court has also said that the equal protection clause is not applicable, I believe, and geographical differentials there. 
    It is between persons, and this is a geographical differential simply because the initial action of not reserving the 16th Section lands precipitated this whole lawsuit. 
    That is what started it. 
    The 16th Section lands were not reserved-- 
    Finally, some five or six years, seven years later, the state was allowed to select some lands, the Governor of the State, and that is the only thing that any named official in this complaint has ever done in regard to the Chickasaw Cession lands. 
    The federal government allowed the Governor to go out and select these lands in the Mississippi Delta which were virtually unsettled at the time, as I said, swamp and overflow land. 
    The Attorney General has never done anything in regard to these lands, nor has he been authorized to. 
    There has been no duties imposed upon the Attorney General of the state. 
    The mere fact that he may be a member of the board of education, or was at one time until the law was changed, just simply does not subject him to being enjoined in this thing. 
    There is nothing he can do. 
    He does not administer the trust. 
    He can't change it around. 
    He can't invest it in some other type of investment. 
    He can't change it around or change the interest paid. 
    The same is true of the Secretary of State. 
    He no longer sits on the board of education. 
    He is a member of the State Lieu Land Commission, and under our law, which is still in effect, and under the constitution lieu lands can be disposed of to this day, right now. 
    I believe there are something like 37 acres left that nobody really wants, but you can dispose of lieu lands under state law at this time. 
    So, it is our contention... and also the Superintendent of Education at one time was a member of the board of education. 
    He is not any more. 
    Ha was appointed by the board of education. 
    The Assistant Secretary of State, that person is basically someone there who keeps up with the state lands, where is the state land, has it been leased, is it coming up for renewal, and this sort of thing. 
    These offices, and that is what is sued here, they are only sued in their official capacity, have never acquired or disposed of the Chickasaw lieu lands or handled any funds from there. 
    In order to accomplish what the petitioners seek here, the State of Mississippi, the State of Mississippi would have to grant the relief. 
    If there is an injunction issued in this case, as petitioners seek, it would have to be out of the corpus of the State of Mississippi to pay this money in the future. 
    That is where it would come from, and we submit that this would be proscribed by the Eleventh Amendment on the decisions of this Court that start back with Hans v. Louisiana and come forward all the way through Green versus Mansour, I believe, decided this term by the Court. 
    One other matter we would point out to the Court at this time is that the... if the Court were to make the order that petitioners seek, we believe it would literally open the proverbial Pandora's Box. 
    Every school district in the southern district of the State of Mississippi would then sue the state, saying, well, another school district has got more money or more land or receives more income from there because of geographical variances than we do, so we will sue, and we will get our money back, or get some more money back, although we have sold our lands some years ago.

    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Mr. Arnold, what... to the extent that the plaintiff said in the complaint Mississippi is depriving the children of the plaintiff class of a minimally adequate education, and that is prohibited by the equal protection clause, now, just to that extent, is that barred in your view also by the Eleventh Amendment, that kind of a claim?
speaker="richard_lloyd_arnold" startTime="2794.020" stopTime="2808.458">
    Mr. Richard Lloyd Arnold 
    Your Honor, I believe it would be.

speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="2808.458" stopTime="2829.322">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Well, assuming that what the Court said was that you will apply a higher level of scrutiny if a child is denied a minimally adequate public school education, and that is alleged in the complaint, do you think the Eleventh Amendment absolutely bars that complaint in federal court?
speaker="richard_lloyd_arnold" startTime="2829.322" stopTime="2847.385">
    Mr. Richard Lloyd Arnold 
    --If the state is the real true party in interest, Your Honor, to require the state to expend funds, perhaps it would. 
    I think it would depend on the facts as they have evolved by the Court, but in the facts that we have alleged here--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="2847.385" stopTime="2850.576">

    Mr. Richard Lloyd Arnold 
    --Right, but as the facts are alleged here, I believe the Eleventh Amendment would proscribe that, would be a jurisdictional bar as far as the State of Mississippi, and it is the real party in interest in this case, we submit. 
    The other defendants are nominal defendants only for the purpose of attempting to evade the Eleventh Amendment jurisdictional bar which would apply to the state. 
    So, I think it would in this case.

    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    If you are right, why wouldn't the San Antonio case have gone off on the Eleventh Amendment grounds rather than the substantive equal protection decision?
speaker="richard_lloyd_arnold" startTime="2882.787" stopTime="2930.680">
    Mr. Richard Lloyd Arnold 
    I am not sure, Your Honor. 
    I don't know if they raised that or not in the San Antonio case. 
    I don't recall it in seeing if they raised the Eleventh Amendment as a jurisdictional bar in that case there. 
    But be that as it may, assuming arguendo that the Eleventh Amendment is not a jurisdictional bar in this case, there just simply has not been a cause of action stated that can survive a motion to dismiss under 12(b)(6). 
    A boilerplate allegation, just boilerplate, deprived of a minimally adequate education, it is just not there. 
    That is just not something I think this Court or any federal court could address. 
    The Court would be continually looking over this.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="2930.680" stopTime="2943.989">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    The reason it was difficult to address it, of course, is that the record that we got just didn't really reflect what other funding the state gives to peoples. 
    That is the handicap.
speaker="richard_lloyd_arnold" startTime="2943.989" stopTime="3074.614">
    Mr. Richard Lloyd Arnold 
    Perhaps in the record not, Your Honor, but in our brief, I believe, on Page 6 we referred to the minimum program for education that the State of Mississippi provides and what those funds go to, and how it goes to each school district based upon the teacher units. 
    Perhaps I did not make this clear as I should have to the Court. 
    But other than that, that fund going to these school districts throughout the state, the only other appropriation specifically out of the state treasury to education is the money to the Chickasaw Cession. 
    In that regard, I believe the figures will show, the most recent figures show in the State of Mississippi approximately 62 or 63 percent, in that range, of the total state budget is directed to educational matters throughout the state and the public education in the state. 
    I think this year it probably increased. 
    There have been some increases as far as the amount the state would pay in teachers' salaries. 
    But we would submit to the Court that the State of Mississippi is the real true party in interest in this case. 
    They are seeking what they call an injunction, but it would require the state to expend its funds out of the state treasury. 
    We also submit that there is no equal protection claim based upon the allegations made in the complaint here, because to the contrary of not receiving everything that the state appropriates to every school district, the districts in the northern section of the state receive more as far as appropriation from the State of Mississippi itself there. 
    And the fact that one school district may be able to raise more money because the land is valuable or it has minerals under it is not an equal protection question that should be addressed by this Court or any other lower federal court. 
    Thank you.

    Mr. T. H. Freeland, III 
    Absolutely, and that is the point also as to Meridian, for example. 
    What happened with that 16th Section land, it was sold, and the money is held in trust, and they get the income from the trust. 
    So, to say that they are not getting any income from 16th Section lands of the trust begs the question. 
    They still are, and our complaint is that we are not, and that is what this lawsuit is about. 
    It is about the trust. 
    It is not about how the State of Mississippi funds its schools around the state. 
    They do that on more or less an equal basis, and that is another basis for our complaint, however. 
    How is it that they can give everybody the same amount of state money, and yet acting as trustees of the trust give us not one nickel of the trust income and say that they are treating us on any sort of rational, reasonable basis? 
    And then they point at Rodriguez and say, well, there wasn't any discrimination in Rodriguez. 
    Of course there wasn't. 
    The case was tried, and that is what the trial court found, that the scheme in Rodriguez was facially neutral, but of course we allege here that we are dealing with rank discrimination, and that is what the pleadings have to say. 
    The Eleventh Amendment, we contend that this claim concerns only continuing violations of federal statutory and constitutional law, and it falls therefore within the rules permitting suits alleging conduct contrary to the supreme authority of the United States, as this Court mentioned in Penhurst, or it said in Green versus Mansour, a recent opinion, that such prospective relief as we are looking for vindicates the authority of the United States, and that is all we ask.
