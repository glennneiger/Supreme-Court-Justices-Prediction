Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Company v. Public Utilities Commission of California

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Mr. Harris, I think you may proceed whenever your are ready now.
speaker="robert_l_harris" startTime="74.564" stopTime="188.144">
    Mr. Robert L. Harris 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    This case comes from the State of California which has order Pacific Gas and Electric Company to include in its monthly billing envelope the fund solicitation messages of a third party. 
    We are required to include the message four times per year for a two-year period. 
    For the past 60 years, PG&amp;E has used the billing envelope to communicate its message through the PG&amp;E Progress. 
    The envelope has never been open to the public. 
    The California Supreme Court refused to hear Appellant's petition for writ of review, thus upholding the Commission's decision. 
    That decision was appealed to this Court, which noted probable jurisdiction. 
    The issue presented on appeal is whether or not the State of California can, consistent with the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, compel Pacific Gas and Electric Company, a privately owned, public utility, to include in its monthly billing envelope the fund solicitation of a third party, in this case, TURN, Toward Utility Rate Normalization. 
    Utility speech is protected by the First Amendment. 
    In Consolidated Edison, this Court decided in 1980 that the State of New York could not regulate the political speech that Consolidated Edison put in the billing envelope unless the state showed a compelling state interest for that regulation. 
    The right not to carry the message of others applies, indeed, to a corporation.

    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    What case holds that?
speaker="robert_l_harris" startTime="189.519" stopTime="229.066">
    Mr. Robert L. Harris 
    First National Bank of Boston versus Bellotti, decided in 1978. 
    In that case, this Court was faced with the issue as to whether or not the corporation was entitled to the protection of the First Amendment. 
    As a matter of fact, that was the first time the issue was squarely presented to this Court. 
    And, Justice Powell writing for the Court, said that the inherent worth of speech is not determined by identity. 
    He said that you look not to the identity of the person who is asserting the right, you look to see if the right that is being asserted is a right that is protected by the First Amendment.

    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Did that case hold that the kind of Wooley versus Maynard type of First Amendment rights the right not to carry a message you don't agree with applied to corporations?
speaker="robert_l_harris" startTime="239.485" stopTime="243.405">
    Mr. Robert L. Harris 
    That case was not faced with that issue.

    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Do, it didn't hold it?
speaker="robert_l_harris" startTime="244.435" stopTime="250.870">
    Mr. Robert L. Harris 
    It did not hold that a person had a right... that a corporation had a right not to carry somebody else's message.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="250.870" stopTime="255.307">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    So, what case of ours do you rely for that proposition?
speaker="robert_l_harris" startTime="255.307" stopTime="311.549">
    Mr. Robert L. Harris 
    There is no case that specifically holds that in the case of a corporation, however, we do rely heavily upon at least two cases, Miami Herald versus Tornillo and Wooley versus Maynard. 
    In the Miami Herald case, the Court held that the State of Florida could not compel the Miami Herald to publish the reply messages of third parties and in that decision Chief Justice Burger, writing for the Court, indicated that although the State of Florida made good arguments in terms of why a wide variety of views are necessary or desired, but the Court says in each instance where there is an enforced right of excess... access... necessarily calls for some mechanism, either consentual or governmental.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="311.549" stopTime="324.871">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Do you think there is a difference between a newspaper, which is not a regulated enterprise, and a public utility, which is quite strictly regulated, a difference for these purposes?
speaker="robert_l_harris" startTime="324.871" stopTime="379.911">
    Mr. Robert L. Harris 
    For these purposes, I think that the same principle that applies in Tornillo should apply here. 
    The mere fact of regulation, as this Court indicated in Consolidated Edison, does not preclude a utility from asserting First Amendment rights. 
    In Tornillo, the difference, of course, is that Tornillo involved a newspaper. 
    Here we are involved with a situation where you have a utility's billing envelope. 
    But, the principle is the same; that is, as the Court said in Tornillo, newspapers should not be compelled to publish that which reason tells them should not be published. 
    Here a utility should not be compelled to carry a message in the billing envelope that reason tells it should not be carried.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="379.911" stopTime="403.824">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Yes, but hasn't the Court distinguished between different kinds of media? 
    The Red Lion case, for example, involving the fairness doctrine who was dealing with the broadcast station which is regulated in a sense and yet the broadcasters are required to do certain things.
speaker="robert_l_harris" startTime="403.824" stopTime="443.745">
    Mr. Robert L. Harris 
    In the case of Red Lion, there Red Lion did not rest upon the basis that the broadcasters had a monopoly. 
    It rested rather upon the basis that they were using a scarce resource that was not open to the public. 
    Here, the mail is not a scarce resource. 
    And, as the Court reasoned in Red Lion, and again emphasized in Consolidated Edison, is that a broadcaster can only communicated through those scarce resources.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="443.745" stopTime="457.553">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Mr. Harris, do you concede that the Public Utilities Commission can require PG&amp;E to carry in its billing envelopes notices of public rate hearings or things of that kind?
speaker="robert_l_harris" startTime="457.553" stopTime="462.549">
    Mr. Robert L. Harris 
    Justice O'Connor, we have, indeed, carried such notices. 
    We are willing to do that.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="462.549" stopTime="471.452">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Well, I am asking if you concede whether the Public Utilities Commission can properly, under the First Amendment, require the company to do that?
speaker="robert_l_harris" startTime="471.452" stopTime="473.045">
    Mr. Robert L. Harris 
    Yes, we do concede that.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="473.045" stopTime="475.467">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    And, why is that different in your view?
speaker="robert_l_harris" startTime="475.467" stopTime="513.764">
    Mr. Robert L. Harris 
    That is different because in the case of a government notice, here an informational notice, informing utility customers that a hearing is going to be on such and such date or that there is a public health or safety matter pending somewhere concerning the utility, it is quite different from compelling PG&amp;E to carry in its billing envelope the fund raising message of a third party unregulated by the Commission, a third party who is free to--
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="513.764" stopTime="529.024">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Does this argument suggest, Mr. Harris, that the PUC order that we have before us, you would not object to it if they permitted TURN to insert only factual matter that dealt with the public utility business?

    Mr. Robert L. Harris 
    --No, it would not, Justice Brennan.

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    I asked you that question because I thought you answered Justice O'Connor that the PUC could require you to insert matter that dealt with rates.

    Mr. Robert L. Harris 
    --As I understand Justice O'Connor, it was whether or not we could be compelled to carry a state's notice. 
    As I understand your question, it is whether or not we can be compelled to carry a private person's notice.

    Unknown Speaker 
    That is right.

    Mr. Robert L. Harris 
    And, no, we cannot, I don't think, consistent with the First Amendment unless the state shows a compelling state interest for ordering us to do it. 
    We rely on Wooley versus Maynard.

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    It is the death or die or whatever.
speaker="robert_l_harris" startTime="580.971" stopTime="597.167">
    Mr. Robert L. Harris 
    No, it is not the death or die. 
    We also rely on the general principles of the First Amendment and that is compelling someone to speak when there are other ways available.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="597.167" stopTime="608.491">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Are you going so far as to suggest that a corporation's negative First Amendment right, as you perceive, is co-extensive with the individual?
speaker="robert_l_harris" startTime="608.491" stopTime="651.254">
    Mr. Robert L. Harris 
    Yes. 
    I think that this Court intimated that to a certain extent in Harper and Row versus Nation Enterprise by Justice O'Connor where she indicated and cited really that the right to speak also necessarily includes the right not to speak. 
    And then she quotes New York's Chief Judge Poole in terms of how they serve the same ultimate purpose. 
    The purpose that is being served here is the right not to be compelled to carry someone else's message.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="651.254" stopTime="654.644">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    It makes no difference whether it is an individual or a corporation?
speaker="robert_l_harris" startTime="654.644" stopTime="683.788">
    Mr. Robert L. Harris 
    I don't think it is any different at all whether it is an individual or a corporation. 
    You cannot look and say in the one instance this is a corporation, therefore, you carry the message without regard to anything else. 
    I think you have to look at the nature of a right involved. 
    Is that right protected by the First Amendment. 
    Here, the right involved is the right not to carry the message of someone else.

    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, I know, but the space doesn't belong to the utility, it belongs to the consumer, it was held below, right? 
    So, the Commission said we are going to fill up that space that belongs to the consumer with... periodically with something that we think the consumer would be more interested in.
speaker="robert_l_harris" startTime="764.943" stopTime="777.375">
    Mr. Robert L. Harris 
    It is true that that is what the Commission held. 
    But, we argue that the First Amendment cannot depend upon a metaphysical definition of space.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="777.375" stopTime="782.060">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    How does the First Amendment give the utility the right to use that space?

    What we are talking about, Justice White, in addition--

    Mr. Robert L. Harris 
    --If the question is who gets a free ride, the Commission can certainly deal with that question by assessing an economic value to that extra space. 
    But, here, in order for the consumer group to use that space, they must use an envelope, an envelope that the Commission has not said belongs to the rate payer. 
    And, in using that envelope we are compelled to associate, we are compelled to be the courier of someone else's message and we think that is protected by the First Amendment.

    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Mr. Harris, a moment ago you referred to the Harper and Row opinion and the suggestion that the right to speak and the right not to speak are somewhat similar. 
    Do you think the right not to be a courier is equivalent to the right not to speak?
speaker="robert_l_harris" startTime="843.084" stopTime="847.878">

    Mr. Robert L. Harris 
    We don't know, Your Honor.

    Mr. Robert L. Harris 
    I don't think so.

speaker="robert_l_harris" startTime="891.767" stopTime="898.154">
    Mr. Robert L. Harris

    Mr. Robert L. Harris 
    The envelope has not been held to be the property of the rate payer. 
    The envelope carries the name of PG&amp;E. 
    The envelope is material that we must send to the rate payer. 
    Whatever is in that envelope is associated with PG&amp;E.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="928.471" stopTime="938.715">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Of course, PG&amp;E could change that very easily if it wanted to by saying PG&amp;E and then adding TURN to the envelope, I mean, if it disliked the notion that it was misleading people.
speaker="robert_l_harris" startTime="938.715" stopTime="966.190">
    Mr. Robert L. Harris 
    Then the association would become even worse because there you have both PG&amp;E and TURN being the sender of the bill. 
    The purpose of the billing envelope is to send a bill. 
    Even aside from any other document included therein, it is the forced association, the forced compulsion to speak when we prefer not to speak that is at issue here.

    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Don't you think there is some difference between the loyal, feisty citizen of New Hampshire who didn't believe in live free or die and, therefore, didn't want to carry it on his license plate, kind of an individual type of thing that always struck me, though I must say I didn't agree with the result in that case, and the corporation.

    Mr. Robert L. Harris 
    It is not the same personality, of course, but it is the right that is involved, the right not to be the courier of someone else's message that I think is at stake here. 
    In Wooley, live free or die. 
    Here, we carry whatever the message may be that is given to us from TURN into a billing envelope that we have mailed out for over 60 years.

    Mr. Robert L. Harris 
    --No, Your Honor. 
    We have not even carried the message of those who support rate increases. 
    We have not carried the message of anyone other than PG&amp;E, although we have been requested by numerous jurisdictions, including the City and County of San Francisco to carry its messages. 
    But, as you can probably see, once we become involved in that, then we find ourselves irretrievably entangled in a mess. 
    This order requires that the PUC place itself in the position of selecting the speakers. 
    In other words, who uses this envelope, whether it is TURN or some other person. 
    They must first come to the Commission, must first indicate to the Commission the subject matter that it intends to talk about. 
    Once it indicates that, then the person must indicate whether or not the viewpoint expressed is one that is in support of PG&amp;E or opposed to PG&amp;E, because, as the decision said, it is the purpose to get a variety of views in addition and opposed to PG&amp;E. 
    I think the government really will become so entangled, unlike in PruneYard, in picking and choosing speakers, that government will end up being the ultimate arbitrator of what is or what is not said.

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Suppose some group came in with material, information, propaganda, whatever you want to call it, about tariffs, urging that tariffs be put on all imports from Japan. 
    Would the Commission have the authority to have that circulated?
speaker="robert_l_harris" startTime="1320.547" stopTime="1429.769">
    Mr. Robert L. Harris 
    Under this order, of course, it would, but I don't think that the Commission would necessarily have the authority to compel us to carry that message as promulgated. 
    I think it is important to remember that we do not take the position that the Commission can never compel us to carry someone's message. 
    We think that when the Commission endeavors to do that the Commission still has to show an overriding governmental interest for making us carry the message that you indicate. 
    And, in the instant case, the Commission, we don't think has met its burden of proof of showing that there is a compelling state interest for carrying TURN messages. 
    The Commission already has California state law which says specifically that intervenor funding can be given to people who intervene in rate cases. 
    For example, the Commission has awarded more than $160,000 to TURN during the past year, the last two years. 
    Pending now before the Commission is an application for over $800,000 by some other consumer group. 
    So, the Commission already has at its disposal a very clear mechanism for taking care of a problem that it wants to resolve. 
    Thus, there is no reason for it to broadly stifle First Amendment rights. 
    There is no reason for it to compel PG&amp;E to become the courier of TURN's message. 
    TURN can mail it to the householder.

    All fees associated with the case. 
    In PruneYard which, of course, is the case which they rely upon very heavily, there you had a shopping center, a shopping center that was open to the public to come and go as it pleased. 
    Some 25,000 people congregated their daily. 
    There was no requirement that government pick or choose the speakers. 
    The only requirement was that the facility... in that case the shopping center... be made available. 
    But, here, in order for government to carry out its order, it must become ensnarled in picking and choosing speakers, precisely what the Court said in Police Department of Chicago versus Mosley. 
    Government should not be involved in picking and choosing speakers. 
    When you have other ways to accomplish the governmental purpose, then government ought not to be allowed to then use means that will broadly stifle First Amendment activities. 
    Here, unlike in PruneYard, government did not permit PruneYard, as Justice Rehnquist pointed out, to open those portions of the shopping center that had never been open to the public. 
    Here, PG&amp;E is required to open its billing envelope that it has never opened to the public. 
    The question is basically one of does it really make sense, in view of all these other alternatives, to compel PG&amp;E to carry somebody else's message that can easily be disseminated in another manner.

    In order to put this case--

    Would you raise your voice some, Mr. Fogelman?

    Mr. Mark Fogelman 
    --Yes, Your Honor. 
    In order to put this case in its proper perspective, it is important to step back a moment and look at what the Commission did and why it did it. 
    PG&amp;E is the largest investor-owned gas and electric public utility in the country. 
    It has a lawful and practical monopoly for the delivery gas and electric service with in its service area, which included most of the State of California. 
    It recovers its reasonable costs and a reasonable rate of return in rates paid by the rate payers. 
    Its representation in Commission rate cases is very effective. 
    That representation by some of the best expert witnesses, consultants, and lawyers that money can buy is considered an operating expense to the utility and is paid for ultimately by the rate payers. 
    The public utility--
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1681.527" stopTime="1683.745">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger

    Mr. Mark Fogelman 
    It is my understanding that 100 percent of operating expenses would be recovered. 
    Of course, costs which are unreasonable or imprudent would be disallowed from the rate base and would be borne by the shareholders.

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    What are the limits on how this authority of the Commission can be used?
speaker="mark_fogelman" startTime="1723.979" stopTime="1773.177">
    Mr. Mark Fogelman 
    The Commission is limited by its state-authorized authority under the State Constitution and it is limited by the United States Constitution. 
    Insofar as it does not violate the principles of either of those authorities, it is essentially free to regulate public utilities in the public interest. 
    With respect to ordering a public utility to carry the messages of a third party, it is difficult to pose the precise limits. 
    There are probably many questions which the Commission ultimately will be required to decide in pursuing this program.

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Who is going to define those limits?

    Your Honor, ultimately the Commission will do so.

    Mr. Mark Fogelman 
    Because the purpose of this program, the primary purpose, the reason why the state has done what it has done here, is to permit consumer groups to solicit funds to increase their participation in Commission proceedings involving PG&amp;E. 
    And, insofar as the access furthers that primary purpose, access would be granted.

    It is very important, I think, for this Court to look at the purposes of the First Amendment which underlies the difference between affirmative speech and negative speech rights. 
    Insofar as someone is attempting to speak, and the state says you can't speak, you have a situation where the marketplace of ideas, society's interest in obtaining information, wide-open debate, is limited and that is the Consolidated Edison case.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="2270.413" stopTime="2278.847">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Well, in some cases, the Court has indicated at least that there is a concomitant right not to speak, has it not?
speaker="mark_fogelman" startTime="2278.847" stopTime="2306.148">
    Mr. Mark Fogelman 
    Yes, it has, Your Honor. 
    But, the underlying purposes which serve the right not to speak, the right to refrain from speaking and to refrain from associating the views of another, is very different from the marketplace of ideas notion. 
    It is, and this is not to be trivialized, it is an important purpose. 
    It is the sanctity and integrity of an individual's belief and thought. 
    It is the interest that was involved in Barnett--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="2306.148" stopTime="2310.506">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    And, you take the position that that does not extend to a corporation?
speaker="mark_fogelman" startTime="2310.506" stopTime="2333.965">
    Mr. Mark Fogelman 
    --I take the position that it does not extend to a corporation which is an artificial entity. 
    Furthermore, that it certainly doesn't extend to a public utility which is a very heavy regulated artificial entity. 
    Furthermore, I don't believe that it is co-extensive with the affirmative counterpart which serves entirely different interests.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="2333.965" stopTime="2356.972">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Does it strike you that the Commission's theory about broader participation or expression of a variety of views is basically a content-based determination? 
    The Commission has to look at what it is that TURN is doing and wants to say as the basis for its order that it be allowed to use the envelope.
speaker="mark_fogelman" startTime="2356.972" stopTime="2371.435">
    Mr. Mark Fogelman 
    The order in a broad sense is content-neutral, because the Commission has disavowed any intention of looking at the way that TURN solicits funds. 
    However, there is a limited purpose--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="2371.435" stopTime="2381.571">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    It certainly has to look at the nature of what TURN is doing and saying in order to decide that it is going to order that its message be carried.
speaker="mark_fogelman" startTime="2381.571" stopTime="2411.590">
    Mr. Mark Fogelman 
    --Well, to the extent that TURN's speech might hypothetically... and, again, this has never occurred... I might say in a similar experience, the UCAN situation, no problem certainly developed over a two-year period, but assuming that TURN were to exceed the purposes of the program and to make... engage in some sort of use of the extra space, which was not a solicitation of funds, in that situation the Commission would have to look at that. 
    I am not sure precisely what--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2411.590" stopTime="2418.977">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    At least it is content-based because... At least it says we prefer to have TURN's material in this extra space than the company's.

    Mr. Mark Fogelman 
    --What it says, Your Honor--

    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, isn't it? 
    Isn't that right? 
    It prefers TURN's to the company's material.
speaker="mark_fogelman" startTime="2423.132" stopTime="2430.817">
    Mr. Mark Fogelman 
    --No. 
    The company gets in the billing envelope every month of the year and it gets in the extra space at least eight months of the year and possibly all twelve.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2430.817" stopTime="2439.063">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    That may be so, but when it can't get into the envelope, can't use the extra space, the Commission has said we prefer TURN's material to go in the extra space.
speaker="mark_fogelman" startTime="2439.063" stopTime="2440.109">
    Mr. Mark Fogelman 
    Well, there is--

    Mr. Mark Fogelman 
    Your Honor, I certainly don't think that the corporation has a right to refrain from speaking which is implicated in this case. 
    I would think that you could possibly postulate a situation in which some area of corporate autonomy would be so threatened by a state compulsion to speak that there would be a violation of the principle.

    How about the John Birch Society?

    The compulsion of the John Birch Society to speak would--

speaker="mark_fogelman" startTime="2517.109" stopTime="2534.150">
    Mr. Mark Fogelman 
    --It is a corporation. 
    And, I guess my answer would have to be that you can postulate situations in which a corporation which concededly has some degree of private autonomy would have that autonomy violated by a compulsion to carry.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="2534.150" stopTime="2535.962">

    Take a regulated, a regulated activity, the three major commercial networks. 
    Could the Federal Communications Commission come down with an order and have it constitutionally enforced providing that no prime minister of any other country or any chief of state of any other country could be on the television program unless it was approved by the State Department?

    It certainly is not this case.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="2587.566" stopTime="2588.752">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    They are both regulated industries.
speaker="mark_fogelman" startTime="2588.752" stopTime="2594.907">
    Mr. Mark Fogelman 
    I am not sure, Your Honor, but it is a heavily regulated medium of communication, that is the airwaves.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="2594.907" stopTime="2617.069">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Well, a broadcast station, not necessarily a network... a broadcasting station is more regulated than the electric utility in the sense that the Federal Communications Commission can terminate their license and put them off the air every three years, I think it is.
speaker="mark_fogelman" startTime="2617.069" stopTime="2618.584">
    Mr. Mark Fogelman 
    That is true. 
    On the other hand--
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="2618.584" stopTime="2619.959">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    That is pretty heavy regulation, isn't it?

    Mr. Mark Fogelman 
    --That is heavy regulation. 
    Of course, the state here has granted a monopoly to a public utility and it is only at the pleasure of the state that the utility has that monopoly and it is to protect the public that the state regulates the public utility in the public interest.

    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Is an example of the sort of corporate First Amendment right that would be sustained the Tornillo case where certainly the Miami Press was a corporation and its First Amendment right to publish obviously allowed it not to have to carry the messages of others.
speaker="mark_fogelman" startTime="2652.694" stopTime="2659.443">
    Mr. Mark Fogelman 
    Well, the Tornillo case, in our view, does not turn on the fact that the Miami Herald was a corporation.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2659.443" stopTime="2674.765">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    No. 
    The press freedom extends to private individuals or corporations alike. 
    And, I take it what you are saying is the since the PG&amp;E is not in the business of running a newspaper, it isn't governed by that case.
speaker="mark_fogelman" startTime="2674.765" stopTime="2699.021">
    Mr. Mark Fogelman 
    Well, no, that is not what we are saying. 
    In some sense, a pamphlet, a document like Progress, would be equivalent to a newspaper. 
    PG&amp;E's position is that the billing envelope, the medium of delivery of its newspaper, is somehow subject to inviolable editorial discretion and that is not the case.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2699.021" stopTime="2712.063">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Would Tornillo come out any differently if the Florida statute had said along with the newspaper you have to put in a little envelope that you deliver the newspaper in, a retraction. 
    It doesn't have to be in the paper itself.
speaker="mark_fogelman" startTime="2712.063" stopTime="2749.799">
    Mr. Mark Fogelman 
    I think it might well have come out differently, particularly if the supplement were clearly identified as being the views of the speaker, and, furthermore, if there were no cost to the newspaper. 
    One of the critical features of Tornillo on which that case turned was the fact that there was a penalty on the affirmative speech of the newspaper. 
    Because the newspaper spoke about certain subjects, the right-of-reply statute was triggered and space had to be given. 
    That is not involved here because TURN gets access to the billing envelope under this program no matter what PG&amp;E says. 
    So, there is no chilling effect which would tend to cause the newspaper not to address a specific point of view.

    Is it perfectly clear that if the utility here had never initiated a program of using this space for its own propaganda, that this order would have ever come about?
speaker="mark_fogelman" startTime="3170.802" stopTime="3185.139">
    Mr. Mark Fogelman 
    I think it is fair to say that the Commission only recently discovered the existence of the extra space, this income-generating asset. 
    And, I think at that point it had a problem. 
    What do you do with it that utilizes it in the public interest?
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="3185.139" stopTime="3194.464">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Putting my question just in a little different form, do you think the case would be precisely the same in terms of its constitutional issues if the utility had never made use of the space for a similar purpose?
speaker="mark_fogelman" startTime="3194.464" stopTime="3196.730">
    Mr. Mark Fogelman 
    I think it would be quite similar, yes.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="3196.730" stopTime="3208.725">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Well, could the Commission order that any unused offices in PG&amp;E buildings be turned over to TURN for its office space and that sort of thing?
speaker="mark_fogelman" startTime="3208.725" stopTime="3279.180">
    Mr. Mark Fogelman 
    Well, the Commission has an obligation to see that the utility operates in an efficient manner and to the extent that unused offices are not being used, the Commission can make PG&amp;E rent them out presumably. 
    But, that is not this case. 
    If I may address some critical points here, I think there are five critical aspects of this decision that preclude the notion that there is a violation of the First Amendment. 
    First, there is no limitation on the continuing availability of Progress in the envelope. 
    PG&amp;E can still say whatever it wants, as much as it wants, in the billing envelope. 
    It only is possibly losing a subsidy of its speech to which it is not constitutionally entitled. 
    Second, each speaker is to determine its own content and TURN's solicitation messages will not be looked at insofar as they are consistent with the program. 
    Third, TURN's is required to identify itself as the source of the message and to indicate that neither PG&amp;E nor the Commission have reviewed the message. 
    This effectively means that there will be no confusion and this Court can be sure that if there is confusion the Commission will immediately take steps to rectify that.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="3279.180" stopTime="3285.303">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    To that extent, TURN is not free just to say what it wants to say. 
    So, two and three are somewhat contradictory.
speaker="mark_fogelman" startTime="3285.303" stopTime="3286.771">
    Mr. Mark Fogelman 
    I beg your pardon?
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="3286.771" stopTime="3292.034">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    I say to that extent TURN is not absolutely free to use the space exactly as it chooses.
speaker="mark_fogelman" startTime="3292.034" stopTime="3293.253">
    Mr. Mark Fogelman 
    You are right. 
    The disclosure--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="3293.253" stopTime="3293.894">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Two and three are inconsistent with one another.
speaker="mark_fogelman" startTime="3293.894" stopTime="3310.059">
    Mr. Mark Fogelman 
    --That is right. 
    We are making TURN carry that speech. 
    Fourth, there is no cost to PG&amp;E for the inclusion of TURN's message, not one cent. 
    So, the utility is really not being disabled in any sense or being required to pay any penalty.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3310.059" stopTime="3318.087">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Unless it wants to send out its material that it now can't... that under this order it can't send out. 
    If it is going to have to do that, it will have to pay for it.
speaker="mark_fogelman" startTime="3318.087" stopTime="3325.380">
    Mr. Mark Fogelman 
    It will have to pay for it, but it is still in the same billing envelope. 
    The only thing is it may be moved from the subsidized space to the unsubsidized space.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3325.380" stopTime="3326.396">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    I know, but it would cost them money.
speaker="mark_fogelman" startTime="3326.396" stopTime="3384.403">
    Mr. Mark Fogelman 
    And, finally, and this really ties to the program, the grant of access to the ultimate purpose, the money which TURN receives from its solicitation message must be used for participation in Commission proceedings involving PG&amp;E. 
    Basically, I think an expansive reading of the three cases, the Barnett, Wooley, and Tornillo cases are being asserted before this Court. 
    The Court is being asked to expand negative speech rights to a set of facts that they have never reached in the past. 
    And, I think it is fair to say that the Commission's decision is reasonable regulation. 
    It has been done in other states. 
    California is not alone in this. 
    It is an experimental program, but I submit to the Court that there is no infringement of any First Amendment rights here. 
    And, if there is an infringement, it is so minimal, the intrusion is so minimal and the state interests are sufficiently significant to warrant that intrusion.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="3384.403" stopTime="3394.821">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Have the other states that have done this taken the action that the California Commission did in declaring the unused or extra space to be rate payers' property?

    Mr. Mark Fogelman 
    No, Your Honor, they have not.

    Yes, they have.

   Rebuttal of Robert L. Harris
speaker="robert_l_harris" startTime="3406.628" stopTime="3466.198">
    Mr. Robert L. Harris 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    I have just a few notes. 
    In regards to the ownership of the extra space, we would disagree, as we did in our reply brief to their motion to dismiss, that that is foreclosed. 
    And, we quoted from the California Supreme Court itself at 25 Cal. 3rd 891, where the Court explained that 
    "when the issue is a question of law rather than a fact, the prior determination of. " 
    --and I am adding in the word Commission... 
    "is not conclusive either if injustice would result or if the public interest requires that litigation not be foreclosed. " 
    As we indicated earlier, if the California Supreme Court or any other California court decided that this was critical in any other proceeding, it could be relitigated.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3466.198" stopTime="3474.087">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    You wouldn't ask us though here to second guess a state court on what is the property interest?
speaker="robert_l_harris" startTime="3474.087" stopTime="3479.395">
    Mr. Robert L. Harris 
    No, no. 
    I just wanted to clear up the record in terms of whether or not this is forever foreclosed.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="3479.395" stopTime="3480.036">
    Unknown Speaker 
    All right.
speaker="robert_l_harris" startTime="3480.036" stopTime="3493.812">
    Mr. Robert L. Harris 
    We certainly don't believe it is. 
    First of all, we believe it is contrary to what this Court said in New York Public Service Commission versus Public Board; that when rate payers pay for service, they do not pay for the property used to deliver that service.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3493.812" stopTime="3502.277">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    We judge the case on the basis of the property... that that unused space is the property of the consumer. 
    That is the way the case gets here, isn't it?
speaker="robert_l_harris" startTime="3502.277" stopTime="3503.323">
    Mr. Robert L. Harris 
    No.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3503.323" stopTime="3507.167">
    Justice Byron R. White

    We can't second guess the state court on that.
speaker="robert_l_harris" startTime="3507.167" stopTime="3514.944">
    Mr. Robert L. Harris 
    No. 
    We brought the issue here, Your Honor, on the basis that it infringed upon our First Amendment rights--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3514.944" stopTime="3517.052">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Even if the property does belong to the--
speaker="robert_l_harris" startTime="3517.052" stopTime="3529.954">
    Mr. Robert L. Harris 
    --Even if that ephemeral concept of extra space, which may be there one month, may not be there the next month, it is the putting of that message in the billing envelope which belongs to PG&amp;E that is at issue.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="3529.954" stopTime="3537.904">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    --Can PG&amp;E just put their bills on heavier paper and solve this problem? 
    [Laughter]
speaker="robert_l_harris" startTime="3537.904" stopTime="3616.107">
    Mr. Robert L. Harris 
    The Commission cautioned us not to do that, Your Honor, and we would try to be fair. 
    [Laughter] 
    But, on the other hand, it is quite possible for TURN to use heavy paper for its message and preclude us from putting in Progress. 
    I think what this case really points out is what this Court said in Cohen versus California; that it is the purpose of the First Amendment to remove government from picking and choosing and from deciding who should speak, when they should speak, etcetera. 
    I think it is even more important here, because here the State of California has at its disposal many other ways to resolve this problem and it never has to become involved in picking this group or picking that group. 
    If the problem that is bothering California that there is some extra space there where, as it said, it is not recouping the economic value of that space, then let it do what it always does in a rate-making proceeding, assess a value. 
    So, I think that this case clearly comes down in terms of saying that here is a case where government really has gotten itself involved in a situation that it will be impossible to retrieve itself from, picking and choosing speakers. 
    Thank you very much, Your Honor.
