    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    We will hear arguments first this morning in Thomas against the Superintendent of the Ohio Reformatory for Women. 
    Mr. Stanley, you may proceed whenever you are ready.
speaker="christopher_danahy_stanley" startTime="14.970" stopTime="370.902">
    Mr. Christopher Danahy Stanley 
    Mr. Chief Justice, members of the Court, if it please the Court, ladies and gentlemen of the audience, it is an honor to appear before the Court. 
    I understand from the clerk that this is the 50th anniversary of the very first argument in this building, so I am doubly honored that I am appearing before the Court. 
    I would first express what I would consider my mea culpa. 
    I wish that I had filed objections in this case. 
    It would have prevented having to come up to the Supreme Court for the decision in this case. 
    It would have prevented a lot of time from having to be expended on this case. 
    However, I didn't, and I think that given the case law involved in this Court and the circuits that it wasn't necessary, and I would like to proceed with the argument. 
    A little history of the case. 
    My client was charged with murder in Cuyahoga County in Cleveland, where she was convicted. 
    On appeal, Judge Krensler, who is now a Federal District Court Judge in Cleveland, held that from the current psychological and sociological research has emerged a profile of a battered woman as one who displays unique behavioral patterns and psychological characteristics as well as differences in reaction and perception, all of which are not within the knowledge of the average juror. 
    He concluded that without expert testimony on the battered woman syndrome, a jury would be unable to have a sufficient comprehension of the defendant's state of mind at the time of the homicide. 
    The Ohio Supreme Court granted review of the case and reversed the reversal. 
    I then went to the Federal District Court Judge in Cleveland. 
    It was referred to a magistrate, who recommended that the petition for habeas corpus be denied. 
    The District Court Judge had a de novo determination. 
    Notwithstanding the failure to file objections, the Sixth Circuit, implementing what is now known as the Walters policy, held that by failing to object to the magistrate's report, one waives the right to appeal to the circuit from the District Court order. 
    I then petitioned for cert and this Court granted it. 
    There are basically four points I would like to make on argument today. 
    The first and most important one is the interplay between the magistrate's act and Article 3 of the United States constitution. 
    When our forefathers were setting up the new government after the Revolutionary War, they were very wary of putting all the governmental power, basically the legislative, executive, and judiciary, into the same hands. 
    Accordingly, they felt that it was necessary that there be an independent judiciary. 
    They wrote Article 3. 
    Article 3 basically says that there shall be a Supreme Court and such inferior courts as Congress may establish. 
    It also said that those courts were to be staffed by judges who have life tenure and a set salary. 
    I must admit that Article 3 at first blush seems a relatively simple statement of fact. 
    It spawned a great deal of litigation in this Court. 
    I do not pretend to understand Article 3 and the litigation it has spawned, particularly in such cases as Northern Pipeline. 
    However, with regard to the interplay between Article 3 and the Magistrates Act, this Court has quite clearly stated what the law is. 
    Now, the Magistrates Act was provided in Congress in 1976 and subsequently amended basically to set up a series of inferior judicial officers, inferior, that is, to the District Courts, to help the District Courts with the overwhelming case law that they were being presented with. 
    Basically, they may consider nondispositive pretrial matters, conduct evidentiary hearings of dispositive motions, habeas corpus, et cetera. 
    In the section that we are dealing with here, that is, 28 USC 636(b)(1)(B), they can conduct hearings on a habeas corpus and then provide the judge with proposed findings of fact and recommendations for disposition by the Judge. 
    Parties may file objections, and the Judge shall make a de novo determination of those portions of the report objected to. 
    However, the last sentence, I think, is the key. 
    The Court may accept, reject, or modify the report. 
    This Court in several cases has considered the interplay between Article 3 and the Magistrates Act, most often through the pen of Chief Justice Burger. 
    The basic cases are the United States versus Raddatz and Mathews versus Weber. 
    This Court quite clearly has said the Magistrates Act is constitutional because the ultimate decisionmaking rests with the United States District Court. 
    Those cases basically came up with three points. 
    One, in going over the legislative history of the Magistrates Act, this Court has said Congress was sensitive to the Article 3 considerations. 
    They were sensitive to not putting in a magistrate Article 3 duties. 
    Hence this Court stressed and Congress stressed that the ultimate adjudicatory determination was reserved to the District Court. 
    The second point this Court has made in Raddatz and Mathews is, the Court says that the ultimate authority and responsibility to make an informed formal determination must remain with the Judge. 
    Three, the Court stressed the magistrate's role is one of helping the Court to narrow the dispute, focusing on the legal issues. 
    However, it again stressed the Court alone remains the ultimate decisionmaker. 
    In sum, this Court said in Raddatz and Weber, the delegation of the magistrate to hear issues does not violate Article 3 so long as the ultimate decision is made by the District Court.

speaker="christopher_danahy_stanley" startTime="416.356" stopTime="441.681">
    Mr. Christopher Danahy Stanley 
    First of all, if I may say, the issues were fully briefed. 
    When I filed the petition for habeas corpus, I included with it a memorandum of law concerning the issues I was to raise. 
    It was approximately 20 pages long. 
    In my opinion, this Court's decisions in Raddatz and Weber mandate independent judicial review of the magistrate's report by a District Court.
speaker="lewis_f_powell_jr" startTime="441.681" stopTime="443.103">
    Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. 
    On its own... on its own initiative.

    Mr. Christopher Danahy Stanley 
    No, on the initiative... what is included in 626(b)(1)(B). 
    That is, failure to object... the penalty for failure to object as enunciated by Congress is no de novo determination, he Court may accept, reject, or modify the report of the magistrate. 
    It seems that this Court has quite clearly said the Court must be the ultimate decisionmaker. 
    Otherwise, you have a situation where the magistrate ends up being an Article 3 judge. 
    For instance, in the Sixth--

    That's correct.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="489.094" stopTime="492.477">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    And that is what we are using our time up for.

    Mr. Christopher Danahy Stanley 
    Pardon?
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="493.566" stopTime="496.869">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    That is what we are using our time up for.
speaker="christopher_danahy_stanley" startTime="496.869" stopTime="522.617">
    Mr. Christopher Danahy Stanley 
    Well, Your Honor, I believe it is a much more serious matter than that. 
    Here we have Raddatz and Weber requiring a District Court judge to make a final determination. 
    The Walters policy as enunciated by the Sixth Circuit and other circuits in their policies have stated that the District Court doesn't really even have to consider the case if you don't file objections. 
    That raises a magistrate to the ultimate decisionmaker in a case.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="522.617" stopTime="543.141">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Mr. Stanley, if you are right that Raddatz and the other case stand for the proposition that the District Court is an independent adjudicator, the adoption of your view would really allow counsel losing before the magistrate to simply go directly to the Court of Appeals without even paying any attention to the District Court.
speaker="christopher_danahy_stanley" startTime="543.141" stopTime="571.948">
    Mr. Christopher Danahy Stanley 
    Well, I disagree with you, Justice Rehnquist. 
    First of all, the magistrate's report is not a final appealable order. 
    Congress in writing the statute says, if there are no objections, the District Court doesn't have to make a de novo review, but the District Court still must consider the case. 
    It must be the ultimate decisionmaker. 
    The District Court then making an independent review but with the magistrate having focused the issues spends much less time on the case, makes a determination, and that is... it is from that--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="571.948" stopTime="579.723">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    But the District Court would surely be even more focused if it had the benefit cf objections to the magistrate's report from the losing party.
speaker="christopher_danahy_stanley" startTime="579.723" stopTime="619.851">
    Mr. Christopher Danahy Stanley 
    --I am not going to disagree with you, Your Honor. 
    However, it seems to me, for instance, in this case, where I had filed a 20-page brief, the issues were before the Court. 
    It was an issue of law. 
    This is the sixth court that my client has been to, that I have been to on her behalf. 
    To say that there is a waiver of anything is, in my opinion, untenable. 
    We have... I raised the issue. 
    I briefed the issue. 
    The magistrate came to a different conclusion. 
    All the District Court judge had to do is in fact what he did dc, Because he did conduct a de novo determination anyway. 
    What he did do was read my brief, read the magistrate's report, come to a conclusion.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="619.851" stopTime="654.392">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Well, in this instance, how was Article 3 violated, because by your own statement the District Court did give review to the magistrate's finding here, and the finding became the District Court finding. 
    Now, if you make no objections in the District Court, if the proceedings at trial have been in the District Court initially, a court of appeals is not going to consider things that aren't raised at the District Court level. 
    Why should it be different with the magistrate's report that is considered by the District Court?
speaker="christopher_danahy_stanley" startTime="654.392" stopTime="682.402">
    Mr. Christopher Danahy Stanley 
    Well, Justice O'Connor, if one reads the opinions in the circuits, there is only one circuit, the Fourth, which discusses this issue in terms of procedural default. 
    The Sixth Circuit does not talk in terms of procedural default. 
    The Sixth Circuit says specifically you waive your right to appeal, period. 
    Now, in a procedural default, you are not waiving your right to appeal. 
    You still have the right to appeal, but the Circuit Court says you didn't preserve it below. 
    It seems to me--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="682.402" stopTime="687.435">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    The effect is the same. 
    In either event the Court of Appeals wouldn't be hearing it. 
    Isn't that right?
speaker="christopher_danahy_stanley" startTime="687.435" stopTime="724.882">
    Mr. Christopher Danahy Stanley 
    --That's correct, but it seems to me in a situation like this it is a question of form over substance. 
    Where you have, Number One, a brief on the issue, the matters that are in issue before the Court on behalf of the petitioner and the magistrate's report, you have a right as enunciated by Congress to appeal from the denial of a habeas corpus. 
    That is an independent right that Congress has seen fit to give to a petitioner in a habeas corpus proceeding. 
    I don't know that a court can say we are going to ignore Congress and we are going to impose this penalty. 
    Further--

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Well, Mr. Stanley, did I understand you to say that the recommendation of the magistrate to which you did not object was nevertheless the subject of de novo review by the District Judge?

    Mr. Christopher Danahy Stanley 
    Well, to be honest with you, Judge, as you pointed out in your dissent in Northern Pipeline, I am not convinced that I know what--

speaker="christopher_danahy_stanley" startTime="819.921" stopTime="830.199">
    Mr. Christopher Danahy Stanley 
    --Yes, Your Honor. 
    Only because Article 3 in interpreting the Magistrates Act has said the reason that it is constitutional is that the decisionmaker must be the District Court.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="830.199" stopTime="831.150">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, it always is.
speaker="christopher_danahy_stanley" startTime="831.150" stopTime="845.490">
    Mr. Christopher Danahy Stanley 
    That's correct, and since the District Court must review the magistrate's report, whether objections are filed or not, it seems to me that the Walters policy and the other circuits are wrong when they say that there is a waiver of the right to appeal, because--

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    You have consumed 17 minutes now on this point. 
    If you want to save some time for the other matters, you should get on to it. 
    I must say that if you are right, then even if Congress said you either object or you waive, that would be unconstitutional.
speaker="christopher_danahy_stanley" startTime="861.808" stopTime="867.673">
    Mr. Christopher Danahy Stanley 
    --I would agree with you. 
    A second point that I wish to make in my remaining 13 minutes--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="867.673" stopTime="869.345">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    May I ask one question before you go to your second point?
speaker="christopher_danahy_stanley" startTime="869.345" stopTime="869.654">
    Mr. Christopher Danahy Stanley 
    --Certainly.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="869.654" stopTime="879.731">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Do you understand the Sixth Circuit rule to be that they think the statute compels a waiver, or that as a matter of practice in the Sixth Circuit we will enforce the waiver rule?
speaker="christopher_danahy_stanley" startTime="879.731" stopTime="939.820">
    Mr. Christopher Danahy Stanley 
    Well, their writing, the language that they said was, although you may file... objections is something that you may or may not do, we feel they felt that under the supervisor power they could force this issue by making it a rule in the Sixth Circuit. 
    One of the dangers of that in my opinion, Justice Stevens, is the fact that different circuits have different rules for jurisdiction, and if we go to what was going to be my third point, which is that the courts cannot limit their own jurisdiction that Congress has given them, in different circuits some people can appeal. 
    In four of the circuits you can appeal no matter what the magistrate does, whether or not you file objections or not, you can appeal from the denial of a habeas. 
    In the sixth circuit you cannot appeal from a denial if you do not file objections. 
    In one of the circuits they talk about procedural default, and one of the circuits, the Eighth Circuit, rejects the waiver theory. 
    So, you have differing jurisdictions of the Court of Appeals as a result from these differing policies with regard to whether or not you file objections.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="939.820" stopTime="944.825">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, there may not be a difference after this case is decided.
speaker="christopher_danahy_stanley" startTime="944.825" stopTime="1028.000">
    Mr. Christopher Danahy Stanley 
    Hopefully not. 
    My second argument is a due process argument as it was enunciated in United States versus Raddatz by the Chief Justice, which basically says that what due process you are entitled to is appropriate to the nature of the case. 
    Citing Mathews versus Aldridge, it goes into the question of private interests, the risk of erroneous determination by reason and process supported, and the public interest in administrative burdens. 
    It seems to me that when we where talking about the great petition of habeas corpus, and where Congress has required the right to appeal as giving you that right, that due process requires in habeas corpus that the ultimate decisionmaking be with the District Court, and that the right to appeal be given to a petitioner. 
    I have already mentioned in reference to Justice Stevens' argument my third point, which is that I do not believe that the courts can limit their own jurisdiction. 
    I would say that in summation, that Walters is wrong because it limits their jurisdiction. 
    Congress never said in its statute that a failure to object is a waiver. 
    There already exists a penalty for failure to object, which is, you do not get a de novo determination. 
    The Statute says, if there are objections, there shall be a de novo determination. 
    That is the penalty for failure to object, not waiver of the right to appeal.

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr.

speaker="christopher_danahy_stanley" startTime="1032.675" stopTime="1055.439">
    Mr. Christopher Danahy Stanley 
    No, I believe the judge may give... in fact, if the court... the court can do whatever it decides to do. 
    As the Chief Justice said in Raddatz and Weber, the magistrate is there to help the District Court in its overburdened case law. 
    It is there to focus the issues. 
    The Court can reject or give whatever weight it wants to to the findings of the magistrate.

    Mr. Christopher Danahy Stanley 
    --Well, I will agree with you as far as the timetable is concerned. 
    There was nothing submitted after the magistrate's report. 
    The case was assigned to Judge Conti's docket. 
    I filed the brief with Judge Conti's docket, a 20-page brief that fully outlined our position on the issues of law.

    Mr. Christopher Danahy Stanley 
    Yes, so I mean when I file it it goes to Judge Conti. 
    Judge Conti fills out a little form and sends it to the magistrate. 
    The magistrate sends it back to Judge Conti with the report recommendation. 
    I would indicate for the record in... I was responding to Justice Brennan that two of the circuits in this country indicate that where there is no objections, the District Court does not even have to review the magistrate's report. 
    There is nothing more for the District Court to do in the case. 
    It elevates in my opinion a magistrate to a Judge. 
    I would reserve the rest of my time for rebuttal.

    All right. 
    Do you think there is any difference between the magistrate's recommendations on factual findings as opposed to points of law? 
    As I understand your argument, it makes no difference which it is, an issue of law or of fact. 
    There is no waiver in your view.
speaker="christopher_danahy_stanley" startTime="1178.950" stopTime="1218.617">
    Mr. Christopher Danahy Stanley 
    That's correct. 
    I recognize that four of the circuits have held that a waiver... that a failure to object waives the right to appeal factual findings but not of legal conclusions. 
    As Justice Marshall pointed out in his dissent in Raddatz, I believe that Justice Brandeis, and I would agree with him, indicates that in habeas corpus petition you are entitled to review of the facts and the law by a judge, and in my opinion because of the great place that we have for the petition of habeas corpus in our society, and the fact that we are talking about a liberty interest, we really must have a judge, and based upon the statute, which holds that the Judge is the ultimate decisionmaker, the judge must decide everything.

    What is here is the question of whether or not the Sixth Circuit's determination in my case that I could not appeal from the District Court order is viable. 
    I say to this Court that my client has the right to appeal to the Sixth Circuit from the denial by the District Court Judge of a petition for habeas corpus.

    Mr. Christopher Danahy Stanley 
    You have to understand, Justice Blackmun, I am an assault practitioner. 
    Up until Friday, when the Circuit Court Judge granted a stay based upon your latest Mitchell versus Wyatt, I was supposed to go back tomorrow to Akron to start a month-long jury trial. 
    I have to put out my time in each case as best I see it. 
    In this case I had filed a brief. 
    The issues were before the District Court Judge. 
    I felt to file an objection would have been just simply an exercise in futility, that the magistrate considered my petition, my position on the issus, and made his recommendation.
speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="1396.936" stopTime="1398.567">

    So it was not an oversight.
speaker="christopher_danahy_stanley" startTime="1398.567" stopTime="1411.396">
    Mr. Christopher Danahy Stanley 
    No, it was simply a matter where I didn't feel that it would add anything to the controversy before Judge Conti by filing objections. 
    I would have simply refiled my brief that I had already filed.

    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Mr. Stanley, how is conditioning an appeal in these cases on filing of objections any different than conditioning an appeal on the timely filing of a brief or payment of a filing fee or something of that kind?
speaker="christopher_danahy_stanley" startTime="1426.968" stopTime="1435.072">
    Mr. Christopher Danahy Stanley 
    Well, I think it is different because, Number One, Congress has given a petitioner for a writ of habeas corpus the right to appeal. 
    Number Two, Congress--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="1435.072" stopTime="1444.148">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Well, even so, can't the courts enforce a requirement filing memos and briefs on timely basis and so forth?
speaker="christopher_danahy_stanley" startTime="1444.148" stopTime="1445.730">
    Mr. Christopher Danahy Stanley 
    --Certainly.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="1445.730" stopTime="1447.781">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    So why not this?
speaker="christopher_danahy_stanley" startTime="1447.781" stopTime="1506.978">
    Mr. Christopher Danahy Stanley 
    Well, because this is where a Circuit Court is saying, we are not going to let you appeal because you didn't do something in the District Court, namely, file objections. 
    Number One, it goes to statutory construction of Congress's intent, which this Court has repeatedly said Congress's intent is for the District Court to be the ultimate decisionmaker, not the magistrate. 
    Number Two, the penalty for failure to file objections is quite clear from Congress's intent that you just simply do not get a de novo review. 
    There is no express policy outlined in any of the statutes or any of the legislative history from Congress that they expected a waiver of the right to appeal. 
    I would say to this Court that where you have a petition for habeas corpus and the right to appeal, that the Circuit Courts cannot limit their own jurisdiction. 
    As I pointed out to Justice Stevens, you now have a mishmash in the different circuits where in some circuits you can appeal, even though you have a failure to file objections, and in other circuits you can't, and I think that is untenable.

    No.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1537.159" stopTime="1540.620">

    Mr. Richard David Drake 
    Yes, and I am saying the Sixth Circuit has adopted it under its supervisory powers. 
    The rule is--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1546.256" stopTime="1548.376">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    A permissible rule that is not required by statute.
speaker="richard_david_drake" startTime="1548.376" stopTime="1550.287">

    --A rule which is not only permissible, but--

speaker="richard_david_drake" startTime="1551.198" stopTime="1560.434">
    Mr. Richard David Drake 
    --Fosters Congressional intent. 
    I don't believe that the Magistrates Act actually speaks directly to this question. 
    The question is whether the Sixth Circuit may do this, not whether it is compelled to do so.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1560.434" stopTime="1564.378">
    Justice John Paul Stevens

    It is definitely not a jurisdictional rule.

    Mr. Richard David Drake 
    The rule was promulgated in a case, United States versus Waltars, which is cited in the brief.

    Mr. Richard David Drake 
    The circuits could in their wisdom, I believe, though, if you look to the Congressional intent underlying the Magistrates Act, a circuit who declines to adopt the Sixth Circuit rule is essentially for reasons unknown to me fostering upon itself review de novo.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="1636.130" stopTime="1637.100">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    But it would be permissible, you are saying.
speaker="richard_david_drake" startTime="1637.100" stopTime="1638.181">
    Mr. Richard David Drake 
    It would be permissible.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="1638.181" stopTime="1644.275">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    You don't urge us then to try to make the rule uniform or not?
speaker="richard_david_drake" startTime="1644.275" stopTime="1667.293">
    Mr. Richard David Drake 
    I think that if affirmance is given in this case, we might have more circuits adopting this rule in their own self-interest. 
    As I pointed out in the brief, the difficulty is not uniform to all the circuits. 
    For instance, the District of Columbia Circuit apparently has very little difficulty, if you look at the statistics, whereas the Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, and now the Eleventh Circuits are having considerable difficulty.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="1667.293" stopTime="1673.076">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    At least there is a question as to whether this was a proper exercise of the supervisory power.

    Mr. Richard David Drake 
    I believe that is the only question before the Court.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="1674.826" stopTime="1680.810">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    And Congress did indicate what a penalty for failure to file was, or is.
speaker="richard_david_drake" startTime="1680.810" stopTime="1683.064">
    Mr. Richard David Drake 
    As to the District Court, yes.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="1683.064" stopTime="1689.747">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Why should a court impose a further penalty for failure to file?
speaker="richard_david_drake" startTime="1689.747" stopTime="1787.451">
    Mr. Richard David Drake 
    Because the purpose underlying the Magistrates Act... and it had had a checkered history. 
    The original 1968 version encountered a series cf adverse judicial decisions, including ones from this Court, and it was in response to your invitation and that of the Chief Justice that the 1976 amendments were actually enacted. 
    The theory underlying the 1976 amendments very much parallels the master system user in the United Kingdom or the referee system used in most states today, which is to use non-Article 3 jurists, here magistrates, to delineate the scope of the dispute. 
    Oftimes you will have in a civil case a multi-count complaint filed. 
    The magistrate might recommend summary judgment as to let's say 18 of those, and the litigant will then have... essentially the magistrate will serve as a filtration system, where the litigant will then make an intelligent judgment as to whether or not he wants to proceed. 
    That is the entire theory underlying this, that the magistrates will filter this litigation in the nondispositive context. 
    The review is under the clearly erroneous standard. 
    In the dispositive context, as I said, the Magistrates Act did not fare well in the Courts. 
    They were very, very aware of Article 3 difficulties, and they made it absolutely clear that if the litigants so desire, he could obtain, he had the opportunity to obtain review anew, but he could forfeit that opportunity. 
    This case is tantamount in my opinion strictly to a failure to prosecute or any other procedural default.

    --First of all, the Sixth Circuit rule is not inflexible at all. 
    As I pointed out in the brief, there was a pro se litigant, and the Sixth Circuit found in that instance that there was cause for the failure to... the procedural default, and wanted to avoid a manifest injustice. 
    The rule is not inflexible, and we are not talking about jurists who are unreasonable.

    Mr. Richard David Drake 
    --I think that in the case of a pro se applicant, that would be sufficient. 
    He is doing the best he can. 
    Here we are talking about someone who is admitted to the bar, and in point of fact Mr. Stanley had filed four claims. 
    When he went to the Sixth Circuit, he abandoned three of those. 
    Here we have a District Judge who sui sponte took it upon himself to unnecessarily waste time on three claims which obviously he had intended to abandon anyway. 
    The Act would have worked in this instance. 
    He would have filed objections in theory on only one of the four claims, and Judge Conti, who at that time had been elevated to the Circuit Court, would not have had to deal with 75 percent of this litigation, Your Honor, and that is what the Sixth Circuit is trying to do, not take away someone's right to appeal, but merely mandate that they perfect that right to appeal, and not... here we have not only a failure to file objections, but in the Sixth Circuit Mr. Stanley did not so much as file a reply brief indicating why he hadn't filed the objections. 
    Even though our brief dealt at length and initially with this question, Mr. Stanley did not appear at the oral argument. 
    The Circuit Court below had neither written nor oral explanation as to why these objections were not filed.

    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Mr. Drake, what about a situation when the District Court sui sponte alters the finding or recommendation of the magistrate on, for example, a point of law, and no objections had been filled in a timely basis, but the District Court on its own reaches some legal conclusion different from the magistrate's recommendation. 
    Would there have to be a right to appeal from that?
speaker="richard_david_drake" startTime="2076.525" stopTime="2080.789">
    Mr. Richard David Drake

    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Yes.

    Mr. Richard David Drake 
    Had Judge Conti granted the writ as to one of these claims, and I here have to speculate to some degree, because it has never really arisen in the Sixth Circuit, but it would be my judgment the state of Ohio could appeal, that Mr. Stanely could appeal raising as the sole ground for affirmance that relied upon in the District Court, and could neither file cross appeal nor could he rely upon the other three grounds that were not considered by Judge Conti.

    Here we are talking about some people that are in prison but aren't that educated, and I am certain that if you can read at all you understand what that notice means. 
    It is not ambivalent or ambiguous to any extent whatsoever, and I think Mr. Stanley's contrary assertion is sheer sophistry, Your Honor. 
    That is a very explicit notice. 
    And it is even in capital letters, as you can see at Page 50 of the joint appendix.

    Mr. Richard David Drake 
    If there were no notice? 
    Yes. 
    For instance, in the United States versus Walters itself had the Sixth Circuit promulgated a supervisory role, and in that case it would have taken away the right, the government's right to appeal, as it turns out, but had it gone the other way, I do see due process concerns. 
    I think that notice is absolutely essential.

    Mr. Richard David Drake 
    No, Your Honor. 
    For instance, had there been a rule, any rule of appellate procedure is not obviously incorporated in every order of a Court. 
    Attorneys are deemed to be on notice, and are to some degree pro se litigants, are deemed to be on notice of rules that are long standing. 
    This Court doesn't for instance, send me rules of practice every time I come here, but I think that the rule... it is the wiser course, because we are--

    Mr. Richard David Drake 
    --Right, which is what we have here, is essentially a rule which the Sixth Circuit perceives, and I agree, is very congruent with the intents underlying the Magistrates Act. 
    You simply cannot have your Article 3 District Judge being bypassed and, sandbagged. 
    The idea is to serve as some sort of filtration system. 
    Congress certainly did not mean to aid Article 3 District Judges and to the detriment of Article 3 Circuit Court judges.

    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, you certainly wouldn't need to reach any constitutional argument if notice weren't provided by the court rule. 
    All you would have to say or hold here is that it was an improvident exercise of his supervisory power not to require noticed. 
    You wouldn't have to reach any constitutional issue.
speaker="richard_david_drake" startTime="2384.570" stopTime="2516.785">
    Mr. Richard David Drake 
    I would agree. 
    Here notice, express notice was given, Your Honor. 
    Mr. Stanley acknowledges that he got the notice. 
    The fact that he filed the motion for extension of time, which was granted, is indicative of that fact. 
    There is no dispute that... the only dispute is his belated misinterpretation of what that fairly plain language meant, Your Honor. 
    But once again, I would point out that we are here dealing with a court who has decided to exercise its supervisory power. 
    Reversal can only obtain if that supervisory power is repugnant either to the Constitution or statute. 
    Mr. Stanley has pointed out no repugnancy that I can ascertain. 
    He simply disagrees with the wisdom of the supervisory rule. 
    Here I believe that, and I believe the statistics indicate that there should be some latitude here for the various circuits to operate in the manner that they wish to operate absent some repugnancy to an overriding statute or the Constitution. 
    And no one has said that this rule is mandated nationwide. 
    Some circuits, particularly the Eighth Circuit, obviously doesn't perceive the need to have such a rule. 
    If they want to allow District Judges to be bypassed, Congress has indicated that they can do so, I believe. 
    I believe that if the court below is affirmed, perhaps Circuit Courts will feel a little more latitude and be a little more receptive to the Sixth Circuit rule. 
    What Mr. Stanley is attempting to do is relieve himself of the obligation as an officer of the Court to apprise the Court of the fact that he is dissatisfied with a portion of the magistrate's report or, for that matter, the whole thing, and he is putting the onus on the judiciary to do his job. 
    This is precisely what the Circuit Court said we are not going to allow this to happen. 
    This is no different than any other legitimate procedural requisite. 
    It is just that Congress said to file the brief, to file a timely notice of appeal, to appear at a pretrial conference, to give discovery. 
    Essentially what we have here is a failure to prosecute, and we have a totally unexcused failure to prosecute.

    And as my brief points out, the circuits which have adopted this rule are the circuits which are inundated with precisely these kinds of cases, because certain circuits... for instance, the District of Columbia doesn't have that many prisoner petitions, I presuppose, at least according to the statistics, whereas the Fifth, the Eleventh, the Fourth and the Sixth do. 
    And again, I am not asking for some nationwide rule of uniformity.

    It is not the power to review here. 
    We are talking about the supervisory rule, which was only given after this express notice, and the rarity of these cases is demonstrated by this case, I believe. 
    I mean, you do not see a flood of instance where the Sixth Circuit has to invoke this rule even against pro se litigants, and as I have indicated, it is not an inflexible barrier, jurisdictional or otherwise, because they have at least in one reported decision granted leave to review those merits when there was a proffer of cause and a feeling that there had been an injustice by the magistrate's ruling, Your Honor. 
    Are there any further questions?

   Rebuttal of Christopher Danahy Stanley
speaker="christopher_danahy_stanley" startTime="2905.653" stopTime="2944.720">
    Mr. Christopher Danahy Stanley 
    Very briefly. 
    First of all, with regard to Justice O'Connor's statements, this, the Sixth Circuit's rule is not a procedural default rule. 
    There is only one circuit, the Fourth Circuit, that would cause a procedural default. 
    The Attorney General may be trying to translate it into that. 
    The Sixth Circuit says, under a supervisory power, you have to file objections or you waive your right to appeal. 
    If there is procedural default, there will be an order of the court, and then that should apply presumably around the country. 
    Here we have, if you are going to talk procedural default, in four the circuits, it doesn't matter, and in two of the circuits it does. 
    That doesn't make any sense. 
    Justice Marshall in your question.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2944.720" stopTime="2946.660">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    But you don't say it is a jurisdictional rule, do you?
speaker="christopher_danahy_stanley" startTime="2946.660" stopTime="3022.141">
    Mr. Christopher Danahy Stanley 
    In my opinion, form over substance, it is a jurisdictional rule. 
    You cannot appeal because you didn't file objections. 
    It is not procedural default. 
    It is a jurisdictional rule. 
    It is a jurisdictional prerequisite, is the way the Sixth Circuit put it in one of its unpublished opinions. 
    And in talking about the differences between the magistrate and the judge, the judge has the case from the beginning. 
    He never loses jurisdiction over it. 
    It doesn't go from the judge to the magistrate, and that somehow they are two different people. 
    The magistrate is working under the judge. 
    The judge has the ultimate determination. 
    The brief that was filed, presented, that is what we are talking about in this case. 
    Were the issues, gut reaction, were the issues before the trial judge, before the District Court? 
    Yes, they were. 
    I filed a memorandum, extensive memorandum of law. 
    This case has been argued extensively and briefed extensively between... and this is the sixth court I have been to for relief from my client. 
    Now, there simply cannot be a waiver construed from that. 
    As I said before, I am sorry I didn't file the objections, because then we wouldn't have to be here, out the fact of the matter is, the issues were before the District Court, and the District Court made the de novo determination. 
    Congress has given us the right to appeal from a denial of habeas corpus, and the Sixth Circuit in their role is trying to take away that right, which I don't think it has anything to do with.

    Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. 
    Mr. Stanley, did you address the waiver issue before the Court of Appeals?

    Mr. Christopher Danahy Stanley 
    No, it was never addressed, and I might say that I was ill on the day of oral argument, and after consultation with his predecessor from the Attorney General has agreed that we could waive oral argument.
