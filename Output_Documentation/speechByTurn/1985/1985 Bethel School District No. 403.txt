Bethel School District No. 403 v. Fraser
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="0.000" stopTime="6.654">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Mr. Coats, you may proceed whenever you're ready.
speaker="william_a_coats" startTime="6.654" stopTime="232.600">
    Mr. William A. Coats 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court: 
    The issue is this case is whether a public school district may regulate indecent speech in a public school setting that does not amount to obscene speech under this Court's Miller versus California standard. 
    The facts in this case are that on April 26th, 1983, Matt Fraser, a 17 year old high school senior, gave a speech to the associated student body. 
    The speech was to introduce his candidate for the vice president's position of the associated student body. 
    He gave a crude and vulgar speech. 
    The speech is set forth in full in the briefs and there's no purpose to repeat it here. 
    It is important to note that Mr. Fraser did obtain significant reaction to his speech, that some of the students hooted and hollered, some of the students looked bewildered, some looked embarrassed. 
    Some students even acted out certain physical acts symbolizing various sexual acts. 
    After the speech, the school administration investigated the incident and provided Mr. Fraser with his due process rights and suspended him for three days and struck him from the list of those candidates who would be considered to be a graduation speaker. 
    Mr. Fraser appealed to the district court. 
    The district court, as affirmed by the Ninth Circuit, has ruled that public school districts can only regulate student speech if it is obscene under the Miller versus California standard, or the one exception they seemingly recognized is if the speech caused a physical disruption or there was a reasonable prediction of a physical disruption. 
    Finally, the district court, as affirmed by the Ninth Circuit, struck down the district's disruptive conduct rule, holding it was overbroad and vague. 
    It is well decided and we agree that students do not shed their constitutional rights at the schoolhouse door. 
    However, it is equally well decided that those constitutional rights will be administered in a way that is sensitive to the speech environment. 
    We are here because the Ninth Circuit we believe has misconstrued the extent of the rights a student has under the First Amendment in the public school setting. 
    They failed to recognize the special relationship between students and their teacher; and finally, they failed to recognize the secondary effects such conduct has in the public school setting. 
    In beginning our analysis of the First Amendment, it is useful to compare this case with this Court's decision in Tinker versus Des Moines School District. 
    In Tinker, the facts were that students wore black arm bands into the public schools in protest of the Vietnam War. 
    There was nothing intrinsically harmful about the black arm bands. 
    What the school officials were concerned about was that the black arm bands stood for protest against this Government's position in Vietnam. 
    Tinker was a viewpoint discrimination case, where the school officials determined that that viewpoint on an important student policy issue should not be interjected in the school system. 
    Contrasting that case with this fact pattern, it is noteworthy that Mr. Fraser at testimony was asked, 
    "What was the purpose of your speech? " 
    He responded quite candidly: 
    "I gave the speech to humor my audience, in the hopes they would vote for my candidate. " 
    There's no overriding public policy.

    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    What was the grade or age range of the students?
speaker="william_a_coats" startTime="251.914" stopTime="352.195">
    Mr. William A. Coats 
    It's a school that has sophomores through seniors, so the youngest would be 14, the oldest would be 18, and they would range in there according to their grades. 
    Mr. Fraser... you will note that the district did not take cavalierly his claims that he was being discriminated against or that somehow his viewpoint was being suppressed. 
    If you review the record in this case, you'll find that Mr. Fraser appealed to the district's hearing officer from the decision of his building principal, and I think if you read that decision, which is part of the joint appendix, that one of the conclusions that was not overturned by the district court was that there was no viewpoint discrimination here, that the district's sole concern was to limit vulgarity and indecent language in the school setting. 
    This Court has been very clear and has often repeated that it does not want to get involved in the daily operations of the school system, that it only wants to get involved when core constitutional values are involved and sharply implicated. 
    This Court has also indicated that the regulation of vulgarity and indecent speech is on the periphery of the First Amendment. 
    We submit to this Court that when you review this case one of the issues is where does the federal court system relate itself to the public schools. 
    And we would suggest to you, with the rights herein involved and the speech here involved, absent viewpoint suppression, that there should be minimal court review and that all a school district should be required to do is to justify its actions with a reasonable educational purpose.

    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Mr. Coats, may I ask you a question? 
    This is an extracurricular assembly? 
    It's not part of the regular... the students were not required to attend, is that right?
speaker="william_a_coats" startTime="360.183" stopTime="410.616">
    Mr. William A. Coats 
    Well, I want to be very clear on what the context is, because I think that's important. 
    It was, students had the option of either going to the assembly or going to a study hall. 
    Now, the ASB, however, in the State of Washington is an activity that is statutorily recognized and required. 
    And those statutes, which are RCW-28A.58.115 through 120, I think you'll find that they're somewhat uniquely specific in this area compared to the other states that I have seen. 
    And they make very clear that this activity is under the direction and control of the public school setting. 
    So this is no more an elective activity that, for example, when a student elects to take drama rather than going to a study hall. 
    This is a part of the educational program of this particular school district, as it is in other school districts in of Washington.

    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    In your view, would it be permissible, given that setting, for the school board to prohibit the discussion of any religious topics during any campaign speech or any prayer activities? 
    Let's all say a prayer for candidate X?

    Well, that's really my question.
speaker="william_a_coats" startTime="427.477" stopTime="444.289">
    Mr. William A. Coats 
    And I think it's important to note that. 
    Bender involved independent student activities. 
    This activity is supported by public funds. 
    It's under the direction and control and supervision of the school authorities. 
    The school officials lead the activity. 
    We assign advisors to it. 
    We subsidize it with public funds.

    You think they could?
speaker="william_a_coats" startTime="463.266" stopTime="473.391">
    Mr. William A. Coats 
    I would think they would be compelled to. 
    This is something that occurs during the student day, when students are required to either be there or in a study hall, and I think it would clearly further that religious activity under the establishment clause.

    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Mr Coats, would it make any difference in your view if the school had tried to discipline the student for activities occurring at lunchtime or on the school premises after school?
speaker="william_a_coats" startTime="487.818" stopTime="523.324">
    Mr. William A. Coats 
    I think in the school setting there could be enclaves of privacy, and I think it is important that this case comes up under the disruptive conduct rule of the district, and that one of the things that the district has found in its disruptive conduct rule is that obscene and profane speech is inherently harmful in a school setting. 
    Now, we would say that if somebody is, for example, swearing around others in a school setting, that would be a concern to us and we could discipline the student for that. 
    They're under the control of the school and we have a--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="523.324" stopTime="536.632">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor

    Mr. William A. Coats 
    --As long as it was a school activity. 
    There are certain private activities that involve students that rent school space. 
    But as long as it is a school activity, my answer would be yes. 
    I think the school and the board, through its rulemaking authority, have determined that that's inherently harmful to the school climate. 
    As long as there is a school activity, my answer to your question would be yes.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="554.276" stopTime="558.128">

speaker="william_a_coats" startTime="558.128" stopTime="574.673">
    Mr. William A. Coats 
    They're under the control, and I think that the school has a definite educational interest in maintaining an environment around the school premises free from vulgarities. 
    Students essentially are required to be there. 
    It's a captive audience of school children.

    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Do you think the school could implement its discipline in this case had there been no school regulation at all on the subject?
speaker="william_a_coats" startTime="588.080" stopTime="606.978">
    Mr. William A. Coats 
    Clearly, I think procedural due process requires us to have regulations in effect. 
    And actually, the Washington Administrative Code requires that and, it is my understanding, your decisions in Goss versus Lopez. 
    So yes, we have to have pre-existing rules. 
    In this case, we did have a rule and the student was charged under that rule.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="606.978" stopTime="619.286">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Do we have to decide in this case whether the rule was sufficiently specific to give notice to Mr. Fraser of what was prohibited?
speaker="william_a_coats" startTime="619.285" stopTime="751.003">
    Mr. William A. Coats 
    The Ninth Circuit has struck down the rule, claiming it was overbroad and vague. 
    They overbreadth argument depends on their determination that our discipline and our disciplining a student for use of obscene and profane language is in excess of our authority. 
    The vagueness argument is a due process argument that says the rule is excessively vague, and that is an issue that is before the Court. 
    I do think it is important in looking at the educational interests to keep in mind that there are really twofold educational interests. 
    One of those interests relates more to the educational nature of this particular activity, that one of the requirements, and something this Court has oft recognized, is that schools teach societal values. 
    Indeed, there's a statute in the State of Washington that expressly makes it a duty of the school district to teach morality, self-respect for others, and civility. 
    The purpose of this ASB activity is multifold, but certainly one of them is to teach these students basic societal values. 
    Another object of this activity, particularly this assembly, is to teach students the art of public discourse. 
    Now, in this education activity there is a special relationship between the students and their instructors. 
    Indeed, the school officials feel they would have been remiss if they had not corrected Mr. Fraser. 
    His speech was inappropriate. 
    It was a bad speech. 
    They as educators had a duty to correct it. 
    But they not only had a duty to Mr. Fraser, but they also had a duty to the other students who were present. 
    I think when you look at the fact-pattern here, you have a senior student, a student who had received honors, who was a gifted orator, and he gives a speech such as that contained in the record. 
    The impression that other students get at that assembly is that that speech is appropriate in that particular context. 
    The speech district--
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="751.003" stopTime="756.157">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    As a matter of fact, wasn't that speech given to a teacher the day before?
speaker="william_a_coats" startTime="756.157" stopTime="795.082">
    Mr. William A. Coats 
    --The record on that, it was given, he claims, to three teachers. 
    Two teachers testified. 
    Approximately ten minutes in advance of the assembly, Mr. Fraser went in, and the teacher was the teacher that had the responsibility for the newspaper. 
    Other students were present, and that teacher told Mr. Fraser, she said, Matt... and this is her testimony... 
    "That speech is inappropriate, don't give it. " 
    He then went to another teacher, Mr. DeHart. 
    Mr. DeHart told him, and his testimony will show: 
    "Matt, that speech is inappropriate, don't give it. " 
    Mr. DeHart also testified that it was his recollection that he intimated there would be severe consequences if he did. 
    That is the record of--

    I think the teachers exercised--

    Mr. William A. Coats 
    --They would have authority, for example, to demand that he go to the office. 
    But I would submit to you that that's really not how discipline works and is not a realistic view, that if a teacher in a school setting tells the student, that's inappropriate, don't do it, and then the student doesn't respond, then it becomes appropriate for disciplinary action.

    Was it his home room teacher?

    Mr. William A. Coats 
    --a significant question of prior restraint, and if the teacher, you know, could ask him... I would think that we would be premature there, in that we did not have a proper basis for disciplinary action until after he gave the speech.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="871.763" stopTime="884.405">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    I think what I'm getting at... I'm not trying to be mysterious about it. 
    If the school had a possibility, had notice and an opportunity to stop the speech, it would be a different case, wouldn't it?
speaker="william_a_coats" startTime="884.405" stopTime="886.740">
    Mr. William A. Coats 
    Yes. 
    That is not the facts here.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="886.740" stopTime="888.375">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Well, that's what I'm trying to get at.
speaker="william_a_coats" startTime="888.375" stopTime="895.213">
    Mr. William A. Coats 
    Okay. 
    Excuse me. 
    I misconstrued your question. 
    The record is as I recited it.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="895.213" stopTime="897.915">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Right.
speaker="william_a_coats" startTime="897.915" stopTime="1084.802">
    Mr. William A. Coats 
    The school district did have a duty to these other students to impress upon them that in this educational activity this type of speech wasn't appropriate in any way whatsoever. 
    And I think it's important to note that the district acted with restraint. 
    Again, if you read the record from the school district, one of the findings of the hearing officer who considered this was that a lesser form of corrective action would not have corrected this particular problem. 
    Indeed, the speech district feels strongly that in its capacity as an educator and dealing with these students it had an obligation to respond to this particular speech. 
    Mr. Fraser seems to argue that the school district's sole remedy is to talk it over with him, to debate with him the appropriateness of this. 
    We submit to this Court that Mr. Fraser's argument misconstrues the relationship of a student to an educator. 
    It's not a relationship of one debater to another, that indeed the educator has authority over the student when properly exercised. 
    Finally, we submit to you that the real question is if the speech district could regulate this speech. 
    This Court held as recently as last week in the Public Utilities case out of California that the First Amendment does not dictate that you respond or ignore a speech, or as we would phrase it, the First Amendment may restrict a school district's ability to censor various views in the student school system, but once they are able to regulate an area, such as vulgarity and indecency, the First Amendment does not dictate how they must go about that. 
    We also note that there are important secondary effects in this case. 
    We think it's important that this came up under the school district's disruptive conduct rule, and when you read that rule, clearly a school district has the right to proscribe disruptive conduct in the school setting. 
    And this board of directors in advance gave notice and concluded that obscene and profane speech was inherently harmful and disruptive to the public school setting. 
    Essentially what the Ninth Circuit has held is that a public school district cannot reach that conclusion and cannot have such a rule. 
    We submit to you that the board's determination that vulgarity and indecency was inherently harmful in the public school setting is supported by a rational basis. 
    First of all, the school has a duty to protect the young adults, who are there in essentially a captive audience. 
    Secondly, such conduct is inherently demeaning to the school setting. 
    This is where we require in the State of Washington students to come to learn. 
    As this Court has recognized in cases such as Pico, where the plurality spoke, and where it expressed its concern in that opinion that the district did not have the authority to suppress ideas in the school setting, but it had no problem, it said, if there had been a facially neutral rule designed to prohibit indecent language in a public school setting.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1084.802" stopTime="1102.097">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Mr. Coats, may I just ask on the rule, the rule prohibits disruptive... I mean, material and substantial interference with the educational process, including obscene and profane language. 
    Now, what is... precisely that is your position, that this was obscene language within the meaning of the rule?
speaker="william_a_coats" startTime="1102.097" stopTime="1116.273">
    Mr. William A. Coats 
    Yes. 
    You'll find that that was considered again by the hearing officer's decision at the school district, and the school district's interpretation of its own rule is that obscene should be given its common and ordinary meaning, which includes lewd and vulgar language.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1116.273" stopTime="1121.891">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Of course, we're dealing by hypothesis with speech that's non-obscene for constitutional purposes.
speaker="william_a_coats" startTime="1121.891" stopTime="1196.408">
    Mr. William A. Coats 
    The speech does not meet the standard of Miller versus California. 
    We concede that. 
    It's not close. 
    But I would point out to you that the standard that was set out in Miller versus California on obscenity according to this Court was designed only to prescribe hard-core pornography. 
    And this Court has recognized that there are some lesser standards which may apply in particular situations, such as in FCC versus Pacifica, the Mini Theatres case out of Detroit. 
    And we're suggesting that a lesser standard is appropriate in a public school setting. 
    Now, the standard that we have proposed essentially is that first you look at the constitutional right we're enforcing, and that when there is a suppression of ideas or a discrimination against ideas, that the school district have to show with a higher standard or show some compelling interest its reason for suppressing those ideas. 
    But here, where the only... where the record clearly shows that the only purpose for the school's action was to suppress vulgarity and indecency in the public school setting, then we would suggest to the Court that a school district should only have to meet a standard of showing a rational educational basis, and clearly there is such a basis.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1196.408" stopTime="1214.520">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    May I just ask this question about it? 
    I understand that the board construed the word obscene in this case to cover this speech. 
    Is there any prior history indicating within the school's own proceedings of any kind that the word "obscene" as used in the rule was intended to be as broad as interpreted in this case?
speaker="william_a_coats" startTime="1214.520" stopTime="1216.070">
    Mr. William A. Coats 
    Were there prior cases?
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1216.070" stopTime="1224.459">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Anything that would fairly... the question is the same thing, I think, maybe Justice O'Connor was driving at, the fair notice to the student as to whether this speech was covered by this word.
speaker="william_a_coats" startTime="1224.459" stopTime="1308.898">
    Mr. William A. Coats 
    I think my response to you was that we have no written decisions in construing this, and that to my knowledge this is the first time that the district had construed its own rule where there was a record kept. 
    Now, school rules are enforced on a daily basis in the public school setting, and I can assure you that if a student swears or is vulgar in the school setting, whether it's in a classroom, in the hall, or in an assembly, school officials have taken corrective action. 
    But most of the time we don't get an appeal from that. 
    Here there was also, as is shown in the record, there was a prior occasion the year before where a student used, actually in as ASB assembly, used inappropriate speech. 
    And indeed, the district called the student into the office, and in fact the principal talked to him and what he would consider disciplined him, told him that, you know, that better be stopped or he's going to be in trouble. 
    Now, Mr. Fraser construes that, he says, well, he knew that speech was given and he thought that the only that happened was the principal called him in and talked to him about it, big deal. 
    I mean, he gives probably the best evidence we have of why the district in this case was compelled to take a more demonstrative action to impress upon the students that this was not appropriate speech in that particular forum, in that public setting. 
    If possible, I'd like to reserve the remaining time for rebuttal.

    Mr. Jeffrey T. Haley 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court: 
    I will begin my rebuttal, my response, with some response to positions taken by my opposing counsel, and I will begin with what was the most important error by opposing counsel in characterizing the record. 
    He said that two teacher told Matt Fraser don't give it, is what he said. 
    I will quote from the record: 
    "I told Matt that his speech was inappropriate and that he probably should not deliver it. " 
    That was the first teacher, who was most critical of the speech, Mrs. Hicks. 
    That's at page 30 of the joint appendix. 
    The second teacher, I'm quoting: 
    "My response at that time was that I told Matt that this would indeed cause problems and that it would raise eyebrows. " 
    That was the extent of his warning not to give the speech. 
    None of them suggested that it might violate a school rule. 
    If fact, the first teacher, who was most critical of it, said in her testimony afterwards at the trial: 
    "I wasn't that there was a school rule regarding that. " 
    In this case, if the teachers don't have any idea that such a speech might violate a school rule, when they are charged with enforcement of the school rule as among their duties as teachers, the rule is clearly so vague and so lacking of adequate notice, at least when it comes to First Amendment rights, freedom of speech, that they cannot punish a student who gave a speech after previewing it with three teachers.

    Certainly, the disruptive conduct exception articulated by Tinker can reach the content of speech, can reach speech which due solely to its content is disruptive. 
    And I suggest in Latin class profanity would distract students from the lessons at hand, would show disrespect to the teacher, and would disrupt the order of the class, and would be disruptive of the educational process.

    Well, we must distinguish carefully between profanity or dirty words, which are relatively easily identified, and which have very few purposes that are other than to insult or to create a negative emotional reaction or to vent a negative emotional reaction, and sexual metaphors, which, especially in this case, did not have any such purpose, to insult or to vent an emotional reaction or to create a negative emotional reaction.

    And there were speeches that had been given at the same nominating assembly one year earlier which contained a four letter word and contained a sexual reference. 
    That student was not suspended from school. 
    He was simply lectured in what I would suggest is an appropriate fashion under the First Amendment.

    Mr. Jeffrey T. Haley

    Well, I'm not sure that I know the basis for the distinction then in your view for First Amendment analysis.
speaker="jeffrey_t_haley" startTime="1916.909" stopTime="1939.406">
    Mr. Jeffrey T. Haley 
    The basis is twofold for distinguishing between the use of profanity or dirty words and mere sexual allusion or imagery. 
    First of all, we know what dirty words are, we know what profanity is. 
    It's a much clearer line and a much easier standard to apply, both for administrators in the schools and for courts developing principled decisions under it.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="1939.406" stopTime="1992.791">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Second of all, there are very few uses for profanity in the school context which do not tend to create antagonism between students or tend to create disrespect between students and teachers or tend to have divisive, disruptive effects within the school situation. 
    There are so few uses that the school might constitutionally pass, adopt a rule which said its use is entirely prohibited. 
    I suggest that a better rule would say its use in public is prohibited, and that between consenting students on the school grounds they might use such profanity, but any time it's used in public it is so inherently likely to disrupt that we're going to rule it out in all cases. 
    I think that would be constitutional. 
    In the last analysis, though, isn't it a regulation of the manner of speech, as opposed to viewpoint suppression?
speaker="jeffrey_t_haley" startTime="1992.791" stopTime="2053.448">
    Mr. Jeffrey T. Haley 
    Well, I do not see this rule as applied in this case as a time, place and manner restriction. 
    I see it very much as a content restriction. 
    That does not mean that it is impermissible in the schools, because certainly schools can regulate the content of speech under the Tinker standard... disruption. 
    But in this case, this particular speech was not disruptive. 
    The sexual metaphor that was used in this speech was not in any way intended to insult or create divisiveness between students or cause any disruption, and the record shows that there was no disruption. 
    First of all, when Matt Fraser was accused of violating a school rule no one mentioned that they thought he disrupted the educational process. 
    They presented five letters to him which characterized the speech as inappropriate, obscene, profane, et cetera, and those letters did not mention that they thought that there had been any disruption. 
    It wasn't until the attorneys for the school district got involved with this case that the justification on the basis of disruption was advanced.

    Mr. Jeffrey T. Haley 
    --I think that the judge is saying, and this would be my view, that the courts should not involve themselves in questions of whether the speech was inappropriate or distasteful. 
    The question is whether this speech is protected by the First Amendment, and those who are in a position to judge whether it's distasteful or inappropriate are the students and, for that matter, the teacher and administrators who might tell the students and tell this particular student that the speech is distasteful and inappropriate and they think that it should not be used in a political assembly. 
    But once the students are granted the forum to exercise students politics, to say you can have an experience in American politics, but it won't be a complete experience because we're not going to give you freedom of speech, we're going to censor what you have to say and limit it, we're going to prohibit from you speech which is on a very important topic to your peers, a topic that is constantly on the minds of teen-agers, really gives them an inappropriate message.

    Mr. Jeffrey T. Haley 
    Well, if you would like my off the cuff analysis, it seems to me that once a group of people assemble together they can adopt rules among themselves to control their own behavior within the organization. 
    And likewise, the students themselves could have adopted a rule which would say: Within the conduct of our student politics or within our particular party, we're going to have a party assembly and meeting and we're going to say that none of our members will be able to give speeches of this sort, or this topic is taboo.

    Unknown Speaker 
    That's a unique view of the First Amendment. 
    We've stricken statutes adopted by legislatures sometimes because they violated the First Amendment.
speaker="jeffrey_t_haley" startTime="2732.473" stopTime="2928.781">
    Mr. Jeffrey T. Haley 
    Well, you're asking for my off the cuff analysis and I'm viewing it as an organization that is analogous to a private organization. 
    The state has various interests in the public schools that must be balanced against the First Amendment interests within the public schools. 
    In the classroom the interest tips strongly in favor of the state, because there are many sorts of speeches which based on their content might be disruptive of the educational process. 
    In the extracurricular activities, it tips much more the other way; and in student politics it tips the farthest of any of those extracurricular activities. 
    Politics is an area where speech is accorded its highest protection. 
    If we allow schools to tell students that they will have an experience in politics within America and then tell them that they can be punished if they give expression which the administrators find distasteful or inappropriate, but nothing more serious than that, we are teaching the students an ugly lesson, that those in power can suppress the speech of those with whom they disagree. 
    This is a pure speech case. 
    This case does not involve the maintenance of discipline in the school, the control of the use of drugs, weapons or violence. 
    It's not a situation where the school administrators need more tools to maintain an educational environment. 
    If the educational environment were disrupted by this speech, yes, it could be prohibited. 
    But it wasn't. 
    The teachers of this country believe that they have adequate tools to deal with this problem, that this is not a serious problem within the schools, when students present speech which contain sexual metaphors no different from what they're taught in the classes in Shakespeare. 
    Romeo and Juliet is a standard text within the classes and there are sexual allusions and metaphor in Romeo and Juliet that are more explicit, that are actually describing sexual activity. 
    When students are allowed to... are presented this in the classroom, teachers do not find that they have a problem dealing with this problem with students. 
    I will respond to the assertion of the captive audience. 
    All audiences, of course, are to a certain extent captive. 
    But the form of expression used in this case is not unusual for high school students. 
    This is not something that the audience who attended this assembly would have been surprised to hear. 
    They heard a sexual reference and a four letter word in a speech at a similar assembly one year earlier. 
    Sexuality is a topic that is of great interest to teenagers. 
    Commonly known statistics show that a great number of teenagers are in fact becoming pregnant while in high school. 
    If we want to teach students to discuss the topic of sexuality properly, appropriately, responsively--
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="2928.781" stopTime="2931.733">
    Unknown Speaker 
    You're suggesting that this is part of the teaching process?
speaker="jeffrey_t_haley" startTime="2931.733" stopTime="2972.477">
    Mr. Jeffrey T. Haley 
    --I'm suggesting that if the schools want to teach the students that this speech is inappropriate, they should tell that to the students. 
    They should conduct... convene an assembly of the students and give them a presentation on why this speech is inappropriate, a presentation on what political speech in America is all about and what kind of speech in the adult world is persuasive and what is offensive. 
    They should present that to all the students. 
    They could present that to Matt Fraser himself. 
    And that... and the National Education Association has taken the position that that is a more than adequate tool for dealing with this problem, that sexual metaphor is not a serious problem in the schools, unlike other discipline problems.

    Mr. Jeffrey T. Haley 
    That is correct. 
    My opposing counsel suggests that speech can... that the local rules should be adopted by local school boards and with presumably the approval of the local parents, and that those rules ought to apply whether... no matter what the rules are. 
    Well, the cases of Tinker and West Virginia versus Barnette show that that cannot be the law in this country, Tinker and West Virginia versus Barnette make it clear that the Constitution does restrict the latitude of local school boards from adopting rules of that nature. 
    Let me return to the vagueness issue. 
    The construction that the school board has applied in this case to the rule was made after the speech was presented. 
    There is nothing that was done to construe this rule or give the students notice that a rule prohibiting obscene, profane language would apply to a speech which contains no profanity or no speech... no words which by themselves would cause offense.

    My understanding from working on this case from the beginning is that he went to the teachers for two reasons: One, to see whether they thought that he would get in trouble for presenting the speech or whether this was something that they wanted to stop; and two, because he had a relationship with these teachers of student and teacher and he wanted to show them what he was doing, he wanted to show them how clever he was and how artfully he had created a speech which would be very entertaining to his classmates.

    I believe the record contains the analysis, the comments of some of the people in the school, teachers or students, who did view the speech as clever.

   Rebuttal of William A. Coats
speaker="william_a_coats" startTime="3240.683" stopTime="3441.248">
    Mr. William A. Coats 
    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    By way of response, Mr. Haley did read from the record, but he didn't go on. 
    And I did ask, when the teacher said, I told him I thought it could cause problems, I said: Well, could you explain what you thought you implied? 
    And the teacher said: Well, I think by saying that it could cause problems and raise eyebrows, I also realized that the speech was indeed ambiguous and could be interpreted a number of ways. 
    So rather than debate with Matt the morality and profanity in it, I thought it might be best to just point out or at last try to reason that it could indeed cause problems as far as his remaining few weeks at the school. 
    I didn't know what the consequences could be. 
    And indeed, the teacher does not administer the discipline. 
    But when you read, a fair reading of the record, when you realize this is ten minutes before the speech, when these teachers had other students present, I think that they went... their comments could not be construed as giving this student license to say anything he wants to say at that assembly. 
    I want to respond first to Justice Powell's question, is this political speech? 
    And Justice Powell, I'd refer you to this Court's decision in Conick versus Meyers, and in that case the Court considered speech between an assistant district attorney, or actually a petition an assistant district attorney circulated in the office, and she was fired as a result of that petition. 
    And this Court in considering that case said that there was only one question in that petition that had any public significance and the rest of it was just an internal communication within the office, and that this Court should not involve itself. 
    We would suggest to you that that case applies here, that there is no big political issue being discussed. 
    It was a crude joke. 
    Secondly, I want to follow up on Mr. Justice Renquist's question about, does it make any difference is this is a classroom or an assembly? 
    And I would suggest to you that it's not up to Mr. Fraser to determine the school district's curriculum. 
    And indeed, what the statute says is that a school district shall have an associated student body, and it's under the control and direction of the board of directors. 
    Now, if the board of directors concludes that the best educational environment is a school assembly, that that's the proper place to inculcate values, that that's the proper place to in fact allow the students to learn public discourse, that that does not change any of the factors which give school districts the authority to regulate the content of speech in a school setting. 
    There is still the relationship of student to teacher. 
    There are still other students around. 
    Now, he tried to distinguish away the captive audience. 
    But I would suggest to you that what he's suggesting is that in order to participate in your school activities such as this, in your own school government, you should have to put up with this type of behavior. 
    That's clearly not the law. 
    Now going to the issue of notice and this Court's concern about a disruptive conduct rule, I think, first of all, it's important you understand how these rules are adopted, and I think the record is clear, first of all, that we do distribute student codes. 
    This is the total student code for Bethel. 
    Mr. Fraser testified that it was available to him. 
    Now, we can't force him to read it. 
    But the board of directors sets out its rules.

    Mr. William A. Coats 
    You would have to go to the office to get it, is my understanding. 
    It was clearly available, however. 
    We don't pass out, for example, criminal justice statutes either, but they are available. 
    I suggest to you that even the argument that the teachers should somehow be able to waive... even if the teacher said the speech was all right, they shouldn't be able to waive and undo the board of directors' own rule. 
    Now, in looking at the rule, I would point out that, in the area of vagueness and overbreadth, that outside of the criminal justice area this Court has recognized a much broader standard. 
    For example, in the case of Arnett versus Kennedy, this Court held that a standard of efficiency of the service is a basis for firing an individual. 
    In almost every labor contract throughout these United States, the standard for disciplining employees is cause or just cause. 
    In addition, in the State of Washington the standard for firing teachers is sufficient cause, without any further elaboration. 
    These rules do not have to meet the same specificity requirement as criminal statutes. 
    Furthermore, it would be totally impractical, impractical for two reasons--

speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="3591.943" stopTime="3604.035">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    If the nature of the penalty makes a difference, would you suggest that perhaps in this context maybe you could have called the student in and given him a severe lecture, but maybe not deprive him of the right to graduate?

    There's no doubt and I think there's a reasonable education debate on what was the appropriate punishment here. 
    But I'd suggest to you that that's not a question that the federal court need answer. 
    That's something that's vested in the sound discretion of the public school administration, following the procedure--

    Mr. William A. Coats

    You'll note in the State of Washington--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="3637.741" stopTime="3641.526">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    But one of the elements of the crime is the fact that it is speech?
speaker="william_a_coats" startTime="3641.526" stopTime="3735.488">
    Mr. William A. Coats 
    --There's no question he's being punished for his speech here, and that that, you know, whether or not we can regulate that speech is clearly a First Amendment issue. 
    Now, once we're over that hurdle, and assuming this Court says yes, you can regulate this particular speech, the issue is then what's the effective way of doing it, should it have been a two day suspension or should we just talk to him, should it have been more, that seems to me to be an issue that the First Amendment does not dictate. 
    The First Amendment was never designed to dictate curriculum or punishment in public schools. 
    I think that is something that's clearly vested in the discretion of the school officials, within the parameters of the due process rules under which we operate. 
    And when you look at the rule and you judge its content, I think it's important to note that in Washington the rules aren't drafted by lawyers. 
    We have a statute that requires that students, that parents and administrators actually work on our codes and adopt them; that the legislature has adopted a policy of participation of those who have the greatest stake in the educational outcome to actually work on these rules and adopt them. 
    So when you look at the word "obscene", most of the people who are drafting this have never heard of Miller and California, I would suggest, and are not aware of the standards set forth therein; and that the district's hearing officer was correct in looking at its common and ordinary meaning, which includes indecent. 
    And so I think that we would hope that you would look at the context of the school rules, realizing that they're not drafted by attorneys for attorneys.
