Bender v. Williamsport Area School District
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="0.000" stopTime="11.497">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    We will hear arguments now in Bender against Williamsport School. 
    Mr. Smart, you may proceed whenever you are ready.
speaker="james_madison_smart_jr" startTime="11.497" stopTime="78.441">
    Mr. James Madison Smart, Jr. 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    The facts of this case are not extremely complicated, but they can be misunderstood. 
    This case does not involved teacher-led or government-prescribed religious activities. 
    Very simply, students from Williamsport Area High School, which we represent, wanted to meet during the extracurricular activity period. 
    The school was originally content to let them meet. 
    Then permission was withdrawn after the first meeting, but solely because the school's lawyer felt that allowing student meetings containing prayer and religious expression would violate the Establishment Clause. 
    Now, since the lawyer's belief was the only reason for the denial of meeting space in this case, the legal issue is very narrow and that is simply whether the Establishment Clause requires a high school to censor out the religious expression of private individuals after having first created an opportunity for students to engage in their own self-initiated activities and expression.

    Mr. James Madison Smart, Jr. 
    In our opinion, they did, Your Honor, and the case is properly here. 
    It is a valid case or controversy. 
    However--

    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor

    Mr. James Madison Smart, Jr. 
    --Well, it was our judgment that Mr. Youngman probably stood in the same position as Mrs. Bashdi McCollum in the McCollum case in 1948 as a parent. 
    But, if the Court should decide that Mr. Youngman does not have standing, the correct disposition of this case would be to vacate the Third Circuit decision and reinstate the decision of the district court.

    Mr. James Madison Smart, Jr.

    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    In the McCollum case, wasn't there an allegation that the child was being offended in some way by these practices?

    Is there anything in the record about his children?

    Mr. James Madison Smart, Jr. 
    --I don't know the details on that, Your Honor.

    Mr. James Madison Smart, Jr. 
    Yes, Your Honor.

    Mr. James Madison Smart, Jr. 
    No, Your Honor, I don't believe so. 
    I believe it would have been a valid decision at the district court level since all parties were properly represented.

    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well, it might have been a valid decision at the time the district court rendered it, but I think our practice, since the time of the Munsingwear case, you know, some years ago, has been to say if it becomes moot on appeal, the whole thing washes out. 
    In other words, you would simply go back and there would be no district court decision, you would have no Court of Appeals decision.
speaker="james_madison_smart_jr" startTime="262.679" stopTime="277.954">
    Mr. James Madison Smart, Jr. 
    Well, if that were the case, then the Court of Appeals would have two options if that were the law, Your Honor. 
    One would be to treat it as a case or controversy that is capable of repetition, yet evading review, or to wash the whole thing out.

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Why not, Mr. Smart?

    Mr. James Madison Smart, Jr.

    Of course, the School Board doesn't decide the constitutional questions with finality, do they?

    Mr. James Madison Smart, Jr. 
    No, Your Honor, however, they do decide what course the School District takes and the Respondent is here in the capacity as an original member of this lawsuit against whom we sought individual liability, including attorney's fees, and he has represented that he is in this lawsuit at this point as a parent.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="319.176" stopTime="323.422">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    So, he could have been a plaintiff in the case originally?

    Mr. James Madison Smart, Jr. 
    Yes, Your Honor. 
    That is our view of the McCollum case.

    Justice Byron R. White 
    So, you think he is still in the case?

    Mr. James Madison Smart, Jr. 
    We believe he is still in the case and we believe it is still a valid case or controversy. 
    It is important to understand that in this case the record shows that the school did not simply make available certain specified activities to the students during this activity period. 
    The school did not say, students, you can do this, this, or this, take your pick of those. 
    Instead, the school said to the students, students, you decide what you will do during the activity period.

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Is that the same as the Widmar factual setting?

    Mr. James Madison Smart, Jr. 
    We think that constitutionally it is indistinguishable, Your Honor.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="368.499" stopTime="374.371">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    I am speaking narrowly. 
    In the Widmar case did the students decide what it was they wanted to talk about?

    Mr. James Madison Smart, Jr. 
    That is exactly correct, Your Honor.

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    If they wanted to advance socialism, they could do it?

    Yes, Your Honor.

    Mr. James Madison Smart, Jr. 
    They were free entirely to conduct their meetings as they saw fit. 
    We believe that the district court findings in this case, that that was the case in the Williamsport Area High School, and are correct; that the School District--
speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="396.675" stopTime="400.142">
    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    Did they have to do something? 
    Did they have to go outside and sit on the steps?
speaker="james_madison_smart_jr" startTime="400.142" stopTime="418.026">
    Mr. James Madison Smart, Jr. 
    --No, Your Honor. 
    The only reason they couldn't do that is because the school requires them to remain in the building, as I understand it, and that is part of the reason for having all the activities, as I understand it, inside the building unless perhaps there is special permission to go outside.
speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="418.026" stopTime="440.094">
    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    You mentioned that some of these youngsters were in the ninth grade. 
    I think his present child was in the ninth grade. 
    Do you carry your argument to the junior high level in those schools which, at the junior high level, have a ninth grade?
speaker="james_madison_smart_jr" startTime="440.094" stopTime="448.638">
    Mr. James Madison Smart, Jr. 
    Your Honor, our case concerns only age 14, grade nine through twelve. 
    Fourteen through 18 are the ages.
speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="448.638" stopTime="466.615">
    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    Suppose, as in another school district, your high school consisted of grades ten, eleven and twelve and the junior high had nine as is the case in many communities. 
    Does your argument also carry you to the grade nine in those communities?
speaker="james_madison_smart_jr" startTime="466.615" stopTime="477.860">
    Mr. James Madison Smart, Jr. 
    No, it... Well, it would depend on whether the school had created a free-speech opportunity for the students through some kind of self-initiated activity forum.
speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="477.860" stopTime="481.171">
    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    Then you would go down to the first and second grades on that basis?
speaker="james_madison_smart_jr" startTime="481.171" stopTime="491.028">
    Mr. James Madison Smart, Jr. 
    No. 
    Probably the closest you would get in elementary school to a student-initiated activity forum would be recess.

    Suppose they wanted to play chess. 
    They had a couple of chess prodigies and they formed a chess club in the fifth grade. 
    Does your argument apply?

    Mr. James Madison Smart, Jr. 
    I think that there is going to be... Of course, the Third Circuit and the Court of Appeals was concerned about the impressionability and age of students and I would have to frankly admit that I think there is some age at which any sort of religious activities going on may reasonably be interpreted by a student as having been sponsored by the school. 
    For instance, the case Judge Friendly decided involving the kindergarten students where there was a claim that they should be allowed to say a prayer before grace. 
    If the teacher leads them in that prayer, why, it is not going to be a voluntary prayer. 
    At that age, nothing is voluntary to those students unless they are maladjusted students.

    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Mr. Smart, in this case, a faculty member was present at the Petros meetings.

    Mr. James Madison Smart, Jr. 
    That is correct.

    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Does the record disclose whether the teachers had been instructed not to actively participate?

    Mr. James Madison Smart, Jr. 
    The record does not disclose that, although I think it is clear that that is what did happen.

    Mr. James Madison Smart, Jr. 
    No, Your Honor. 
    We believe that the crucial constitutional distinction is the distinction between state action or government action and individual action and that the only safe harbor of constitutional analysis is that distinction between is the government acting in promoting or conducting this activity or are private individuals acting and what is the government's role? 
    We must look at the government's role.

    Mr. Smart--

    Mr. James Madison Smart, Jr. 
    Yes, Your Honor.

    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    --if that is your position, supposing the time that is devoted to this activity is needed to qualify the school for its academic diplomas and all the rest, and as I understand, you can't tell from the record whether it is counted or not. 
    The Court of Appeals said they couldn't tell whether the activity periods count toward the minimum requirement for powers of the school under the state statute. 
    Now, if it is required, then would it not be state action?
speaker="james_madison_smart_jr" startTime="640.249" stopTime="665.537">
    Mr. James Madison Smart, Jr. 
    I don't see that that is a significant constitutional connection, Your Honor. 
    If the school in this case determined that they wanted to take credit for the activity period and to apply it, that certainly was their prerogative to do so because there is educational value even in self-initiated student activities. 
    However, there has been no adjudication--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="665.537" stopTime="678.719">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Well, if that is your position, why would it matter if the monitor was an employee of the school and who directed the activity? 
    I don't understand how you reconcile that with your response to Justice O'Connor's question.
speaker="james_madison_smart_jr" startTime="678.719" stopTime="683.608">
    Mr. James Madison Smart, Jr. 
    --I am not sure I understand the question.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="683.608" stopTime="685.668">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    The issue as you put it is whether it is state action or not.
speaker="james_madison_smart_jr" startTime="685.668" stopTime="685.856">
    Mr. James Madison Smart, Jr. 
    That is right.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="685.856" stopTime="693.291">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    And, if it is action that is necessary in order to have these students be qualified for a state diploma, why is it not state action?
speaker="james_madison_smart_jr" startTime="693.291" stopTime="815.820">
    Mr. James Madison Smart, Jr. 
    Well, Your Honor, the state action consists of having them on the premises in the question that you put forth. 
    The state action you want to focus on is who is doing the religious activity, who is promoting it, who is sponsoring it, who is encouraging people to participate? 
    If the state is doing that, then it would violate the Constitution. 
    But, all the state has done here is to require these people to go to school, these students to be at school between certain hours. 
    Now, not everything that goes on in the school grounds during those hours makes them a captive audience to that activity on the school. 
    In fact, there is an inherent competition during this activity period between all of the activities that are going on. 
    A student has to choose what he will do during that time and he can even choose to start new activities during that time if he doesn't like any of the existing ones that are going on. 
    And, that is where we get the free-speech opportunity for these students that was created and that is how we draw the distinction between the government action in the case and the individual, private action in the case. 
    And, this is a crucial distinction. 
    Any departure from the distinction on government action versus private action will get us into constitutional difficulty. 
    It will get us into problems with excessive entanglement as we try to determine what students are doing at their meeting. 
    Are they too religious at this meeting, are they talking too much about religion, do they have an invocation, that sort of thing. 
    It will, furthermore, put us in the problem of having to tell these students that we cannot allow your meeting because, you see, if we have a neutral policy, then somebody might think that we are sponsoring your activity. 
    So, we can't have a neutral policy. 
    We have to have a non-neutral policy.

    Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. 
    Mr. Smart, I thought the record indicated that the teacher was there to take the roll to make sure the students were present and then to remain because of disciplinary problems.
speaker="james_madison_smart_jr" startTime="916.217" stopTime="957.609">
    Mr. James Madison Smart, Jr. 
    --There is a reference in the record to the teacher taking the roll, although I think that what actually happened was that the students signed a roster in actuality. 
    The school has a practice of having a teacher or school employee present in all areas of the building where there are students. 
    There are teachers stationed in the hallways between periods and during this activity period. 
    That doesn't mean they are monitoring with the speech of the students in the hallway or censoring the speech of the students, it simply means that they are there to take care of any need that might arise and to keep the students on the premises.

    Mr. James Madison Smart, Jr. 
    --It is my understanding that it does. 
    However, I would urge on the Court the fact that the School District itself calls these periods extra-curricular and I think the curricular and the non-curricular--
speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="1034.328" stopTime="1041.918">
    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    Well, if it is required, what importance is the nomenclature the School Board puts on it as required or not?
speaker="james_madison_smart_jr" startTime="1041.918" stopTime="1117.591">
    Mr. James Madison Smart, Jr. 
    --Well, I think the curricular/non-curricular distinction is a distinction this Court has used in the past. 
    For instance, in the School Library case, the Board of Education of Island Trees School District versus Pico the Court did not look at the hours the students had to be at the school. 
    The Court drew the distinction between the curricular activities and the non-curricular activities. 
    And, the position of this Court has been that students have free speech rights in the public school. 
    Our view of what the First Amendment requires in a public school is not a highly regimented, dictatorial type of situation outside of the classroom. 
    When students are in the hallways or in self-initiated activities or in the cafeteria, they are able to exercise free-speech rights. 
    The school created that right here. 
    All we are asking is that you not exclude one category, the religious student, from participation in that right simply because of the religiousness of it. 
    The Court has always held religious speech to the same protection as other forms of speech. 
    Mr. Chief Justice, if I could, I would like to reserve my remaining time for rebuttal.

    Mr. Charles Fried 
    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    The federal interest in this case is direct and substantial. 
    If the Court of Appeals is correct and the Respondents are correct that the Establishment Clause forbids what these students chose to do, wanted to do, that the school authorities were perfectly willing to have them do until the lawyer said otherwise, if the Court of Appeals is correct, then the subsequently enacted Equal Access Act is under grave constitutional doubt.

speaker="charles_fried" startTime="1207.118" stopTime="1209.163">
    Mr. Charles Fried 
    The cloud would still be there, Justice Stevens.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1209.162" stopTime="1210.632">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    So, you would rather have an advisory--
speaker="charles_fried" startTime="1210.632" stopTime="1473.759">
    Mr. Charles Fried 
    On the jurisdictional point, Justice Stevens, we do discuss that on page five of our brief. 
    It is fairly intricate. 
    I would like to proceed to the rather puzzling point in the Court of Appeals decision. 
    One wonders why in this case we have had the new notion introduced that free speech has got to be balanced against the Establishment Clause and, indeed, that free speech must yield to the Establishment Clause. 
    This case is not like Wallace and Jaffree last term or Stone v. Graham where the Court could point to a state statute which the Court concluded sought by direction or indirection to endorse religion. 
    And, indeed, this case is easier, should be viewed as easier than its older twin brother, Widmar against Vincent, because in Widmar the state had reasons of its own, quite apart from the federal Establishment Clause, for wishing to limit the access of those students to their religious activities. 
    Here, the controverted action... the controverted activity was entirely student initiated and there was no state objection apart from the lawyer's objection based on the federal Establishment Clause. 
    So, here we have no endorsement of religious and we have no conflict with a substantive state educational policy. 
    If you compare this case to cases of incidental, but permissible state involvement, tax exemption in Walz, school books and text books for parochial school students, or the use of the mall for a papal mass, one sees that the objective involvement of the state is virtually negligible. 
    So, how is it that this case is thought to present these agonizing constitutional difficulties. 
    Only on one premise and that is that high school students are different. 
    There is the fear that unlike the rest of us high school students are unable to discern the difference between neutrality and endorsement. 
    That is the fear which moved the Court of Appeals in its decision and that is the fear which is raised by the Respondents and the amici in this case. 
    Now, whether that fear is justified, whether high school students, indeed, are so immature that they cannot make the distinctions that the rest of us make was a question which was specifically addressed by Congress. 
    Hearings were held, testimony was taken, materials were examined. 
    And, Congress concluded that high school students... secondary school students was the word of the statute... are sufficiently mature to make the same distinctions that the rest of us make, that all of us have to make when that papal mass was held on the mall, to distinguish between state endorsement and state neutrality towards religion. 
    And, this Court has consistently held, most recently in Rostker and Goldberg, that where Congress has made a determination of a controverted matter of general fact, that disposition is entitled to the very highest degree of deference. 
    This case cannot be affirmed without controverting that congressional judgment about the maturity of secondary school students and rejecting the major premise of the Equal Access Act. 
    That is why I say the federal interest is direct and substantial. 
    Now, once that factual premise is accepted, high school students do understand the difference between neutrality and endorsement, this becomes the easiest of cases for we are far from any actual endorsement of religion in this case. 
    If the Court has no further questions, I thank you for its attention.

    Mr. Fried, I know that you passed over the standing of jurisdiction question and referred to the passage in the Solicitor General's brief on the subject. 
    Is it your view that a student who does not allege a desire to attend a Petros meeting has standing to complain about the fact that the school is holding such meetings or permitting them if nothing else appears?
speaker="charles_fried" startTime="1554.649" stopTime="1582.605">
    Mr. Charles Fried 
    A student may allege an injury of a constitutional dimension if that student alleges that the going on of such activities in his school is, as it were, constitutionally offensive to that student. 
    But, I should point out that in this case the Petros students are still seeking to meet and the School Board is still preventing them from meeting.

    I think the way to put that concern to rest would be to realize that the School Board is still preventing Petros from meeting. 
    True, it is acting like a disinterested stakeholder.

    "Are there any student clubs for which the faculty advisor is instructed not to participate? " 
    Answer: "Not to my knowledge". 
    And, then a question is "Are these advisors hall monitors"? 
    "I do not look upon advisors as hall monitors. " 
    "I think they are there to help the activities. " 
    That was the forum as it existed at Williamsport High School prior to the decision of the District Court in this case. 
    Petros did not meet until after the District Court... other than informally... until after the District Court decided this case and issued its order. 
    So, the District Court in this case altered the forum as it existed. 
    The relevance of that is that it is our position that the Petitioners must live with the forum as it existed and that forum was to have advisors. 
    Why? 
    Because the School Board wants to have structure and direction given in the educational process and that occurred in these clubs before the District Court's order in this case and it is our contention that that should occur and that by the District Court's altering the forum it puts... in effect, gives the Petitioners the right to negotiate as to how the forum will be and that is not consonant with the basic purpose of public education.

    That is correct.

    And, if we don't do that, do you lose or do you have other grounds?
speaker="john_c_youngman_jr" startTime="2308.110" stopTime="2491.397">
    Mr. John C. Youngman, Jr. 
    We certainly have other grounds, Justice White. 
    If there is... It is our position here that there is an Establishment violation, whether or not there was a public forum or not, and that is based on the nature of the forum as it existed at Williamsport High School. 
    We believe that when an advisor is present to help the students, this objectively is sponsoring and advancing religion. 
    In addition, I would point out on page 76 of the record with respect to this advisor the answer of Mr. Newton, the Principal, to Mr. Seevers' question. 
    "Do you make, you and the other principals or supervisors, actively check, attend, periodically, student groups to make sure that the speech which is going on is what you consider proper? " 
    Answer: 
    "I would say that the very rule that we have with regard to any group must meet with a faculty advisor gives us direct input as to what is going on. " 
    And, then, there is a stipulation in this case, found on page 144 of the Appendix with respect to this advisor situation. 
    There is... Reading in the middle of Paragraph One, Faculty Advisors: 
    "There is, however, an unwritten policy of the Williamsport Area High School that each student club have an adult advisor who is generally a faculty member or another employee of the school district. " 
    "In some circumstances, parents of student club members serve as adult advisors. " 
    And, then in the next paragraph: 
    "Selection is based upon the nature of the particular club and corresponding background of the faculty member. " 
    "Although students may request a particular adult advisor, the principal and his staff have final approval as to whom will serve as an advisor to a student club. " 
    Then, I would like to point out on page 65 of the Appendix that the nature of the forum as it existed in the question: 
    "Are there any political clubs such as the Young Democrats or Young Republicans, something of that nature. " 
    "No". 
    And,--
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="2491.397" stopTime="2510.625">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Now, do you mean by that, if you will clear it up for me, that if the faculty member was there they can participate in the debate of the students on a political issue?

    Mr. John C. Youngman, Jr.

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    So, if the faculty advisor had republican leanings, he could... or she... could influence the line of discussion, is that what you are suggesting?

    Mr. John C. Youngman, Jr.

    They could have one, could they not, a Republican or a Democratic Club?

    Mr. John C. Youngman, Jr.

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    But, we are concerned here with the scope of the authority as well as what really took place. 
    So, clear that up for me, if you will. 
    Could a group of students get together and say we want to meet with this other group who are Democrats and we will call ourselves Republicans and have a debate. 
    They could do that under this arrangement?

speaker="john_c_youngman_jr" startTime="2584.016" stopTime="2621.532">
    Mr. John C. Youngman, Jr. 
    There is nothing except that the clubs that were in this forum were uncontroversial and I believe that the School Board would not have opened this forum generally to First Amendment speech on the ground that they would not have wanted to promote controversy and divisiveness. 
    The purpose of the forum was to examine... First of all, to expand on directly curricular activities.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="2621.532" stopTime="2641.978">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Do you suggest the school performs its function of getting young people ready for citizenship if it would forbid a group to get together, one asserting a democratic position and one asserting a republican position and perhaps someone asserting a socialist position? 
    Do you think they could prohibit that?
speaker="john_c_youngman_jr" startTime="2641.978" stopTime="2741.078">
    Mr. John C. Youngman, Jr. 
    If there were a non-public forum, I believe, yes. 
    That is my position. 
    And, I think they could prohibit that absent a public forum. 
    If there was a public forum, then, no. 
    The answer to that is no. 
    I would also like to call the attention of the Court to the Joint Appendix at page 104, the second paragraph, which is an affidavit of Wayne E. Newton, the Principal of the school, the last paragraph prior to III. 
    "Any student activity or club which is considered to contribute to the intellectual, physical or social development of the students and is otherwise considered legal and constitutionally proper would likely be approved as an officially sponsored and sanctioned school activity. " 
    That was also the nature of the clubs. 
    They were approved, they were sponsored, and that is the nature of the public school. 
    There is structure, there is direction, and people understand that what goes on there is approved and sponsored by the district. 
    That is the nature.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="2741.078" stopTime="2770.254">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Let me come back to this other question because I am perplexed by your responses. 
    Suppose a group of students said we want to have one of these seminars, one of these gatherings, in the school in this period to discuss the whole problem of the budget deficit. 
    We kids... the children would say to the faculty... We kids are going to have to pay that and we would like to have a debate about it. 
    Would that be permitted?
speaker="john_c_youngman_jr" startTime="2770.254" stopTime="2775.626">
    Mr. John C. Youngman, Jr. 
    My reaction is that that would be permitted.

    How could you discuss that--
speaker="john_c_youngman_jr" startTime="2779.048" stopTime="2823.951">
    Mr. John C. Youngman, Jr. 
    But, it would be... The point is it would have an advisor there and would be subject to structure and direction from the School District. 
    We, as a School Board, were not going to give up our right to give structure and direction to the education that was going on in the public school. 
    If that had happened, believe me, the parents would have been in on us the next day complaining loudly and bitterly about having a situation where there was no direction being applied at the school.

    Mr. Youngman, suppose we reverse the Court of Appeals and the School Board says, well, even if this is not an establishment, we nevertheless don't want the group to meet and we are perfectly free to do that just as our own decision.

    Mr. James Madison Smart, Jr. 
    A few comments, Your Honor. 
    Mr. Chief Justice: 
    First of all, I would like to disagree with Mr. Youngman about the discretion of the school administrators. 
    I view the decision of the District Court in this case resting on the fact that the Establishment Clause was the only reason asserted for denying this group an opportunity to meet and I think it would be a different case--

speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3504.805" stopTime="3512.413">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Would you say that under the... Would you say that if we reverse the Court of Appeals the School Board could nevertheless keep your group out?
speaker="james_madison_smart_jr" startTime="3512.413" stopTime="3515.551">
    Mr. James Madison Smart, Jr. 
    --I think it would be an entirely different case.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3515.551" stopTime="3517.098">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, that isn't what I asked you.
speaker="james_madison_smart_jr" startTime="3517.098" stopTime="3520.284">
    Mr. James Madison Smart, Jr. 
    Yes. 
    I think they could keep it out if they had--

    Justice Byron R. White 
    Do you mean despite their free-speech interest?

    Mr. James Madison Smart, Jr. 
    --No. 
    Only if they had a structured activity period, only if they had a--

    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, yes, there is a structured activity period, isn't there?
speaker="james_madison_smart_jr" startTime="3529.547" stopTime="3535.933">
    Mr. James Madison Smart, Jr. 
    --Yes. 
    And, if it is predetermined what the categories are in their curricular, then they could keep them out.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3535.933" stopTime="3545.351">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, if there is a forum in the school, you would think your group should be able to get in. 
    You would think the First Amendment would require them to get in.
speaker="james_madison_smart_jr" startTime="3545.351" stopTime="3546.539">
    Mr. James Madison Smart, Jr. 
    Yes, Your Honor, we would argue that.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="3546.539" stopTime="3570.748">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Well, what if the school policy were that we will have an activities period and it is open only to secular groups to meet. 
    Can the school do that, not considering the Act passed by Congress that might superimpose some different standard today. 
    As a matter of constitutional doctrine, could the school do this?
speaker="james_madison_smart_jr" startTime="3570.748" stopTime="3591.973">
    Mr. James Madison Smart, Jr. 
    Your Honor, I do not believe that they could articulate a valid reason for having only secular activities once they have opened the forum. 
    I also think it would create Establishment Clause problems with regard to excessive entanglement of determining what is religious and what is not religious as the Court discussed in the Widmar case.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="3591.973" stopTime="3597.144">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    I gather they would simply have to abandon the whole program to keep your group out.
speaker="james_madison_smart_jr" startTime="3597.144" stopTime="3622.414">
    Mr. James Madison Smart, Jr. 
    Your Honor, I think they would not have to abandon the whole program. 
    I think they have a choice of curricular-related groups that are an extension of the curriculum, or letting the students decide and if they let the students decide, then they can't keep the religious group out. 
    And, all we are saying here is we believe they have opened the forum and we are just asking to be included in that.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="3622.414" stopTime="3627.382">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Mr. Smart, do you take the position your clients have the right to use the bulletin boards as the other activity groups do?
speaker="james_madison_smart_jr" startTime="3627.382" stopTime="3631.927">
    Mr. James Madison Smart, Jr. 
    No, Your Honor, that is not in this case. 
    Our clients have never sought that right.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="3631.927" stopTime="3637.720">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    I know they haven't sought it, but assume they did seek it. 
    Would they not have the same right as others and, if not, why not?
speaker="james_madison_smart_jr" startTime="3637.720" stopTime="3676.190">
    Mr. James Madison Smart, Jr. 
    If our students had sought that right, then I think this Court would want to know more about the details of how that is administered, who puts the notices up there, who determines what is up there, and that sort of thing. 
    We would argue that if it is the students putting the notices up there, then the concept of neutrality, if everyone realizes this is the students' bulletin board and they can put whatever they want to up there, then the concept of neutrality requires that they have equal access to that bulletin board. 
    If there were more government involvement in the board, then it might be a different question.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="3676.190" stopTime="3691.261">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Well, Mr. Smart, under your view, would the Board have to permit some group such as Sons of Satan or whatever it might be that would be entirely anti-religious to come and meet?
speaker="james_madison_smart_jr" startTime="3691.261" stopTime="3696.026">
    Mr. James Madison Smart, Jr. 
    Yes, Your Honor, the School Board would have to permit that.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="3696.026" stopTime="3697.743">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Or a neo-Nazi party?
speaker="james_madison_smart_jr" startTime="3697.743" stopTime="3735.806">
    Mr. James Madison Smart, Jr. 
    Or a neo-Nazi party unless the School Board can articulate a compelling interest. 
    And, the School Board would probably have two options in that regard. 
    Number one, a hate group or something of that nature might present a compelling state interest to keep them out or a school district could always go to a parental consent format if it was causing a lot of political turmoil for the school board to have such a group. 
    I think that would be an easier way. 
    It would keep the government from prescribing what is orthodox. 
    I think the issue is--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="3735.806" stopTime="3742.022">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Did both parties here agree that in this instance an open forum had been created?
speaker="james_madison_smart_jr" startTime="3742.022" stopTime="3744.194">
    Mr. James Madison Smart, Jr. 
    --Did both parties agree?
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="3744.194" stopTime="3745.833">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Both sides.
speaker="james_madison_smart_jr" startTime="3745.833" stopTime="3751.111">
    Mr. James Madison Smart, Jr. 
    Both sides in the District Court I think, in effect, agreed that at least that was not contested.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="3751.111" stopTime="3756.328">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    So, perhaps it isn't necessary in this case to wrestle with all those problems.
speaker="james_madison_smart_jr" startTime="3756.328" stopTime="3757.109">
    Mr. James Madison Smart, Jr. 
    That is exactly right.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="3757.109" stopTime="3759.905">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    The only barrier is the Establishment Clause now?
speaker="james_madison_smart_jr" startTime="3759.905" stopTime="3766.872">
    Mr. James Madison Smart, Jr. 
    The only thing we are asking this Court is to decide that our group does not face any additional barrier because of the Establishment Clause.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3766.872" stopTime="3778.320">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    But, wasn't an issue in the Court of Appeals whether any kind of an open forum had been created at all, because the Court of Appeals certainly spent a lot of time discussing it and saying, yes, there is one.
speaker="james_madison_smart_jr" startTime="3778.320" stopTime="3783.692">
    Mr. James Madison Smart, Jr. 
    That was certainly argued by Mr. Youngman in the Court of Appeals that there was no public forum created.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3783.692" stopTime="3789.518">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Exactly. 
    I suppose, in support of the judgment below, he could argue it here.
speaker="james_madison_smart_jr" startTime="3789.518" stopTime="3805.169">
    Mr. James Madison Smart, Jr. 
    Yes, Your Honor, he could argue that. 
    The fact is that the only reason that the School District said that we can't meet is because of the Establishment Clause. 
    They did not say, well, we think that this in inappropriate--

    It does not contain the letter from the attorney, however, we do have a recitation in the record from the Superintendent of what the attorney said.

    I understand. 
    But, the opinion itself was not put in record?

    Mr. James Madison Smart, Jr. 
    The opinion itself is not in the record, but it is clear from the record that the opinion of the attorney concerning the Establishment Clause was the only reason and I think that it would be a different case if the school had said it is inappropriate for this reason or that reason or some other reason.
