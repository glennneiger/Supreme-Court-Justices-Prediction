    Mr. Robert E. Manley 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, to a certain extent this case can be characterized as the opposite of the Tuttle case which this Court decided several months ago. 
    Here we do not have low level policemen going off on a frolic of their own to violate constitutional rights. 
    We have the opposite. 
    We have patrolmen and deputy sheriffs who have grave reservations about the propriety of their chopping down a door in order to search a private doctor's office without a search warrant, armed only with an order to attach the bodies of people who may or may not be inside and who are not the owners of the premises. 
    Because of these grave reservations, they summoned for instructions from their superiors. 
    Ultimately, their superiors referred the problem on up to the county prosecutor, who is an elected official, and who is--

    Mr. Robert E. Manley

    The county, Hamilton County.

    Mr. Robert E. Manley 
    The Hamilton County deputy sheriffs. 
    The Sixth Circuit reversed the trial court with respect to the city of Cincinnati, so the only issue is whether or not Hamilton County has exposure for this unconstitutional invasion.

    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    So if the prosecuting... if the county attorney, if that is the term in Hamilton County, wants a particular item seized by the police, he can tell the chief of police, go out and seize that item, I think it is legal to do so?

    Mr. Robert E. Manley 
    It is also in the respondent's brief in Footnote 1 at Page 8 where it is set forth, the language is set forth. 
    So that we are in a situation where the county prosecutor has been found by the Court of Appeals to be a policymaker, and under the procedure of referring questions... the sheriff has a policy to refer questions of this sort to the prosecutor. 
    It is referred to him, and he says go in and get them. 
    He gives them instructions to go in and get them. 
    The deputies, when they get these instructions, tell Dr. Pembaur, Doctor, please open the door, because if you don't, we are going to have to break it down, because the prosecuting attorney told us to go in and get them. 
    There was no doubt in the minds of the sheriffs or deputy sheriffs as shown on the record in this case that they were operating under instructions from the county prosecutor, who is a policymaker for Hamilton County in areas of his authority, and who is obligated under Ohio law to give instructions to county departments, including the sheriff's department, and he gave instructions. 
    The instructions were followed, and as a consequence the door was chopped down, and the search was conducted without a search warrant.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="338.934" stopTime="344.338">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Does the record tell us that the search was conducted by county sheriffs or city police?
speaker="robert_e_manley" startTime="344.338" stopTime="410.680">
    Mr. Robert E. Manley 
    Well, it was a joint exercise. 
    The sheriffs arrived. 
    Later city police arrived. 
    The sheriffs attempted to break the door down without success. 
    This lasted for two hours. 
    The sheriffs sat around for two hours waiting to act until they got the instructions from the county prosecutor. 
    They put their shoulders to the door. 
    It didn't budge, so the police took an ax and sledgehammer and broke it down. 
    Then the sheriffs went in and conducted the search. 
    I forget whether the policemen went in or not, but I believe they did. 
    But the sheriffs were responsible for conducting the search. 
    The police were there under a city policy to assist the sheriffs. 
    And in this situation, as I read Tuttle, a policy is the selection of alternative courses of action, and in this particular situation the prosecutor was apprised of the situation. 
    He knew he could have... had plenty of time to get a search warrant, because there was a two-hour interval between the arrival of the sheriffs and the time of the breakdown, during which time the doctor served the sheriffs tea from the window. 
    It was not a--

    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Mr. Manley, let me go back just a moment to the thing we were questioning you about earlier. 
    Did you say that the Court of Appeals found as a matter of Ohio law that the county attorney had line authority over the sheriff?
speaker="robert_e_manley" startTime="421.838" stopTime="457.095">
    Mr. Robert E. Manley 
    --No, I did not say that. 
    The Court of Appeals did not address that particular question. 
    The Court of Appeals did say the county prosecutor is a policymaking official in this area of activity, and did say that the constitutional rights of the doctor were in fact violated, but found that there was no policy in this particular case because of the failure to implement the county prosecutor's position more than once. 
    And here, I believe the Sixth Circuit has confused two lines of cases.

    Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. 
    May I ask you a question before you proceed? 
    The telephone call was received by the assistant county prosecutor. 
    If there had been a policy, why would he have gone to the prosecutor himself?
speaker="robert_e_manley" startTime="470.419" stopTime="472.455">

    Well--

    Mr. Robert E. Manley 
    --I believe, there again, as I read Monell and Owen, we have a county policy when the person who has the authority acts, and if he has the authority to take an action on behalf of the county, that thereby becomes policy.

    Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. 
    What does the word "policy" mean?
speaker="robert_e_manley" startTime="523.466" stopTime="556.687">
    Mr. Robert E. Manley 
    Well, I believe that it is defined in Tuttle as the selection from alternative courses of action, and here the county prosecutor had the option of getting a search warrant... the county courthouse was five minutes away... telling the deputy sheriffs to secure the area and wait for them to leave at the close of the business day if they were there, or having the deputy sheriffs go out to the homes of the individuals, which is where the capiases were addressed. 
    You know, the record shows that the capias for Dr. Maulden was issued 20 days before the break in. 
    They had 20 days in which to--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="556.687" stopTime="559.639">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    What policy do you think the county attorney adopted here?
speaker="robert_e_manley" startTime="559.639" stopTime="615.642">
    Mr. Robert E. Manley 
    --The county attorney adopted... did two things. 
    First of all, he articulated what both he and the sheriff believed to be the long-standing policy of the county. 
    Namely, you can break down a door to make an arrest, and that is based upon an Ohio statute which says you can break down a door to make an arrest. 
    It is based upon a Sixth Circuit decision I believe McKinney, which is cited in our brief. 
    But that Sixth Circuit decision refers to an arrest where there has been a warrant issued for arrest for a crime. 
    This is a capias, a body attachment, an order that a notary public can issue in the state of Ohio without any kind of prior judicial review, and of course this Court in Steagald has clearly indicated what the county thought the policy was was--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="615.642" stopTime="622.963">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    You say he articulated a longstanding county policy. 
    Does that suggest it had not been articulated before?
speaker="robert_e_manley" startTime="622.963" stopTime="626.783">
    Mr. Robert E. Manley 
    --Well, it had never been written down.

    Why wouldn't it be a custom, then, if not a policy?
speaker="robert_e_manley" startTime="629.283" stopTime="641.291">
    Mr. Robert E. Manley 
    The record shows that the sheriff and the deputy sheriffs testified that they had served capiases on third party--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="641.291" stopTime="647.095">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, at the time it was quite constitutional to run searches this way, wasn't it?

    Mr. Robert E. Manley 
    --On a capias? 
    I don't think so.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="648.497" stopTime="655.151">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    No, but I mean a search of a third party was not unconstitutional at that time.

    Mr. Robert E. Manley 
    With a search warrant, but not without a search warrant. 
    There is no case that I can find that says that you can use a capias--

    Justice Byron R. White 
    What did Steagald hold?
speaker="robert_e_manley" startTime="662.888" stopTime="712.253">
    Mr. Robert E. Manley 
    --Steagald held that you cannot use an arrest warrant as a substitute, but we are not talking about an arrest warrant. 
    We are talking about a capias, which is a different kind of breed of cat under Ohio law. 
    It is not... in the McKinney case the Sixth Circuit held that you have extraordinary circumstances because there has been a judicial determination that there is probable cause that a crime has been committed. 
    You don't have any of that with respect to a capias. 
    Any witness who doesn't appear is subject to being picked up as in... after the manner of a forthwith subpoena, and that kind of an order can be even issued, as I say, by a notary public, without any kind of prior judicial determination that there is probable cause that there has been a crime committed, so that is an entirely different thing, and I know of no case that says you can use a capias as a substitute for a search warrant.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="712.253" stopTime="722.711">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    But in this case the Sixth Circuit held that its McKinney case, which I gather was based on a search warrant and not a capias, exonerated Waylan.
speaker="robert_e_manley" startTime="722.711" stopTime="758.032">
    Mr. Robert E. Manley 
    That is correct, but you see, there, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, Waylan is subject to a good faith immunity defense, whereas Owen is... under Owen the county is not. 
    So that Waylan can be honestly mistaken, and be free of any liability, but the county does not have a good faith immunity defense, and so that... but the McKinney case involved an arrest warrant, not a search warrant, but not a capias. 
    There is no case that we have found where a capias has been used as a substitute for a search warrant.

    Was that before he called the prosecutor?

    Mr. Robert E. Manley 
    --After he called the prosecutor, and so there would have been enough time at that period to have gotten a search warrant.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="784.184" stopTime="814.786">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Mr. Manley, let me read you two sentences from the Court of Appeals opinion on 5A of the petition for writ of certiorari. 
    You are probably familiar with the opinion. 
    It is talking about Waylan's actions, and it says, 
    "Waylan's actions therefore did not violate any clearly established constitutional right. " 
    "In fact, his instructions to the officers accorded with the law as it stood in 1977. " 
    Now, that sounds as though the Court of Appeals didn't agree with your distinction between capiases and search warrants.
speaker="robert_e_manley" startTime="814.786" stopTime="817.754">
    Mr. Robert E. Manley 
    They didn't discuss that distinction.

    Mr. Robert E. Manley 
    Well, assuming that were the correct view of federal constitutional law, with which, of course, I don't agree, then that still makes the Sixth Circuit incorrect in its determination of the case for the following reason.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="850.209" stopTime="861.267">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, if that were the case, at the time this search was made, at the time they knocked the door down, it was quite constitutional to do so on that assumption.

    They were mistaken. 
    That is correct. 
    And so that we have a situation where we have a policymaker doing one of two things, either, A, articulating a longstanding practice or policy, what was believed to be the lawful course of action in his official capacity as the county prosecutor, or taking an act which constitutes policy. 
    In either event, he is shaping policy for the county, and that policy directly resulted in breaking down the door and the illegal search without a search warrant, and under these circumstances, we respectfully submit that the Sixth Circuit should be reversed, and that the county should be held accountable for the implementation of this policy in breaking down the door and searching the premises without a search warrant.

    Well, that is why I started to say the Sixth Circuit, I think, got off on the wrong track, but if you are trying to prove policy by means of a longstanding practice or custom, I think you have to show more than one time, repeated occurrences, and maybe even as in Rizzo 20 cases is not enough. 
    But on the other hand, a policy doesn't have to be proven by circumstantial evidence. 
    A policy can be proven by the statements or the writings or the actions of a policymaker.

    Mr. Robert E. Manley 
    There is nothing like that here, but for this particular area of activity, the governing body has... county commissioners would have no power to pass such a resolution. 
    The only people that have the power to set policy in this area are either the county prosecutor or the county sheriff, and they work together as a team.

    Or a policy manual. 
    But there is a state statute that says you may break down a door to effect an arrest, and then you get into an ambiguity, does that apply to capiases or not, so that certainly they were following, and they relied upon this state statute throughout the multiple appellate processes in various courts, so to that extent the statute was articulating a policy that applied in the county and was implemented by the county prosecutor.

    Some organizations do.

speaker="lewis_f_powell_jr" startTime="1355.494" stopTime="1359.529">

    Mr. Robert E. Manley 
    Well, that is not correct. 
    The assistant prosecutor could have looked at the Ohio statute, and if he had, he would have said, based upon the Ohio statute, break down the door. 
    He could have discussed it with the county sheriff, who would have said, well, it is our policy to use force to effect an arrest, failing to make a distinction between a capias and an arrest warrant, so that if he had done that, it would not have fallen under the single act policy formation. 
    It would have fallen under the articulation of a longstanding policy as reflected in the Ohio Revised Code, and as reflected in the custom of the sheriff's department. 
    So that far he could have gone, but I just... what I am having difficulty with is whether or not, if those other things were not present, would he be able by a single act to be able to create a new policy, and I honestly don't know the answer to that question.

   Argument of Roger E. Friedmann
speaker="roger_e_friedmann" startTime="1424.971" stopTime="1558.889">
    Mr. Roger E. Friedmann 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, on behalf of the respondent Hamilton County, Ohio, we would urge this Court to affirm the decision of the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, which found that the petitioner had suffered no constitutional deprivation because of a policy of Hamilton County, Ohio. 
    Before proceeding into the argument, I think it would be well to clarify several points that were raised on the petitioner's argument, especially with regard to some of the facts. 
    The record before the Court does indicate that Deputy Webb testified that there had been other instances where the third party premises had been searched in effectuating an arrest warrant. 
    However, the record also reflects that Webb testified that he had never had to use force before because he had never been denied entry before. 
    When he had the arrest warrant for someone, the person who owned the premises let him in the door. 
    Also, in response to a question from Justice Marshall, petitioner indicated that the police had talked to the prosecutor before they went to get the fire ax. 
    That in fact is not correct. 
    The police department, the Cincinnati police department never did talk to the prosecuting attorney in Hamilton County, Ohio. 
    It was a deputy sheriff who contacted his supervisor, who in turn connected the deputy sheriff to the prosecutor's office, and the deputy sheriff first talked to an assistant prosecuting attorney who went in and talked to the prosecuting attorney, and the message was relayed back to the deputy sheriff. 
    One other matter, and this is a minor matter, but or Page 3 in Footnote 4 of the petitioner's reply brief he indicates that the respondents have changed their argument from the Court of Appeals in that in the Court of Appeals we were not arguing that it was not a policy of Hamilton County which caused the deprivation. 
    I believe that the statement that is in the footnote in the petitioner's reply brief is actually taken out of context to the entire paragraph in our brief before the Court of Appeals, and we have not changed our position in this matter. 
    Petitioner would have this Court--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="1558.889" stopTime="1563.609">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Do you agree that the prosecutor has line authority over the sheriff?

    Mr. Roger E. Friedmann 
    --I certainly do not, Your Honor.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="1565.909" stopTime="1578.535">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Footnote 8 of the petitioner's brief that counsel referred to, it says the prosecutor is also the legal advisor for all county officers. 
    Is that the extent of his authority, do you think?
speaker="roger_e_friedmann" startTime="1578.535" stopTime="1598.080">
    Mr. Roger E. Friedmann 
    I believe it is, Your Honor. 
    The statute clearly provides... I think it is Section 309.09 of the Ohio Revised Code... that the prosecutor by statute has the duty to render advice to other county officers when they request such legal advice. 
    That is his duty as the prosecuting attorney with regard to those other county officers.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="1598.080" stopTime="1605.953">
    Justice Byron R. White

speaker="roger_e_friedmann" startTime="1605.953" stopTime="1617.827">
    Mr. Roger E. Friedmann 
    Your Honor, I believe that there probably are situations where the prosecuting attorney may set policy for certain items or certain areas.

speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="1617.827" stopTime="1628.699">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    I suppose you defend the Court of Appeals statement that the prosecutor's advice was consistent with the existing constitutional law at that time.

    If we could. 
    Your Honor, in this action, the petitioner would have the Court impose a liability upon the county because of the actions it believes have been taken by the prosecuting attorney. 
    The petitioner had this Court impose liability because, and only because, the prosecuting attorney gave legal advice to one of the deputy sheriffs, and as we have already said, which advice was proper at the time. 
    After this Court's decision in Oklahoma City versus Tuttle, I think if the county is going to be liable, the petitioner must show that there was an existing unconstitutional policy which caused a constitutional deprivation, and I don't believe that the petitioner has done that in this action.

    Mr. Roger E. Friedmann 
    I think it is very relevant, Your Honor. 
    If liability is to be imposed upon a custom or practice, if it is the first incident that is supported by any evidence, the only way that anyone in any authority is going to know of a customer practice is by repeated incidents of some type of activity, not by one incident, but the question that is before us is whether or not it is a policy, and I don't believe that it is a policy on the part of Hamilton County.

    Justice Byron R. White 
    I don't think it makes any difference in view of the fact that you have never challenged the applicability of Steagald to these facts.
speaker="roger_e_friedmann" startTime="2193.078" stopTime="2240.724">
    Mr. Roger E. Friedmann 
    I think in light of Steagald, though, and knowing what Steagald says, I think the sheriff has some responsibility in that area also to know what the decisions of this Court, the Sixth Circuit, and the courts of Ohio have been as they relate to his execution of arrest warrants or search warrants, and I don't believe that he in his position would be acting as a reasonable man in not knowing the decision in the Steagald case. 
    As we said before, I don't believe that the prosecuting attorney was a policymaker in this particular case with regard to the search of the petitioner's premises. 
    The capias was issued by two separate judges of the Court of Common Pleas.
speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="2240.724" stopTime="2248.478">
    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    Could it have been issued, as your opponent says, by a notary public?
speaker="roger_e_friedmann" startTime="2248.478" stopTime="2282.699">
    Mr. Roger E. Friedmann 
    I believe that there is provision in Ohio law for that situation, but that is not what occurred in this case. 
    The two employees of the petitioner had been subpoenaed to appear before the grand jury. 
    They failed to appear pursuant to the subpoenas that were served upon them. 
    And the foreman of the grand jury went before two separate judges of the Court of Common Pleas advising the court that these witnesses were necessary and that the grand jury desired them to be present, and on that basis of that, two separate judges issued the capias for their arrest, to be brought before the court.

    That's correct, Your Honor.

    You don't go to one judge, and then you go down the hall to another one.
speaker="roger_e_friedmann" startTime="2288.369" stopTime="2348.239">
    Mr. Roger E. Friedmann 
    As a matter of fact, Your Honor, it was before two separate judges. 
    In Hamilton County there is a system whereby every month the presiding judge changes, and the presiding criminal judge is the judge who decides whether or not, if questions arise with regard to the grand jury, what is going to happen, and as it was, this occurred in two different months of the year, of the calendar year, and that is why there were two separate judges who had issued the capiases. 
    As we stated before, the prosecutor is not the policymaker in this area because he was required to give legal advice to the sheriff, not directions to the deputy sheriff. 
    He had no authority to control the activities of the deputy sheriff, and it is even clearer that the prosecuting attorney could not control the activities of the Cincinnati city police department. 
    I believe that the rendering of legal advice--

    Your Honor, as I understand the proceedings, the Court of Appeals reversed and remanded back to the District Court for further proceedings with regard to the city of Cincinnati.

    "The duties of a prosecuting attorney. "

    "may require written opinions or instructions from him. " 
    What significance do you attach to the word "instructions"?

    Would the manner in which one serves a capias be something with respect to which he could give instructions?

    Mr. Roger E. Friedmann 
    I think that could be a matter for which the sheriff could seek legal advice, and that in fact is what the sheriff's department did in this action.

    A recommendation.
speaker="roger_e_friedmann" startTime="2519.749" stopTime="2563.644">
    Mr. Roger E. Friedmann 
    If I as a lawyer give advice to my client, that client is certainly free to disregard that advice, and I think clearly the sheriff is in that same position here. 
    He is not required to follow the advice of the county prosecuting attorney, nor certainly are his deputies. 
    I think the practical result of adopting the position of the petitioner in this case would be that the prosecuting attorneys or district attorneys or whatever in local government units will be somewhat concerned and reticent to give legal advice to their clients if the ultimate result is that the entity can be responsible and liable if there is some constitutional deprivation.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="2563.644" stopTime="2595.096">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    May I ask you one other question, because you called attention to Footnote 4 on the reply brief, and you indicated that your brief had been... portions had been taken out of context, and they indicate, they quote from your brief saying there is a distinction. 
    They seem to suggest that you drew a distinction between a policy of the county itself on the one hand and a policy of either the sheriff or the prosecutor on the other. 
    Do you maintain that there is a difference, that the county prosecutor or the county sheriff could have a policy for which the county would not be responsible?
speaker="roger_e_friedmann" startTime="2595.096" stopTime="2628.504">
    Mr. Roger E. Friedmann 
    Your Honor, I believe that the county prosecutor could have a policy perhaps with regard to the operation of his office for which the county itself does not recognize him as the final repository of authority. 
    In that situation he could have a policy that is not necessarily the policy of Hamilton County. 
    Conversely, he could have a policy if he has the ultimate responsibility in that area where that is the policy of the county.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="2628.503" stopTime="2641.744">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Supposing that the sheriff or the prosecutor or both collectively had a policy regarding service of capiases such as this. 
    Would you question that as being county policy but were their policy?

    Say if the... or say if the sheriff, after consulting with the prosecutor, concluded that it would be his policy to do exactly what they did here, if that were true, would that be county policy in your view?
speaker="roger_e_friedmann" startTime="2658.856" stopTime="2684.840">
    Mr. Roger E. Friedmann 
    The ultimate decision with regard to the execution of an arrest warrant that is directed to the sheriff, I believe, the ultimate responsibility lies with the sheriff to effectuate that warrant, and in that regard, unless there is a specific state statute that requires him to do something else, I think he would be the ultimate policymaker in that regard.

    Mr. Roger E. Friedmann 
    Your Honor, I think in cases such as this in which 42 USC 1963 is involved the Court should be seeking to achieve responsible governmental units where officers act sensibly and reasonably and conform their conduct to existing law while also protecting the rights of individuals. 
    In the present case we have a situation where all persons involved in the local governmental process acted sensibly and reasonably, with one exception, and I think that is the petitioner.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="2724.548" stopTime="2725.917">
    Unknown Speaker 
    And were entitled to qualified immunity?
speaker="roger_e_friedmann" startTime="2725.917" stopTime="2727.467">

    The governmental entity?
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2727.467" stopTime="2729.202">

    No, the individuals.
speaker="roger_e_friedmann" startTime="2729.202" stopTime="2735.439">
    Mr. Roger E. Friedmann 
    I clearly believe that the individuals were entitled to qualified immunity and the courts have so found below.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2735.439" stopTime="2736.975">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    The prosecutor would probably do absolute immunity.
speaker="roger_e_friedmann" startTime="2736.975" stopTime="2861.786">
    Mr. Roger E. Friedmann 
    I would make the argument that the prosecutor is entitled to absolute immunity, being in that position, but definitely qualified immunity would be available. 
    Again, everyone here acted sensibly and reasonably. 
    Subpoenas were lawfully issued for employees to appear before the grand jury. 
    Only on the failure of those witnesses to appear pursuant to the subpoena did the foreman of the grand jury go to the court to seek the capiases. 
    Two separate courts issued the capiases, and the deputy sheriffs went to serve those capiases. 
    The deputy sheriffs attempted service during normal business hours at the known business location of the employees who were named in the capias. 
    When thwarted, they sought legal advice, and the prosecuting attorney gave that legal advice based upon the law of the time as he knew it to exist within the Sixth Circuit. 
    Petitioner, however, barricaded the door. 
    It was only after the Cincinnati police arrived that the door was chopped down. 
    He was convicted for obstructing official business. 
    That conviction was upheld, and this Court denied a petition for writ of certiorari. 
    I think any responsible government official, even though he has immunity in this situation, is not going to be satisfied if he knows that some advice, legal advice that he has given might subject the governmental unit to liability. 
    For all the foregoing reasons, I think that the petitioner has failed to establish an unconstitutional policy on the part of Hamilton County which caused a constitutional deprivation for the petitioner, and I believe that the decision of the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit should be affirmed. 
    Thank you.

    Mr. Robert E. Manley 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, I have a few matters. 
    Initially, Mr. Justice Stevens raised a question of a dialogue between the sheriff and the prosecutor. 
    I do not know whether or not that dialogue took place. 
    I uncovered no evidence of it. 
    But the functional equivalent of it took place in that after the event, the sheriff caused a complete investigation to be made, and the record in this case shows that the sheriff approved the advice that his people got from the county prosecutor, and indicated that what his people did was completely consistent with the policies of his office at that time, so that while we don't have the conversation that Mr. Justice Stevens suggested, we have the functional equivalent.
