    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Ms. Kuhl, I think you may proceed whenever you're ready.
speaker="carolyn_b_kuhl" startTime="66.848" stopTime="226.081">
    Ms. Carolyn B. Kuhl 
    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court. 
    The issue in this case is whether a Government employee union can require a Government agency to bargain over, and therefore to make a subject of grievance arbitration, a proposal that would give the union the right to enforce the provisions of Circular A-76. 
    The court below held that a Government employee union can enforce the circular, but this result is anomalous. 
    A-76 is a management directive. 
    It flows from the authority of the President to manage the budget and to manage the Executive Branch, and it implements the President's economic policies. 
    The circular itself expressly reserves to the President and to his delegates the authority to enforce the circular. 
    But the decision below turned enforcement of the A-76 directive and of the President's management authority, and in turn the interpretation of the directive, over to arbitrators, with review perhaps only by the Federal Labor Relations Authority, perhaps no judicial review. 
    This result is not only contrary to the express language of the circular, but it also interferes with the authority of the President to give directives to his subordinates and to enforce those directives in his own way. 
    It should not be assumed that Congress would have intended this anomalous result and this disruptive result, absent some clear statutory authority. 
    But on the contrary, the statute in fact requires no such solution. 
    Let me try to condense here very quickly the statutory provisions that are at issue. 
    All the parties agree that Title 7 of the Civil Service Reform Act gives management the right to make determinations with respect to contracting out, and all parties also agree that the only constraint on that management right is that it be... that is, the only constraint that's at issue in this case... is that the right to contract out be exercised "in accordance with applicable laws". 
    So that the question for decision is whether the phrase A-76. 
    The first and most important reason why the A-76 is not a law at all.

    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Well, Ms. Kuhl, suppose that we agreed that the circular is not a law for purposes of Section 7106. 
    Does that end the case, or do we still have to determine whether non-compliance with the circular is the subject of a grievance under the Act notwithstanding whether it's included in a collective bargaining agreement?

    Ms. Carolyn B. Kuhl 
    --That's right. 
    But it's our submission that the language of 7106, which says nothing in this chapter shall interfere with management rights, that that applies to not only the negotiability issue, but also to the grievability issue, and the Respondents have not presented any reason why Congress would nave said nothing in this chapter when in fact it meant nothing relating to bargainability or negotiability.

    Well, of course the language there is a bit different. 
    It doesn't say "laws". 
    It says 
    "laws, rules, and regulations. " 
    And we also have some rather specific legislative history there that indicates that Congress was concerned that unions not be able to create rules that would conflict with Government-wide policies. 
    It did not want inconsistencies among the agencies. 
    So that there's, number one, a difference in language and, number two, some rather specific legislative history. 
    And in fact, the Respondents agree that A-76 is a law, rule, or regulation within the meaning of 7117.

speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="418.691" stopTime="421.861">

    Ms. Carolyn B. Kuhl 
    It's quite short. 
    My apologies to the Court. 
    To continue then as to why A-75 is not a law within the meaning of the A-75 itself makes clear that it is not a law and that it's only binding effect flows from the President's authority. 
    The circular states that it does not establish and shall not be construed to create any basis for anyone to challenge agency action or inaction on the grounds that that action or inaction was not in accordance with the circular. 
    The only challenge to agency action that the circular permits is by a very expedited appeals procedure that the circular creates within the agency. 
    And it's important that this procedure is a very rapid one. 
    People who would like to challenge the agency's decision to contract out must file their appeal within 15 days, and the agency within itself must decide within 30 days. 
    And again, there's no further right to review beyond that appeal within the agency. 
    Every court and administrative body other than the court below that has been asked to enforce circular A-76 has respected the limitations that are contained within the language of the circular itself and has refused to create third party enforcement rights. 
    Two Courts of Appeal have turned down challenges brought under the Administrative Procedure Act and the Ninth Circuit has ruled in direct conflict with the decision of the court below. 
    And perhaps most importantly, the Merit System Protection Board, which is the Congress agency which has authority to enforce employee rights in a non-union context, the MSTB has held that an employee's challenge to a reduction in force brought on the theory that the reduction in force was required by an incorrect decision to contract out, that that kind of challenge would not be brought predicated on A-76. 
    Thus, is seeking the right to enforce A-76, the union is seeking a right that non-union employees indisputably do not have, and it's our view that Congress did not anywhere express any intent to create this kind of disparity.

    What effect would the proposal have on management rights, other than an effect on grievance and arbitration procedures?

speaker="carolyn_b_kuhl" startTime="588.028" stopTime="615.938">
    Ms. Carolyn B. Kuhl 
    Well, it would have really a very substantive effect. 
    The union suggests that its proposal is a modest one of trying to enforce A-76. 
    But because they want to enforce A-76, but don't want to accept the conditions under which the President was willing to issue A-76, the union's discretion to make contracting out decisions is very severely impinged when grievance--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="615.938" stopTime="618.313">

    Ms. Carolyn B. Kuhl 
    --Well, the grievance and arbitration... I think our point is that the grievance and arbitration procedures would affect the substance of contracting out, because the agency's decisions will be affected.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="657.687" stopTime="666.215">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Well, the other side takes the position that the Act requires that these matters be subject to grievance and arbitration anyway.
speaker="carolyn_b_kuhl" startTime="666.215" stopTime="701.528">
    Ms. Carolyn B. Kuhl 
    That's correct, but that's because they do not admit that the "nothing in this chapter" language applies to the grievance proceedings as well as to the negotiability context. 
    But the reason why there's a substantive problem here and not just a procedural problem for the agency is because when a grievance is filed the agency is faced with quite a dilemma. 
    It either has to decide to proceed with the contract, in which case it risks later having--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="701.528" stopTime="717.866">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, be a little more concrete. 
    The kind of a grievance that would be filed is that when there's a proposal to contract out the union would grieve and say that you're not following the right procedures and you must not do this until you do; is that it?
speaker="carolyn_b_kuhl" startTime="717.866" stopTime="734.389">
    Ms. Carolyn B. Kuhl 
    --That's right. 
    And to be a little more concrete, they might say, for example, well, you didn't determine personnel cost correctly in making your comparison between in-house costs and costs that would be incurred using an outside contractor.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="734.389" stopTime="739.076">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    And if the arbitrator agreed with then, the contracting out would be interfered with, I gather?
speaker="carolyn_b_kuhl" startTime="739.076" stopTime="826.056">
    Ms. Carolyn B. Kuhl 
    It would be. 
    And in fact, it's interesting, the Authority even agrees that management discretion would be interfered with under those circumstances. 
    They say at least in some cases. 
    Now, their proposed solution we think is not really a solution at all. 
    They say the arbitrators will stay their hands; don't worry, the arbitrators will not be permitted to second guess discretionary judgments of the agency. 
    But in fact, the Authority doesn't cite any statutory language which would so constrain the authority of the arbitrator. 
    And actually, I draw the conclusion from that that the Authority doesn't fully believe what is says. 
    They say that the management rights clause does not apply to the grievance proceedings, but yet they say, well, when arbitrators get into a discretionary area they'll stay their hands. 
    But they don't propose... the Authority does not propose any standards by which arbitrators are to decide when to stay their hands. 
    And moreover, if the arbitrators do not stay their hands in the discretionary area, there can indeed be review by the Federal Labor Relations Authority. 
    But as I've stated, it is questionable whether... it's an open question as to whether there can be any judicial review beyond that point.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="826.056" stopTime="854.139">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    I take it you submit alternative theories by which you could prevail, the theory that 7106 ends the inquiry if the circular is not a law or the theory that 7117(a)(1) ends the case if we say it's a rule or regulation that's inconsistent.
speaker="carolyn_b_kuhl" startTime="854.139" stopTime="974.746">
    Ms. Carolyn B. Kuhl 
    That's correct, and we have yet another variation on the first theory. 
    If A-75 is a law... and of course we don't concede that it is a law... but if it is a law, we say that it is not an applicable law within the meaning of the statute. 
    And the reason that we say that is because we read the "in accordance with applicable laws" language to give unions the right only to enforce laws that have rights personal, directly personal, to the employees. 
    If you read the phrase "in accordance with applicable law" more broadly than that, you run into some quite anomalous results, and Respondents do not explain why this result could have been intended by Congress. 
    They wouldn't draw any lines. 
    They would say "in accordance with applicable law" means that so long as the agency's action is constrained by some law somewhere, and so long as the agency's action has some effect on employees somehow, then there can be review or the unions can enforce that law. 
    But to just give a hypothetical of why that reads "in accordance with applicable laws" much too broadly, suppose Congress instructs the Forest Service to give priority to fire prevention, and suppose that the Forest Service then decides that it should conduct a reduction in force and some Forest Service personnel are included in that reduction in force. 
    The Authority's construction, the Respondent's construction, would seem to allow the union to come in and argue that the reduction in force was not in accordance with applicable law because Congress had indicated that fire prevention was a priority.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="974.746" stopTime="979.713">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well, under the union's theory, would that then be decided by an arbitrator?
speaker="carolyn_b_kuhl" startTime="979.713" stopTime="983.555">
    Ms. Carolyn B. Kuhl 
    That's correct, it would be decided by--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="983.555" stopTime="986.726">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Whether the fire service... Forest Service was laying off the right people?
speaker="carolyn_b_kuhl" startTime="986.726" stopTime="1348.625">
    Ms. Carolyn B. Kuhl 
    --That's right, it would be decided by an arbitrator. 
    So that their construction really leads to the conclusion or would suggest that Congress intended to create very broad private rights of action for union employees. 
    But this Court has held that private rights of action should be inferred only when Congress has intended to create such remedies, and there is no indication of a Congressional intent here to create such broad rights of action. 
    To give the unions this kind of broad right of action would create a great disparity, as I've suggested before, between union and non-union employees in terms of the type of statutes that they can seek to enforce. 
    And as I say, there's no evidence Congress intended this. 
    What we can glean from the legislative history is that Congress intended to take traditional personnel decisions that either union on non-union employees could bring under the old executive order regime and to give unions the ability to take these kinds of rights and raise them through the grievance proceedings. 
    The broad interpretation that the Respondents would give to the 7106 subsection (a)(1). 
    To look at the structure of the statute, subsection (a)(1) management rights, which are the right of the agency to control the mission and the budget and the number of employees of the agency, is not constrained by the "in accordance with applicable law" phrase. 
    In other words, the agency insofar as the union is concerned does not have to act in accordance with applicable laws in setting the mission of the agency. 
    But the Respondent's interpretation of (a)(2) that would reach just the same result that's precluded under subsection (a)(1). 
    This is rather difficult, but let me try and give a hypothetical. 
    Under subsection (a)(2), under the Respondent's theory, the union can require that layoffs comply with applicable law. 
    But under their reading they might be able, for example, to argue that the Forest Service was not complying with Congress' fire prevention priorities when it laid off people in the fire prevention area. 
    But in fact, this kind of challenge would be exactly the sort of challenge that (a)(1) does not permit. 
    It would be a challenge to the mission of the agency. 
    So that while the Respondents try to suggest that they have a coherent interpretation of the statute as a whole, in fact their interpretation does conflict one part of a statute with another, and it also tries to read out certain parts of the statute. 
    For example, it does not give any effect to the language saying 
    "nothing in this chapter shall effect. " 
    It reads that right out of the statute. 
    To go back again to mission, particularly with regard to A-76 and the consequences that will flow if arbitral review of A-76 decisions is permitted. 
    These decisions, if permitted... that is, if arbitral review is allowed... will inevitably interfere with management's authority to contract out, because every aspect of circular A-76 involves matters of agency discretion. 
    One of the chief reasons why courts have declined under the APA to review compliance with A-76 is that it lacks meaningful standards by which to judge an agency's exercise of discretion. 
    And to give just one example of the kind of discretionary judgments that are involved in an agency's carrying out circular A-76, when the cost comparison is done by the agency it is premised on a management study that the agency has to conduct to determine the most efficient composition by which the agency could perform the function, so that already you have an element of estimation, an element of exercise of agency judgment, in just determining what the in-house cost comparison is to be based on. 
    The circular then goes on to say that, in determining personnel costs, one makes a staffing estimate that also is cabined by the tools, judgmental tools, that the agency is to use. 
    And as I've mentioned before, even the Authority admits that this kind of arbitral review for compliance with A-76 will at least sometimes impinge on agency discretion. 
    But again, the solution that they offer is a clearly inadequate one of just the hope that arbitrators will stay their hands when they get into somehow the fine discretionary area. 
    If the Court has no further questions, at this time I'd like to reserve the remainder of my time for rebuttal.

   Argument of Ruth E. Peters
speaker="ruth_e_peters" startTime="1354.295" stopTime="1613.050">
    Ms. Ruth E. Peters 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Courts: 
    One of the responsibilities entrusted to the Federal Labor Relations Authority by Congress is the task of determining the negotiability of collective bargaining proposals in the federal sector. 
    This case arose nearly six years ago now when AFGE submitted a proposal which provided that Petitioner EEOC agree to comply with OMB circular A-76 and other applicable laws and regulations concerning contracting out. 
    The Authority found the proposal to be negotiable. 
    Underlying the Authority's determination are three basic propositions to which the Authority has adhered since the first days of its enabling statute, the first proposition here being that the statute does indeed reserve to management as non-negotiable the substantive exercise in accordance with applicable laws of the management rights enumerated in Section 7105(a)(2); however, a proposal such as the one here that imposes no substantive limitations of its own making, that simple restates management's obligation to comply with applicable legal requirements when exercising those reserved rights, is negotiable. 
    The second proposition here being that the statute in the federal sector defines the scope of the negotiated grievance procedure. 
    Thus, even in the absence of a proposal such as the one here, with or without such a proposal, disputes about the applications of laws, rules, and regulations such as the circular, affecting conditions of employment, are within the scope of the grievance procedure unless the parties agree through negotiations to exclude such grievances. 
    The final proposition here is likewise rooted in the notion that the statute prescribes the scope and the coverage of a negotiated grievance procedure in the federal sector. 
    Thus, no Government-wide rule or regulation, including the circular, even a rule or regulation purporting to address the permissible scope in some fashion of the grievance procedure, may be applied in a manner that is inconsistent with the scope as defined by this Act of Congress. 
    Having stated these propositions, I would also like to note, because I think it is pertinent to an understanding of this case, one proposition in which the Authority's decision takes absolutely no root, and that is this Authority decision and no Authority decision of which I am aware either is based upon or provides any support for the notion that in the area of management's reserved rights choices of policy or matters of discretion that management reserves to itself are somehow susceptible to the bargaining process or to the grievance procedure. 
    An examination of the first proposition, that proposals such as the one here are negotiable, demonstrates the faithfulness of the Authority in this decision to the text of the statute and to its own decisional precedent. 
    The statute does reserve to management in Section 7106(a)(2), along with other rights, the non-negotiable substantive authority to make determinations with respect to contracting out. 
    The Authority in its decisional precedent has recognized, respected, and effectuated that reservation of authority to management. 
    But this authority reserved to management is not unfettered. 
    By the literal terms of the statute, that authority is subject, first of all, to the negotiation of procedures under Section 7106(b)(2) and appropriate arrangements under Section 7106(b)(3). 
    Furthermore, the statute expressly provides that management's contracting out authority, as well as the other enumerated reserved rights, must be exercised in accordance with applicable laws. 
    Thus, a bargaining proposal like this one is not rendered non-negotiable simply because it mentions a reserved right. 
    Indeed, in a long line of decisional precedent, the Authority has consistently found to be negotiable proposals like the one in this case, proposals that impose no substantive criteria of their own making, but instead simply restate management's obligation to act in accordance with applicable laws.

    In terms of Section 7106, I think that a natural meaning given to that term and the term that the Authority has given to the term "in accordance with applicable law" means applicable legal requirements. 
    And certainly, in any of the legal criteria that apply to the rights there, whether it be contracting out or discipline or promotions or work assignments, any of the underlying laws, rules, or regulations could involve expressions of executive or Congressional policy.

    Well, that I do not know. 
    The precedent that exists to this time seems to me either to be based upon a pre-1979 version of the circular, that is during that period, or based upon precedent developed in that period. 
    One of the Claims Court's decisions cited by AFGE in its brief suggests at 4 Claims Court page 198... and it's the International Graphics Division case... that the post-1979 case, Local 2855 versus Brown, that relied upon previous cases, relied upon a version of the circular in 1967 that said no specific standards or guidelines are set present for determining whether cost savings justify going, contracting rather than staying in-house. 
    But the Claims Court suggests that the vitality of this aspect of that case, which I believe is an Eleventh Circuit case, was diminished by the replacement in 1979 of that portion of the circular with the specific and detailed... and this is the language of the Claims Court... cost comparison handbook. 
    So what would happen now in litigation, I am not sure. 
    But it would appear that disappointed bidders or offerors could go to the Comptroller General under certain circumstances. 
    They have entertained review of what they call the mandatory procedures set forth in the cost comparison handbook. 
    And it seems to me that, locking at the Comptroller General cases cited by AFGE in its brief, that when a disappointed bidder or offeror goes there that the Comptroller General conducts the same sort of analysis that occurs under arbitration of applicable laws in our program.

    --In my view and in the authority's view, the scope of the grievance procedure is defined by the statutory definition of "grievance", and the statutory definition of "grievance" talks about matters, first of all, relating to the employment of an employee, and secondly about the misapplication of laws, rules, or regulations affecting conditions of employment. 
    So even if it weren't a law, perhaps a question of whether it's a Government-wide rule or regulation, which ever Petitioner would agree it is under Section 7117, would be pertinent. 
    There are perhaps other applicable laws.

    Ms. Ruth E. Peters 
    --Well, that would I think be the pertinent point.

    And in response to the--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2109.130" stopTime="2111.707">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, it needn't be negotiable to be grievable.

    Ms. Ruth E. Peters 
    --That is correct. 
    But the Authority's theory that it is negotiable is because it places no substantive limitations of its own making upon management's rights. 
    And the issue of grievability arose when the authority stated in its decision that if EEOC, the Petitioner, were interpreting this as somehow... by placing this in the contract--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2136.384" stopTime="2149.489">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    To make it negotiable, don't you have to say that it's a law?

    Ms. Ruth E. Peters 
    --Well, in our view it is... in our view, the natural meaning of the phrase "in accordance with applicable laws" means applicable legal requirements. 
    Many of those requirements may be discretionary, and they would not be susceptible to a grievance procedure. 
    In the area of management rights, essentially management holds all the cards. 
    It first of all determines the underlying policy. 
    For example, in the reduction in force area or the layoff area, which is a reserved management right, it determines, for example, whether reductions in forces are preferable to furloughs, and it also determines whether reductions in force should be based upon seniority or performance or some combination thereof. 
    Having established policies, it also chooses the criteria by itself, without grieving or bargaining, upon which it exercises such rights and effectuates such policies. 
    To the extent that it chooses discretionary criteria for itself, those would not be susceptible to the grievance procedure, and this is true whether it is contracting out or layoff or discipline or any of the reserved management rights. 
    But to the extent that management chooses for itself mandatory criteria against which compliance can be measured... and it would appear that the Comptroller General at least in this area has been able to find some mandatory criteria, although there are also some discretionary ones against which compliance can be measured... that would be susceptible to the grievance procedure to the extent that it affects conditions of employment.

    Ms. Ruth E. Peters 
    I don't know if that's what the Petitioners here have in mind. 
    Authority precedent makes clear that it doesn't permit that. 
    For example, in the lead case in the contracting out area where the Authority protected the substantive rights of management to choose its own criteria and make its own policy, in that case, NFFE Local 1167, the proposal simply was to put portions of the circular as it existed into the contract, and the Authority found that non-negotiable because it would bind them to that even if the circular changed. 
    But a proposal such as this in the Authority's view, simply "in accordance with applicable laws", does not, because management retains the right and there are no specific provisions of the circular or other applicable laws in the contract, so that management can change those during the life of the contract and those will be the applicable provisions in any grievance or arbitration or in any other way that they affect employees.

    I'm a little troubled by that statement, because I suppose it gets back to what the Chief Justice was asking. 
    You have to go through grievance and arbitration to determine whether the agency discretion will be allowed or not. 
    It's going through the process to which the Government objects, I guess.

    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    It is your position that that is not a burden; let them go through the process, and at the end of the line the arbitrator will say: Well, that's subject to agency discretion, so the Government wins... I mean, the agency wins.

    Ms. Ruth E. Peters 
    --It certainly is not a burden that is outside the contemplation of Congress, if it is a burden at all, because Congress made such matters subject to the grievance procedure. 
    And Petitioner and other employing agencies do have one avenue. 
    The exceptions to the grievance procedure as defined by statute are either the five subjects enumerated in the statute... there are five subject areas... or they are matters that the pretties themselves agree to exclude from the grievance procedure through negotiations. 
    So therefore, Petitioner can propose during collective bargaining negotiations that contracting out matters or any other matters that it does not want to have subject to the grievance procedure be excluded from the broad scope of the grievance procedure. 
    But absent such, absent such negotiations and agreement between the parties, the statutory definition is quite explicit and quite express in its breadth and in terms of what it covers. 
    Despite the fact that contracting out is not one of the five subjects expressly excluded by Congress, the Petitioner has contended throughout this litigation that matters concerning contracting out are not grievable. 
    In essence, Petitioner has argued that the statute's designation of a subject as a management right also operates to preclude the subject from the scope of the grievance procedure. 
    But Petitioner acknowledges to this Court that grievances over discipline and promotions are permissible, ever though discipline and promotions are reserved management rights. 
    But Petitioner's reliance on the phrase in Section 7106 
    "nothing in this chapter shall affect. " 
    as having that effect of removing it from the grievance procedure is unavailing. 
    First of all, if they were correct about that language it would mean that even discipline and promotions were not grievable, and they have acknowledged that those subjects are grievable. 
    Furthermore, relying on that phrase in isolation just doesn't take into account the "in accordance with applicable laws" language or the fact that the statute expressly says that it is subject to procedures and appropriate arrangements bargaining. 
    And of course, the legislative history certainly indicates that that section of the statute is meant only to prohibit bargaining in certain respects and it does not treat the grievability of matters. 
    Petitioner now also makes the argument to this Court that, even if it were somehow coming within the grievance procedure, it nevertheless should be excluded because contracting out determinations bear only indirectly on the employment relationship. 
    But of course there are any number of indications of the direct effect of contracting out matters on the bargaining unit employees, and that contracting out affects or is a condition of employment. 
    Among these indications are the very terms of the circular, which since 1979 has recognized the stake that employees and their bargaining representatives have in contracting out by providing them access to the circular's appeals procedure for challenging cost comparisons. 
    The circular, I would note, describes its appeals procedure as a mechanism 
    "intended to protect the rights of all directly affected parties. " 
    Moreover, the circular provides that employees should be informed about the undertaking and the progress of cost studies, and agency regulations, which also involve grievable matters to the extent that they impose mandatory criteria, agency regulation such as the Air Force and Army regulations referenced in AFGE's bried have specific provisions about employee and union involvement in aspects of the cost study. 
    And the circular itself also addresses arrangements for employees who are adversely affected by the conversion to contract performance of services. 
    And as I have noted before, the Office of Management and Budget extended national consultation rights over the circular to federal sector unions, and those are extended with regard to laws, rules, or regulations... excuse me, Government-wide regulations affecting any substantive change in any condition of employment. 
    And furthermore, the notion that Congress intended to exclude contracting out matters from the scope of the grievance procedure doesn't find any support in the legislative history or the language. 
    And to the extent that private sector precedent provides an appropriate analogy for our program, that law strongly supports the status of contracting out as a condition of employment and of its susceptibility to the grievance procedure. 
    But this does not mean, of course, to say that anything, no matter how attenuated its relationship or effects on employment, would be subject to the grievance procedure, but that matters such as this are. 
    Disputes involving contracting out determinations, to the extent that they affect... excuse me. 
    Thank you.

    Ms. Carolyn B. Kuhl 
    I'd just like to make one point briefly, if I may. 
    Of course, it is our submission that 7106 states... or applies not only to negotiability, but also to the grievance procedure, so that the reason why we're debating here whether A-76 is a law or not is because 7106 constrains not only negotiability, but also arbitrability.

    Ms. Carolyn B. Kuhl 
    Well, and indeed, as to the interpretation of A-76, it should be the interpretation of the Office of Management and Budget that should prevail. 
    But on the issue of whether 7106 applies to grievances, the Authority's own decisions have held... and I might just cite AFGE Local 1968 and Department of Transportation, a 1981 decision. 
    That decision and others, the PATCO decision, have held that whenever a proposal for negotiation creates a possibility, ever a possibility, that an arbitrator will second guess the agency's management discretion, the result should be that there should be no negotiation over that proposal, as well as ultimately no grievances may be brought on the proposal. 
    For those reasons, we ask that the Court reverse the decision or the judgment below.
