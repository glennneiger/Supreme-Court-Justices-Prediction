    Mr. Jack T. Lassiter 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the issue presented in Hill v. Lockhart is rather a technical and narrow issue, but one T think is significant in the daily workings of the criminal courts. 
    Petitioner William Hill entered a guilty plea in the Pulaski County Circuit Court in 1979 to charges of murder and theft of property. 
    He received a 35-year sentence on the first degree murder conviction and a concurrent ten-year sentence on the theft of property conviction. 
    In his habeas petition which he filed pro se, which appears in the joint appendix a: 8 and 9 he alleged that he bled with the understanding that he would receive a 35-year sentence and that he would be parole eligible after serving one-third of his sentence, less good time.

    He also indicated that his lawyer told him that the Court would impose a 35-year sentence. 
    He alleged that his lawyer told him that he would be out in six years if he stayed out of trouble. 
    He alleged that he was not advised of Act 93 which rendered him parole ineligible until serving one-half of his sentence less good time, since he was a second offender.

    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Would you mind explaining what the law in Arkansas is on alleging and proving prior convictions to enhance or determine parole eligibility? 
    If I understand it correctly, the State is not required to allege and prove the prior conviction.
speaker="jack_t_lassiter" startTime="376.619" stopTime="377.202">
    Mr. Jack T. Lassiter 
    That's correct, Your Honor.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="377.202" stopTime="383.523">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    That's a determination to be made by the parole board after the conviction and the sentence, is that right?
speaker="jack_t_lassiter" startTime="383.523" stopTime="564.589">
    Mr. Jack T. Lassiter 
    It is determined by the Arkansas Department of Corrections. 
    When the inmate is received at the Department of Corrections they will check his prior record through the Arkansas Crime Information Center and the FBI, and then if they find a prior felony conviction for which he was incarcerated, then they use that in computing his parole eligibility that date. 
    The State does not have to allege and prove prior convictions as part of the trial process or plea process. 
    The District Court dismissed the petition without a hearing. 
    The Eighth Circuit affirmed, the Eighth Circuit holding that details of parole eligibility are a collateral and not a direct consequence of the plea and therefore cannot render Mr. Hill's plea involuntary. 
    And also, the Eighth Circuit looks at the Fourth Circuit cases of Strader versus O'Tuel discussed in the brief and finds here that counsel's misadvice, alleged, does not rise to the level of gross misinformation as addressed in Strader and O'Tuel. 
    There is one matter here that I would like to address initially because the cases cited in the brief, a number of them, distinguish between what we call positive misadvice and statements by counsel that are called a mere prediction, or present only a hope of leniency. 
    The State argues that in the situation that Mr. Hill found himself in, and with the series of events as alleged by Mr. Hill, that this could only... that counsel's advice here could only be of a speculative nature, just an estimate, and cannot rise to the level of being positive misadvice, and the State argues that that is so because under the Arkansas rules of Criminal Procedure, the trial judge does not have to accept the recommendation of the State. 
    Now, that is correct, under the Arkansas Rules of Criminal Procedure the trial judge does not have to accept the recommendation of the State. 
    But we're not sure exactly what happened here. 
    Mr. Hill alleged that counsel told him that the judge would accept the plea under the Arkansas Rules of Criminal Procedure. 
    There is a provision which allows the attorneys to discuss the plea with the Court beforehand, and the Court can either accept or indicate that the Court will accept or reject. 
    That may have happened here, we're not sure. 
    If we had a hearing on this matter, I also think that I could show that this particular judge at that time in 1979 accepted almost all recommendations from the State on negotiated pleas, and it was his practice, if he was not going to accept that recommendation, to allow the defendant to--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="564.589" stopTime="575.628">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Well, under this plea the highest potential sentence that could have been imposed was up to 50 years, is that correct?
speaker="jack_t_lassiter" startTime="575.628" stopTime="577.247">
    Mr. Jack T. Lassiter 
    --Five to 50, or life.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="577.247" stopTime="621.426">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    And had the judge given the maximum sentence, then this Mr. Hill would not have had to serve longer than the time he is objecting to here, isn't that true? 
    A third of 50 would be how much? 
    And how is he prejudiced, then, by the fact that he got a lesser sentence that he has to serve half of, which wouldn't be any more than had he received the maximum sentence and served a third of it?
speaker="jack_t_lassiter" startTime="621.425" stopTime="653.794">
    Mr. Jack T. Lassiter 
    Well, the allegation is that he entered the plea based on advice by counsel that he would receive the 35 years, and he did receive the 35 years, and that he relied on that in entering the plea. 
    If he had received a 50-year sentence then the same parole laws would have been in effect. 
    He would have had to have served one-half less good time and not one-third less good time, as counsel told him he would have to serve.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="653.794" stopTime="701.792">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    But, now, when the judge asked him whether any promises were made to him to get him to enter the plea agreement, his response was, no, nothing that didn't appear on the agreement. 
    Are you relying for purposes of this case on a promise that he would get 35 years maximum, or not? 
    Because, that would be in conflict with the face of the plea agreement and I hadn't understood that you had raised that and were relying on that. 
    I understood that you were relying only on an allegation that the lawyer had told him something about his parole eligibility date, not that he had been promised that he would get a 35-year sentence, maximum.
speaker="jack_t_lassiter" startTime="701.792" stopTime="732.163">
    Mr. Jack T. Lassiter 
    Well, I think I have to address the issue of what sentence that the lawyer told him he would get, in order to demonstrate that the lawyer's advice concerning potential parole eligibility was not just an estimate or a prediction, if he were in the situation where nobody knew what Mr. Hill was going to receive when he walked up there and pled.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="732.163" stopTime="740.734">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, he really didn't, did he? 
    He didn't know what he was going to get. 
    The Judge wasn't bound. 
    They could have given him 50 years.
speaker="jack_t_lassiter" startTime="740.734" stopTime="756.945">
    Mr. Jack T. Lassiter 
    He could have, but that was not that judge's practice and counsel advised him that the Court would impose whatever the recommendation was. 
    That is correct, under the Arkansas Rules of Criminal Procedure the judge did not have to take the recommendation.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="756.945" stopTime="771.621">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Let's assume he expected to get 35 years and the judge gave him 50.

speaker="jack_t_lassiter" startTime="771.621" stopTime="791.082">
    Mr. Jack T. Lassiter 
    It depends on what happened before and if it was a negotiated plea where the judge had in no manner whatsoever participated in it, and if counsel had not advised him that he was going to get 35 years and he walked up there and the judge gave him 50 years. 
    No, he--

    Mr. Lassiter, you keep changing the question.

    Mr. Jack T. Lassiter 
    It does not appear at page 8 and 9 in his allegations. 
    Justice Stevens, you raised a question a moment ago concerning what the Court said about the defendant being required to serve one-third. 
    I would like to clear this up. 
    There is some misunderstanding about that. 
    Whatever the Circuit Court Judge would have said at that time would have had no effect on the potential parole eligibility date of the petitioner. 
    It was strictly controlled by Act 93 and that would have been set once he reached the Department of Corrections. 
    I believe that that was probably just a result of having at that time some of the judges continuing to do that, because prior to the enactment of Act 93 if one was under the age of 21 and he would be immediately parole eligible upon being sent to the Arkansas Department of Corrections as a first offender, and the judge could make him serve one-third less good time by saying he had to serve a third. 
    I think that was just force of habit. 
    His statement that he was to do one-third would have had no effect whatsoever on the amount of time that he was to serve.

    Yes, but on the other hand, maybe if they'd known... I don't know what that conviction was. 
    It might have been something that might have made the prosecutor ask for a more severe sentence. 
    I just don't know, and if you get a hearing that you've asked for, the testimony will be presented by your client about his conversation with a now deceased lawyer, a kind of unsatisfactory state of affairs.

    Mr. Jack T. Lassiter 
    Yes, it certainly is, and that's one of the first things that your client wants to know if you are negotiating a plea. 
    So, criminal defense attorneys are, and certainly should be, well aware of the defect of Act 93 because everybody wants to know that. 
    If you're going to negotiate a plea they want to know when is the earliest possible date that they could be released. 
    I think we could show at a hearing by putting on attorneys that this kind of advice is extremely important during the course of representing a client when negotiating a plea. 
    I think that we could prove that rather easily and I think we could show that if an attorney misadvises in this manner that it would be a breach of a duty owed a client, and a breach of diligence, which was, I think, the term used in Strickland v. Washington.

   Argument of John Steven Clark
speaker="john_steven_clark" startTime="1610.395" stopTime="1703.255">
    Mr. John Steven Clark 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court, the facts in this case are simple and direct. 
    It is true that Mr. Hill was charged with murder one and theft of property. 
    It is also important for this record to remember that on April 6th, 1979, the defendant in this case entered into a plea agreement. 
    In that specific agreement, in which the plaintiff waived, knowingly waived and informedly waived his constitutional rights to a trial, to confront witnesses, to testify in his own behalf, that document, executed by the defendant with the help of his counsel, in fact is a form which they complete together. 
    On that form the defendant entered "zero" as to prior convictions, without... with assistance of counsel. 
    That same day the defendant and his counsel appeared before the trial court in order to enter his voluntary plea of guilty. 
    The Court inquired as to the terms of the plea agreement, specifically if it was accurate, specifically if the defendant had relied upon any promises, threats or other offers from the prosecution, specifically as to whether the defendant was satisfied with representation of counsel, and specifically if the defendant had any other comments that he would like to offer to the Court. 
    The defendant said no. 
    I submit to you that the central issue in this case--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1703.255" stopTime="1716.765">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    General Clark, just so I can find it in the record, the plea agreement is the one on 28 and 29 of the joint appendix, and where is it that he says "no" as the prior convictions? 
    I just want to be make sure I--

    --In the second paragraph, in the first sentence, Your Honor:

    Unknown Speaker 
    I see.
speaker="john_steven_clark" startTime="1749.918" stopTime="1860.323">
    Mr. John Steven Clark 
    The simple issue, I submit to the Court in this case, is whether the Court of Appeals erred in finding that the Petitioner was not constitutionally entitled to an evidentiary hearing in a collateral attack of his voluntary guilty plea. 
    I submit to you, the Court of Appeals did not make error. 
    This Court on several occasions has emphasized the validity and importance of plea bargaining process, and likewise stated, for the plea bargaining process to work, a guilty plea must be accorded a great measure of finality. 
    In this instance, the truthfulness and the accuracy of this guilty plea, this voluntary guilty plea, is evidenced by the record. 
    I submit that generally speaking, parole eligibility is not a direct but rather a collateral consequence of any guilty plea. 
    It is unnecessary to advise the defendant who desires to plead guilty as to parole eligibility, and the fact that the defendant is misadvised does not in itself per se negate that voluntary plea. 
    In fact, we have found in the Federal Criminal Rules of Procedure, Rule 11, that the... we have stated in the comments that not only is the question as advise as to when someone might make parole or be parole eligible, but whether, and that is true in Arkansas as there is no requirement to advise as to parole eligibility. 
    In the case at bar the record clearly demonstrates, I submit to this Court, that parole eligibility was not a part of the plea bargain, and that this Petitioner was not wrongfully induced to plead guilty based on some assertion. 
    I would further submit to this Court that a better rule of law is that even if the defendant was ill-advised or misinformed as to what the precise eligibility is to be for parole, that fact alone does not take away from guilt or the desire to enter a plea of guilty. 
    There must be some demonstration of prejudice.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1860.323" stopTime="1870.929">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Just while I've got it on my mind, does the record tell us of anywhere that we might have missed as to what the nature of the Florida conviction was, when it occurred, what the offense was and so forth?
speaker="john_steven_clark" startTime="1870.929" stopTime="1880.551">
    Mr. John Steven Clark 
    Your Honor, the record does not. 
    The offense, however, was aggravated assault and breaking and entering, of which he was convicted in '77 and served until '78, at which time he came to Arkansas.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1880.551" stopTime="1887.306">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    I see. 
    Thank you. 
    And the Government knew that when this plea bargaining was going on?
speaker="john_steven_clark" startTime="1887.306" stopTime="1889.523">
    Mr. John Steven Clark 
    Your Honor, I do not know that the Government knew that.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="1889.523" stopTime="1895.477">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Have you ever seen the Government negotiate without a rap sheet?
speaker="john_steven_clark" startTime="1895.477" stopTime="2020.557">
    Mr. John Steven Clark 
    Your Honor, I have not, but in this instance the rap sheet that we had came from the Arkansas State Police. 
    Whether it was complete or not, I do not know. 
    The allegation... the need for finality in the criminal justice process is imperative, I submit to you, particularly when those challenges come from some collateral attack some years later, and are only allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel. 
    This allegation has become a very common vehicle for those incarcerated to seek relief by simply placing the system and their attorney on trial by realizing their petition as petitioner, at worst cases merely the status quo, 
    "I voluntarily entered my plea of guilty, I made an informed decision to waive my rights and was sentenced, but maybe I can receive a more favorable sentence later if I will file this collateral attack on that sentence. " 
    In particular, I submit to you today, what troubles me about this case is that the so-called inducement to plea asserted by Petitioner is actually only that individual's unilateral expectation, an expectation which rarely, as in this case, if ever can be tested by any objective standard, and which submits virtually every guilty plea, and in Arkansas there are some 10,000 entered each year, to attack collaterally at any time when the defendant upon incarceration determines that his expectations, whatever they may have been, that being denied a right to vote would not have occurred, or being denied the right to hold a hunting licence or a barber's licence would not have occurred. 
    If he asserts, then, that because of his expectation he can challenge, collaterally challenge the voluntariness of that plea and be entitled to an evidentiary hearing because of his own individual expectations, and this instance has been stated before clearly, a competent and dedicated and respected public defender, now deceased, cannot be heard as to what in fact did go on in terms of contradicting or supporting the Petitioner's case. 
    But in this instance we have a record that demonstrates that that competent and dedicated public defender, who in my opinion did know the law, saw from the defendant an assertion that there were zero prior convictions.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2020.557" stopTime="2069.889">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    General Clark, on page 16 of the joint appendix, there begins what apparently is the State's response to the federal habeas petition, and which appears to be a transcript of a proceeding before the district court, or at least the State's version of what happened before the Arkansas trial court. 
    On page 18, the paragraph towards the bottom of the page, after the indented observation where the Court says something, and this apparently is the State's paraphrase, it says, 
    "The Trial Judge then stated that Petitioner would be required to serve at least one-third of his sentence before becoming eligible for parole. " 
    Now, is that contested in any way that you know of by opposing counsel?
speaker="john_steven_clark" startTime="2069.889" stopTime="2132.395">
    Mr. John Steven Clark 
    No Your Honor, it is not contested by opposing counsel. 
    I would further submit to this Court that though I recognize there will be those who would appear at this bar and argue that parole was the only factor to be considered by the defendant in pleading guilty, "When do I get out", if you will, that a better rule of law and policy requires that you take into consideration two very important factors, and those are simply these, and must be remembered and balanced against that assertion: the multiplicity of imponderables that can affect parole, not the least of which is the conduct of the defendant or changes in regulations or policy, perhaps, by policy making bodies. 
    I submit that as in this case, when this Petitioner pled guilty voluntarily and in an informed way waived those constitutional rights that are protected, and was sentenced to 35 years which was the agreed recommended sentence, he is not, and I repeat not, constitutionally entitled to serve anything less than 35 years.

    Mr. John Steven Clark 
    Your Honor, I have considered that question carefully. 
    It would be my opinion that perhaps you could make the case where the erroneous advice, or such an inducement to the plea, and on the record the defendant indicated that this was a material fact, to the Court, that, 
    "I wanted this Court to consider. " 
    and therefore if the Court did not consider it you might make such a case.

    Mr. John Steven Clark 
    Yes, Your Honor.

    Justice Byron R. White 
    What if the defendant's lawyer just advised him that parole is available and usually, if you behave yourself, it will be one-third, and it turns out that for this crime parole just isn't available at all, which is true of some crimes?

    Mr. John Steven Clark 
    Yes, Your Honor, it is.
