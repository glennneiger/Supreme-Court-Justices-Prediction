    We'll hear argument now in Number 95-2031, Thomas Young v. Kirk Fordice. 
    Ms. Wright.
speaker="brenda_wright" startTime="9.687" stopTime="81.374">
    Ms. Brenda Wright 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    This case arises because the State of Mississippi, since early 1995, has been conducting voter registration under procedures that have not been submitted for preclearance to the United States Attorney General or to the D.C. District Court, as required by section 5 of the Voting Rights Act. 
    Because the section 5 preclearance requirement is so critical in protecting the right to vote in States such as Mississippi, Congress expressly provided in the National Voter Registration Act of 1993, the NVRA, that States must comply with the Voting Rights Act in implementing the NVRA. 
    Now, the procedures that Mississippi ultimately decided upon in implementing the NVRA established a twotier or dual system under which citizens who register under the provisions of the NVRA must also register separately to be able to vote in State elections, and a plan that implements the NVRA through that type of dual system reflects a change from the voter registration system that Mississippi had in effect prior to 19--

    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Well, may I ask you a question right here about that? 
    Suppose from the outset Mississippi had said we're not going to change our State and local registration system from what it's been. 
    We're going to keep it, but here are the changes we're offering to implement for Federal election purposes the NVRA. 
    Could the Department of Justice refuse to preclear such a scheme if Mississippi kept in place its State local registration scheme and had a proposal that met the statutory requirements for the NVRA?
speaker="brenda_wright" startTime="125.685" stopTime="137.222">
    Ms. Brenda Wright 
    --Yes, it could Your Honor. 
    If the procedures that the State adopted were found by the Attorney General or the D.C. District Court to be discriminatory in purpose or effect, that objection could be made, and--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="137.222" stopTime="151.620">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Well, even in the face of the fact that the NVRA requirements expressly state that they govern only Federal elections?
speaker="brenda_wright" startTime="151.620" stopTime="153.603">
    Ms. Brenda Wright 
    --Well, Your Honor, in this case--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="153.603" stopTime="163.879">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    There seems to be some indication in the statute itself that it never... Congress never purported to require a change in requirements for State and local elections.
speaker="brenda_wright" startTime="163.879" stopTime="167.452">
    Ms. Brenda Wright 
    --It doesn't require that, that is true. 
    It leaves that decision up to the States, but--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="167.452" stopTime="172.545">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    But you think that the Attorney General can make that a condition of any approval?
speaker="brenda_wright" startTime="172.545" stopTime="177.247">
    Ms. Brenda Wright 
    --Well, it depends in part upon the State's specific history and the practices it had.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="177.247" stopTime="181.331">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    In any section 5 State you think the Attorney General can insist on that?
speaker="brenda_wright" startTime="181.331" stopTime="188.446">
    Ms. Brenda Wright 
    Mississippi had a unitary system by statute at the time the NVRA came into effect.

    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Yes.
speaker="brenda_wright" startTime="188.857" stopTime="193.709">
    Ms. Brenda Wright 
    And we contend that the implementation of a dual system reflects a change from that unitary system.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="193.709" stopTime="203.676">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    It still does have the same unitary system in place. 
    You can still register for both Federal and State elections the same way you could before the NVRA provisions went in.
speaker="brenda_wright" startTime="203.676" stopTime="204.177">
    Ms. Brenda Wright 
    But you have a--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="204.177" stopTime="219.896">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Now you have an additional option. 
    If you want to use the easier method you can register for Federal elections, but as far as what a citizen of Mississippi can do by way of registering for both State and Federal, it is exactly the same as it was before, isn't it?
speaker="brenda_wright" startTime="219.896" stopTime="221.388">
    Ms. Brenda Wright 
    --Well, our contention is this.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="221.388" stopTime="224.400">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Except for the false start. 
    Let's leave the false start out of the mix for the moment.
speaker="brenda_wright" startTime="224.400" stopTime="237.319">
    Ms. Brenda Wright 
    Leaving the false start out of it, you now have a system under which there is a class of citizens that once registered is not permitted to vote in State and local elections, and that is not a unitary system under any meaningful sense of the term.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="237.319" stopTime="249.645">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    By reason of the special grace provided by the Federal statute, but the same system that existed for multiple registration prior to the NVRA is still in place in Mississippi.
speaker="brenda_wright" startTime="249.645" stopTime="255.339">
    Ms. Brenda Wright 
    There was no system of multiple registration, though, because one registration made you eligible for all purposes.

    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    Eligible... well--
speaker="brenda_wright" startTime="255.900" stopTime="288.271">
    Ms. Brenda Wright 
    And the real purpose of our lawsuit here is to say that whatever choices Mississippi made in implementing the NVRA, whatever plan it decided to adopt ultimately had to be submitted for preclearance so that the Attorney General could review exactly how that procedure was going to be implemented, and there are many, many discretionary choices that a State makes in deciding to set up a system either on a dual basis or, even if it's on a dual basis, there are different ways and different choices that a State makes that will have a major impact on whether the voters--
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="288.271" stopTime="293.975">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    --Could you give me a few illustrations of that? 
    One is which State offices will be used for registration. 
    I take it that's one?
speaker="brenda_wright" startTime="293.975" stopTime="324.385">
    Ms. Brenda Wright 
    --That's right, and also, for example, the registration forms themselves. 
    In the, the NVRA forms that are currently in effect and are being handed out at the State agencies do not say anything about limited registration. 
    You have forms, for example, that are being handed out at the public assistance agencies that are entitled, Mississippi Voter Registration Application, and nothing on the form tells you that when you fill that out you're only going to be eligible to vote in State and local elections, so it was vital for the Attorney General--
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="324.385" stopTime="326.847">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    In Federal? 
    You mean only vote in Federal elections.
speaker="brenda_wright" startTime="326.847" stopTime="343.797">
    Ms. Brenda Wright 
    --In Federal... that you would only be able to vote in Federal elections, that's correct, and so it was vital, because of the risk of confusion, and the risk of people believing that they may already be registered for all purposes when in fact they are not that the Attorney General reviewed these procedures, each and every one of them.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="343.797" stopTime="369.515">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Well, I can understand that, but to ask the further question whether the Attorney General, assuming the forms make it clear that it's only for registration for Federal elections as the law indeed says is necessary, whether it can go beyond that and say, moreover, State, you have to make this a unitary system now and follow the Federal plan for all, even State and local.
speaker="brenda_wright" startTime="369.515" stopTime="380.702">
    Ms. Brenda Wright 
    But if there were evidence before the D.C. District Court or the Attorney General that a dual system had been reinstated for the very purpose of discriminating against minority citizens, certainly--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="380.702" stopTime="391.889">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Not reinstated, kept, unchanged from the past, but following the new law for Federal elections.
speaker="brenda_wright" startTime="391.889" stopTime="410.291">
    Ms. Brenda Wright 
    --But Your Honor, the cases such as City of Lockhart v. United States recognize that even when a State maintains certain procedures but changes other aspects of its registration system, the procedures that are unchanged themselves may be subject to section 5 review.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="410.291" stopTime="426.721">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    It just seems so counterintuitive in the face of language in the statute whereby Congress expresses the intent not to require a change for State and local registration purposes. 
    That's the troublesome part of this case for me, anyway.
speaker="brenda_wright" startTime="426.721" stopTime="432.324">
    Ms. Brenda Wright 
    But cases such as City of Lockhart recognize... in that case the numbered post requirement had not been changed at all.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="432.324" stopTime="436.848">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    That wasn't in connection with the Federal Voter Registration Act.
speaker="brenda_wright" startTime="436.848" stopTime="459.954">
    Ms. Brenda Wright 
    No, it was not, but it was a situation where one provision that called for numbered post remained unchanged, and the Court held that it nevertheless was a change when the city applied that numbered post requirement to an election system where additional seats had been added, because the Court held that you have to examine a change in the context of the entire election system.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="459.954" stopTime="494.677">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Ms. Wright, why-- 
    --That's fair enough when it's voluntary on the part of the State. 
    Where one change is made voluntarily on the part of the State you can say well, the whole thing gets sucked in, but this is a unique situation in which a certain change is imposed upon the State by the Federal Government. 
    Now, it's one thing to say that the way in which you implement that mandatory change must be cleared with the Attorney General. 
    That's one thing. 
    But it's quite something else to say that because the Federal Government has mandated this change all of your current system which you have not changed at all has to be resubmitted for clearance to the Attorney General.
speaker="brenda_wright" startTime="494.677" stopTime="505.876">
    Ms. Brenda Wright 
    But Your Honor, the Attorney General is entitled to examine the effect that this particular method of implementation will have on voting and registration in State and local elections.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="505.876" stopTime="513.561">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Whatever its effect is is the fault of the Federal Government, so long as the procedures for implementing the Federal scheme themselves are fair.
speaker="brenda_wright" startTime="513.561" stopTime="514.212">
    Ms. Brenda Wright 
    Well--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="514.212" stopTime="525.168">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Now, it may discourage people from voting in State elections who find it easier to register for Federal only, but that's the Congress' fault for applying this new system only to Federal elections.
speaker="brenda_wright" startTime="525.168" stopTime="537.497">
    Ms. Brenda Wright 
    --We argue, Your Honor, that because of the decision in Allen v. State Board of Elections it's clear that even if a change, a particular change is mandated by the Voting Rights Act itself, it is subject to preclearance requirements.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="537.497" stopTime="557.298">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Your argument goes considerably further than Allen, which itself went to me to the extreme of construing this statute. 
    May I ask, Ms. Wright, I just want to be sure, I didn't think the questions that Justice O'Connor put to you is presented by this case. 
    We aren't concerned with whether or not the Attorney General would have had a duty to preclear if there had been a submission, are we?
speaker="brenda_wright" startTime="557.298" stopTime="560.331">
    Ms. Brenda Wright 
    No. 
    That question will arise when and if the procedures--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="560.331" stopTime="565.055">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Yes. 
    We don't... for all we know the Attorney General would just routinely preclear it.
speaker="brenda_wright" startTime="565.055" stopTime="566.816">
    Ms. Brenda Wright 
    --Well--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="566.816" stopTime="569.928">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Or perhaps she'd act wrongfully if she refused to, but that's not before us, is it?
speaker="brenda_wright" startTime="569.928" stopTime="579.885">
    Ms. Brenda Wright 
    --The question of actual discriminatory intent or effect is not before this Court and it was not before the court below, and that is why we contend that the Court exceeded its jurisdiction.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="579.885" stopTime="588.263">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Is it not true that even if it's perfectly clear that the Attorney General would have had a duty to preclear the existing system, you would nevertheless prevail?
speaker="brenda_wright" startTime="588.263" stopTime="590.864">
    Ms. Brenda Wright 
    Oh, yes, Your Honor. 
    Yes. 
    I'm simply--
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="590.864" stopTime="629.399">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    Then are you actually asking as well to submit all the changes that weren't made? 
    I thought what you were asking for is that what has to be submitted, the manner in which they carried out the changes required by the voter registration, the motor voter act, and that would be judged against a background in which they didn't change the State officials. 
    But I don't understand... I agree, I don't understand why they'd have to submit the things they didn't change. 
    I suppose they'd have to submit the things they did change, and then you would argue that those changes are unlawful because of what they didn't--
speaker="brenda_wright" startTime="629.399" stopTime="635.683">
    Ms. Brenda Wright 
    --That's right. 
    We contend that the procedures establishing a dual system, all of them, need to be submitted for preclearance.

    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    --But isn't all of that premature? 
    I thought the simple point is, there's been a change. 
    Every change has to be precleared, period. 
    Now, the Attorney General may agree with your point of view or disagree. 
    We don't know that at this point.
speaker="brenda_wright" startTime="649.274" stopTime="650.095">
    Ms. Brenda Wright 
    That is correct.

    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    All we know is that we have a change prompted by the Federal law.

    Why should we look at anything more than that in this case?
speaker="brenda_wright" startTime="662.344" stopTime="669.340">
    Ms. Brenda Wright 
    Well, we certainly agree that there is no necessity of determining what the ultimate outcome of the--

    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Or even what constitutes a satisfactory submission.

    --Yes.

    But it might be important to other members of this Court to know just how far the Attorney General's position goes. 
    It certainly is important to me.

    Ms. Brenda Wright 
    Yes.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="691.263" stopTime="705.842">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    It isn't your position that as a practical matter... as a practical matter, the State must ask for preclearance of its former voting procedures.
speaker="brenda_wright" startTime="705.842" stopTime="719.902">
    Ms. Brenda Wright 
    It need not Gubmit those procedures, but we do believe that if the State is going to change from its current statutory policy of a unitary system it does need to obtain preclearance for that alteration of its important policy, and that would be part of--
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="719.902" stopTime="730.480">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    So you're saying that as a practical matter the State cannot leave in place its previous precleared procedures without further amendment and alteration of those procedures.
speaker="brenda_wright" startTime="730.480" stopTime="749.941">
    Ms. Brenda Wright 
    --Because it's current... but that's only because its current system contemplates a unitary system of registration, and I do want to emphasize the very narrow character of the inquiry that we have here. 
    The only inquiry is whether there has been a change and whether, if there has been a change, that change has been submitted to the Attorney General.

    It was an implementation of the Voting Rights Act.

    You could also say, however, if they had changed it to a unitary, or had continued a unitary, you could also say there has been a change because it used to be that you had to, in order to register for the State, do things beyond what the motor vehicle registration act requires.

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    --If you ask me what would constitute the least change that Mississippi could make in order to comply with the Federal law, I would say it is precisely what Mississippi did here, leave its current registration procedures entirely in place. 
    If you want to register for State and Federal localities at the same time, you just follow what Mississippi has had in place for years, and add to that what the Federal Government has required to be added: motor vehicle registration for Federal elections. 
    That seems to me the minimal change possible from the State system.
speaker="brenda_wright" startTime="903.251" stopTime="930.910">
    Ms. Brenda Wright 
    We would argue from the perspective of the voters it certainly is not the least change possible, because if you think about election day the registrars are now required to keep two sets of poll books, one for NVRA registrants only allowed to vote in Federal elections, and one for other registrants. 
    Presumably if you go into the voting booth you have to get a separate ballot, because if there are both Federal and State elections on the ballot you can't be permitted to vote that ballot, and so these types of changes, these types of--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="930.910" stopTime="934.523">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    No problem. 
    Just register under the State procedures and you don't have to worry about that.

    Justice David H. Souter 
    Okay, so the only fact difference, then, is it didn't make changes to conform its old State system to the new procedures which it, which everybody agrees it's following for the limited Federal registration.

    Ms. Brenda Wright 
    But there are further differences because of... by necessity, when you implement a dual system you have to make changes in your practices to take into account the fact that you now have two separate sets of registration requirements that may result in confusion for voters. 
    So we say that as a package the decision to implement these procedures on a Federal-election-only basis really need to be submitted and reviewed on that basis.

    Ms. Brenda Wright 
    Well, we contend that even though only some of the circuit clerks put voters actually on the rolls for all purposes, the unitary NVRA plan was actually being implemented on a State-wide basis, because in each of these counties when you went into the agencies the forms that you were being given and the procedures that were being followed were to the knowledge of the voters procedures registering you for all elections, and that was going on in every county regardless of whether the circuit clerks immediately put you on the rolls for all purposes, and that's how we say there was in fact State-wide implementation here.

    Mr. Malcolm L. Stewart 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    The point I would like to stress from the outset is that the potential discriminatory effects of Mississippi's current system with which the Department of Justice is most concerned are not in any sense the product of Federal compulsion. 
    That is, the NVRA does require the States to take certain steps, but it leaves the States with substantial discretion in other respects not only as to the initial decision as to whether NVRA registrants will be entitled to vote in State and local elections, but also with respect to subsidiary decisions regarding the forms that will be used, the procedures by which people will be registered. 
    And I want to emphasize as well that we think we are not being fanciful or alarmist in suggesting there may be a substantial problem with telling thousands of people in Mississippi that they are registered to vote in Mississippi when in fact they are not eligible to cast ballots for any Mississippi official. 
    The question of what forms are being used, what process of notification is given to NVRA registrants, is not simply a technicality. 
    It really goes... potentially at least goes to the heart of whether Mississippi's current system is--

    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Well, the procedures it did submit to the Attorney General contained within them a proposal for changing State law to go to a system that would be the same for Federal as well as State, but I thought the Attorney General's own requirements and that of Federal law in this area did not permit the Attorney General to act on something on the basis of laws that had not been passed.

    They need a law that says they do have it, and the only law in effect is one that said this is how you get to vote in Mississippi, and then you get this submission from Mississippi which says, we are now going to let people vote in State elections on the basis of this new Federal law, and you see that in the Mississippi statutes... you get this from the Secretary of State, right?
speaker="malcolm_l_stewart" startTime="1516.483" stopTime="1517.134">
    Mr. Malcolm L. Stewart 
    --That's correct.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="1517.134" stopTime="1530.574">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    And you see the Mississippi statute doesn't permit this. 
    I cannot imagine that you people at the Justice Department did not know... did not know that this thing required legislation which had not yet been passed.
speaker="malcolm_l_stewart" startTime="1530.574" stopTime="1597.860">
    Mr. Malcolm L. Stewart 
    No, what we knew was that the State had begun to adopt the plan outlined in the submission as of January 1, 1995, and again, this is not a situation in which the State could decide at a later date what elections these people were registered for. 
    It's essential that a person who comes in to register be told what elections he is eligible to vote in, so it wouldn't have been appropriate at all for the State to tell people you're eligible to vote in all elections and then decide at a later date, after the fate of the legislation was determined, whether in fact that would be the case. 
    To return for a second to Justice O'Connor's question, I think if Mississippi had told us from the outset we plan to do this for Federal elections only, the Attorney General in deciding whether to issue preclearance would have had to decide first whether there was discriminatory purpose. 
    But leaving that aside, the Attorney General would have had to determine whether the overall system contemplated would leave minority voters in a worse position than they were before the passage of the NVRA, and in making that determination, the Attorney General could properly consider the likely ancillary effects on voting in State and local elections.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="1597.860" stopTime="1613.507">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Well, that certainly isn't clear from the language of the act that Congress passed, which seemed to leave in place, if States chose, their existing system for State and local elections. 
    I thought that was pretty clear from the face of the law.
speaker="malcolm_l_stewart" startTime="1613.507" stopTime="1628.568">
    Mr. Malcolm L. Stewart 
    Again, we're not... we acknowledge that the NVRA itself does not require these procedures to be used in State and local elections, and we're not arguing that the Attorney General has some blanket authority to require that as a matter of her own discretion. 
    What we're saying--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="1628.568" stopTime="1633.203">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor

    Mr. Malcolm L. Stewart 
    --I don't understand that to be Ms. Wright's position, and it certainly isn't ours. 
    I think our position is that in determining whether minorities will be worse off after Mississippi implements the NVRA, the Attorney General could consider not only the likely advantages to minority voters of expedited registration procedures in Federal elections, she could also consider whether the methods by which Mississippi was registering NVRA voters would be likely to confuse them and thereby dissuade them from--

    Mr. Malcolm L. Stewart 
    --Well, at least our primary concern at this point is that the method by which Mississippi is implementing the NVRA creates a particular risk that NVRA registrants will be dissuaded from registering separately for State and local elections, because the forms on their face give the message that the registrant is eligible to vote in all elections.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="1711.692" stopTime="1722.101">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    Well, the way to cure that is simply to deny the preclearance with respect to the simple implementation of the Federal act.

    All we want at this point is the opportunity to view the submission and to determine whether there are any likely discriminatory consequences, and with respect to the consequence that I have just outlined, the possibility for confusion based upon the forms and procedures, it certainly would be a sufficient response for Mississippi to reformulate those forms and procedures so that the likelihood of confusion is diminished or eliminated.

    Mr. Malcolm L. Stewart 
    --Well, I think part of this depends upon the benchmark that would be used. 
    If, as we've contended, the State initially implemented a unitary system of NVRA registration and then sought to change that system, the appropriate remedy pending submission of a new package of materials would be that NVRA registrants would be eligible to vote in all elections until a change had been submitted and precleared. 
    This Court has recognized often that the question of whether unlawful elections should be set aside is distinct from the question of whether there has been a violation of section 5, so we certainly don't think that the consequence of requiring a new preclearance submission would necessarily or even probably be that any elections would be set aside.

    I would like to begin by responding to Justice O'Connor's first question, that being whether base implementation by a State of the requirements of the National Voter Registration Act are subject to section 5 preclearance, and I think the answer to that question clearly is no. 
    When the Congress mandates that a State implement the matters set forth in the National Voter Registration Act, the State has no discretion about whether to do that. 
    If the Attorney General is asserting a right of review, that means necessarily that the Attorney General is asserting a right to object to Mississippi's implementation of the congressional mandate.

    If I understood your brief, you said that a certain State official did a rogue act, that the December 20 submission was without any authority, that Ms. Slaughter-Harvey acted on her own without authority, without anybody in Mississippi approving that, so if one takes you... takes that characterization of it, it is as though the December 20 submission never happened. 
    It was totally unauthorized. 
    It was not Mississippi's submission, and if that's the case, then mustn't there be a legitimate preclearance application?

    Mr. Robert E. Sanders

    Mr. Robert E. Sanders 
    --All right. 
    The NVRA form itself, the State has some discretion, arguably, about what to include in that. 
    The Federal Election Commission has the responsibility of setting forth which elements must be contained in the NVRA form. 
    The State of Mississippi may incorporate into that form its own voter disqualifications, such as conviction of certain crimes and so forth. 
    The State of Mississippi did that. 
    That form was submitted to the Attorney General and the Attorney General precleared that form on February 1.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="2184.683" stopTime="2210.521">
    Justice Antonin Scalia

    The Attorney General purports to preclear something that was never submitted, and you purport to have gotten precleared something that was never submitted. 
    It was submitted as a whole package.
speaker="robert_e_sanders" startTime="2210.521" stopTime="2294.925">
    Mr. Robert E. Sanders 
    Yes, Your Honor. 
    That's what the plaintiffs refer to as the context argument, that the context of the submission was different than the context of the implementation of that which was submitted. 
    There is a very important thing to keep in mind. 
    Section 5 has... prescribes a 60-day period for reviewing submissions. 
    Section 5 also, by the express language, says that if the Attorney General within that 60-day period decides not to object within that 60-day period, but that the Attorney General receives additional information within that 60-day period, the Attorney General may lodge a conditional objection pending an opportunity to review that additional material. 
    Now, the 60-day period began here on December 20, 1994 and it ended on February 18, 1995. 
    The Attorney... or, the Department of Justice on February 16, 1995, 2 days before that 60-day period ended, wrote a letter setting forth that they believed that what we were doing was instituting a dual registration system, but the Attorney General never did anything to diminish the preclearance that she had granted on February 1, 1995. 
    It cannot be said that on February 16 or February 18, also the day that the 60-day period ended, it cannot be said that the Attorney General at that point did not understand fully the context of what she precleared on February 1.

    Mr. Robert E. Sanders 
    That's right.

    Mr. Robert E. Sanders

    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    All right. 
    Now--

    Correct me if I'm wrong. 
    Is it further true that you do concede that Mississippi's discretionary acts in implementing NVRA must be precleared?

speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="2337.944" stopTime="2340.034">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    --That they must be precleared, must be subject to preclearance.
speaker="robert_e_sanders" startTime="2340.034" stopTime="2389.506">
    Mr. Robert E. Sanders 
    To the extent that they represent significant discretion, they must be precleared. 
    It's like McDaniel v. Sanchez, when the Court said that court imposed election remedies need not be precleared unless there is significant voter jurisdiction input into that plan. 
    It makes that distinction, and I would say the same thing applies here. 
    To the extent that there is significant discretion in Mississippi's input, then it does require preclearance. 
    I'm not certain, however, that the very limited things that we do when we designate which agencies fit the description of public assistance agencies, I'm not sure that that is enough Mississippi input to require those things to be submitted for preclearance, but to the extent that that is enough, they were submitted and they were precleared.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="2389.506" stopTime="2420.137">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Mr. Sanders, wouldn't the most important thing to preclear, perhaps the only thing once Mississippi decides it's going to do a different Federal-only registration, is to tell people who come into the motor vehicle bureau in big letters, this will register you for Federal elections only, and such a thing was never precleared because the first submission didn't suppose there was going to be that system.
speaker="robert_e_sanders" startTime="2420.137" stopTime="2430.512">
    Mr. Robert E. Sanders 
    Well, of course, the National Voter Registration Act doesn't require that we set forth any such disclaimer or warning. 
    It simply requires that we put certain forms at certain locations, and that's what we did.
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="2430.512" stopTime="2444.554">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    It also says at each voter registration agency the following services shall be made available: assistance to applicants in completing voter registration forms. 
    Now, perhaps assistance to applicants would include an explanation of what's going on.

    Mr. Robert E. Sanders 
    All right. 
    Yes, Your Honor, I don't quarrel with that. 
    The fact is, we are informing people when they come in to register of the status that they will obtain by virtue of that registration, and I don't think the fact that we now inform people, I don't think the conveyance of information is a change within section 5 that requires preclearance.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="2464.907" stopTime="2472.831">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    Yes, but the means by which you do that, however you are informing them, has never been submitted to the Attorney General and has never been precleared.

    Yes, Your Honor.

    Justice David H. Souter

    --That's true, yes, sir, but I would just contend that the transmission of information, helping someone understand his or her voting status, is not a change in any event, especially within the meaning of section 5. 
    I don't think that if a circuit clerk or the Secretary of State wanted to inform someone of what their voting status was, the names of the persons on the ballot or anything else, I don't think that that would require--

    Virtually all of it.

    Virtually.

    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    But isn't it fairly clear that if at the time of your submission you had realized what the ultimate outcome would have been, you would have put on that form, this is good only for Federal elections?

    Mr. Robert E. Sanders 
    --Well, of course, if the Attorney... if the Mississippi Attorney General's Office had known at the time that a submission was about to have been made, a lot of things would have been done differently. 
    The fact is here that the Department of Justice interjected itself into the Mississippi matters. 
    It pressured--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="2561.980" stopTime="2572.939">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Well, they didn't interject themselves. 
    Congress passed a statute that requires preclearance when you make changes, and you made some changes. 
    You had a duty to get preclearance, so you triggered the preclearance process.
speaker="robert_e_sanders" startTime="2572.939" stopTime="2603.130">
    Mr. Robert E. Sanders 
    --Well, I beg to differ, Your Honor. 
    I believe the Department of Justice triggered this hasty submission. 
    They called and wrote to a person who is employed with the Secretary of State's office on several occasions, prompting them to go ahead and submit a preclearance, and frankly I think it was their behavior that caused this false start, as Justice Scalia referred to it as. 
    It's not the fact that Mississippi has tried to deceive the Department of Justice by any stretch.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="2603.130" stopTime="2623.814">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    No, it isn't that, but it seems to me that we're off on sort of a tangent about whether they should or should not preclear a unitary system or not, but it seems to me it's a very simple case. 
    Even the most modest changes under the motor vehicle... motor voter registration act needed preclearance. 
    They weren't precleared.

    Yes--

    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Now, whether they should be precleared is... maybe you're dead right on that. 
    They probably should be.
speaker="robert_e_sanders" startTime="2629.187" stopTime="2647.918">
    Mr. Robert E. Sanders 
    --Well, but I contend they were precleared. 
    The February 1 letter says that they are precleared. 
    The only thing different is the context, and by February 16, well within the 60-day period to lodge a conditional objection, they ratified the original preclearance. 
    There... I don't think there's any... there can be any meaningful dispute that they understood on February 16--

    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Mr. Sanders, if there had been no-- 
    --You mean the-- 
    --December 20, then do you agree that there would have had to have been a preclearance of what was agreed upon on February 10 to keep the Mississippi system? 
    Forget about... there had never been any December 20 submission. 
    On February 10 the State of Mississippi knows what it's going to do. 
    Does that have to be precleared?

    Mr. Robert E. Sanders 
    --No, ma'am, I don't think it does. 
    I think the fact... the 60-day period just makes the case stronger, but I think it's beyond dispute that the Department of Justice knew that those statutory changes, or that the law surrounding voter... Mississippi registration qualification was embodied in State statutes, and that law could not be changed unless those statutes were changed.

    Mr. Robert E. Sanders 
    Well, it is largely dictated, and is almost exclusively dictated by the Federal Election Commission.

    Mr. Robert E. Sanders 
    --All right. 
    I certainly would not have to submit any notion that there has been a change of State law. 
    Clearly there has not been. 
    I would not have to submit any of the things that amount to base compliance... or I mean, that amount to implementation of the base requirements of the NVRA. 
    Again, at most I would have to submit those matters... the designation of agencies, the construction of the form, and the--

    May I interrupt you just for a second? 
    Before you tell me that, what... I just want to know what you meant by the words you used. 
    You spoke of the construction of the forms. 
    What do you mean by construction of the forms?
speaker="robert_e_sanders" startTime="3011.850" stopTime="3046.173">
    Mr. Robert E. Sanders 
    --If the State of Mississippi had decided to put a lot of additional material on the form, then we would have been constructing in a material sense. 
    If we had... I can't think of an example, but if we had put a great deal more material on there. 
    All we actually put on there were those things that would disqualify someone. 
    The NVRA form has a voter declaration section and all the person needs to do is sign his name below this declaration which says, I have not been convicted of these certain crimes, I am over 18... in other words it incorporates Mississippi's qualifications.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="3046.173" stopTime="3046.774">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    Okay.
speaker="robert_e_sanders" startTime="3046.774" stopTime="3058.642">
    Mr. Robert E. Sanders 
    Now... so Mississippi put Mississippi's qualifications in there. 
    I suppose Alabama put Alabama's qualifications in there. 
    So to that extent it is somewhat different than the base form, from the FEC--
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="3058.642" stopTime="3067.749">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    So you agree that insofar as you include those, in effect State law conditions and limitations you must submit the form for preclearance.
speaker="robert_e_sanders" startTime="3067.749" stopTime="3088.751">
    Mr. Robert E. Sanders 
    --I'm just... no. 
    I say that arguably if... I don't know whether just filling out that part and putting our State qualifications is enough. 
    Frankly, I don't think it is. 
    I'm just saying arguably it could be, but I think clearly if we went further than that, if we put other material in there, the more we put into it--
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="3088.751" stopTime="3105.883">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    Or if you omitted material. 
    For example, if you omitted a statement calling attention to the fact that under Mississippi law this registration would be good for Federal elections only, that omission, as I understand it, would not be something that would require submission for preclearance.
speaker="robert_e_sanders" startTime="3105.883" stopTime="3110.466">
    Mr. Robert E. Sanders 
    --Well, I'm not sure that not putting something in there amounts to a section 5 change.

    Justice David H. Souter 
    Well, you say you're not sure. 
    I thought your position was going to be that you were sure and it was not a section 5 change and you didn't have to submit it.
speaker="robert_e_sanders" startTime="3118.679" stopTime="3124.143">
    Mr. Robert E. Sanders 
    Well, all right. 
    I'll state it in the affirmative. 
    I don't think that not putting that is a section 5 change, correct.
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="3124.143" stopTime="3178.153">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    Okay. 
    What should we do if we think, well, you haven't submitted the... I see about 20 pages here in this statute. 
    It has a lot of different procedural requirements, and maybe some are absolutely mandatory, maybe some give you discretion. 
    If we send it back and say you have to preclear those, would there be a lot of argument about what you have to preclear or not? 
    I mean, what would you suggest we do? 
    I imagine what would happen is you'd have to preclear those, and they'd come in and argue that in light of the dual system you have to do something that's virtually impossible. 
    I don't know what they're going to argue, but they're going to argue that that dual system is highly relevant, and you'll argue it isn't. 
    All right, and... so what in your opinion, if we... just what Justice O'Connor asked, I think. 
    What is your opinion if we disagree with you that it has been cleared, and we think it hasn't been cleared yet, what should we do?
speaker="robert_e_sanders" startTime="3178.153" stopTime="3216.789">
    Mr. Robert E. Sanders 
    Well, I think at most of course you should just simply remand it. 
    I do not think that this Court should in any way render a decision on... without going back to the district court, but I think still, to the extent that anyone considers that a change has been made, I think that it's still something that section 5, the district court should have an opportunity to look at. 
    If the Court feels that more proof should be developed and so forth through discovery, I mean, that can be done, but the very most that this Court should do is remand to the district court, if that's what your question is. 
    I--

    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    Mr. Sanders-- 
    --Yes. 
    A look at the assistance part seems... I mean, there seems to be some words here about their having to provide appropriate assistance, your having to, to people. 
    That was the part that seemed the most discretionary when I just glanced at it, but that hasn't been argued fully here.
speaker="robert_e_sanders" startTime="3230.120" stopTime="3231.620">
    Mr. Robert E. Sanders 
    --No, that's correct, Your Honor.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="3231.620" stopTime="3272.106">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Mr. Sanders, I'm reluctant, as some others seem to be to say that you have to submit forms for preclearance, because if we adopt that principle we'll have to use it not just in this case but in all cases in the future, and the notion that all forms are submittable whenever you make any change is a rather expansive one. 
    On the other hand, I'm also concerned that the Justice Department ought to be able to protect Mississippi voters from being misled when they register under what is a Federal-only system into believing that they're registered under State law. 
    Then they appear at the State voting place and they find that they can't vote.
speaker="robert_e_sanders" startTime="3272.106" stopTime="3273.928">
    Mr. Robert E. Sanders 
    And Your Honor--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="3273.928" stopTime="3287.416">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    If we can't be sure by requiring the forms to be submitted, how can the Attorney General prevent the State of Mississippi from misleading citizens that way?
speaker="robert_e_sanders" startTime="3287.416" stopTime="3327.971">
    Mr. Robert E. Sanders 
    --Well, obviously through a section 2 challenge or any Fifteenth Amendment-based challenge, but our position is that the Attorney General should not be able to do that through the device of section 5 preclearance. 
    Again, we do not think that the Attorney General should be able to review, object, or veto any mandate to the State of Mississippi from the Congress, but they have plenty of other options available to it. 
    To the extent, as my good friend Mr. Stewart said, that base implementation of the NVRA might amount to a discriminatory purpose, if it does, then the United States may challenge that in a variety of other ways but not through the device of preclearance.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="3327.971" stopTime="3349.937">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Is there any significance to the fact that the motor vehicle statute has a specific section in it saying that this doesn't limit the application of the Voting Rights Act and doesn't modify it in any way, and doesn't it follow that if you adopt a new form to be used to register voters, that that's a change or practice, blah, blah, blah, within the meaning of section 5?
speaker="robert_e_sanders" startTime="3349.937" stopTime="3374.972">
    Mr. Robert E. Sanders 
    I read that language in the NVRA simply to mean the same... or I read it the same way I read footnote 29 in Allen, where this Court says that State-initiated changes, even when made to comply with section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, must be submitted for preclearance. 
    I read that language in the NVRA the same way. 
    When the State makes changes itself, they must be submitted for preclearance even though they are part of an NVRA--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="3374.972" stopTime="3391.685">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    But the fact that the Federal Government, the Federal statute required them to do some things, made them print a new form with respect to elections, is it not still true that the distribution of a new form to people who are being registered, a form you never used before, is a change in a voting practice?
speaker="robert_e_sanders" startTime="3391.685" stopTime="3392.944">
    Mr. Robert E. Sanders 
    --Not within the meaning of section 5.

    Mr. Robert E. Sanders 
    No. 
    I don't think that language in the NVRA was designed to give the Attorney General the right of veto over an act of Congress, over a mandate from the Congress.

    No, of course not. 
    It has nothing to do with a person's ability to vote. 
    It simply is... if we're trying to inform them of their status, that does not represent a change for section 5 purposes or for any other purposes so far as I can see. 
    That is simply... I mean, all elected officials have always done what they can to help people... to help their constituents. 
    That's just currying favor with voters, and that does not represent a section 5 change.
