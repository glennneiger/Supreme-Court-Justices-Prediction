    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    We'll hear argument next in No. 96-320, Metro-North Commuter Railroad Company v. Michael Buckley. 
    Ms. Birnbaum.

    Ms. Sheila L. Birnbaum 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court: 
    The Court this morning is confronted with a ruling from the Second Circuit that is both unprecedented, stands alone and is contrary to the common law and field of precedent both before this Court and in most of the common law courts of this country. 
    If the Second Circuit's decision is not reversed, it will greatly exacerbate the asbestos litigation crisis we have in the courts and will lead to the unpredictable and expansive, unlimited liability that this Court was concerned about in the Gottshall case. 
    Tort law is clear: you have to sustain an injury before you can recover from a negligent defendant.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="65.524" stopTime="104.066">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Ms. Birnbaum, may I ask you if you would clarify your position in this case with the one that the... that is being taken by the defendants in the case this afternoon? 
    That is, they say that there is an injury, that there is a class of people who have been really exposed to asbestos. 
    And they have an injury, in fact... a concrete, particularized injury, in fact... here and now, just by virtue of having been inundated with asbestos. 
    And you're saying, as I take it you've just said, they don't have any claim until they suffer an illness.
speaker="sheila_l_birnbaum" startTime="104.066" stopTime="104.818">
    Ms. Sheila L. Birnbaum 
    What--
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="104.818" stopTime="106.384">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    We can't both be right.
speaker="sheila_l_birnbaum" startTime="106.384" stopTime="149.780">
    Ms. Sheila L. Birnbaum 
    --Well, I'm not going to argue the Georgene case on the standing issue. 
    There may be different considerations with regard to standing. 
    You're also looking at this issue through the context of FELA, a statute that provides that there must be an injury, and has a jurisprudence that goes with it. 
    But it's still much broader. 
    We would say that a person who is merely exposed and has no injury... in this case, the record is clear, he has no clinical evidence even of pleural plaques, pleural injuries, he has no recognition, no determination by his own physicians even of subcellular changes--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="149.780" stopTime="157.117">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    The courts below relied on the physical impact of the fibers going inside his lungs.
speaker="sheila_l_birnbaum" startTime="157.117" stopTime="178.030">
    Ms. Sheila L. Birnbaum 
    --But, first, there is no real evidence of that except a hypothetical given by the expert below. 
    But besides that, the real issue here is subcellular injury, even if it existed, has been held over and over again by most common law courts in this context not to be an injury.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="178.030" stopTime="184.517">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Well, how do we deal with a physical impact, does that constitute an injury, even if it's slight?
speaker="sheila_l_birnbaum" startTime="184.517" stopTime="228.296">
    Ms. Sheila L. Birnbaum 
    No. 
    I think that... and I think if you look at the courts... the common law courts... even a court like Florida, which clearly adopts an impact test by itself, not a zone of danger test... which I think we need to talk about... that this Court has adopted a zone of danger test, not an impact test... if you look at those courts that have adopted an impact test, in the area of asbestos exposure, toxic exposure, what the courts have done is added more, because they are concerned about this unlimited, unpredictable liability. 
    In Florida, where they have just the impact test, the court, in the Cox case, said you have to also have a physical injury.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="228.296" stopTime="245.342">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    But aren't there many jurisdictions that have recognized a claim for medical monitoring, a common law claim for medical monitoring, for people who have been massively exposed but have not yet manifested any illness? 
    There are--
speaker="sheila_l_birnbaum" startTime="245.342" stopTime="247.444">
    Ms. Sheila L. Birnbaum 
    There are... there are a few. 
    And it's--

    Over a dozen I think.
speaker="sheila_l_birnbaum" startTime="250.646" stopTime="277.143">
    Ms. Sheila L. Birnbaum 
    --A little less, but there are some. 
    And if you look at most of those cases, they are either in the area where there are a very small number of people... the water cases, where there are just a small number of people who have been exposed to contaminated water, and not the kind of situation here, where 21 million people have been substantially exposed to asbestos. 
    Twenty-one million people could come into the court today--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="277.143" stopTime="296.389">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Yes, but may I interrupt with just a question? 
    Let's talk about one of those 21 million people who has been substantially exposed. 
    And say that person's doctor says the exposure is sufficiently serious that I think you ought to check with me every 6 months to see if anything has developed, because if it does develop and we catch it early, we'll be better able to treat you. 
    Would that be an injury?
speaker="sheila_l_birnbaum" startTime="296.389" stopTime="297.707">
    Ms. Sheila L. Birnbaum 
    --No. 
    Not under FELA.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="297.707" stopTime="300.676">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Even though he'd have to pay his doctor's bill every 6 months?
speaker="sheila_l_birnbaum" startTime="300.676" stopTime="302.861">
    Ms. Sheila L. Birnbaum 
    That would be a damage, but it wouldn't be an injury.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="302.861" stopTime="304.961">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    But not within the meaning of the statute?
speaker="sheila_l_birnbaum" startTime="304.961" stopTime="305.478">
    Ms. Sheila L. Birnbaum 
    Right.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="305.478" stopTime="313.983">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    But as a matter of ordinary reasoning, would not that be a pecuniary injury that one could at least say gave... gave rise to some kind of claim?
speaker="sheila_l_birnbaum" startTime="313.983" stopTime="316.518">
    Ms. Sheila L. Birnbaum 
    I think it's just much more complicated than that--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="316.518" stopTime="319.837">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Well, it's more complicated because there are 21 million people out there. 
    I agree with that.

    Ms. Sheila L. Birnbaum 
    --Twenty-one million--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="320.154" stopTime="322.522">

    Right.

    --this would apply to all toxic substances. 
    We can't count the numbers of other toxic substances--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="330.345" stopTime="341.153">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    No, but I'm just... I'm just challenging the integrity of the argument that there's no injury there, when a person, because of the physical exposure to that, is required to pay a doctor every 6 months for the next 10 years.
speaker="sheila_l_birnbaum" startTime="341.153" stopTime="352.442">
    Ms. Sheila L. Birnbaum 
    --I would say that under tort law and under the law of FELA, you have to have an injury. 
    It has to either be a physical injury or an emotional distress injury within the boundaries that this Court has said.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="352.442" stopTime="353.794">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    And dollar injury is not enough?
speaker="sheila_l_birnbaum" startTime="353.794" stopTime="356.679">

    Damage. 
    It's damage.

    Justice David H. Souter 
    But under general... under general tort law, you wouldn't make that argument, would you?

    Ms. Sheila L. Birnbaum 
    --Yes, I would, Your Honor.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="360.814" stopTime="371.839">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    You... you would not... I mean, but your argument seems to be saying that you... that there is no injury cognizable in tort which does not involve personal as opposed to economic injury. 
    And that... you're not arguing that?
speaker="sheila_l_birnbaum" startTime="371.839" stopTime="373.005">
    Ms. Sheila L. Birnbaum 
    No. 
    There--
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="373.005" stopTime="401.606">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    But why isn't there, then, an economic injury, just as Justice Stevens says? 
    If the... if the doctor says the exposure is such that you would be crazy not to have an examination every 6 months, why... and presumably you are not crazy, so that you're going to act reasonably and you're going to have the exam... why doesn't the reasonable necessity of expending the money for the examinations every 6 months constitute an economic injury to you?
speaker="sheila_l_birnbaum" startTime="401.606" stopTime="416.449">
    Ms. Sheila L. Birnbaum 
    --It... it maybe a damage to you, but before you can get to a damage for medical monitoring... for future medical monitoring, the courts... the common law courts have been very clear... you first have to have an injury.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="416.449" stopTime="418.884">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Except for the 12 that you said go the other way?

    Ms. Sheila L. Birnbaum 
    Yes. 
    And that is... that is so. 
    There is--
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="421.403" stopTime="423.705">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    But why should we not accept economic injury?
speaker="sheila_l_birnbaum" startTime="423.705" stopTime="428.674">
    Ms. Sheila L. Birnbaum 
    --Because if you do that, you will be opening up the courts of this country to the... to... to--
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="428.674" stopTime="457.391">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    Okay. 
    But that's a different... you're... it seems to me you're now saying... and I'm not saying it's an illegitimate argument... but you're making a different kind of argument. 
    You're saying not that it would be, in the abstract, foolish to regard this as an economic injury or economic damage, but if you do, you're simply going to cost the system more than the system can bear. 
    And, therefore, not for an analytical reason, but for reasons of the cost of consequences, we shouldn't recognize it. 
    That's the argument you're making now.
speaker="sheila_l_birnbaum" startTime="457.391" stopTime="476.869">
    Ms. Sheila L. Birnbaum 
    --I... that is the second argument. 
    I would go back to the first argument, and except for the small number of cases in the water situation, not an asbestos exposure, where there has been no physical injury, the courts have not jumped in to provide a medical monitoring kind of--
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="476.869" stopTime="514.494">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Ms. Birnbaum, if we... if we just took the one-on-one case that Justice Stevens gave... I really don't follow your argument. 
    Because something happened to this person. 
    No illness is manifested yet. 
    But something happened to create a greater vulnerability than the population at large. 
    And if we just were looking at these two people and say, who should bear the cost of that something that the medical profession says should be done, we would certainly put it on, would we not, the person who caused the exposure rather than the person who suffered the condition that requires the monitoring?
speaker="sheila_l_birnbaum" startTime="514.494" stopTime="525.634">
    Ms. Sheila L. Birnbaum 
    --I... I think that the tort law does not... does not respond that way, except for these special circumstances, these minority group of cases--
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="525.634" stopTime="539.478">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Then are you saying that we have a kind of assumption of the risk involved, that the worker who didn't know that he was being exposed and is going to incur this cost if he follows his doctor's advice, has to bear that cost?
speaker="sheila_l_birnbaum" startTime="539.478" stopTime="572.365">
    Ms. Sheila L. Birnbaum 
    --No, we're not saying that. 
    I think it's not an assumption of the risk. 
    If there is an injury, then he can recover all of the damages that arise from that injury, including foreseeable medical expenses in the future. 
    But if we just have this type of damage... and if you call it something else, then you may come up with a different solution... but it is a damage. 
    It has to go on to something. 
    That something would be a physical injury.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="572.365" stopTime="594.629">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well, Ms. Birnbaum, in the case just preceding, we were discussing the product liability law. 
    Certainly that has evolved often in conscious consideration of which party can best protect against an injury. 
    I take it want you're arguing is that transactional costs are a permissible consideration in deciding what recovery you can have under FELA?
speaker="sheila_l_birnbaum" startTime="594.629" stopTime="608.455">
    Ms. Sheila L. Birnbaum 
    Yes, I think... I think it is, Your Honor. 
    And I think that even more so under FELA. 
    The statute is explicit... you have to have an injury. 
    We're putting the cart before the horse. 
    It talks about a physical injury.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="608.455" stopTime="616.394">

    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    --it says a common carrier by... railroad, while engaging in commerce shall be liable in damages to any person suffering injury while he is employed by such carrier. 
    Now, does that include economic injury or only physical injury? 
    And... and what do we look to in precedent to resolve that?
speaker="sheila_l_birnbaum" startTime="637.289" stopTime="646.494">
    Ms. Sheila L. Birnbaum 
    I... I think what you look to is the common law. 
    What you look to is your prior field of precedent. 
    What you look to is language and the intent of Congress.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="646.494" stopTime="658.119">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Well, certainly if you look to the common law, an economic injury can be and has often been recognized as the basis for liability in tort.

    But this is not--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="658.987" stopTime="662.856">

    Ms. Sheila L. Birnbaum 
    --Well, I think that the kind of economic damages we're talking about is not this type or economic damage.

    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Economic injury.

    Ms. Sheila L. Birnbaum 
    I... I... the statute does say "injury". 
    And this Court has interpreted that to mean, in some instances, physical injury, emotional distress injury under certain limitations that this Court said was important. 
    And there is no case under FELA that has ever held that the type of damage we're talking about here is an injury that was covered by Congress, certainly in 1908, and certainly today.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="702.164" stopTime="712.121">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Well, but we have recognized that emotional injury will suffice for recovery if the person meets the zone of danger test.

speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="731.249" stopTime="739.003">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Well, is his theory that if he has regular monitoring, it will alleviate... xx monitoring... it will alleviate his emotional concern?

    Ms. Sheila L. Birnbaum 
    That was never argued below. 
    And a jury would be giving him his emotional distress injury not for any period of time until he had the first checkup.

    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Ms. Birnbaum, you're talking about FELA as though it were some kind of very restrictive statute. 
    But at least as I remember in ancient days, when I went to law school, it was the most forward-looking and the most... they stretched the boundaries of everything. 
    Causation was stretched to the breaking point under FELA. 
    And has now it become some kind of a constricted statute?
speaker="sheila_l_birnbaum" startTime="903.042" stopTime="944.835">
    Ms. Sheila L. Birnbaum 
    No. 
    I think it is a broad remedial statute. 
    And it has broadly looked at defenses and causation. 
    But I think this Court, in Gottshall, made it clear that there have to be bright lines, especially in the area of negligent infliction of emotional distress, to prevent the kind of unpredictable and unlimited liability that will occur if the Second Circuit's decision is affirmed. 
    Look what we have here. 
    We have a person who has no injury, who has no serious emotional distress. 
    He is worried and angry. 
    Well, he may have a good right to be worried and angry. 
    But he--

    Because asbestos is a known carcinogen and the causer of serious respiratory harm. 
    And if one worked for an employer who knowingly subjected the employee for 3 years to massive doses of asbestos, without ever a warning that that's what was being dealt with, one would have some concern.

    Your Honor, there are several things in your statement that really I question... and we'll get back to the massive amounts in a moment... of asbestos... but Dr. Selikoff, who is one of the noted scientists in this area, who brought this all to the attention of the public, said in his book, "Asbestos and Disease", it is undisputed that the overwhelming majority of exposure-only plaintiffs will never develop asbestos-related injuries.

    If there is a need for medical monitoring, that is something Congress should be deciding. 
    The legislative branch should decide that. 
    That's... there are so many policy implications, besides the fact whether this does any good, besides the fact what the amici argue or whether it's necessary, beside the fact of how do we decide what is massive or substantial, beside the fact that we have no guidelines than the Second Circuit.

    There is no fruit or vegetable that you can eat that is not going to have at least several molecules of pesticide residue. 
    There is nothing in this room that doesn't contain some elements of known carcinogens. 
    All right. 
    So your first two tests don't help distinguish your case, I think, from tens of thousands of millions of cases affecting every man, woman and child in the United States. 
    So, therefore, the third part of your test must do it. 
    And that's what I want to know... how? 
    Because I suspect, in every instance in which my 50,000-substance list of known carcinogens is concerned, where in fact negligence is at stake, you will find at least one expert who would come in and say, well, negligence is at stake, why isn't negligence... there must be some significant risk. 
    And, therefore, I take it that what your third test is going to do is allow every... a claim of negligent infliction of emotional suffering without limitation.

    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    My question--

    Mr. Charles C. Goetsch 
    --Okay.

speaker="charles_c_goetsch" startTime="2153.030" stopTime="2198.076">
    Mr. Charles C. Goetsch 
    All right. 
    And my illustration of the... how it would function to limit that situation, Your Honor, is that a railroad clerk walks by the Snowmen when they're walking out of the tunnels. 
    And later learns that that dust on them that that clerk breathed was in fact carcinogenic asbestos. 
    That clerk has a reaction, goes to a psychiatrist, has severe distress... physically manifests distress... the psychiatrist confirms this is genuine distress. 
    This person has severe emotional distress. 
    No question about it. 
    This test would hold that that clerk cannot recover, because there is no scientifically verifiable basis for that clerk to have a reasonable foundation... scientific foundation... to fear the future development of asbestos cancer.

    Because--

    Mr. Charles C. Goetsch 
    --It doesn't sound significant, Justice O'Connor, but it is an enormous increase in risk.

    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    Well, as for that, how do we know if it's a lot or a little? 
    I'll tell you right now, your risk is doubled of being hit by lightning if you walk out the door. 
    It's unlikely. 
    All right. 
    Do people worry about being hit by lightning because they're outside? 
    The risk of lightning is 1 in 2 million. 
    If you're on top of a hill, it's probably 1 in 500,000. 
    That's quadrupling... not just 5 percent. 
    How do we know the significance of this 5 percent without knowing what the underlying risks are? 
    That's something that I haven't been able to find in the record.

    Mr. Charles C. Goetsch 
    --His underlying risk of death from cancer due to asbestos was 0, Your Honor. 
    It has now been increased from 1 to 5 percent.

    How can... how can you be so sure his underlying risk was 0?

    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    What do you mean "fear"? 
    We know that... look, my problem... the reason I'm going into this is to suggest how complicated and difficult, as soon as you start using words like "increased risk", anything is possible. 
    All these substances have increased risks. 
    And... and, therefore, what kind of standard are you offering that would in fact permit some recovery for emotional distress without saying in any toxic substance case, any significant toxic substance case, automatically you get emotional distress injury? 
    See, you purported to have some limitations.

    They're telling the truth. 
    These substances are dangerous.

    This is not a claim for present physical injury. 
    This is a negligent infliction of emotional distress claim, which, by definition, means that there is no present physical injury. 
    So when there are physical injuries down the line, for asbestosis, lung cancer, et cetera, those... those physical injuries will... will accrue.

    Mr. Charles C. Goetsch

    And since the common law, in general, protects them, they are protected under the FELA.

    Mr. Charles C. Goetsch 
    The starting point is Gottshall.

    That... there's two doors. 
    If you have physical impact, you go in that door. 
    If you don't have physical impact, you have to go through the door which is threat of physical impact or immediate risk of physical harm. 
    That is the Gottshall test. 
    The plaintiffs here satisfy that test.

    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    Mr. Goetsch, let's... let's assume they do, at least as a threshold matter. 
    Let me ask a question which, in a way perhaps, is somewhat similar to Justice... or gets to the same point that Justice Breyer's would. 
    We heard from your opposing counsel this morning that when the exposure reaches some measurable level... and I'm not quite sure how it was measured... that OSHA would kick in with a medical monitoring remedy. 
    I want you to, if you will, comment on two things. 
    Is it correct that OSHA would not apply to the facts of this case? 
    And if that is so, shouldn't we take that fact into consideration in deciding how far we ought to go in developing an FELA common law when another... when the Congress of the United States, in another statute, has said this degree of exposure simply does not merit... merit a medical monitoring remedy?
speaker="charles_c_goetsch" startTime="3105.324" stopTime="3147.218">
    Mr. Charles C. Goetsch 
    OSHA applies when an employee is exposed over the permissible exposure limit for more than 30 days a year. 
    That is determined by medical... by air... by taking air tests of the employee while he's actually working and in his general work area. 
    The Railroad, from 1985 to 1988, when they were exposing the Snowmen without warning, training or protection, didn't take any air tests, in violation of OSHA. 
    Therefore, there's no OSHA air tests over the permissible exposure limit. 
    Therefore, OSHA doesn't apply to these plaintiffs, and they are not getting OSHA medical surveillance. 
    The point is this. 
    The Railroad here saved an enormous amount of money by... by exposing their workers, without warning, training or protection, to a carcinogen--
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="3147.218" stopTime="3158.657">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    No, but in any case, your answer is that it is merely for lack of administratively acceptable evidence that OSHA does not cover this case and grant the remedy that you want... the monitoring remedy that you want.
speaker="charles_c_goetsch" startTime="3158.657" stopTime="3163.228">
    Mr. Charles C. Goetsch

    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    No, I don't... I want to hear what you say, but was my statement a moment ago correct, that the only thing that prevents an OSHA remedy from being extended to your clients in this case is the lack of a certain administratively necessary or legally necessary evidence under the OSHA statute?
speaker="charles_c_goetsch" startTime="3182.205" stopTime="3190.445">
    Mr. Charles C. Goetsch

    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy

    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Before you conclude, may I ask your reaction to one point that was made? 
    That in the universe of asbestos victims, if one were to have a line, one would certainly put at the head of the line the people who get this virulent form of cancer, and maybe next you'd go down to the asbestosis victims, and then I suppose the last people you would get to are the people who have... have had exposure, but haven't manifested anything.

    Medical monitoring will enable these individuals to detect the disease early and hopefully beneficially treat it. 
    So they don't have to die and bring a wrongful death case later on. 
    I mean the whole point of this is to mitigate and to reduce society's burden and the railroads' long-term burden for paying damages as a result of its negligent conduct in violation of the FELA, in violation of OSHA, in violation of these... these human beings' who happen to be railroad workers' legally protected duty to be free from this type of exposure to a known carcinogen. 
    And if the railroads are not held economically accountable under the FELA for this type of conduct, they will have no meaningful economic incentive to avoid it in the future.
