    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    We'll hear argument next in Number 95-1872, William Strate v. A-1 Contractors and Lyle Stockert. 
    Spectators are admonished, do not talk until you get outside the courtroom. 
    The Court remains in session. 
    Ms. McCoy.
speaker="melody_l_mccoy" startTime="16.802" stopTime="33.592">
    Ms. Melody L. McCoy 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    This case is about whether an Indian tribe has jurisdiction over a tort action between two non-Indians. 
    A-1 Contractors was working on the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation for the tribe's company.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="33.592" stopTime="36.424">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Where is the reservation, Ms. McCoy?
speaker="melody_l_mccoy" startTime="36.424" stopTime="39.366">
    Ms. Melody L. McCoy 
    The reservation is within the State of North Dakota.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="39.366" stopTime="47.872">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    And the accident occurred on a State highway on the reservation?
speaker="melody_l_mccoy" startTime="47.872" stopTime="49.524">
    Ms. Melody L. McCoy 
    That's correct.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="49.524" stopTime="62.082">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    And what entity sets the speed limits and the regulations for driving on that State highway? 
    Is it the State of North Dakota?
speaker="melody_l_mccoy" startTime="62.082" stopTime="65.705">
    Ms. Melody L. McCoy 
    Yes, Your Honor, it is the State that sets the speed limit.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="65.705" stopTime="69.579">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    And the other rules applicable to driving on that State highway?
speaker="melody_l_mccoy" startTime="69.579" stopTime="73.539">
    Ms. Melody L. McCoy 
    Those are set by both the tribe and the State.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="73.539" stopTime="84.708">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    They have different regulations. 
    The State could say, no left turn without a stop, and the tribe could say something the opposite? 
    No right turn. 
    No right turn, or whatever it is. 
    [Laughter]
speaker="melody_l_mccoy" startTime="84.708" stopTime="91.701">
    Ms. Melody L. McCoy 
    At this time, Your Honor, there's never been a case that's answered any kind of conflict between the regulatory jurisdiction.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="91.701" stopTime="98.496">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    But the State purports to adopt rules and regulations and standards for driving on that State highway.
speaker="melody_l_mccoy" startTime="98.496" stopTime="100.139">
    Ms. Melody L. McCoy 
    That's correct, as does the tribe.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="100.139" stopTime="106.161">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    And could a State police officer be there and issue citations for a violation?
speaker="melody_l_mccoy" startTime="106.161" stopTime="107.692">
    Ms. Melody L. McCoy 
    That's correct, yes.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="107.692" stopTime="108.263">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Of the State law?
speaker="melody_l_mccoy" startTime="108.263" stopTime="114.798">
    Ms. Melody L. McCoy 
    As can the... that's correct, as can the Federal Bureau of Indian Affairs and the tribal police.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="114.798" stopTime="119.440">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    And in fact, who does police that stretch of road?
speaker="melody_l_mccoy" startTime="119.440" stopTime="130.930">
    Ms. Melody L. McCoy 
    Primarily the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the tribe. 
    There are also... this particular stretch of road is a very small spur of a State highway. 
    It's not a major thoroughfare. 
    On all of the roads--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="130.930" stopTime="145.139">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Right. 
    Well, if a criminal traffic citation were issued by a BIA staff person or a tribal policeman, would the subsequent prosecution be conducted in tribal court?
speaker="melody_l_mccoy" startTime="145.139" stopTime="146.588">
    Ms. Melody L. McCoy 
    --Not if the person is a non-Indian.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="146.588" stopTime="149.349">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Right. 
    That would go to State court.
speaker="melody_l_mccoy" startTime="149.349" stopTime="149.990">
    Ms. Melody L. McCoy 
    That's correct.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="149.990" stopTime="151.342">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Because it's a criminal procedure.
speaker="melody_l_mccoy" startTime="151.342" stopTime="167.412">
    Ms. Melody L. McCoy 
    That's correct. 
    However, non-Indians do answer to civil traffic offenses to the tribe, even when they're cited by non-tribal or non-Federal law enforcement--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="167.412" stopTime="168.714">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    What's a civil traffic offense?
speaker="melody_l_mccoy" startTime="168.714" stopTime="170.023">
    Ms. Melody L. McCoy 
    --Speeding, open container--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="170.023" stopTime="174.017">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Those aren't punishable by fine or imprisonment?
speaker="melody_l_mccoy" startTime="174.017" stopTime="193.568">
    Ms. Melody L. McCoy 
    --Those are punishable by fine. 
    They are civil offenses, civil traffic offenses, that's correct. 
    That's correct, and I think that... the accident in this case occurred on the State highway, but the State highway is a very recent easement, a 1970 easement by the Federal Government.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="193.568" stopTime="199.805">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    One other preliminary question. 
    Is the highway marked so that it says you are now entering or now leaving the reservation?
speaker="melody_l_mccoy" startTime="199.805" stopTime="214.916">
    Ms. Melody L. McCoy 
    Yes, it is, Your Honor. 
    There are... there's a sign at the very entry to the reservation. 
    It only runs into the reservation for about 7 miles, but there's a sign, both the State speed limit sign and the sign that you are entering the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="214.916" stopTime="224.054">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    But the suit filed here is not a traffic enforcement suit of any kind. 
    It's a suit between two nontribal members.
speaker="melody_l_mccoy" startTime="224.054" stopTime="225.446">
    Ms. Melody L. McCoy 
    That's correct.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="225.446" stopTime="229.206">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    And could the suit have been brought in State court, do you suppose?
speaker="melody_l_mccoy" startTime="229.206" stopTime="233.490">
    Ms. Melody L. McCoy 
    There's not a definitive answer from this Court as to that question, but we would concede that yes--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="233.490" stopTime="235.821">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    You would concede that it could have been.
speaker="melody_l_mccoy" startTime="235.821" stopTime="238.823">
    Ms. Melody L. McCoy 
    --That's correct, concurrent. 
    What we're asking is the Court also recognize--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="238.823" stopTime="251.062">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Has this Court ever recognized concurrent jurisdiction in a civil context over a suit that occurs on a State highway? 
    Have we ever dealt with that, do you think?
speaker="melody_l_mccoy" startTime="251.062" stopTime="252.464">
    Ms. Melody L. McCoy 
    --No, the Court has not.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="252.464" stopTime="256.136">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Have we ever dealt with concurrent jurisdiction with tribal courts at all?
speaker="melody_l_mccoy" startTime="256.136" stopTime="256.956">
    Ms. Melody L. McCoy 
    Yes.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="256.956" stopTime="259.829">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    In the State tribal context?
speaker="melody_l_mccoy" startTime="259.829" stopTime="278.573">
    Ms. Melody L. McCoy 
    Yes, Your Honor. 
    That's the Three Affiliated Tribes v. Wold decision of 1986, where the civil cause of action arose on the reservation, this very reservation, in fact, and this Court held that the tribe could bring the claim against, in that case, a non-Indian in the State courts on the theory of concurrent jurisdiction.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="278.573" stopTime="281.146">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    But the plaintiff there was the tribe itself?
speaker="melody_l_mccoy" startTime="281.146" stopTime="283.337">
    Ms. Melody L. McCoy 
    That's correct, and here--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="283.337" stopTime="284.587">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Not a private nonmember?
speaker="melody_l_mccoy" startTime="284.587" stopTime="297.870">
    Ms. Melody L. McCoy 
    --That's correct. 
    That's correct. 
    Here... here the plaintiff in tribal court is an elderly woman who was married to a tribal member, and she was going towards the home on the trust allotment there that this highway runs over.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="297.870" stopTime="301.905">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    How could that make a difference? 
    She either is a tribal member or she's not, and she's not. 
    You concede that.
speaker="melody_l_mccoy" startTime="301.905" stopTime="328.013">
    Ms. Melody L. McCoy 
    That's correct. 
    I think, though, there's two answers to your question. 
    It doesn't make a difference under our primary theory, which is that Indian tribes have jurisdiction over the conduct of non-Indians, including Mrs. Fredericks and A-1 Contractors, when the case arises on Indian land, and on our alternative theory it's not relevant either, because our alternative theory is that--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="328.013" stopTime="338.541">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Is the State highway easement considered Indian land? 
    The underlying fee surely is trust land probably held for the Indian tribe.
speaker="melody_l_mccoy" startTime="338.541" stopTime="342.504">
    Ms. Melody L. McCoy 
    --That's correct. 
    It is our position that this highway constitutes Indian land sufficient--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="342.504" stopTime="353.082">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    But, indeed, the easement itself is held by the State and could be considered, I guess, State land for that purpose... the easement, State property?
speaker="melody_l_mccoy" startTime="353.082" stopTime="357.314">
    Ms. Melody L. McCoy 
    --It's a State easement, a much lesser interest than a fee simple.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="357.314" stopTime="363.608">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    It's division of a bundle of rights, basically, the easement giving the right to use and the underlying fee being the rest, I suppose.
speaker="melody_l_mccoy" startTime="363.608" stopTime="373.545">
    Ms. Melody L. McCoy 
    That's correct, and it's clear that this highway crosses exclusively Indian trust land for all of 6-1/2 miles on the reservation.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="373.545" stopTime="376.297">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well, did... where does the highway end up?
speaker="melody_l_mccoy" startTime="376.297" stopTime="381.390">
    Ms. Melody L. McCoy 
    At the lake. 
    There's a lake, Sakakawea.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="381.390" stopTime="388.805">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Is it a... because... is the lake a resort? 
    I mean, why does the highway go to the lake, or don't you know?
speaker="melody_l_mccoy" startTime="388.805" stopTime="472.844">
    Ms. Melody L. McCoy 
    Yes, I do, Your Honor. 
    On the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation, this road was originally... this is not in the record, but it was originally a Bureau of Indian Affairs gravel service road that ran to the original capital, or headquarters of this tribe's reservation. 
    That road has been there since at least, according to Corps of Engineer maps, since the 1940's. 
    Below the boundaries of the reservation it was... it has been a State highway. 
    In the 1940's, when the Garrison Dam was built and the lake was flooded onto the reservation, the tribe's capital was flooded, and that was subsequently moved. 
    But as to this road, it remained a gravel BIA service road, only it stopped at the lake because the lake came to meet the road. 
    In 1970, the tribe wanted this road paved to serve the tribal community of Twin Buttes on the reservation, because the lake had so isolated Twin Buttes. 
    The only things in Twin Buttes, population 300, are a K through 8 tribal school, a satellite clinic for the Indian Health Service, the tribal community center that A-1 Contractors helped to build, and a now-shut-down-due-to-downsizing Bureau of Indian Affairs substation. 
    This is not a major marina for this lake. 
    Those are on other parts of the reservation.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="472.844" stopTime="476.556">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Is there a marina of some sorts at Twin Buttes, or--
speaker="melody_l_mccoy" startTime="476.556" stopTime="494.757">
    Ms. Melody L. McCoy 
    It's my understanding there are two dock sites, one at Red Buttes and one at... they're... Twin Buttes itself is about 3 miles below the lake on the highway, and the two docks, they're not really full-blown marinas, are to the left and right of that... you know, the east and west of that on the lake.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="494.757" stopTime="499.302">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    --But... and one gets access to those docks, as you refer to them, by the highway?
speaker="melody_l_mccoy" startTime="499.302" stopTime="517.244">
    Ms. Melody L. McCoy 
    That's correct, but the highway is also used, you know... that's seasonal use. 
    The tribe in fact regulates seasonal vehicle use on that stretch of the highway, but there are many other roads on the Fort Berthold Reservation that provide the major access for recreation and use of this lake.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="517.244" stopTime="521.496">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    Why was it important for the plaintiff to go to the tribal court?
speaker="melody_l_mccoy" startTime="521.496" stopTime="525.279">
    Ms. Melody L. McCoy 
    That was her choice of forum that she exercised.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="525.279" stopTime="526.779">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    Why is it important for her?
speaker="melody_l_mccoy" startTime="526.779" stopTime="575.275">
    Ms. Melody L. McCoy 
    It's important for her because she's very much a member of this reservation community. 
    She lives on the reservation. 
    Her children are enrolled there. 
    She lived on her deceased tribal member's husband allotment. 
    That's the stretch of the highway that crossed where the accident occurred in this case. 
    She's lived on this reservation since... for most of her adult life, and that is where her choice of forum was. 
    Plus, she put this Court's cases together... Williams v. Lee, 1959 case, that says if you are a non-Indian suing an Indian you have to go to tribal court, and this Court's case in 1987, 10 years ago, Iowa Mutual, that says if you're an Indian you can sue a non-Indian in tribal court. 
    She put those two together because she's a non-Indian suing a non-Indian.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="575.275" stopTime="592.816">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Isn't there, Ms. McCoy, some dispute about the second case that you mention, whether it meant anything more than you have to exhaust the tribal court process? 
    It didn't make an ultimate determination that there was tribal court jurisdiction. 
    Isn't that so?
speaker="melody_l_mccoy" startTime="592.816" stopTime="596.168">
    Ms. Melody L. McCoy 
    No, I don't think there's any dispute.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="596.168" stopTime="602.472">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Is it not so that subsequent cases of this Court have said that about Iowa Mutual?
speaker="melody_l_mccoy" startTime="602.472" stopTime="622.555">
    Ms. Melody L. McCoy 
    I believe that the reference there was in the plurality opinion in the Brendale case, a 1989 case. 
    But that arose dealing with the issue in Brendale of the tribe's authority to regulate the private property of non-Indians. 
    That's not this case.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="622.555" stopTime="638.807">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    But whatever Brendale involved, it did distinguish Iowa Mutual on the basis that it was merely an exhaustion, that there was no determination that the tribe as opposed to the State had jurisdiction.
speaker="melody_l_mccoy" startTime="638.807" stopTime="700.769">
    Ms. Melody L. McCoy 
    And that, to the extent... I understand, Your Honor. 
    To the extent the plurality in Brendale did hold that, that was not necessary to the Brendale ruling and I think also the proper way to read Iowa Mutual is that... I realize it set the exhaustion rule. 
    It also set the rule by which exhaustion would be conducted, or else exhaustion itself would be a meaningless exercise, because as this Court said in National Farmers Union, where it expressly rejected the argument that respondents make here now for a rule of general and implicit divestiture of tribal court jurisdiction over reservation-based civil actions, that was unanimously rejected in National Farmers Union. 
    And 2 years later in Iowa Mutual, when it again dealt with the issue of how to exhaust, Iowa Mutual set a clear rule that tribal courts presumptively have jurisdiction over reservation-based civil actions against non-Indians, and the lower courts have relied on that--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="700.769" stopTime="709.094">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    That was dicta, though, was it not? 
    You didn't have to say that in order to decide the question that the Court took the case to decide.
speaker="melody_l_mccoy" startTime="709.094" stopTime="733.170">
    Ms. Melody L. McCoy 
    --I think that I... with all due respect, Your Honor, I... Mr. Chief Justice, I think that it was the rule of that case by which exhaustion was to be conducted, because it gives guidance to the tribal courts and the Federal courts on that very issue, and we don't have Congress divesting this tribe's jurisdiction.
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="733.170" stopTime="755.647">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    There's a civil tort suit on fee lands. 
    I mean, you know, a tribe has some lands, it sells some lands to people who are not Indian member, tribe members, and there's a slip-and-fall accident. 
    Does that mean those court cases have to go to the tribal court? 
    I mean, the State court couldn't handle an ordinary slip-and-fall accident on a fee land?
speaker="melody_l_mccoy" startTime="755.647" stopTime="762.820">
    Ms. Melody L. McCoy 
    Well, I think, Your Honor, we should distinguish between the existence of the tribe's jurisdiction, which is the issue here, and the scope of the--
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="762.820" stopTime="793.323">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    Well, that's what I wondered. 
    I mean, I understand much better since your explanation why the tribe really thinks of this, the highway, as really its highway, and I can understand why they think that, but I guess we have to decide this as if it were Interstate 93, or... isn't that right +/? 
    and the two people involved had nothing to do with the tribe whatsoever, going down the biggest State 10-lane highway in imagination, which had... just happened to cross the... an Indian tribe's land, and under an easement... I mean, we'd have to decide it on that basis, wouldn't we?
speaker="melody_l_mccoy" startTime="793.323" stopTime="845.252">
    Ms. Melody L. McCoy 
    --Not necessarily. 
    We've offered the Court three alternative theories for dealing with this. 
    The first one is, if you find the site of this accident is Indian land, then this case is very easy to decide because the tribes can regulate non-Indians, a fortiori, tort cases, no problem in the courts. 
    The second theory, though, I think addresses more of what you are saying, and that's if you don't want to get into the status of the land issue, fee land here, quasi fee land, trust land, then we offer the Court the opportunity to apply the rule for Indian tribes that governments can adjudicate tort cases arising within their territory, because it is undisputed in this case that this case arose within the reservation boundaries. 
    There's no issue of off-reservation contacts. 
    If the status of the land is not necessary to a determination of the--
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="845.252" stopTime="846.554">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    That's why my question--
speaker="melody_l_mccoy" startTime="846.554" stopTime="847.353">
    Ms. Melody L. McCoy 
    --adjudicatory jurisdiction--
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="847.353" stopTime="862.933">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    --Is that clear, in an ordinary slip-and-fall tort accident in the middle of a reservation, but on fee land involving non-Indians, that those cases go as a matter of course to tribal courts?
speaker="melody_l_mccoy" startTime="862.933" stopTime="882.628">
    Ms. Melody L. McCoy 
    --It's not. 
    No case of this Court has reached the issue of tribal adjudicatory jurisdiction on fee lands. 
    However, Iowa Mutual and National Farmers Union both arose either on non-Indian-owned fee land or on a Federal highway crossing Indian reservations, and the Court did not rule against tribal jurisdiction.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="882.628" stopTime="894.385">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Now, is your assertion that the tribe... you keep referring to adjudicatory jurisdiction. 
    As I recall, you say it is possible for the tribal court to adjudicate the case but not to apply tribal law.
speaker="melody_l_mccoy" startTime="894.385" stopTime="895.587">
    Ms. Melody L. McCoy 
    That's correct, Your Honor.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="895.587" stopTime="900.579">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    And you don't ask us to decide right here whether they should apply tribal law or not, or do you think they shouldn't?
speaker="melody_l_mccoy" startTime="900.579" stopTime="922.535">
    Ms. Melody L. McCoy 
    That's two questions. 
    I think that the Court need not reach that issue in this case if it chooses not to, because we're not at that point yet. 
    We're at the threshold point. 
    However, we would also argue that if the Court wants to set the rule that it could be on a case-by-case... it should be on a case-by-case basis because it might involve fee land, it might involve quasi fee land, it might involve trust--
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="922.535" stopTime="947.873">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    I don't understand your answer to that question, because it seems to me the two are tied together.

    Is there... if tribal court jurisdiction is proper here between the two non-Indians, and if the tribal court were in the subsequent trial to apply some tribal law and make a choice of law that it was going to look to tribal law, assuming it had one, is there any way later that that could be challenged by the losing party in any Federal court?

    I thought it was quite unclear whether any subsequent challenge could be made.

    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    No. 
    The challenge goes to the choice of law rule.
speaker="jonathan_nuechterlein" startTime="1208.675" stopTime="1212.919">
    Mr. Jonathan Nuechterlein 
    --Well, choosing its own law in the course of adjudication is a form of exercising jurisdiction.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="1212.919" stopTime="1240.710">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Well, suppose the jurisdiction question were decided in favor of the petitioner. 
    The tribal court has jurisdiction. 
    Then suppose the tribal court tries the case and were to choose to apply tribal law. 
    That's not this case because the petitioner's counsel says we don't have tribal law, so we wouldn't do that. 
    But let's suppose it's a tribe that does. 
    They choose tribal law. 
    Can that ever be tested in any subsequent proceeding in a Federal or State court?
speaker="jonathan_nuechterlein" startTime="1240.710" stopTime="1252.048">
    Mr. Jonathan Nuechterlein 
    I think the answer to that question is yes, and the reason the answer to that question is yes is because as a matter of comity among sovereigns it is important for there to be a Federal review of a tribal exercise of--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="1252.048" stopTime="1258.603">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Well, but there's no case, is there, holding that yes, sure, you can have subsequent review in another jurisdiction?

    Mr. Jonathan Nuechterlein

    But it certainly could... would be unthinkable in a sister State context, that a second State could second-guess the first State's choice of law in a collateral attack.

speaker="jonathan_nuechterlein" startTime="1276.413" stopTime="1288.102">
    Mr. Jonathan Nuechterlein 
    That is true. 
    I think the difference between the two cases is that Congress has specifically given the losing party in the State court system a right to appeal to this Court to allege under the Due Process and Full Faith and Credit Clauses--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="1288.102" stopTime="1291.024">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    But Congress hasn't done that for tribal court judgments.
speaker="jonathan_nuechterlein" startTime="1291.024" stopTime="1295.166">
    Mr. Jonathan Nuechterlein 
    --That is correct, Justice O'Connor, Congress has not passed a statute giving this Court appellate jurisdiction.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="1295.166" stopTime="1307.695">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    And a choice of law question isn't necessarily due process. 
    It can be in extreme cases, but if there's a valid basis or an arguable base for choosing either law you can't get into Federal court under a due process--
speaker="jonathan_nuechterlein" startTime="1307.695" stopTime="1322.705">
    Mr. Jonathan Nuechterlein 
    That is correct, Justice Kennedy, but there are in fact important Federal constraints on a forum's choice of its own law. 
    As this Court held in cases like Shutts and Allstate the scope of a forum jurisdiction's ability to choose its own law as the rule of conduct is narrow--
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="1322.705" stopTime="1351.753">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    --As you said it held in Allstate, but Allstate, some might have regarded the homing instinct of that State court as exorbitant, and yet this Court held that it didn't violate due process for the State to prefer itself, so it seems to me that Allstate proves that at the very least this Court has been extraordinarily indulgent to choice of law decisions made by a forum. 
    Isn't that what one would take away from Allstate?
speaker="jonathan_nuechterlein" startTime="1351.753" stopTime="1361.090">
    Mr. Jonathan Nuechterlein 
    --Well, in the subsequent case, Justice Ginsburg, of Phillips Petroleum v. Shutts this Court did in fact invalidate the choice of Kansas law as the rule of decision--
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="1361.090" stopTime="1376.982">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Certainly not as to an accident that happened within a reservation. 
    I mean, wasn't the Shutts concern people who were outside Kansas whose entire connection to this venture was outside Kansas?

    Mr. Jonathan Nuechterlein 
    --I think that's correct, Justice Ginsburg. 
    However, I think there's an important difference. 
    This Court in cases like Montana, Brendale and Bourland has pointed out that the scope of a tribe's ability to regulate non-Indians, at least on certain kinds of lands within a reservation, is subject to stricter limitations than a State's ability to regulate outsiders.

speaker="jonathan_nuechterlein" startTime="1425.434" stopTime="1444.116">
    Mr. Jonathan Nuechterlein 
    That's correct, and I think it's also significant in that regard that in 1993 Congress based the Indian Tribal Justice Act, which commits essential Federal resources to the development of tribal courts on the premise embraced by this Court in Iowa Mutual that tribal jurisdiction over events arising on a reservation presumptively does lie in tribal court.
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="1444.116" stopTime="1509.449">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    Yes, but what sense does it... I mean, suppose there is room in the cases to go either way. 
    I could understand a rule that says, people who build houses in fee... you know, I'm thinking that this highway is a like a fee land. 
    I realize that's a big issue in dispute, but assume it is for the sake of argument. 
    Two people who are not Indians living on the land in fee, they have a house like... you know, they have no... I can understand a rule that say, they have to go to the tribal court, and tribal law applies. 
    That would be one rule. 
    That's a possible rule. 
    That's how you treat California, probably. 
    Or I could understand a rule which said, well, it's not like California. 
    It's a rule that South Dakota law applies. 
    Then have them go to South Dakota court. 
    I mean, what good does this mixing up of everything do except to leave... the lawyers will get very mixed up and the judge will get mixed up, and it will mean a lot of extra cost and very hard to sort out who goes where. 
    I mean, what's to be said against simplifying this? 
    If it's South Dakota law on the fee thing, go to the South Dakota court. 
    If it's the tribal law, go to the tribal court, if there's room to do it.

    Mr. Jonathan Nuechterlein 
    As an initial matter, Justice Breyer, we believe that both the State and the tribe have concurrent jurisdiction over this sort of suit in the same way that adjoining States often have jurisdiction over accidents--

    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    I'm not talking about jurisdiction. 
    I'm saying if we had room to do it, why wouldn't the sensible thing be to simplify? 
    If it's the State law that governs it, have them go to a State court. 
    If it's the tribal law that governs it, have them go to a tribal court.

    It is undisputed that a tribe has adjudicatory jurisdiction even over nonconsenting non-Indians in cases where the tribe can point to a particularized interest in the outcome of the dispute sufficient to justify the application of tribal regulatory authority under the Montana tribal interest test. 
    That test looks to see whether or not the activities of non-Indians have a direct effect on tribal welfare or whether or not they've entered into--

speaker="patrick_j_ward" startTime="1734.749" stopTime="1769.553">
    Mr. Patrick J. Ward 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court: 
    This Court has, on several occasions, indicated reasons why the tribal court lacked jurisdiction over Mr. Stockert and A-1 in this case. 
    Tribal courts exist primarily to apply tribal customs between tribal members. 
    In this instance, the tribe has given up its power to exclude nonmembers from the State highway. 
    In using the State highway on this occasion, Mr. Stockert did not give up his rights to due process, equal protection or trial by a jury of his peers.

    So then you're not relying on, as Justice Souter spoke, this case could be... could be described as a State highway case, and that would be the end of it, but I think you're telling us now that... that even if it occurred on a reservation road, there would not be tribal jurisdiction. 
    Is that what you're saying?
speaker="patrick_j_ward" startTime="1804.649" stopTime="1848.603">
    Mr. Patrick J. Ward 
    Your Honor, yes. 
    In this... the precedents of this Court's would indicate that the State's authority over nonmembers of the tribe, over its citizens, reaches into the reservation. 
    And so it doesn't necessarily require that the road has been alienated by the tribe. 
    But in this case, that gives the Respondents an even stronger position, because this is a State highway and it is regulated by the State and it is controlled by the State. 
    And as Justice Breyer indicated, there are interstate highways that run through reservations as well. 
    And citizens of this country have no idea when they enter an interstate highway to travel to Yellowstone Park or something out in the West that they're subjecting themselves to the tort jurisdiction of a tribal court that could deprive them of their property.

    --I know someone who knows that. 
    I know someone who knows that. 
    Isn't... isn't there kind of a dual concern implicit in what you're saying here? 
    It's perfectly true that when you go from North Dakota to South Dakota you realize you're going into a different jurisdiction. 
    But the general assumption that's made is highway laws, liability rules and so on are generally, more or less, the same. 
    So that the substantive legal regime probably is not changing very much.

    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    Here, however, I think, underlying some of your argument are two suggestions. 
    One is we really don't have a sense of what the legal regime is going to be if we are subject to tribal jurisdiction with the probability of tribal substantive law. 
    And, number two... and one of the amicus briefs was pretty explicit about this... there is a real concern about fairness of treatment in the tribal courts by virtue of the fact that the tribal judges can be removed by the tribal political authorities, in effect, if they don't like the results. 
    Are those two reasons... the fact that we have real question about what the substantive legal regime will be in a tribal court and, number two, we have a real question about due process because of the appointment scheme... are those two reasons, reasons that you rely significantly on and feel that we should rely significantly on in deciding this case?
speaker="patrick_j_ward" startTime="2003.967" stopTime="2012.104">
    Mr. Patrick J. Ward

    Mr. Patrick J. Ward 
    --There is no specific text, in the sense of a statute, that addresses this question. 
    There are treaties with the tribe. 
    And in those treaties, the tribe has historically recognized the right of safe passage for people passing through the reservation. 
    If... if one looks at those treaties, those treaties... never... if you look at the common notions of the day at the time that those treaties were entered into, these tribes, from the time almost 20 years after Lewis and Clark to this day, realized that there would be rights of way, there would be people passing through, and they would not interfere with the rights of those people passing through.

    Mr. Patrick J. Ward 
    The constitutional impediment would be that this... the Constitution recognizes two sovereigns, the United States and the States.

speaker="patrick_j_ward" startTime="2184.950" stopTime="2198.020">
    Mr. Patrick J. Ward 
    --The controlling doctrine is the Montana case that was decided by this case, which provides the limitations, or at least addresses the limitations, on tribal sovereignty and the exceptions to those limitations where nonmembers are involved.

    Mr. Patrick J. Ward 
    It was... it was legislative, but the sovereignty of a tribe, whether it's legislative or adjudicative, comes from the same place. 
    It comes from whatever retained inherent sovereignty remained after the tribes were incorporated into the United States. 
    And as this Court has recognized in Oliphant and Wheeler, for purposes of criminal jurisdiction, there is no tribal sovereignty, and the tribe could not, as in some of the earlier examples, exercise any criminal jurisdiction over either of the parties here because they were both nonmembers of the tribe.

    You said, well, even if Congress provided by statute that there would be jurisdiction in the tribal court in... in this case, that there would... there would or could... I'm not sure which you said... still be a due process problem. 
    Did you mean by that simply that you might still raise a due process challenge to the particular manner in which the... the court offices were appointed or the jurors selected or whatnot?

    Okay.

    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    How could you raise that?

    Mr. Patrick J. Ward 
    --Well, Your Honor, that would be a difficult problem, because the Court's Santa Clara Pueblo decision seemed to indicate that the... the issues of the Indian Civil Rights Act with respect to due process will not be reviewed except in habeas corpus proceedings. 
    So unless there was some revision of that decision with respect to review for nonmembers, the Santa Clara Pueblo case did involve a member, and she was questioning tribal... the issue of tribal membership rules.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="2304.741" stopTime="2346.159">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    But why wouldn't it operate... Ms. McCoy, I think, told us that, as a practical matter, to enforce a judgment of this nature rendered by the tribe, you'd have to go into State court, bring a fresh proceeding, to enforce that judgment. 
    And couldn't the defendant in that enforcement proceeding say that I recognize Indian tribal sovereignty; it's like the sovereignty of France or Italy. 
    When we're dealing with a sovereign to whom the full faith and credit clause doesn't apply, then we have certain checks. 
    And one of them is due process. 
    So we would look to the particular proceeding and see if essentially fair procedure was accorded in the tribal court.
speaker="patrick_j_ward" startTime="2346.159" stopTime="2357.547">
    Mr. Patrick J. Ward 
    There would be, in this instance, a comity provision, pursuant to the North Dakota rule with respect to enforcement of this tribal judgment.

    But--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="2357.547" stopTime="2362.071">

    In the cases Justice Breyer was suggesting, it's the plaintiff's choice of forum. 
    Most non-Indians probably wouldn't go to the tribal court in this kind of accident.

    One is whether they're going to have adjudicatory jurisdiction over all accidents, contracts on fee land, or the second issue could be this isn't fee land; this is not fee land. 
    This is an easement... shouldn't be treated as fee land. 
    So I'd appreciate your addressing that second contention briefly.

    It is an alienation of the land by the tribe.

    Mr. Patrick J. Ward

    It's giving up the power to regulate the highway.

    Mr. Patrick J. Ward 
    --Well, my understanding is that the practical application by the... by the tribe and the highway patrol is that if a non-Indian is involved, the tribe will call in the deputy sheriff from the county or they would call in the highway patrol.

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    If the tribe had not given up the easement to the State for the highway, could non-tribal members be totally excluded? 
    I mean, can the tribe just say, you know, we don't want to give the State any highway land, and since there are no State highways, no outsiders, just tribal members. 
    Can the tribe do that? 
    I--
speaker="patrick_j_ward" startTime="2818.973" stopTime="2827.799">
    Mr. Patrick J. Ward 
    The tribe, in this instance, certainly did give up the easement. 
    Whether the tribe could decide not to, I believe the tribe--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="2827.799" stopTime="2836.717">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    --Well, sure it could. 
    Well, haven't we had cases involving that; that on tribal land, the tribe has the right to exclude others? 
    We've had cases decided on that very basis.
speaker="patrick_j_ward" startTime="2836.717" stopTime="2847.714">
    Mr. Patrick J. Ward 
    --Yes... yes, you have, Your Honor. 
    And those cases involved reservations, where the tribe retained its power to exclude, as opposed to where it had given that up and agreed to give free passage, and agreed to allow rights-of-way.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="2847.714" stopTime="2851.438">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    And did it go along with this easement that the tribe promised not to exclude anybody?
speaker="patrick_j_ward" startTime="2851.438" stopTime="2864.236">
    Mr. Patrick J. Ward 
    Yes, Your Honor. 
    The only rights reserved to the tribe in the easement were the right to create crossings for purposes of approaches to farms and things like that. 
    Otherwise, the easement gave the State the rights to the surface of the road.

    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Do you know of any case where a tribe claims exclusive jurisdiction, which I believe is what Justice Breyer was suggesting... claim exclusive jurisdiction as distinguished from concurrent jurisdiction with the State over a tort that happens on a highway or on fee land?
speaker="patrick_j_ward" startTime="2885.951" stopTime="2889.584">
    Mr. Patrick J. Ward 
    I'm not aware of any case from this Court, Your Honor, where the tribe has--
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="2889.584" stopTime="2900.360">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    But do you know of any tribe that has asserted exclusive jurisdiction as distinguished from concurrent jurisdiction, where the plaintiff chooses the forum?
speaker="patrick_j_ward" startTime="2900.360" stopTime="2928.821">
    Mr. Patrick J. Ward 
    --I believe that the tribes, maybe. 
    And I believe that the effect of what happens, pursuant to the Petitioners' argument in cases... as a result of Iowa Mutual... is that State courts and Federal courts are reluctant to proceed because the action has been started in a tribal court. 
    And so, from that standpoint, whether the tribe asserts exclusive jurisdiction, in effect, it is by the way that the procedure is followed once that jurisdiction is invoked.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="2928.821" stopTime="2963.204">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    I must say, I am confused by the easement discussion. 
    I'm... you know, a sovereign can cede land, even the whole fee much less an easement, without conceding any sovereignty over that land. 
    If I purchased land from the United States, the United States doesn't give up jurisdiction over that land. 
    It's still subject to United States law. 
    I don't know that the fact that the tribe gives an easement to a State necessarily means that the tribe thereby cedes all of its jurisdictional responsibility over the... over the land as to which the easement was given. 
    Why do you assume that's the case?
speaker="patrick_j_ward" startTime="2963.204" stopTime="2963.474">
    Mr. Patrick J. Ward 
    Well--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="2963.474" stopTime="2968.778">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Is it clear that the tribe could not regulate Indians on that... on that easement, for example?
speaker="patrick_j_ward" startTime="2968.778" stopTime="3001.451">
    Mr. Patrick J. Ward 
    --Well, the... the reason I assume that's the case is for reasons similar to the Bourland decision of this Court, that, in that case, the tribe gave up the authority over the taken area for the building of the dam and for the recreational enjoyment of hunting and fishing in that area. 
    And the tribe, similar to this case, asserted that it maintained regulatory control even over non-Indians in that area. 
    And this Court decided no, it did not; that it did not retain that regulatory control. 
    And it further decided that that kind of control was not part of the tribe's inherent sovereignty.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="3001.451" stopTime="3012.117">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Only over non-Indians, you would say, though. 
    So, I mean, your highway principle that Justice Souter was discussing with you would only apply to regulation of non-Indians on the highway?
speaker="patrick_j_ward" startTime="3012.117" stopTime="3034.482">
    Mr. Patrick J. Ward 
    Well, Your Honor, this... this Court has never decided whether an easement or an alienation of land would give up the authority over the tribal members. 
    I don't think it goes that far. 
    I think the tribe... the essence of the tribe's sovereignty is the tribe's right to regulate the affairs of its members. 
    So, in that sense, there may be concurrent jurisdiction of the tribe over its members with respect to the highway.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="3034.482" stopTime="3036.823">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    But to members within the boundaries of the reservation?

    Mr. Patrick J. Ward 
    Exactly, yes. 
    Until the... once the State highway goes beyond the borders of the reservation, the tribe loses its authority even over its members.

    Mr. Patrick J. Ward 
    Not specifically; no, Your Honor.

    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Well, is that really completely true?

    Mr. Patrick J. Ward 
    --That's correct.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="3064.122" stopTime="3067.414">

    Mr. Patrick J. Ward 
    Yes, they have, Your Honor.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="3068.375" stopTime="3072.457">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    So, arguably, they might have given up jurisdiction to regulate non-Indians on this road?
speaker="patrick_j_ward" startTime="3072.457" stopTime="3076.420">
    Mr. Patrick J. Ward 
    I would submit that that's true, Your Honor.

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Well, except it's given up the power not only to exclude them from the road, but the power to exclude them from the reservation. 
    So, I mean, if you follow that logic, they would not have... they would not have power to regulate their activities on the rest of the reservation either?
speaker="patrick_j_ward" startTime="3087.857" stopTime="3090.288">
    Mr. Patrick J. Ward

    Because with respect to--

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Have they given up the power to exclude generally from the reservation?

    Mr. Patrick J. Ward 
    --Well, with respect to these particular tribes, there are no closed areas like there were in the Brendale decision. 
    This is an open reservation. 
    There are approximately 40 percent fee land. 
    Close to 50 percent of the people living on the reservation are nonmembers. 
    So there's a significant interaction. 
    And from an economic standpoint, a decision that would close the reservation or make people fearful of entering the reservation for fear of losing their property as a result of an adverse judgment there would not be good for the tribes and it would not encourage intercourse with the tribes, which is something that Congress has always indicated is part of its essential purpose in dealing with the tribes--

    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    Could you explain something to help focus on the precise law that we look to, to resolve this case? 
    If a State court exercises personal jurisdiction over someone erroneously... there's no personal jurisdiction... that person doesn't run into Federal court and get an injunction. 
    What was the theory on which you went into Federal court here originally?
speaker="patrick_j_ward" startTime="3153.366" stopTime="3169.417">
    Mr. Patrick J. Ward 
    --The theory that we originally went into Federal court was that we had exhausted our tribal court remedies with respect to jurisdiction and that the tribe did not have jurisdiction to involuntarily force Mr. Stockert and A-1 Contractors into one of its courts for purposes of a civil case.

    Mr. Patrick J. Ward 
    --Well, Your Honor, I believe the Federal question is presented by the fact that there is a deprivation of Mr. Stockert's rights.

    Mr. Patrick J. Ward 
    That's exactly what the Farmers Union case said, Your Honor. 
    The Farmers Union case said that Federal courts are the final arbiters of questions of Indian jurisdiction. 
    So, to the extent that authority is needed for that proposition, it's in the Farmers Union case. 
    And it was again in Iowa Mutual. 
    And basically, what Iowa Mutual was, was an extension of that exhauction requirement. 
    But, again... and it dealt with Section 1332 jurisdiction for diversity cases. 
    But it extended that exhaustion requirement that was announced in Farmers Union and recognized that yes, it is a Federal question... the question of Indian jurisdiction is a Federal question, because of the unique nature of Indian tribes in their dealings with the Congress and with the American people.

    Mr. Patrick J. Ward 
    --That's correct, Your Honor, their claims are not before us. 
    Those are claims that are derivative and they are essentially pending claims. 
    And they can adequately be pursued in the State courts, as well, pursuant to the second Montana exception. 
    To the extent there is a tribal interest that could be asserted here, however marginal, that... that interest could be adequately protected in the State court. 
    And not only is there... is Petitioner conceding that there is concurrent jurisdiction, but there is actually an action pending in the State court. 
    And with respect to the community argument that has been made by the Petitioners, the local courthouse, the closest local courthouse... and the State court is actually closer to the area where this accident happened then the reservation courthouse, which is across the lake and around the highway. 
    Since the lake was constructed, you actually would have to go around the lake almost... you would have to go far west and then cross a bridge to get to the tribe courthouse and you'd just go a few miles south to get to the county courthouse. 
    So it's not like there's any disadvantage to Mrs. Frederick's being required to use a State court of which she's a citizen and of which she has power to vote.
