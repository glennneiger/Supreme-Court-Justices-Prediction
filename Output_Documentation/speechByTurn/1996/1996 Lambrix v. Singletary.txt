Lambrix v. Singletary

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    We'll hear argument now in Number 96-5658, Cary Michael Lambrix v. Harry K. Singletary. 
    Mr. Lawry.
speaker="matthew_c_lawry" startTime="9.806" stopTime="42.327">
    Mr. Matthew C. Lawry 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    Everybody agrees that the proceedings by which petitioner was sentenced to death violated the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution. 
    Espinosa v. Florida so holds. 
    The issue before the Court is whether the settled principles of Eighth Amendment law applied to the Florida system in 1992 in Espinosa were themselves compelled by existing precedent in 1986. 
    That the--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="42.327" stopTime="50.997">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Another way of appraising it is the way we phrased it in the Butler case, isn't it, Mr. Lawry, that could a reasonable jurist have decided otherwise?
speaker="matthew_c_lawry" startTime="50.997" stopTime="113.256">
    Mr. Matthew C. Lawry 
    --Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, that is another way of phrasing it. 
    That the Espinosa result was compelled in 1986 can be explained very briefly, in 30 seconds or less. 
    As Stringer explains, as of 1985 an unadorned jury instruction on heinous, atrocious or cruel aggravating factor was unconstitutional. 
    An uncorrected jury weighing of such a factor required resentencing. 
    Moreover, jury weighing of such a factor could be corrected or cured only by harmless error analysis or by independent reweighing by a court that was untainted by the original error. 
    Espinosa simply applied those settled principles to the Florida sentencing scheme. 
    To elaborate somewhat on these points, I would like to describe in a bit more detail why the result in Espinosa was compelled by this Court's decisions in Proffitt, Godfrey, and Stringer.

    Justice David H. Souter 
    You... I don't want to interrupt the sequence that you want to follow, but are you going to address also Baldwin in Alabama, because Baldwin held in '85, I think-- 
    --Five, yes. 
    --that there was a question about just how intense the reweighing had to be if that were to supersede a jury error, and I would have supposed that that would be factored into the question of just how clearly anticipatable Espinosa was.
speaker="matthew_c_lawry" startTime="147.477" stopTime="212.835">
    Mr. Matthew C. Lawry 
    Yes, sir. 
    Yes, sir, I think it does factor in, if I can explain the way that I think it factors in. 
    We have to start with Proffitt v. Florida in 1976, and in fact respondent has quoted one of the key passages from Proffitt in their brief at page 13. 
    The Court was discussing whether the Florida sentencing scheme was basically constitutional, and it said that it was basically constitutional as long as adequate guidance was provided, and I'm quoting here, to those charged with the duty of recommending... that is, the jury... or imposing death sentences. 
    So in Proffitt this Court recognized that the jury has sentencing authority and must be adequately guided, and I would see Baldwin as more or less a reminder that the Florida sentencing scheme does work in that way. 
    It's different from Alabama, which at the time gave no real consideration to what the jury did.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="212.835" stopTime="246.390">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    Well, that may... you know, that might be the better view, but isn't it also the case that one could reasonably read Baldwin as saying that it's not clear whether the subsequent act of the sentencing judge in the Florida scheme constituted an adequate reweighing even on the assumption... which, of course, we never really know under the Florida scheme... even on the assumption that that factor was found by the jury and was one of the bases for the jury's recommendation. 
    Couldn't it reasonably have been argued that Baldwin had left that question open?
speaker="matthew_c_lawry" startTime="246.390" stopTime="254.079">
    Mr. Matthew C. Lawry 
    Well, yes, I don't think that Baldwin... Baldwin itself decided that decision. 
    I think that's--
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="254.079" stopTime="271.105">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    But didn't Baldwin signal that there was a real issue to this effect, and that issue, at least so far as the particular Florida scheme was concerned, did not get resolved until... or at least resolved in part until Espinosa came along?
speaker="matthew_c_lawry" startTime="271.105" stopTime="286.217">
    Mr. Matthew C. Lawry 
    --No, I... well, I think that Baldwin itself does not decide the issue. 
    I think that's correct. 
    I think that the way to decide... because Baldwin was not looking at the Florida scheme.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="286.217" stopTime="286.417">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Right.
speaker="matthew_c_lawry" startTime="286.217" stopTime="326.775">
    Mr. Matthew C. Lawry 
    The way to decide the issue is to look at how the Florida sentencing scheme actually works, applying this Court's settled principles, and if you look at the way that the Florida sentencing scheme works, you have to start with the Florida supreme court's 1975 decision in Tedder, and respondent virtually ignores Tedder in their brief because that's the only way that you can really seriously argue that the Florida jury does not have any sentencing authority. 
    Proffitt says that the jury does have sentencing authority, that it has to be guided, and that's exactly what this Court picked up on in Espinosa.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="326.775" stopTime="383.627">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    But the question, it seems to me, that you've got to wrestle with here under Teague is whether, assuming we were correct, and I happen to think we were insofar as evaluating the significance of the jury's function, you still have to wrestle with the question whether the subsequent act of the judge, who is presumed to know the Proffitt standard, in effect adequately supersedes what the jury had done, and I would have thought that that was the difficult question. 
    And one reason why that was a question upon which people could reasonably disagree was that Baldwin had said we're not telling you yet just what kind of subsequent act or how intense or de novo a subsequent reweighing will be required, and I would have thought that was the sticking point under Teague.
speaker="matthew_c_lawry" startTime="383.627" stopTime="410.759">
    Mr. Matthew C. Lawry 
    Well, I think that Stringer answers the question about what significance the trial court's actions have. 
    Stringer says that as of 1985, in order to cure weighing error before a jury, it's necessary to either have harmless error review or independent reweighing.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="410.759" stopTime="413.878">

    Mr. Matthew C. Lawry 
    It was the jury that sentenced, yes, and because the Florida jury has sentencing authority, the same result applies in Florida.

    Mr. Matthew C. Lawry 
    Yes, I do read it in that fashion.

    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    Well, but three or four times it says the trial judge is the sentencing authority, and so forth. 
    I guess we can quarrel over the reading of it. 
    I certainly don't think it's clearly to the effect that you state.
speaker="matthew_c_lawry" startTime="471.795" stopTime="484.955">
    Mr. Matthew C. Lawry

    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    It says the basic difference between the Florida system and the Georgia system is that in Florida the sentence is determined by the trial judge rather than by the jury, and there are like phrases... there are like phrases throughout the opinion.

    Mr. Matthew C. Lawry 
    I think that's correct, and certainly nothing had changed in the law in the intervening period, and I think it was obvious to this Court in Espinosa that the Florida sentencing scheme in fact gives sentencing authority to the jury.

    Yes.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="551.644" stopTime="561.167">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Does Florida law require the sentencing judge to place great weight on the recommendation of the jury?
speaker="matthew_c_lawry" startTime="561.167" stopTime="568.256">
    Mr. Matthew C. Lawry 
    Exactly. 
    That's what Florida law requires, and that's whether the jury's recommendation is life or death.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="568.256" stopTime="592.287">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    But Mr. Lawry, you also said that harmless error plays a part in this, and this trial judge did say that the facts speak for themselves. 
    Doesn't that indicate that he reweighed without reference to the jury verdict? 
    Isn't that a signal that what we're talking about is really academic?
speaker="matthew_c_lawry" startTime="592.287" stopTime="663.332">
    Mr. Matthew C. Lawry 
    Well, no, Your Honor, I don't think so. 
    I... first it's very difficult to determine exactly what the trial judge found when he said the facts speak for themselves, but even if it's assumed that the trial judge was finding that the facts fit within the Dixon limiting construction in Florida, which I don't think can be assumed, but even if we were to assume that, merely a finding by the judge that the facts... that he believes the facts fit within the aggravating circumstance doesn't mean that the jury necessarily would have. 
    It's certainly not a finding of harmless error, because he doesn't recognize that there was any error, and it's also not any kind of independent reweighing, which is what Stringer would require, because the judge in his weighing process must give great weight to what the jury did, and what the jury did was tainted by the invalid instruction, so it's not possible for the trial court in Florida to cure the error because the trial court has to weigh the error. 
    You can't cure the error by weighing it.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="663.332" stopTime="684.898">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    But if he said... this trial judge had said, now, I know what heinous, atrocious conduct is, and I find that that standard is met here, these facts speak for themselves, would that be... is that... would that be adequate then to amount to harmless error?
speaker="matthew_c_lawry" startTime="684.898" stopTime="713.464">
    Mr. Matthew C. Lawry 
    No, Your Honor, not without determining the effect of the error upon the jury, because the jury may not view the facts in the same light. 
    They may not believe that the facts are unnecessarily tortuous. 
    Unless you go to that step and say that the facts are... that the jury necessarily would have, or by some standard would have found that... the case unnecessarily tortuous, then you're not applying harmless error analysis, and--
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="713.464" stopTime="722.152">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Would it be harmless only if the judge disassociated himself from what the jury did and said, I'm looking at this de novo and here's how I come out?
speaker="matthew_c_lawry" startTime="722.152" stopTime="789.881">
    Mr. Matthew C. Lawry 
    --Yes, that's right, and furthermore, in the Florida system the Florida supreme court's review, both what the trial court does is virtually controlled by the jury's recommendation. 
    So is the Florida supreme court's review, because if a death sentence is imposed after a jury recommendation of death, the Florida supreme court does a normal form of deferential appellate review to see if the trial court's findings are supported by the evidence. 
    If a death sentence is imposed after a jury recommendation of life, the Florida supreme court will affirm only if virtually no reasonable person could differ as to the appropriateness of the sentence. 
    So that many, many times the Florida supreme court reverses the trial court's imposition of a death sentence after a jury recommendation of life when the trial court did not make any error. 
    The trial court did not err in any of its findings, but the Florida supreme court nevertheless reverses and imposes life because of the jury's life recommendation.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="789.881" stopTime="819.114">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Mr. Lawry, there's also an issue of procedural bar in this case. 
    Are you going to address that at all? 
    I mean, as I understand it the Florida supreme court held in this litigation specifically that Lambrix did not raise the issue of the trial court's failure to include his special instruction on his direct appeal, and consequently Lambrix's Espinosa claim is procedurally barred. 
    That's the last word of the Florida supreme court on that subject. 
    Why is that not dispositive?
speaker="matthew_c_lawry" startTime="819.114" stopTime="859.989">
    Mr. Matthew C. Lawry 
    Well, it's not dispositive for several reasons. 
    First, in the initial round of post conviction proceedings there was what the district court found was a merits ruling on this claim, and so this was a second review after remand from the Eleventh Circuit. 
    Now, whether that was... whether what the Florida supreme court did on its second look, whether that was an adequate and independent State bar, is a very complicated issue that's tied up with Florida rules and practice, and it's not been ruled on by any court, and so it's--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="859.989" stopTime="862.655">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    I thought it was ruled on by the Florida supreme court.

    Mr. Matthew C. Lawry 
    --No... yes, Your Honor. 
    I mean, it hasn't... whether that was an adequate and independent State bar has not been ruled on by any Federal court is what I should have said.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="871.028" stopTime="892.089">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Well, I find it hard to get around the statement by the supreme court of the State that the objection wasn't raised on appeal, and there is a procedural bar. 
    That's what it said, and you say there's a later lower court opinion in the State which contradicts the supreme court statement that there was a procedural bar?
speaker="matthew_c_lawry" startTime="892.089" stopTime="905.030">
    Mr. Matthew C. Lawry 
    No. 
    There was... the claim was previously raised in the 3850 proceedings, and in those proceedings there was what the district court found amounted to a merits ruling, but--

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    By a lower Florida court.

    Mr. Matthew C. Lawry 
    --It came... yes. 
    It came after the case had gone to Federal habeas proceedings, proceeded to the Eleventh Circuit.

speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="1044.829" stopTime="1059.487">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Well, but the procedural bar arises from the original trial. 
    If that is procedurally barred as a result of what was done at the original trial, the mere fact that you have different later proceedings certainly wouldn't alter the judgment of whether there's a procedural bar or not.

    It hasn't been ruled on... the adequacy hasn't been ruled on by any Federal court.

    --no procedural bar, and if any procedural bar had been applied it wouldn't have been adequate and independent. 
    The Eleventh Circuit then remanded the case back to State court, where the State supreme court said that there was a bar. 
    The case returned to the Eleventh Circuit. 
    The Eleventh Circuit ruled only on Teague. 
    So our argument is that there was no regularly applied bar, that the bar... or that the bar went away when the State courts ruled on the merits in the first instance. 
    You can't go back after the fact. 
    The State's bar may be nothing more than applying a rule that we're not going to consider the merits in a successive proceeding. 
    And furthermore, even if there is... even if the Court thinks that there's an adequate and independent bar, there's also a cause in prejudice argument, because if we win on Teague, then it's clear that this law was dictated as of the time of the direct appeal, and so competent counsel should have raised it. 
    The Eleventh Circuit hasn't ruled on any of this. 
    The Eleventh Circuit is closer to State law and State practice than this Court is, and the appropriate disposition would be to remand to the Eleventh Circuit to let it figure out the procedural bar issues as well as any other issues remaining after this Court's disposition.

    I thought that their basic point was that as you go back to that period of time, the late eighties and so forth, it wasn't really clear the extent to which the Constitution required States to follow what one would have thought of as ordinary legal harmless error rules, and that perhaps all that was happening was that the judge was being told, you go look at this case where there's a HAC error, and you make up your own mind. 
    We have to have a judge saying that this case is the kind of case that isn't cruel and unusual, heinous, aggravated or cruel on the ground that all murders are like that. 
    There has to be something special about it.

speaker="carol_m_dittmar" startTime="1510.833" stopTime="1539.632">
    Ms. Carol M. Dittmar 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    There are two fundamental reasons why this Court should affirm the opinion of the Eleventh Circuit in this case. 
    The first issue is the Eleventh Circuit's conclusion that Teague v. Lane bars Espinosa review in a Federal habeas proceeding, and that conclusion is correct. 
    The second reason is the procedural bar that exists, and I'd like to start by addressing the procedural bar. 
    First--
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="1539.632" stopTime="1541.801">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Which the Eleventh Circuit didn't address, is that right?

    Ms. Carol M. Dittmar 
    --That's correct. 
    The Eleventh Circuit obeyed the command of treating retroactivity as a threshold issue and decided the case solely on Teague, so they did not address the State's procedural bar argument.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="1552.889" stopTime="1554.325">

    Justice John Paul Stevens

    Yes, it was.

speaker="carol_m_dittmar" startTime="1563.781" stopTime="1631.406">
    Ms. Carol M. Dittmar 
    Yes, it was. 
    The district court... as to the Godfrey claim that had been raised back in the district court, the State argued at that time that there was a procedural bar based on several different reasons. 
    One of the reasons, and this is in the joint appendix on pages 46 to 49 in the State's response, the primary reason was this was a direct appeal issue in the State of Florida, and it had not been raised in Mr. Lambrix's direct appeal. 
    The next... the other argument put forth by the State at that time was that although it had been raised in the motion for post conviction relief, the trial judge in that motion did not decide the merits of that issue, and furthermore, when it went to the Florida supreme court, the Florida supreme court did not have that particular issue before it, because the Florida supreme court opinion from the appeal of the post conviction motion clearly says there are two issues before this Court. 
    Both of them relate to the defendant's state of intoxication at the time of the crime. 
    So that specific issue was not addressed in the post conviction appeal as well.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="1631.406" stopTime="1634.691">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    How does that square with--
speaker="carol_m_dittmar" startTime="1634.691" stopTime="1636.841">
    Ms. Carol M. Dittmar 
    What the district court found?
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="1636.841" stopTime="1647.849">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    --what the petitioner's counsel has told us that it was specifically included in the grounds that were presented in the collateral... in the appeal from the denial of collateral relief?
speaker="carol_m_dittmar" startTime="1647.849" stopTime="1829.162">
    Ms. Carol M. Dittmar 
    Based on Florida procedure is how the district court reached that conclusion. 
    What happened is, the Godfrey claim that was raised in post conviction... and this was a claim that the Florida supreme court had inconsistently interpreted this aggravating factor, and therefore the factor was invalid. 
    That claim was raised in the post conviction motion for the first time, and the State responded at that time that it was a direct appeal issue. 
    The circuit court judge, the trial judge in Florida, did not specifically address that issue. 
    In his order he merely concluded that Mr. Lambrix was not entitled to relief. 
    He does not say, based on the merits, or based on the procedural law in Florida. 
    He just says his conclusion is Mr. Lambrix is not entitled to relief. 
    That is what the Federal district judge in the habeas proceeding found to be a ruling on the merits, his conclusion. 
    When that was appealed to the Florida supreme court, there is a particular statute... I'm sorry, a rule of procedure in Florida that when a post conviction motion is determined summarily by a trial judge without an evidentiary hearing, that what is... goes to the Florida supreme court or whatever the appellate court is, is simply the record that was before the lower court, and that there is no briefing or argument in that appeal. 
    It's basically a review of what the trial judge had before him. 
    If there is an evidentiary hearing held on the post conviction motion, it is treated as an ordinary appeal where the parties file briefs and orally argue the case, and then the court decides it. 
    Because there had been no evidentiary hearing on the post conviction motion, the petitioner has argued to the Federal district court successfully that under the Florida rule that says everything goes up to the Florida supreme court, even though in this particular case there were briefs filed and there was oral argument held, that under the rule, you have to look at the entire record and not just what was argued in the briefs and argued to the court, and that's what the district court found when he found that there was a ruling on the merits by the trial judge, and that that ruling on the merits was undisturbed by the Florida supreme court. 
    Therefore, he found that it was reviewed, and central to his holding... of course, this is prior to the time that the Espinosa claim went back and was found to be procedurally barred by the Florida supreme court. 
    Central to the district court was the idea that no State court had ever specifically said this is procedurally barred. 
    He was looking for that language in one of the State court opinions and he did not find it. 
    Based on the lack of that statement, he said that there was a ruling on the merits. 
    So the State has maintained consistently that this was a direct appeal issue that should have been raised in the direct appeal and it wasn't. 
    This same issue in the Sochar case, this Court declined to address it, because it was procedurally barred in that case, and that was a direct review case, so you really can't come back on a collateral case on habeas review and address the procedurally barred issue that's the same issue that you didn't address earlier.

    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor

    Ms. Carol M. Dittmar 
    Well, I think it's a very straightforward issue, though.

speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="1946.391" stopTime="1958.616">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Do you know how many Florida convictions or sentences would have to be set aside if we were to agree with the petitioner on the merits?
speaker="carol_m_dittmar" startTime="1958.616" stopTime="2008.496">
    Ms. Carol M. Dittmar 
    Yes, ma'am. 
    I would say less than a dozen cases, not necessarily set aside but at least considered in the habeas proceeding. 
    Most of the cases in Florida where this has come up have either been decided since the time of Espinosa, and obviously at that point the Florida supreme court was well aware of the issue and they had consistently applied Espinosa to the cases that have come before them. 
    It really only affects the cases prior to Espinosa that had already gone into Federal court, and there would have to be the preservation of error and, in fact, the Florida supreme court, if it was raised in the trial court, an issue, and argued on appeal, the Florida supreme court is granting collateral relief in those cases. 
    So if it has not been procedurally barred, even though the conviction may be final in Florida, they can still get relief from the Florida supreme court without having to turn to the Federal court. 
    There are--

    Right. 
    If they argued to the trial judge that the instruction was incorrect, and also argued that on appeal to the Florida supreme court, and those arguments were rejected at that time because Espinosa had not been decided, then the Florida supreme court is granting relief in those cases.

    I think that that is how it is, but the cases... I think the cases where this Court has said that have not been cases where there was a procedural bar to consider or to decide whether a procedural bar takes priority over a Teague issue. 
    I think that fundamentally the procedural bar is an issue that needs to be addressed as a threshold issue by any Federal court.

    Ms. Carol M. Dittmar 
    Well, I don't think it would be that extraordinary. 
    In Gray v. Netherland this Court found a procedural bar on the Brady claim, despite the fact that the circuit court in Gray had never reached the procedural argument on that claim. 
    The district court in Gray had found a procedural bar on the Brady claim. 
    The circuit court did not address it at all, and when Gray came up to this Court, this Court addressed the procedural bar that applied on that claim, so I don't think it's so unique that it can't be done, and I certainly don't think it's something that's beyond this Court's ability to do.

    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    What's the advantage to you as a prosecutor from that? 
    It's... I mean, suppose we said you're right on the procedural bar. 
    There are other cases in front of us, I think, that raise this same Espinosa retroactivity issue, and if that were so we'd have to take one of those, if there are, and then decide the same issue in that other case, and all we would have done with the two cases is simply decided on a matter unique to this case that the Eleventh Circuit's perfectly capable of deciding anyway. 
    I mean, so how do you benefit from that, except you might have two arguments instead of one or something.
speaker="carol_m_dittmar" startTime="2198.350" stopTime="2220.179">
    Ms. Carol M. Dittmar 
    Well, I think this Court can address both issues in this case. 
    I don't think you're limited to only addressing one issue. 
    The Eleventh Circuit applied the Teague bar, and I think that gives the Court reason to look at the Teague issue and to decide the Teague issue. 
    I think that you can say that there are two reasons to affirm the Eleventh Circuit, and one of them is a procedural bar, and one of them is the Teague issue.

    On the Teague issue, it... if... is the reading of Proffitt dispositive of the case?

    Ms. Carol M. Dittmar 
    I think that is... a great deal of the case is Proffitt, but also the other sentencing opinions out of Florida that has come from this Court, including Spaziano, where you were looking at the constitutionality of the judge imposing a death sentence when the judge had recommended a life sentence. 
    And in Spaziano you talk about how that jury recommendation is only advisory, and again you refer to Florida as a judge-sentencing State, and even up through the time of the Walton decision in Arizona, which was decided the same year that Espinosa was decided, this Court continuously refers to Florida as a judge-sentencing State.

    I mean, the question is, how obvious is this? 
    So in thinking about that, well, basically there is something working out here which is obvious from, like, Justinian or something, that if you have a jury and the jury decides whether a person's negligent or any other thing, and the jury's misinstructed, you get a new trial, unless the judge says that it was harmless, and it seems as if all these cases represent a working out of that principle and nothing else. 
    And the only thing was, it wasn't clear for a while whether that basic hornbook principle is applicable through the Eighth Amendment to the States in death penalty cases, and by the late eighties it was clear that it was, and even if it wasn't clear that it was, Stringer says it was clear that it was, and that's the end of the matter, and therefore it's clear.

    Ms. Carol M. Dittmar 
    What is clear is that there is Eighth Amendment error if the jury waives an invalid factor, and under the cases prior to Espinosa, the validity of the factor turned on its application to the facts of a particular case and the way the factor had been interpreted by the State appellate court to give a narrowing definition of the factor. 
    In Espinosa, the validity of the factor all of a sudden turned on the sufficiency of the jury recommendation, or the jury instruction, rather than how the factor was applied and whether it had been narrowed through appellate court decisions. 
    That was a fundamental change new to Espinosa.

    Well, I think, as the point was made earlier, there had been briefing on the issue in Sochar that the Court examined, but I don't think it's a fair conclusion to draw merely from a summary... the fact that it was a summary opinion in Espinosa to say we would never have made a new rule.

    I don't think so, if the facts of the case supported the narrow construction.

speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="2721.066" stopTime="2729.906">

    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    I want to go back for a second to my question, because looking at it as I was doing you'd say, look, all that Godfrey is, is it tells you what the basic error is. 
    It's like making a misinstruction about negligence. 
    And all Clemons is, it tells you, treat it like a negligence case. 
    It gives you some rules, which are obvious rules, that if the jury makes a mistake because it was misinstructed on the Godfrey issue, like negligence or anything, then of course you have to have a new trial, unless the judge can say for one of three reasons that it made no difference. 
    And all that Espinosa does is say, Florida, which is a little bit special, is really like a State where the jury decides it. 
    And in case you had any doubt, Stringer makes clear this very basic rule, the rule from Justinian, is the rule. 
    It was obvious, says Stringer. 
    Now, that's a way. 
    I know it's not the perfect way, and I know it's overlooking a lot of things, but if I were to look at the case that way, then I would say, yeah, Espinosa's pretty obvious, and this whole thing's obvious enough. 
    So I want to get a direct response to that.
speaker="carol_m_dittmar" startTime="2872.427" stopTime="2879.514">
    Ms. Carol M. Dittmar

    Justice Stephen G. Breyer

    That was never our intent. 
    The judge has a statutory duty to do an independent, de novo review of the aggravating and the mitigating factors, and the jury recommendation is just that, an advisory recommendation, and the Florida supreme court said that quite strongly in cases where the Eleventh Circuit had found a Caldwell error, a violation that the jury's role was minimized to the jury based on Florida's standard jury instructions.

    Mr. Matthew C. Lawry 
    I'd like to briefly address the procedural bar issue. 
    There's two important points about what happened in the trial court in the 3850 proceedings. 
    The claim that was raised there was a Maynard claim that challenged the vagueness of the jury instructions as well as the Florida supreme court's review. 
    Furthermore, the trial court denied the State's motion to dismiss, which was based on procedural grounds, so the clear implication of what the trial court did is that it was ruling on the merits of the claim. 
    If there's no further questions, I have nothing additional.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="2999.237" stopTime="3010.712">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    Well, but the procedural bar is not just failure to raise it at the trial level, is it? 
    It's failure to bring it to the attention of the supreme court, which brings us back to our earlier discussion.
speaker="matthew_c_lawry" startTime="3010.712" stopTime="3030.773">
    Mr. Matthew C. Lawry 
    Right, but when a State court rules on the merits... the 3850 proceedings are after the trial. 
    When a State court rules on the merits in any proceeding, that does away with the procedural bar. 
    They... even though the court perhaps could have applied a procedural bar.

    And the Eleventh Circuit is more familiar with that than we.

    Mr. Matthew C. Lawry 
    That's correct, and that's why we think the appropriate disposition is to remand after ruling in our favor on the Teague issue.

    The part about Espinosa which opposing counsel said was the least obvious was the part about what Florida State law is really like. 
    That is, is the role of judge-jury there really like a judge-jury in a negligence case or some other, or does the judge really make a pretty independent decision? 
    Now, what do you think we ought to read on that, just Tedder?

    Mr. Matthew C. Lawry 
    Well, I would read Sochar and the cases cited in Sochar, because there are numerous kinds of jury error that the Florida supreme court has reviewed in death penalty cases... jury instruction error, improper evidence, improper argument. 
    In none of those cases has the court said, oh, well, the jury has... there was error in front of the jury, but the judge did it, okay, so we don't have to concern ourselves with the jury. 
    They've always said, look to see whether the error affected the jury, and that's exactly what should be done in this case, and that shows that it's not just a pure judge case--

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Mr. Lawry, can I come back to your response to Justice O'Connor? 
    You say it's... the question of whether there's a procedural bar is a question of State law. 
    If it was a question of State law we have the last word of the supreme court of Florida, which says that this claim is procedurally barred. 
    Now, it seems to me that there is an issue whether that assertion by the Florida supreme court is sufficient to establish a procedural bar for Federal purposes, given that a lower Florida court had reached the merits in this other fashion and so forth, but it's clear, is it not, that the Florida supreme court believes this claim to be procedurally barred, as a matter of Florida law? 
    Now, you know, they may be wrong as to whether they are... that is good enough to create a Federal bar, but don't we have the word of the Florida supreme court?

    Mr. Matthew C. Lawry 
    --Yes, and a second opportunity, and then the question is whether that's adequate, independent, and whether there's cause and prejudice for any default. 
    My time is up. 
    Thank you.
