    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    We'll hear argument first this morning in Number 95-1065, Paul Schenck and Dwight Saunders v. Pro-Choice Network of Western New York. 
    Mr. Sekulow.
speaker="jay_alan_sekulow" startTime="11.630" stopTime="59.542">
    Mr. Jay A. Sekulow 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court: 
    Whatever one thinks of abortion, this Court in both Bray and Casey has recognized that there are common and respectable reasons for opposing it. 
    We are not here challenging the prohibitions of the injunction which prohibit blockades, trespass, or obstruction of access. 
    In the Western District of New York, the opposition to abortion with which we are concerned involves demonstrations such as picketing, leafleting, the holding of a sign, or a prayer vigil. 
    Under the one-size-fits-all injunction issued by the district court, the petitioners are prohibited from engaging in these form of demonstrations inside overlapping speech-free zones that float without geographic limitation. 
    The injunction also allows, to a very limited extent, a form of demonstration that--

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Mr. Sekulow--
speaker="jay_alan_sekulow" startTime="60.113" stopTime="60.702">
    Mr. Jay A. Sekulow 
    --Yes, Justice--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="60.702" stopTime="62.655">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    --I think we can hear you quite well if you were to lower your voice a little.
speaker="jay_alan_sekulow" startTime="62.655" stopTime="100.559">
    Mr. Jay A. Sekulow 
    --Yes, Mr. Chief Justice. 
    The other provision of the injunction that we are challenging involves a sidewalk counseling allowance. 
    It allows sidewalk counseling. 
    However, that sidewalk counseling can be terminated based on facial gestures. 
    In other words, what we call and the lower courts recognized as a cease-and-desist provision. 
    This provision of the injunction is implemented on verbal or nonverbal indications. 
    In fact, the injunction itself prohibits and allows for... prohibits any person being approached. 
    It's not just limited to women seeking the services of an abortion facility. 
    On page 183 of the petition appendix--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="100.559" stopTime="107.752">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    You'd be content if we modified that so only verbal indications would suffice?
speaker="jay_alan_sekulow" startTime="107.752" stopTime="113.586">
    Mr. Jay A. Sekulow 
    --No, Justice Scalia, we would not. 
    That would be certainly a step in the right direction. 
    The ACLU in their brief has acknowledged that--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="113.586" stopTime="115.830">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    And that's not really what you're after here, is it?
speaker="jay_alan_sekulow" startTime="115.830" stopTime="139.765">
    Mr. Jay A. Sekulow 
    --That is not. 
    We think that the no consent, and that's what this is, without consent, the speech stops, and that could be before a word is even uttered, and we think that provision of the injunction, like the no approach zone in Madsen, because it is dependent upon consent of the people speaking and the people that are listening, therefore it is unconstitutional, because without a doubt it burdens more speech than necessary to serve any of these purposes.

    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    How does it stop? 
    I mean, we're 15 feet apart now.

    Mr. Jay A. Sekulow 
    Yes.

    The Chief Justice certainly said that.

    Yes. 
    So what is the problem?

    We're in the--
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="157.009" stopTime="160.458">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    --and the judge's decree allows everybody to go 15 feet apart, doesn't it?
speaker="jay_alan_sekulow" startTime="160.458" stopTime="202.075">
    Mr. Jay A. Sekulow 
    --Justice Breyer, I think that in reality we're talking about, of course, in Buffalo city sidewalks and city streets, with sidewalk escorts trying to get people into the clinic. 
    It's the hustle and bustle of any metropolitan area, and to carry on intimate conversation, one-on-one communication with a desire to dissuade, to tell someone we really don't you... want you to go into this particular abortion facility. 
    That is intimate conversation. 
    Sure, you could be 15 feet away, but in that 15 feet, if you were to ask me, as a demonstrator, if I was the demonstrator, you wanted some information, under this injunction consensual speech is also prohibited, and that's where I think, if we look at the burdening-no-more-speech-than-necessary standard, why is it that 15 feet serves as a standard, especially--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="202.075" stopTime="202.646">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Let me ask you--
speaker="jay_alan_sekulow" startTime="202.646" stopTime="203.057">
    Mr. Jay A. Sekulow 
    --Yes, Justice Stevens.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="203.057" stopTime="204.339">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    --Would 5 feet be okay?
speaker="jay_alan_sekulow" startTime="204.339" stopTime="208.220">
    Mr. Jay A. Sekulow 
    I don't think so in the particular situation here. 
    If there is--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="208.220" stopTime="209.152">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Two feet?
speaker="jay_alan_sekulow" startTime="209.152" stopTime="294.587">
    Mr. Jay A. Sekulow 
    --Two feet I think would approach what we would consider probably blocking, certainly crowding, and crowding is prohibited by section 1(c) of the injunction and we're not challenging that, but crowding in the sense that if I were blocking your access. 
    One of the examples that we use, and I think it was one of the contempt proceedings... it's found in the Joint Appendix on page... beginning... commencing on page 101, actually 102 going forward. 
    Bonnie Behn and Carla Rainero were engaged in sidewalk counseling. 
    They were held in contempt. 
    The court held them in contempt. 
    On page 107 of the Joint Appendix, in describing what exactly was taking place, and then going on to page 108, and I'll refer to page 108, Bonnie Behn and Carla Rainero walked alongside the young woman, her companions and the escorts, and continued talking to the young woman. 
    They were engaged in a conversation. 
    Now, ultimately, the woman in that particular case that was seeking the abortion said, please stop talking. 
    There's no finding of yelling, no finding of blockades, no finding of impeding access. 
    She just said, stop talking. 
    The two individuals, Carla Rainero and Bonnie Behn, continued to communicate, and for that the court held them, the district court held them in contempt, because the injunction itself prohibits that type of speech on a public sidewalk in New York absent evidence of yelling, absent evidence of blockades. 
    That information or that concern is handled by the injunction, as is the noise restrictions. 
    We're not challenging those.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="294.587" stopTime="303.523">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Yelling. 
    You would accept this injunction if it prevented you from raising your voice to anyone going into the clinic?
speaker="jay_alan_sekulow" startTime="303.523" stopTime="310.078">
    Mr. Jay A. Sekulow 
    Oh, no, I don't think that is the prohibition that we're concerned with. 
    The noise provision, Justice Scalia, excessively loud noise to be heard inside--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="310.078" stopTime="310.919">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    To be heard inside.
speaker="jay_alan_sekulow" startTime="310.919" stopTime="311.578">
    Mr. Jay A. Sekulow 
    --Yes.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="311.578" stopTime="315.852">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    But you wouldn't say that this injunction would be okay if it prevented the counselors from shouting at the--
speaker="jay_alan_sekulow" startTime="315.852" stopTime="328.929">
    Mr. Jay A. Sekulow 
    No. 
    I think that's robust speech, and this Court has talked about the need to protect robust speech in public forums. 
    This is clearly a public forum. 
    The fact that these sidewalks abut an abortion clinic does not mean that they become enclaves immune from the First Amendment.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="328.929" stopTime="332.812">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    --Well, are you challenging the fixed 15-foot limit?
speaker="jay_alan_sekulow" startTime="332.812" stopTime="348.153">
    Mr. Jay A. Sekulow 
    We are challenging that as well. 
    Justice O'Connor, the way that these zones work in operation, you have, as you acknowledge, the 15-foot fixed zone, which actually is really 45 feet, because as an individual approaches the clinic their bubble zone, their floating zone goes with them.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="348.153" stopTime="354.006">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    I'm not talking about the floating bubble, I'm talking about the fixed buffer zone provision.
speaker="jay_alan_sekulow" startTime="354.006" stopTime="385.266">
    Mr. Jay A. Sekulow 
    The fixed buffer zone in and of itself, Justice O'Connor, we are challenging. 
    Two reasons. 
    Number 1, the Court here, before... when it issued the temporary restraining order had a speech-restrictive provision initially. 
    I think what this Court said in Madsen as it relates to the entire issue of was there a... before a broader injunction is issued, is there a least restrictive or less restrictive injunction that just didn't do the job, and I don't think that's the facts here. 
    The reality is that the injunction had a speech restriction at the outset. 
    Then the Court increased that speech restriction in the final... the preliminary injunction.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="385.266" stopTime="393.282">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    Is it your position that there was no post-TRO conduct that justified the 15-foot limit?
speaker="jay_alan_sekulow" startTime="393.282" stopTime="404.910">
    Mr. Jay A. Sekulow 
    That is our position, and I think the record in that sense shows it, because there would have been six contempts, or actually seven contempt actions brought in an almost 18-month period, three of them involving cease and desist... yes, Justice Ginsburg.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="404.910" stopTime="441.844">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    As I recall, Judge Meskill in the panel ruling did find that there had been violations after the issuance of the TRO, and if you would look at A-57 he refers to an incident on March 26, 1991, in which two men blocked the doorway to the clinic, and then another one on January 1, so Judge Meskill, whose position I think you are not challenging--
speaker="jay_alan_sekulow" startTime="441.844" stopTime="442.324">
    Mr. Jay A. Sekulow 
    That's correct.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="442.324" stopTime="450.208">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    --did find post-TRO conduct that violated the Court's order.
speaker="jay_alan_sekulow" startTime="450.208" stopTime="456.632">
    Mr. Jay A. Sekulow 
    Yes, Justice Ginsburg, that's correct, and we've acknowledged, and they're in the Joint Appendix, there are also contempt actions that have been filed.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="456.632" stopTime="470.003">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    But you did say in your reply brief that the district judge found no defendants physically blocked access after the issuance of the TRO, and as I read Judge Meskill's opinion that's not so.
speaker="jay_alan_sekulow" startTime="470.003" stopTime="491.865">
    Mr. Jay A. Sekulow 
    What it's talking about there in the particular page A-57, the way we understand the evidence was submitted at trial and the way we've seen the case was, this was not a mass blockade, and what we were talking about in our reply brief, Justice Ginsburg, is, this is not a case involving mass blockades. 
    There have been occasions where protesters have trespassed, and we believe--
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="491.865" stopTime="527.589">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    But I wanted to inquire, what is the principle that limits the Court to the conduct post-TRO and pre-preliminary injunction, given the long history of discord, to use the mildest term, what is it that confines the district judge in thoughtfully drawing a preliminary injunction after trying to preserve the peace with a TRO, from crafting it in a sensible way in light of all of the past history? 
    Why is he confined just to this post-TRO conduct?
speaker="jay_alan_sekulow" startTime="527.589" stopTime="562.733">
    Mr. Jay A. Sekulow 
    --I think that the Court should only be looking at this particular injunction in light of the facts that the district court have. 
    Was the injunction that was issued, Justice Kennedy, then, the question that we would submit is, did it burden more speech than necessary, and the provisions that we're challenging... we're not saying that it was inappropriate to say, as the court did... it increased the... under provision 1(c) from the TRO to the preliminary injunction, it did increase things such as no touching, no physical contact. 
    We're not challenging that. 
    But there's nothing that justifies the speech-free zones that float without any geographic limitation, and speech can be silenced on command. 
    Justice Scalia.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="562.733" stopTime="568.705">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Was that 15-foot... not the floating zone, but the 15-foot absolute, that was in the TRO originally. 
    That wasn't added.
speaker="jay_alan_sekulow" startTime="568.705" stopTime="569.767">
    Mr. Jay A. Sekulow 
    Actually, the--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="569.767" stopTime="571.908">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Wasn't that in the original TRO as well?
speaker="jay_alan_sekulow" startTime="571.908" stopTime="574.710">
    Mr. Jay A. Sekulow 
    --Justice Scalia, actually it was the floating zone was in the TRO.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="574.710" stopTime="575.501">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Ah.
speaker="jay_alan_sekulow" startTime="575.501" stopTime="587.979">
    Mr. Jay A. Sekulow 
    And the fixed zone came afterwards, and I think that points to the nature of what took place here, so we have these automatic floating zones, if you will, without geographic limitation, and then a 15-foot zone is imposed, and we would--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="587.979" stopTime="609.772">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    What Meskill says on A-57, after noting that there were these two violations after the TRO, he says, however, the Supreme Court's First Amendment jurisprudence clearly requires more than two isolated incidents over the course of 1-1/2 years before a court may banish an entire protest demonstration from a given area, and that's your contention here.
speaker="jay_alan_sekulow" startTime="609.772" stopTime="611.224">
    Mr. Jay A. Sekulow 
    --And that is our contention, and also--
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="611.224" stopTime="625.463">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    But Mr. Sekulow, I think you will agree that it is a standard in law regarding injunctions that if there is no incident following the TRO... the TRO is a very temporary thing.
speaker="jay_alan_sekulow" startTime="625.463" stopTime="626.084">
    Mr. Jay A. Sekulow 
    --Right.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="626.084" stopTime="643.446">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    And if there is no violation of it, that shows the injunction is working, not that it should be stopped. 
    I think your proposition is extraordinary, that if the very brief TRO is working, then the injunction must be stopped, rather than maintained.
speaker="jay_alan_sekulow" startTime="643.446" stopTime="647.566">
    Mr. Jay A. Sekulow 
    But Justice Ginsburg, if it is working but infringes on free speech at the same time--
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="647.566" stopTime="650.688">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Well, then... then there was something wrong with the TRO.
speaker="jay_alan_sekulow" startTime="650.688" stopTime="652.150">
    Mr. Jay A. Sekulow 
    --Well, precisely.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="652.150" stopTime="663.367">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    But the notion that I thought you were putting forward to us was that because there was compliance with the TRO there was no longer need for that restraint.
speaker="jay_alan_sekulow" startTime="663.367" stopTime="699.021">
    Mr. Jay A. Sekulow 
    We have not challenged, nor are we here challenging the restrictions other than the two speech provisions, but the district court and the court of appeals acknowledge, and it's on A-8 of the petition appendix, that the demonstrations are mostly peaceful in nature. 
    Twelve judges of the Second Circuit Court of Appeals stated that in fact this was very different record than in Madsen. 
    And in Madsen, this Court held that in fact the issue of a fixed zone was debatable. 
    We think the debate should tip in favor of free speech here, especially since this Court in Madsen said that precision of regulation is required, couched in the narrowest possible terms.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="699.021" stopTime="706.327">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    We also said in Madsen, Mr. Sekulow, that some deference was due to the trial court's formulation of the thing.
speaker="jay_alan_sekulow" startTime="706.327" stopTime="740.709">
    Mr. Jay A. Sekulow 
    Yes, and this Court, in looking at the... in giving some deference to the trial court struck down the no-approach zone in Madsen and also declared that a portion of the 36-foot zone burdened more speech than necessary. 
    Mr. Chief Justice, I think that's precisely our point, that the pinpoint precision that this Court talked about in Madsen is absent here. 
    This is a one... this injunction applies to every single facility where abortions are performed in the Western District of New York, and it is one size fits all. 
    They did not carve it to specific needs, and we think a floating zone is not justified anyways, and a cease-and-desist provision--

    May I ask on the floating zone--

    --Yes.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="742.759" stopTime="768.766">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    --is it your position that a floating zone, no matter how carefully tailored, could never be justified as a remedy for repetitive speech?

    Oh.

    Mr. Jay A. Sekulow 
    In the context of robust debate on a public issue like this, there is going to be a variety of speech. 
    This injunction, though, which is interesting, prohibits a person from... a demonstrator from approaching anyone. 
    In fact, interestingly, this injunction does not limit its impact to women seeking the services of an abortion clinic, or physicians and staff. 
    It applies to any person seeking access, and provision 1(c), the no approach zone, it's similar to the no-approach zone. 
    It's the cease-and-desist provision, says on its face... I mean, it's very clear that a person or a group of persons can prohibit, or use the provision and prohibit speech. 
    How does a group of persons do that? 
    Is it one individual wants to hear a message, the other does not? 
    What happens if--

    Mr. Jay A. Sekulow 
    And at some point that crosses the line from speech to harassment. 
    We've looked at that issue. 
    Is there a way to prohibit one-on-one persistent speech on a public forum? 
    I have trouble with that, because I think it leads to a dangerous provision, but if there was harassment, you had... we have the case in the Second Circuit involving Ms. Onassis, and there the court said that a zone was appropriate.

speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="916.122" stopTime="921.468">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    But I don't think this injunction prohibits the speech. 
    It just requires the speaker to stay 15 feet away, which is prohibiting following.

    Mr. Jay A. Sekulow 
    --No, I think not, Justice Stevens, with respect, for two reasons. 
    Number 1... and I want to draw an analysis, if I could. 
    In NAACP v. Claiborne Hardware, one of the most effective tools for the civil rights protestors was the stationing of sidewalk-based store watchers. 
    They were sometimes called deacons, sometimes called black hats. 
    And the Court acknowledged... this Court acknowledged that, as the lower courts found, that the volition of many black citizens were just overcome by sheer fear because the presence of these black hats was so strong and it was intimidating, but the Court still said that that was protected speech, and the fact that here the speech is vigorous, and it's about an issue that is part of a debate, doesn't entitle it to less constitutional protection, or alternatively protecting platitude.

    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    I still don't understand, what is the word, or the idea, or the expression that one could make if you're within a 15-foot radius that you couldn't communicate being the distance, a little bit less than the distance that we are now. 
    Is there some word, or expression, or thought, or idea, or view that is only communicable when I'm closer to you than I am at this moment, and if so, what is it?
speaker="jay_alan_sekulow" startTime="993.363" stopTime="1013.439">
    Mr. Jay A. Sekulow 
    I think, Justice Breyer, all of the above. 
    I think someone that is on the streets of New York that wants to talk to a woman who is about to engage in an abortion procedure, or for that matter a salesman who does business with this abortion facility, wants to communicate a message one-on-one, maybe wanting to share, as the records happen in this case, a Bible verse. 
    It's hard to show someone a Bible 15 feet away.

    Mr. Jay A. Sekulow 
    Actually, there's no demonstration allowed within the 15-foot zones at all. 
    The only carve-out is the sidewalk counseling, which is the distribution of literature, according to the lower court, to dissuade someone from not having an abortion based on a particular statement, and then, of course, the cease-and-desist language comes in. 
    But if someone were simply holding a sign, or handing a religious tract, or simply trying to show a Bible to someone, they cannot do it, and in the decorum of this courtroom, it's quite easy for you and I to communicate.

    Mr. Jay A. Sekulow 
    I think, though, the way to... if someone pushes, if someone grabs, if someone crowds so that someone can't move forward, there's provisions of the injunction that cover that, and they should be prosecuted for contempt.

    No, but isn't the answer to that, Mr. Sekulow, that the closer they are, given the history, the more likely there are going to be incidents of pushing and shoving, and you can't as a practical matter, simply as a court, prosecute 100 contempts a day under these orders, so the idea, to have something... you're making a practicality argument. 
    I think the court is making a practicality argument. 
    The court is saying, let's have some kind of a zone which isn't going to cut off speech entirely, but which is going to reduce the probability that we are going to have a multiplicity of contempt actions every time somebody walks into an abortion clinic.

    The answer, yes. 
    We're not challenging the issuance of the injunction. 
    However, does that mean that demonstrations, the holding of a sign, the wearing of a button within 15 foot, 15 feet of an individual, any person seeking access, is constitutional, and we think not. 
    It has to burden more speech than necessary.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="1401.682" stopTime="1454.536">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Mr. Sekulow, what was... what is the meaning of something that the Government emphasizes in its brief, the provision that if the court concludes that some of the relief requested by the plaintiff should be granted, that the defendants will consent to the entry of an injunction against each and every one of them, and the Government tells us that the defendants thus stipulated below that any unlawful conduct found to have been performed by any of them could be attributed to all of them for purposes of the preliminary injunction. 
    So that sounds like if you did have some people crowding, pushing, needing this kind of keep-your-distance rule, that that same rule could apply to all of the people.
speaker="jay_alan_sekulow" startTime="1454.536" stopTime="1484.956">
    Mr. Jay A. Sekulow 
    There was a concession, Justice Ginsburg, in the district court regarding the nature of the evidence, and it simplified in a pretty real way, and a not necessarily beneficial one, it simplified the evidence that was presented. 
    It does not change the nature of what's being challenged here, though. 
    We're not saying that an injunction should not be issued. 
    We're not saying it applies to one person and not the other. 
    We're saying that any demonstrator is prohibited from demonstrating within a 15-foot zone and a floating zone that goes without geographic limitation whatsoever. 
    No geographic limitation of this zone. 
    It just floats, and we think that burdens more speech than necessary, and--
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="1484.956" stopTime="1492.040">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Did you ask to have that clarified, because wasn't there a point where the district judge said, gee, that's not what I meant.

    Mr. Jay A. Sekulow 
    --I found that... we found that fascinating, too. 
    The Court said, my gosh, it would be impractical. 
    In fact, it says... it goes further. 
    He said, no one would know how to comply with the floating zone, but then he acknowledges it's floating, and the Second Circuit acknowledges it's floating, so maybe the judge at the district court level forgot what he meant, I don't know, but it burdens more speech than necessary because it does exactly what the judge was concerned about.

    Ms. Lucinda M. Finley 
    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    I think we cannot lose sight of the record and the evidence in this case. 
    We have here an unrelenting campaign by defendants of illegal and tortious harassment, intimidation, obstruction, and trespass at health care facilities. 
    We have to keep that in mind as well. 
    The activity that the district court found occurred repeatedly is antithetical to the need of surgical facilities and hospitals for quiet and calm. 
    The idea of quiet zones and buffer zones around hospitals is a well established traditional principle in law, and all we're trying to do here is make sure such a zone pertains outside these surgical facilities.

    --The preliminary injunction allows sidewalk counselors to come right up to people, which is far more accommodating of defendants' free speech rights than the buffer zone affirmed by this Court in Madsen and by the buffer zone around polling places affirmed by this Court in Burson v. Freeman. 
    The injunction here gives far more leeway to defendants than buffer zones previously upheld by this Court, despite their record of dangerous, medically risky, intimidating and harassing activity. 
    I think we need to focus on... yes, from 15 feet away they can, in fact, communicate. 
    As Justice Breyer pointed out, we are approximately 15 feet away now, and he--

    In fact, the record shows most of the time when people are trying to get in it's about 7:00 in the morning, and there isn't much traffic on the streets at 7:00 in the morning. 
    The record also shows that the greatest amount of noise being created is by the defendants themselves. 
    If occasionally other people lose their cool and shout back, that's to be expected and understood in this kind of volatile situation. 
    The district court found that it's the persistent face-to-face harangue by the defendants that often triggers other people into starting to yell back. 
    It's the defendants' conduct who initiates all of this noise and cacophony outside of surgical facilities, and that is what the district court found.

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well, Ms. Finley, are you suggesting that there's some special rule for abortion clinics that wouldn't apply in other cases where people are being perhaps harassed or counseled or argued with?
speaker="lucinda_m_finley" startTime="1701.809" stopTime="1703.361">
    Ms. Lucinda M. Finley 
    No, not at all, of course--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1703.361" stopTime="1704.932">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Certainly Madsen doesn't say that.
speaker="lucinda_m_finley" startTime="1704.932" stopTime="1705.773">
    Ms. Lucinda M. Finley 
    --No, it does not.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1705.773" stopTime="1708.715">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Then why do you keep stressing the quiet zone outside the abortion--
speaker="lucinda_m_finley" startTime="1708.715" stopTime="1755.625">
    Ms. Lucinda M. Finley 
    Because Madsen did recognize that the governmental interest ensuring... in ensuring safe conditions for health care is a compelling interest, and I think we must keep in mind that that interest is very present in this case. 
    So I think there are a different calculus of governmental interests that are involved when protest is occurring outside hospitals and surgical facilities, as this Court recognized in the labor cases, NLRB v. Baptist Hospital and Beth Israel Hospital, so sometimes what might be a no more burdensome provision than necessary at a hospital, it may be different from what is no more burdensome than necessary at another sort of facility that doesn't have the same need for people being able to get in without being in stressed-out hysterics.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="1755.625" stopTime="1766.190">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor

speaker="lucinda_m_finley" startTime="1766.190" stopTime="1775.386">
    Ms. Lucinda M. Finley 
    Well, of course, to get a preliminary injunction anyone has to show a likelihood of success on the merits of some valid cause of action. 
    That's--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="1775.386" stopTime="1777.159">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Okay, and what is it here that you rely on?
speaker="lucinda_m_finley" startTime="1777.159" stopTime="1782.933">
    Ms. Lucinda M. Finley 
    --Our causes of action... well, the district court found that in addition to the Federal civil rights claim that the--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="1782.933" stopTime="1789.688">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    I thought that claim under section 1985(3) was dismissed here.
speaker="lucinda_m_finley" startTime="1789.688" stopTime="1807.628">
    Ms. Lucinda M. Finley 
    --Dismissed, and subsequently the complaint was amended and it was reasserted, but the district court also found that the State law causes of action for trespass, which under New York law broadly protects people's use and enjoyment of their property rights, and the causes of action under New York State law for harassing people for exercising their right--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="1807.628" stopTime="1816.704">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Could there be trespass on a public street or sidewalk, or would that just apply to the property of the clinic?
speaker="lucinda_m_finley" startTime="1816.704" stopTime="1857.152">
    Ms. Lucinda M. Finley 
    --In... under New York law, trespass is not simply the physical invasion of a line-demarcated private property. 
    It also includes interference with the fair and unfettered use and quiet enjoyment of your property. 
    We also have State law claims in the case for intentional interference with business relations, infliction of emotional distress. 
    Our State law causes of action are virtually identical to the State law causes of action involved in Madsen. 
    But this issue of whether the State law claims in this case still warrant relief has never been raised by the petitioners in the lower court, which I think is the forum that should first be given the chance to look at the remaining causes of action in light of the evidence.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="1857.152" stopTime="1865.547">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Did Madsen state that the consent requirement alone invalidated the no-approach provision in that case?
speaker="lucinda_m_finley" startTime="1865.547" stopTime="1869.050">
    Ms. Lucinda M. Finley 
    That is, I believe, an accurate quotation from Madsen, yes, Justice--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="1869.050" stopTime="1871.461">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    So are you asking that we ignore that here?
speaker="lucinda_m_finley" startTime="1871.461" stopTime="1909.805">
    Ms. Lucinda M. Finley 
    --No. 
    We do not have a no-approach-without-consent provision in this injunction. 
    The cease-and-desist provision is substantially different. 
    The cease-and-desist provision specifically allows all uninvited approaches without consent. 
    It specifically allows the very thing the Madsen no approach zone did not allow. 
    There's a substantial difference under First Amendment law between not letting someone try to go up to somebody versus saying you have to respect that other person's right to refuse you. 
    This Court has repeatedly emphasized that the right to refuse a messenger, and the right to make your own choices about what you do and do not listen to--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="1909.805" stopTime="1943.927">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    But the reason... the reason we struck down the uninvited approach provision in Madsen is as follows, quoting from Boos v. Barry: As a general matter, we have indicated that in public debate our own citizens must tolerate insulting and even outrageous speech in order to provide adequate breathing space to the freedoms protected by the First Amendment. 
    Now, if you apply that same statement to... to what... unwanted speech just as we applied it to uninvited speech, it seems to me you get the same result.

    Ms. Lucinda M. Finley

    Would you name it again?
speaker="lucinda_m_finley" startTime="2012.114" stopTime="2041.143">
    Ms. Lucinda M. Finley 
    It's called social impact theory, a scholar named Edward Hall developed it in the fifties, and there's been an extensive body of research in the fields of psychology, medicine, and anthropology that have further studied it. 
    It's the idea, the basic idea that there is a zone of personal space, and it varies according to the nature of the encounter. 
    For example, the appropriate zone of personal space here for this sort of encounter is about 15 feet.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="2041.143" stopTime="2053.531">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    But I thought we had to... the Court had to find some violation of statutory or common law to justify a preliminary injunction.
speaker="lucinda_m_finley" startTime="2053.531" stopTime="2057.362">
    Ms. Lucinda M. Finley 
    And it did. 
    It found a likelihood of success on the merits.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="2057.362" stopTime="2066.128">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    So I don't know what this argument does to bolster that. 
    I mean, it's not a theory of a violation of law.
speaker="lucinda_m_finley" startTime="2066.128" stopTime="2087.433">
    Ms. Lucinda M. Finley 
    No. 
    I think the relevance as I was responding to Justice Scalia's question, which I understood to be is there... what is the problem with having somebody force their physical proximity on you, so I was highlighting that particularly when people are going in for medical care, that is a... it escalates the health risks, which is a factor, of course, for injunctive relief.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="2087.433" stopTime="2093.507">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor

    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    I did.
speaker="lucinda_m_finley" startTime="2098.322" stopTime="2113.581">
    Ms. Lucinda M. Finley 
    Certainly I misspoke if I did. 
    No, that is not my position. 
    My position is that to get a preliminary injunction you have to show likelihood of success on the merits of a valid cause of action, irreparable injury, no adequate remedy at law, which the district court found that we in fact did, amply.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="2113.581" stopTime="2135.886">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Do I understand, Ms. Finley, that that is still something that's open to inspection by the district judge? 
    We did start out with a 1985(3) claim that the district judge erroneously thought was solid. 
    Then he said, but there are these State claims that can be substituted for it, and the Second Circuit refused... did not deal with that.
speaker="lucinda_m_finley" startTime="2135.886" stopTime="2152.896">
    Ms. Lucinda M. Finley 
    Absolutely yes, Your Honor, it is very much open to the district court. 
    This is a preliminary injunction. 
    Everything is open to the district court. 
    The Second Circuit instructed petitioners and the panel 2 years ago that they should take these arguments to the district court where they belong, and they never have.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="2152.896" stopTime="2161.522">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    So the viability of this whole case under State law has yet to be fully tested in the district court, and it hasn't been touched by the court of appeals.
speaker="lucinda_m_finley" startTime="2161.522" stopTime="2162.633">
    Ms. Lucinda M. Finley 
    That is correct, Your Honor.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="2162.633" stopTime="2170.548">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    But the district judge did make a preliminary finding that you had under New York law a probability of success on the merits.

    Ms. Lucinda M. Finley 
    That is correct, Your Honor, yes.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="2172.711" stopTime="2192.593">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    But even... regarding... you're not contending that the provisions of the injunction do not have to be designed to prevent a violation of the law, as opposed to prevent the kind of emotional upset that your expert testimony related to. 
    You still acknowledge that the provisions of the injunction must be ordinated to preventing a violation of law.
speaker="lucinda_m_finley" startTime="2192.593" stopTime="2204.861">
    Ms. Lucinda M. Finley 
    Yes, of course. 
    The expert testimony documented elevated physical medical risk, which is substantially greater than mere emotional upset. 
    I want to move a moment--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="2204.861" stopTime="2208.344">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    I don't understand that. 
    Does that have anything to do with whether State law is being violated?

    Ms. Lucinda M. Finley 
    --No. 
    Your Honor. 
    No. 
    Well, it may. 
    We've never yet tested in the district court the State law claims for tortious harassment, for example, and whether someone is being put under medically dangerous physical stress may be highly relevant to whether you've made out a claim for harassment. 
    That issue has never yet been tested in the district court. 
    Also, the amount of stress caused, and distress, may be highly relevant to whether we've made out a claim under our State law cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress. 
    In this context of antiabortion protest, there are State law-based decisions finding that conduct very similar to what defendants here do constitutes intentional infliction of emotional distress.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="2252.162" stopTime="2271.593">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    I would say that persons who walk through a picket line in order to work despite a strike face extreme stress. 
    Have we ever in the labor area recognized that stressed individuals is ground for enjoining picketing and labor protest activities?
speaker="lucinda_m_finley" startTime="2271.593" stopTime="2280.650">
    Ms. Lucinda M. Finley 
    In the labor context, many courts have established buffer zones to keep the picketers out of the face of people, particularly when they're picketing at hospitals.

    Violence and intimidation.

speaker="lucinda_m_finley" startTime="2295.550" stopTime="2318.514">
    Ms. Lucinda M. Finley 
    Well, I think that when people are going in for surgery, and there's medical evidence that to safely perform the surgery the stress needs to be reduced, not elevated, that is a governmental interest that is present in this context that is only present in labor contexts when people are picketing at hospitals or nursing homes, and--
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="2318.514" stopTime="2332.135">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    And I submit to you that anybody who walks through a picket line at any facility in order to take a job during the pendency of a strike is subjected to great emotional stress, and our cases have never recognized that as a ground for injunction.
speaker="lucinda_m_finley" startTime="2332.135" stopTime="2349.826">
    Ms. Lucinda M. Finley 
    --Well, Madsen recognized that the elevated medical risks are a governmental interest that needs to be weighed in assessing whether the restrictions on speech are no more burdensome than necessary to protect that governmental interest in ensuring safe conditions for health care.

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    But only in the context of keeping the noise down outside the hospital which could be heard inside. 
    We studiously avoided using that as a basis for validating any of the restrictions imposed outside the facility which could not... with respect to speech that could not be heard inside. 
    Isn't that what we did in Madsen?

    Well, what about a situation such as Justice Kennedy posits, where you walk through a picket line to go to work, and you've got a very important assignment that day, and you feel you're subjected to a great deal of stress, you're not going to be able to do that work.

    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Ms. Finley, why do you lay such stress on this point, when I thought the major reason for the injunction and for its provisions was that there was a history of grabbing, pushing, shoving, and the district judge thought that it was reasonable to have a keep-your-distance rule to make sure that the pushing, grabbing, and shoving didn't go on again? 
    I did not regard whatever you call that expert as central to your case, and perhaps you ought to clarify whether it is an extra, or whether it's pivotal.

    --But wouldn't there be a difference, and isn't this the difficulty in this case, that if there were simply a 15-foot zone around one person, that's fairly easy to administer and to police, but when you've got multiple, intersecting 15-foot zones around a lot of people who may even be subject to argument as even covered by the zone, you've got something which is far more difficult to administer. 
    And I was suggesting a moment ago that... when Mr. Sekulow was arguing that there was a kind of a practicality consideration in having a zone at all, but there's another practicality argument, and that is when the zones are moving and intersecting like this, it may be difficult to enforce with reliable evidence, with reliable proof. 
    And isn't that a good argument for saying, don't have floating zones, have fixed zones. 
    Realize that things are going to be unpleasant outside the fixed zones, they're going to be less unpleasant inside, but everybody will know where the line is, and the First Amendment isn't going to suffer from the uncertainty.

    He allowed them on the same side of the sidewalk, which creates the need to have a clear zone around people.

   Argument of Walter E. Dellinger, III
speaker="walter_e_dellinger_iii" startTime="2733.779" stopTime="2815.412">
    Mr. Walter E. Dellinger, III 
    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    In light of the questions about the practicality of how this injunction works, it might be useful to look at this case from the vantage point of the trial judge in February of 1992. 
    At that point, he had had several days of hearings on the preliminary injunction and weeks of testimony on the contempt proceedings against Paul and Robert Schenck and others who violated the temporary restraining order. 
    One of his findings, and they're set out at pages 79 to 149 of the Joint Appendix, one of his findings was that these named defendants had deliberately engaged in a technique of physically crowding in an intimidating and obstructing manner. 
    What's a trial judge supposed to do in the face of that kind of finding? 
    If he were to issue an injunction precisely in those terms ordering the defendants to cease crowding in an intimidating and obstructing manner, what problems would that cause for a police officer who is at the scene, trying to understand how to enforce that?
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="2815.412" stopTime="2833.664">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    Well, one of the things he's supposed to do is read the First Amendment, I take it, and what he's doing here is, he's prohibiting certain conduct based on speech, and that means that the injunction must be precisely tailored. 
    It's not just to eliminate harassment.
speaker="walter_e_dellinger_iii" startTime="2833.664" stopTime="2834.973">
    Mr. Walter E. Dellinger, III 
    I'm--
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="2834.973" stopTime="2860.492">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    This injunction goes much further than that, and if you want to defend it as saying that everything here is necessary to avoid the touching, grabbing aspect, that's one thing, but the harassment rationale as I see it goes much further. 
    It protects people against repeated, very annoying, very stressful expression of views by those who differ with them--
speaker="walter_e_dellinger_iii" startTime="2860.492" stopTime="2862.252">
    Mr. Walter E. Dellinger, III 
    --Justice Kennedy, I--
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="2862.252" stopTime="2864.363">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    --and that's a very difficult First Amendment case.
speaker="walter_e_dellinger_iii" startTime="2864.363" stopTime="2916.817">
    Mr. Walter E. Dellinger, III 
    --I believe that it is not difficult because the trial judge did tailor this to burden no more speech than necessary by making it clear that this message, or messages could continue to be conveyed. 
    There's no speech that is silenced by this injunction. 
    I think the judge understood that the message that someone is about to commit a deeply immoral act is disturbing and upsetting, but that's the price of the First Amendment. 
    One of our citizens has a constitutional right to convey that message to another, but in this case to avoid a different kind of problem, not the message, but two aspects of the crowding that are not related to the message are at issue here.

    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    In--
speaker="walter_e_dellinger_iii" startTime="2918.639" stopTime="2943.804">
    Mr. Walter E. Dellinger, III 
    Justice Breyer, if you wish... well, in further response to Justice Kennedy, one of those issues is the sheer effect of the crowding itself, that is, the use of what were called constructive blockades by having 4, 6, 10 people literally crowd around a patient as she attempted to approach the clinic, and to use that in an intimidating way. 
    The second--

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    --I don't under... why is that a constructive blockade? 
    I... a blockade means preventing somebody from entering. 
    Were these people preventing anyone from entering?

    Mr. Walter E. Dellinger, III 
    --It was a construct--

    They were just annoying the person--

    --No.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="2956.383" stopTime="2958.163">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    --and that's why it was a constructive blockade.
speaker="walter_e_dellinger_iii" startTime="2958.163" stopTime="2962.837">
    Mr. Walter E. Dellinger, III 
    Well, they were not physically barring the people from entering, but--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="2962.837" stopTime="2963.668">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Well then, it's not a blockade--
speaker="walter_e_dellinger_iii" startTime="2963.668" stopTime="2964.819">
    Mr. Walter E. Dellinger, III 
    --Then it's not a blockade.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="2964.819" stopTime="2966.070">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    --constructive or otherwise, it seems to me.
speaker="walter_e_dellinger_iii" startTime="2966.070" stopTime="3000.942">
    Mr. Walter E. Dellinger, III 
    The term, constructive blockade I think came from those who were engaged in them, Justice Scalia, because the use of 4, 6, or 10 people to crowd around an individual and to use that effect... we had testimony, or the plaintiffs had testimony in this case of one of the women who said she felt like she was in the middle of a lynch mob. 
    That is intended to dissuade people from continuing to go, not by appealing to her conscience or her shame or her medical self-interest, but to dissuade her because of running this gauntlet, and if that prevents people--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="3000.942" stopTime="3020.106">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    I see. 
    Are you going to apply that to labor picketing, too? 
    And Claiborne Hardware case, where the Court... this Court struck down a speech-restrictive injunction because the violence that accompanied it was episodic and isolated.

    Mr. Walter E. Dellinger, III

    But I thought there were something like five episodes over 18 months.
speaker="walter_e_dellinger_iii" startTime="3053.837" stopTime="3086.108">
    Mr. Walter E. Dellinger, III 
    --Those were the ones, I think, that were raised in the contempt proceedings. 
    The actual controversy itself, the actual proceedings were continuous and, of course, they were under, as several justices noted, under a TRO, so that, you know, ideally they're... they... there shouldn't have been any. 
    What the judge did in this case, faced with this situation and trying to give some kind of guidance that would be useful to the parties, to the police, is to set what Justice Ginsburg called a keep-your-distance rule. 
    Basically--
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="3086.108" stopTime="3113.415">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    In answer to Justice Kennedy and Justice O'Connor, and I wonder, I'm just asking this, is it relevant to consider this is not labor picketing or civil rights picketing because the people by and large are pregnant women who are undergoing a serious medical procedure. 
    You haven't brought that up, and I wonder the extent to which that is constitutionally relevant. 
    I would think it might be.
speaker="walter_e_dellinger_iii" startTime="3113.415" stopTime="3143.737">
    Mr. Walter E. Dellinger, III 
    --I do think it is relevant in precisely this way. 
    The Court's decisions, like Grayned v. City of Rockford, about a public school, NLRB v. Baptist Hospital, cases like that, note that the Government interest is sometimes dependent upon the nature of the activities that are to occur. 
    You don't need social science... you don't need social science evidence to reach the conclusion that having to go through this kind of obstructive and intimidating crowding is not good for people who are on their way to see the doctor.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="3143.737" stopTime="3153.862">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Is there... well, that's it, on their way to see the doctor. 
    Surely it's not the case that every woman who's going in there is going in to have an abortion. 
    I assume they must visit the clinic at least once beforehand.
speaker="walter_e_dellinger_iii" startTime="3153.862" stopTime="3156.263">
    Mr. Walter E. Dellinger, III 
    There are different--

    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 
    Actually, what General Dellinger was referring to on page 29 says that the scope of the injunction and these injunction floating zones do float without geographic limitation. 
    It says that they are structured to protect the rights of all party and directed to the activities at the site chosen for demonstration. 
    Anyplace these individuals are demonstrating is the site chosen for demonstration. 
    As I understand the Government's argument and the respondents', there is now a medical exception to the First Amendment. 
    This Court in Madsen dealt with evidence that came to the same conclusions regarding increased stress. 
    Despite that increased stress, the no-approach zone was still deemed to burden more speech than necessary. 
    If the owner of Claiborne Hardware had a heart condition, would he now say, get these protesters away from the front of my store because I've got a heart condition that's going to be aggravated when I go in there, and I think the answer has to be no to that, that... the owner of a fur store is aggravated because there's animal rights protesters out there picketing.

    That Xerox salesman... not just the woman seeking abortion... that Xerox salesman has the advantage of this injunction.

    Mr. Jay A. Sekulow

    But this injunction on the cease-and-desist provision on paragraph 1(c) says that it can be imposed by any person or any group of persons, so a group of persons are entering the abortion facility, the woman seeking the abortion wants to get the information, wants to talk to the sidewalk counselor, but the companion says no. 
    Under this injunction, under section (c), 1(c), the cease-and-desist provision is implicated. 
    That's the way it's drafted. 
    That burdens more speech than necessary. 
    The citation, and it's consistent in the briefs, we think it just misses the mark, and that is the Beth Israel Hospital v. NRLB did not say you can't distribute literature inside a hospital.
