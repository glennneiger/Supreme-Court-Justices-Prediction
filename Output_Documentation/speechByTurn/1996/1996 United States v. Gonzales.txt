    Mr. Miguel A. Estrada 
    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    Section 924(c)(1) of title 18 provides for mandatory jail sentences for persons who use or carry a firearm during the commission of certain offenses. 
    The Tenth Circuit in this case held that a sentence imposed under section 924(c) by a Federal district court may be made to run concurrently with a State sentence that the defendant is already serving. 
    In our view, that is wrong for three reasons. 
    First and foremost, the language of the statute expressly forbids the imposition of a concurrent sentence. 
    Second, we think the court of appeals was wrong to imply a presumption that that prohibition refers solely to previously imposed Federal sentences, and finally, we think the Tenth Circuit was wrong to rely on a passage from the 1984 Senate committee report that accompanied the 1984 amendments to section 924(c).

    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Mr. Estrada, do you take the position that section 924(c) requires the separate sentence given for that violation to run before any other sentence, or could it be required after any other sentence? 
    Just, what the statute refers to is running sentences concurrently, so is it okay to order its service after the expiration of a State court penalty?
speaker="miguel_a_estrada" startTime="107.490" stopTime="120.320">
    Mr. Miguel A. Estrada 
    Yes, Justice O'Connor, but let me back up. 
    Under the sentencing statutes that we have, how the sentence is administered is usually up to the Bureau of Prisons.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="120.320" stopTime="123.853">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    And you don't take the position that it has to always be first?
speaker="miguel_a_estrada" startTime="123.853" stopTime="129.797">
    Mr. Miguel A. Estrada 
    No, and in many circumstances it will not be able to be first.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="129.797" stopTime="130.765">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    Right. 
    Okay.
speaker="miguel_a_estrada" startTime="130.765" stopTime="208.578">
    Mr. Miguel A. Estrada 
    In this case, for example, in order to give effect to both the statutory authority to make the drug sentences concurrent with the State terms and to the statutory mandate that the 924 sentence be consecutive, the Bureau of Prisons would have to run the Federal drug sentence first, concurrent with the State sentence, and to run the 924(c) sentence last, consecutive to both State and Federal sentences. 
    There was an assumption in the court of appeals view that that would not be so because it gave what we think was inordinate weight to its view of the Senate committee report, but that is, in fact, an error. 
    As a matter of the administration of the sentence, under section 3584(c), I believe, the Bureau of Prisons would treat the entire term imposed by the Federal court as a single administrative term that has several parts, and the part that would correspond to the Federal drug sentences in this case would be ordered... would be served concurrently with the existing State sentences. 
    The part that corresponds to section 924(c), as required by the plain language of the statute, would be made consecutive both to Federal sentences and to the State sentences that are already being served.

    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    Do the States have to go along with that? 
    I suppose this can get very complicated as to which is first. 
    In the... Number 1, can the Bureau of Prisons tell the States when their sentence is going to run in relation to the Federal sentence?
speaker="miguel_a_estrada" startTime="221.746" stopTime="222.597">
    Mr. Miguel A. Estrada 
    No.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="222.597" stopTime="224.927">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    Or is there some control on that discretion?
speaker="miguel_a_estrada" startTime="224.927" stopTime="240.728">
    Mr. Miguel A. Estrada 
    The State sentence is independent. 
    Section 924(c), like all Federal sentencing statutes, in our view speaks solely to a Federal question, how a Federal court imposing a Federal sentence for a Federal crime, may order the calculation of the Federal sentence.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="240.728" stopTime="261.291">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    My question was, does the Bureau of Prisons have discretion to say in a particular case to the State, we're going to allow all the Federal sentences to run first, and then you can do whatever you want, or, we're going to require that part of our sentence be served, then part of your sentence served, then the remaining part of ours, or can... is there... does... is there some supremacy principle where the Federal Government can direct this if the States object?
speaker="miguel_a_estrada" startTime="261.291" stopTime="299.788">
    Mr. Miguel A. Estrada 
    Not in those terms, Justice Kennedy. 
    There is a case from this Court, Punsey v. Fessendon, which is at 258 U.S. 254, which encompasses a principle of primary jurisdiction, which is that each of the two sovereigns, State and Federal, may lend someone to the other Government so he may be tried, yet choose not to relinquish him for the service of the other sovereign sentence until they choose to, but under the statutes that we have, we would not take the view that we can break up a term of imprisonment and to tell the States how to do anything.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="299.788" stopTime="336.750">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Mr. Estrada, I can agree with your... with the Government's position that the statute as written does not compel the States to make their sentences nonconcurrent, but why is it not the case that, after you've had the Federal sentence imposed and then a State sentence is imposed and the State says, well, we're not bound by this Federal statute, we will have this run concurrently with the Federal sentence, why does not the Federal sentence at that point become in violation of the statute, because it is now a sentence that is being served concurrently with another sentence.
speaker="miguel_a_estrada" startTime="336.750" stopTime="404.126">
    Mr. Miguel A. Estrada 
    That view might have some weight, Justice Scalia, if all there were to this statute would be the single clause, nor shall any sentence be made. 
    In context, it seems clear to us that the statute speaks to the duty of the Federal sentencing court at the time it imposed the sentences to impose a sentence based on the facts then existing, as is true with Federal sentencing statutes generally. 
    Therefore, given that the Federal court complied with that duty at the time it imposed sentence, any subsequent court that is not bound by that duty would be in no breach and, as a result, it would not be any violation of the statute. 
    Quite simply, if you take the language of the statute that says, notwithstanding any other provision of law the court shall not suspend the sentence or do any of these other things that a sentencing court would do, or, nor shall the sentence be made concurrent, in that context the natural reading is that the statute speaks to the duties of the Federal sentencing court as sentencing statutes usually do at the time sentence is imposed.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="404.126" stopTime="405.616">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    Then everything's going to turn on whose sentence is first. 
    That's right.
speaker="miguel_a_estrada" startTime="405.616" stopTime="406.187">
    Mr. Miguel A. Estrada 
    Excuse me, Justice--
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="406.187" stopTime="428.219">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    Then everything... then the result is simply going to turn on whose sentence is first. 
    If they do a State sentence first, then, in effect, you get the policy carried out when the Federal sentencing follows it. 
    If the Feds sentence first, in effect the State can negate the policy by saying everything we impose is going to run concurrent, including the premium, yes.
speaker="miguel_a_estrada" startTime="428.219" stopTime="478.154">
    Mr. Miguel A. Estrada 
    --There are two answers to that question, Justice Souter. 
    The first one is that the policy of the statute is that the sentence that is imposed under section 924(c) be made consecutive to any other sentence that the defendant might be serving. 
    It is always the case, where a sentence is made consecutive to another sentence, that any number of circumstances, for example, might change the first sentence. 
    All that Congress can do is to say this is what the Federal court may make the sentence at the time of sentencing, and until and unless Congress chooses to go forward and to say that this is a national policy, not of instruction to the Federal courts about how to do their business, but of instruction also to the State courts about how to do theirs, the statute simply doesn't speak to the question.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="478.154" stopTime="499.737">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    So I guess you would say that the State could... let's... it imposes its sentence first. 
    The Federal sentence comes up second, and the sentencing judge says, well, this cannot run concurrent, so it will be consecutive, and then he goes back to the State court and says, in light of, you know, what the Feds have done, please make my State sentence run concurrent with the Federal sentence, and the State says, that's fine.
speaker="miguel_a_estrada" startTime="499.737" stopTime="500.138">
    Mr. Miguel A. Estrada 
    If that is--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="500.138" stopTime="501.760">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    So the State could in effect frustrate this by--
speaker="miguel_a_estrada" startTime="501.760" stopTime="504.821">
    Mr. Miguel A. Estrada 
    --If that is a course that is allowed by State law--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="504.821" stopTime="505.852">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    --By State law it would be all right.
speaker="miguel_a_estrada" startTime="505.852" stopTime="546.377">
    Mr. Miguel A. Estrada 
    --that is absolutely true, Justice Scalia, and the same would be true if he went back to the Governor of the State and told them, I have received an unduly long sentence, would you please exercise your discretion under State law to make my State sentence go away, and to thereby remove the predicate for the consecutive sentence in the Federal court. 
    I'm not saying that that would effectuate the Federal policy to the fullest possible extent that one might take such a policy, but under the terms of this statute as written, it would, because the policy, as we have explained, is one that speaks to the actions of the Federal sentencing court when imposing sentence, and it is that court--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="546.377" stopTime="557.056">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Mr. Estrada, that's certainly a reasonable interpretation, but it's not what the statute says. 
    Do you think... you say that's a literal reading, or are you just making a very sensible construction of the statute?
speaker="miguel_a_estrada" startTime="557.056" stopTime="558.745">
    Mr. Miguel A. Estrada 
    --Oh, I think both, Justice Stevens.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="558.745" stopTime="560.698">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Because it says... it's a flat prohibition, as Justice Scalia pointed out.
speaker="miguel_a_estrada" startTime="560.698" stopTime="570.893">
    Mr. Miguel A. Estrada 
    Well, as I indicated to Justice Scalia, Justice Stevens, it is our view, and we think it's right--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="570.893" stopTime="571.735">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    That it should be read that way.
speaker="miguel_a_estrada" startTime="571.735" stopTime="607.318">
    Mr. Miguel A. Estrada 
    --No. 
    It is our view that, as the Court has always stated, the clarity of the language turns on context, and if all we had to go to... through were a Federal statute that says, anyone who has been sentenced for a firearms charge shall never have a concurrent sentence, and there was nothing else to the statute, that might give rise to the issue of whether that binds the State courts as well. 
    In the context of a statute that first defines a crime and then makes a direction to the court not to suspend the sentence or to impose a concurrent sentence--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="607.318" stopTime="634.446">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    It doesn't say that. 
    If it said, nor shall a concurrent sentence be imposed... it uses... almost goes out of its way to use different language. 
    It says, nor shall the term of imprisonment imposed under this subsection run concurrently with any other term of imprisonment, and so as soon as the State decides later to have a concurrent State sentence, this term, the term imposed under this section, will begin to run concurrently with the State sentence. 
    I mean, literally, it--
speaker="miguel_a_estrada" startTime="634.446" stopTime="653.637">
    Mr. Miguel A. Estrada 
    --I have two answers to your question, Justice Scalia. 
    The first one is that I agree with your reading in isolation. 
    As I pointed out, that reading would ignore what comes earlier in the statute, which gives context to what the subject for who may not impose may be. 
    The second answer is that, as we--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="653.637" stopTime="660.694">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    --Before you go to the second, and I want you to get there, what is it earlier in the statute that's inconsistent with that sentence? 
    That's what I didn't quite follow.
speaker="miguel_a_estrada" startTime="660.694" stopTime="672.100">
    Mr. Miguel A. Estrada 
    --Well, there are two things, Justice Stevens. 
    In the first place, it is a definition of a Federal offense, which is something that normally gives rise to Federal sentencings, and second is--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="672.100" stopTime="677.704">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Yes, but that doesn't cut any ice, because this last sentence clearly contemplates, not concurrent with State or Federal sentences.
speaker="miguel_a_estrada" startTime="677.704" stopTime="683.668">
    Mr. Miguel A. Estrada 
    --Well, that's right as an instructions to the Federal court as to what they may order.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="683.668" stopTime="684.298">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Right.
speaker="miguel_a_estrada" startTime="684.298" stopTime="686.610">
    Mr. Miguel A. Estrada 
    It doesn't really speak to the State courts as to what--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="686.610" stopTime="693.585">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Well, and then the first part of the sentence it says, we're just talking about a sentence for Federal crimes. 
    That doesn't undermine the literal reading of the last sentence.
speaker="miguel_a_estrada" startTime="693.585" stopTime="696.946">
    Mr. Miguel A. Estrada 
    --No, but the... let me make two further points.

    Yes.

    --that preceded it.
speaker="miguel_a_estrada" startTime="711.107" stopTime="711.996">

    Yes.
speaker="miguel_a_estrada" startTime="712.277" stopTime="734.632">
    Mr. Miguel A. Estrada 
    --which is that the language that Justice Scalia read in isolation, which we concede would bear that reading, doesn't really have a subject, and it is part of a sentence that starts with, the court shall not, and in our view in that context it is most reasonable to read the court as the Federal court, as the subject that--

speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="737.214" stopTime="743.976">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer

speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="746.600" stopTime="751.732">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    And so I take it your point is, like all other sentencing statutes this is meant to talk about the obligation of the judge.

    But this one is phrased that way. 
    But that cuts the other way because the first part of the sentence talks about what the court may do--

    Just one at a time.

    Mr. Miguel A. Estrada 
    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 
    [Laughter] 
    I think I've made my first point, which is in essence that you have to infer a subject for the clause in the passive voice and that, given that the very same sentence starts with a clause in the active voice the more reasonable reading, even if it would bear another, is that the subject is that of the Federal court. 
    I would like to have a--

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    What principle says that you must infer a subject for a sentence in the passive voice?

    --Well--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="792.299" stopTime="799.784">
    Justice Antonin Scalia

    If it's in the passive voice it simply means the term of imprisonment imposed shall not run concurrently.

    Mr. Miguel A. Estrada 
    --Well--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="800.192" stopTime="801.063">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    You don't need a subject for it.
speaker="miguel_a_estrada" startTime="801.063" stopTime="852.789">
    Mr. Miguel A. Estrada 
    --This case... excuse me. 
    This Court has had cases in which similar grammatical difficulties have been present, Justice Scalia. 
    In the Wilson case, I think, which is cited in our brief and which also deals with how Federal sentences are administered, the Court had before it a statute that also was written in the passive voice and the question then was, does this give a right or a duty to the sentencing court or to the BOP, and the Court went into the context of the statute and to some extent into the history to conclude that it did not give any rights or duties to the sentencing courts, but it confided the duties to be carried out under the statute to the Bureau of Prisons alone, and I think that that's not an unusual act of statutory interpretation. 
    I don't want to let go of the second point--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="852.789" stopTime="857.942">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    You still have the second point.

    Some grammarians might disagree.

    Mr. Miguel A. Estrada 
    --Well, and I think... and I really will concede, Justice Stevens, that if all I had were an independent freestanding sentence that began with the term of imprisonment, this might raise a different question. 
    To just touch upon our... or, our second point is that to the extent the language would bear another reading, and to the extent that you might read the language in isolation as speaking to the duties of State courts imposing sentences under State law, there is a section that is also part of the Gun Control Act, section 927, which is quoted in our brief, in our reply brief in one of the footnotes, which indicates that it was not... in footnote 7 at page 10... which indicates that it was not, in fact, Congress' intention to occupy the field of sentencing for these offenses, and that they did not intend to divest the State courts of the authority that they would ordinarily have.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="927.005" stopTime="967.934">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    It seems to me that your argument here is really being generous to the defendant. 
    Even if you conceded the point that Justice Stevens and I have been pressing, you would not have to concede the point that therefore the statute does... therefore the statute does not take into account State sentences. 
    All you would have to concede is that the Federal... or that the statute controls State courts. 
    All you would have to concede is that the statute continues to control only Federal sentencing, but when the Federal sentencing has been made by a State courts action to run concurrently with the State sentence, the Federal sentence must be altered to be... you know, to run sequentially, or, in other words, the sentence that's imposed has to be conditional.
speaker="miguel_a_estrada" startTime="967.934" stopTime="986.177">
    Mr. Miguel A. Estrada 
    I agree that it is not a necessary component of our case that we show the premise of the question to be wrong, Justice Scalia. 
    I think in a spirit of candor we can tell you that we have never read the statute in that way, and we have no intention of applying it that way.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="986.177" stopTime="1009.240">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Mr. Estrada, do you know of any Federal criminal sentencing statute that controls State courts without saying so? 
    To affect the State's criminal process one would expect Congress at least to speak with a clear voice that it is attempting to control what the State does.
speaker="miguel_a_estrada" startTime="1009.240" stopTime="1084.338">
    Mr. Miguel A. Estrada 
    I think that you are right, Justice Ginsburg, in that to the extent Congress ever tries to control the processes of State courts applying State law and tell them what to do, that fairly interesting and maybe difficult federalism issues would come up that may call that as one of the principles. 
    One of the interesting facets of this case is that there is a general statute that governs whether Federal courts may impose sentences that are concurrent or consecutive, section 3584, which is quoted both in our opening brief and in our reply brief. 
    In our reply brief I believe the pertinent part is quoted at page 4, footnote 2. 
    That is the general residual Federal statute that deals with the question whether a Federal court may impose a concurrent sentence or a consecutive sentence, and the statute that respondents urge should be applied to them here. 
    Now, the interesting thing about that statute is that even though it authorizes a concurrent term of imprisonment, it doesn't speak to State terms of imprisonment at all, so that if one were to take the rule of construction being urged for here, the logical consequence would be that there is no statutory authority for the imposition of a concurrent term of imprisonment.

    Yes. 
    I guess on that the hardest point is that the State sentence involved an additional year actually served as a mandatory additional year under State law for the very possession of the firearm that is also the subject of the extra 5 years under Federal law, and I suppose that, if you apply the extra 5 years under Federal law into Federal cases, that will never arise. 
    It would never happen that the extra 5 years would be imposed consecutively to an additional sentence that had as its base solely the possession of that very gun--

    Mr. Miguel A. Estrada 
    Well, no. 
    Let me give you an example. 
    For example, the armed bank robbery statute, 18 U.S.C. 2113, 2113(a), if I recall, defines the crime of bank robbery. 
    2513(d) imposes an additional authorized sentence of 5 years under the bank robbery statute for a bank robbery that is carried out with a weapon.
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="1236.340" stopTime="1248.267">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    So you think that this statute means when a person is accused of that crime through violence... let's say it's an armed bank robbery with a gun... he gets 10 extra years for the gun?
speaker="miguel_a_estrada" startTime="1248.267" stopTime="1283.249">
    Mr. Miguel A. Estrada 
    Justice Breyer, the issue that you just posed was one of the questions that the Court had before it in the Busic case. 
    The Court in that case took the view that I gather you would instinctively take of how that case should turn out. 
    In 1984 Congress turned around and said no, we didn't mean that, and overruled in effect for future cases the outcome in Busic and as a result of that change the statute now reads that the mandatory 5-year sentence may apply to any offense, including one that has an enhancement for a firearm.
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="1283.249" stopTime="1286.902">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    Including the firearm. 
    Not may, but must, you mean?
speaker="miguel_a_estrada" startTime="1286.902" stopTime="1307.185">
    Mr. Miguel A. Estrada 
    Mm-hmm. 
    That is right, and it's very plain from the legislative history that accompanied the 1984 amendments that Congress was unhappy with the outcome in Busic and changed the statute just to make that possible.
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="1307.185" stopTime="1307.925">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    Thank you.

    Mr. Miguel A. Estrada 
    And the relevant language that does that is at the top of page 2 in our brief, where Congress added a parenthetical that reads, including a crime of violence or drug trafficking crimes which provides for an enhanced punishment if committed by the use of a deadly or dangerous weapon or device.
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="1327.698" stopTime="1334.431">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer

speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="1341.997" stopTime="1394.091">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    Mr. Estrada, you answered some of the questions from Justice Scalia or Justice Stevens about the scope of the nor shall clause by saying it occurs in a sentence which is addressed to Federal sentences, and that provides the context. 
    Why should we confine our contextual reference to sentences? 
    Why don't we approach this case with a... sort of a section-based contextualism, and the principle address of the section, I suppose, is to Federal sentencing and the relationships of Federal sentences, so if we're going to look at context, why don't we look at it more broadly than you would and find that a reason not to apply the any sentence reference to State sentences?
speaker="miguel_a_estrada" startTime="1394.091" stopTime="1431.935">
    Mr. Miguel A. Estrada 
    You see, I think, Justice Souter, that I do not disagree with your statement up to the very last clause, which is that it is true that this is a statute that applies only to Federal sentencings, but one of the things it does is to instruct a Federal court as to how the sentence should be imposed and, by extension, the Federal Bureau of Prisons as to how the sentence should be administered, and it is to them that the instruction goes, this sentence shall not start before that other sentence has been concluded. 
    It doesn't act on a State court, and it doesn't act on a State sentence. 
    It merely takes--
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="1431.935" stopTime="1433.738">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    No, but your--
speaker="miguel_a_estrada" startTime="1433.738" stopTime="1439.141">
    Mr. Miguel A. Estrada 
    --takes that as a point of reference for Federal officials discharging their duties under Federal law.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="1439.141" stopTime="1466.779">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    --Oh, I grant you that, but I thought your answer to the question about the nor shall clause was not that it could not be addressed or effectively be enforced against a State court. 
    That's a separate issue. 
    We'll leave that aside. 
    Your answer was in the context we can infer that it's not being addressed, and don't we have sort of no more or less ambiguity when we get to the reference to any sentence being served?
speaker="miguel_a_estrada" startTime="1466.779" stopTime="1490.873">
    Mr. Miguel A. Estrada 
    Oh, I see. 
    No, for two reasons. 
    The first one is that the first sentence of this very statute uses the expansive language, any crime, and goes on expressly to qualify it by reference to only crimes that are Federal crimes and when the same expansive language, any crime or offense or sentence is used in the first sentence of the statute and does not so--
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="1490.873" stopTime="1491.704">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    Yes, that gives that--
speaker="miguel_a_estrada" startTime="1491.704" stopTime="1541.357">
    Mr. Miguel A. Estrada 
    --restrict it, there is a fair inference that Congress did not mean the qualifications then. 
    The second answer to that is the answer that I started to give to Justice Ginsburg concerning section 3584, which is a residual statute that governs concurrency and consecutivity, and it does not itself make reference to State sentences either. 
    As a historical matter, before the statute was passed in section 19... in 1984, the rule in the Federal courts was that a Federal sentence could not be concurrent with a State sentence, and the legislative history of section 3584 makes clear that one of the things that section... that the residual statute meant to do with unqualified reference to terms of imprisonment that don't mention State law was to allow Federal courts, when otherwise appropriate, to impose a sentence that would be concurrent to a State term.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="1541.357" stopTime="1591.001">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    --Well, I think your answer is a fair answer, but I guess I have one follow-up question to it, and that is, if there is any question about whether your answer is sort of dispositive, isn't it fair to look to the point that was brought out earlier, and that is that on your theory there's sort of a game of chance going on, because if the... in this case, for example, if the State sentence had not been imposed first, the result would be different here, and rather than allow this statute to be administered in a way that is going to turn it into a game of chance, which sentence... depending on which sentencer gets there first, why isn't it more reasonable to interpret it the way the respondents claim?
speaker="miguel_a_estrada" startTime="1591.001" stopTime="1630.575">
    Mr. Miguel A. Estrada 
    Because I think as an empirical matter it will be the case in most of the cases that Congress may have contemplated that the sentences imposed later will correspond to later-occurring crimes, and it's not necessary to think that they crafted the entire sentencing structure of the Federal courts to fit the facts of a dual successive prosecution. 
    But even apart from that, I think that the implicit assumption in the premise is that a statute that requires a consecutive sentence purports to speak to what may happen in the future, and I think that is not empirically founded.

    Mr. Edward O. Bustamante 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    This Court should affirm the Tenth Circuit, because the Government ignores proper methods of statutory construction in this case, and they base their entire argument in this case on the false premise that the any used in 924(c)(1) is capable of only one meaning. 
    That term actually has multiple definitional possibilities, and where there are multiple definitional possibilities, this Court... any practitioner should examine the entire text of the statute and place the word in context with this entire statutory scheme.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1697.671" stopTime="1723.279">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Mr. Bustamante, the Tenth Circuit in its opinion relied on the case of the Church of Holy Trinity v. The United States, which to me has always meant we're going to legislate a little. 
    It means that you can't really get the meaning you want out of the statute. 
    Do you think the court of appeals went that far here, or do you think its interpretation is absolutely defensible just as the statute is written?
speaker="edward_o_bustamante" startTime="1723.279" stopTime="1740.950">
    Mr. Edward O. Bustamante 
    Your Honor, I believe... Mr. Chief Justice, I believe that if the Court examines 924(c)(1) and the language of 924(c)(1) and then looks at the history of 924(c)(1). 
    I think it becomes clear that 924(c)(1) only applies to Federal sentences.

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Mr. Bustamante, what is your response to Mr. Estrada's point about 3584(a)? 
    I mean, I understand that your only concern is your client, but if we agree with you in this case with regard to defendants in general we would be doing them more harm than good, because if this provision doesn't apply to State sentences, I don't see how you can distinguish 3584(a), which also would not apply to State sentences, which would mean that a Federal court could not make a Federal sentence concurrent with a State sentence.
speaker="edward_o_bustamante" startTime="1775.222" stopTime="1784.749">
    Mr. Edward O. Bustamante 
    Justice Scalia, I believe the difference, and I think it's a consistent interpretation, is that if the Court looks at the legislative history of 3584--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="1784.749" stopTime="1789.782">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Oh, you just lost me. 
    Do you have anything about the text that would distinguish the two?

    Mr. Edward O. Bustamante 
    --Not about the text. 
    Your Honor, but I believe that if the Court... I think it's clear from 3584 that a court has discretion under that statute to run sentences concurrently or consecutively, and I think the difference between 3584, other than the legislative history, Your Honor, is that 924(c)(1) does something very different, which is, it takes absolute discretion away from a court, which is a major change, Your Honor, in the history of sentencing. 
    Throughout history, Federal courts, State courts have been given great discretion in running... deciding whether sentences shall run concurrently or consecutively.

    Mr. Edward O. Bustamante 
    Justice Breyer, I believe the odd result in this specific case, and again this case does have unusual facts, because it was a consecutive prosecution, is that because the State sentence occurred first and the Federal sentence occurred second, what in fact occurred in this case is that the... what the Government seeks is a doubling of the sentence based on the same conduct.

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Well, another way to eliminate all the chance, and the Government generously has not asserted this, but it would be quite possible to interpret this to speak only of the Federal courts, but to allow the Federal... to require the Federal sentences to be made consecutive whenever a State court says that the State sentence shall run concurrently. 
    And I guess you could have games being played back and forth, and the State court revises its sentence and the Federal court revises its sentence, but you could eliminate all of that inconsistency by simply saying if a State court after the Federal sentence imposes a concurrent State sentence, the Federal sentence, pursuant to the precise language of this, the term of imprisonment imposed shall not run concurrently with that State sentence, so it thereupon becomes consecutive.

    Your Honor, what could occur in this case and in cases in the future is that... in this case, Your Honor, the sentencing judge did run the underlying offense concurrent to the State sentence. 
    What could occur in this case and other cases, Your Honor, is that you would in fact have the Federal sentence beginning, then the sentence would stop while the State sentence would continue, and then at some point, indeterminate point in the future the Federal 924(c)(1) gun count would begin, and I think that's one of the major problems with the Government's interpretation of--

    Mr. Edward O. Bustamante 
    --I believe the last sentence to that statute states that when a prisoner begins to serve a Federal sentence it shall be considered one aggregate sentence, and what could result in this case and future cases is that there would be a gap, a Federal gap in sentences, and I do not believe that is what Congress intended in 3584 or 924(c)(1), especially when you consider the committee report of 924(c)(1), which states, members of the Court, that in their opinion they are... it is their intent that the 924(c)(1) gun count begin first, and I think if the Court looks at that, that's the only practical way to apply 924(c)(1). 
    924(c)(1) clearly was enacted to take all discretion away from a court. 
    A court... a person convicted of a 924(c)(1) sentence must do prison time. 
    That does not affect the court's discretion at all as to the underlying offense, so it's really impractical--

    38... 3584(a), which you're... says a sentence may be made to run either concurrently or consecutively, and then 924(c) says that in certain circumstances it shall not be made to run concurrently, so you can construe those sections consistently, can you not?

    It says, shall not run concurrently.

    Mr. Edward O. Bustamante 
    --No, Your Honor. 
    I believe 3584, from its legislative history and from the text of the statute, allows a Federal judge to run his sentence either concurrently or consecutively to a State sentence. 
    But I would premise that, Your Honor, by stating that in order for the judge to do that he must first apply a guideline analysis, and if the guidelines state that this sentence shall run concurrent, then the court may consider doing that, and either do an upward or downward departure, depending on what he feels appropriate. 
    If the guideline states that it shall be consecutive, then again the court can do an upward or downward departure depending on what he feels is appropriate. 
    In this case, Your Honor, the problem is, is that there was no guideline analysis that could be done as to this particular sentence.

    Your Honor, I believe in that instance the person...

    I mean, assume that 9... that... I thought the question was, if 3584(a) applies both to State and Federal sentences, which I agree with you, I think it does, and then if the section before us also applies to both State and Federal, as the Government but not you argues, I thought you were saying that that would produce an inconsistency, but I didn't understand the inconsistency so I thought I'd ask you so you could explain.

    I believe what I'm saying, what... I hope what I'm saying is that 3584 clearly from its legislative history can allow the court under a guideline analysis to run a sentence either consecutive or concurrent to a State sentence. 
    924(c)(1) is a much more specific statute, and that analysis, if there's a guideline analysis at all, only requires a Federal sentencing judge to run that sentence consecutive to a Federal sentence.

    Well, the fact that it's much more specific is what is hurting you here, because I think you may be right that there is an incompatibility between 3584(a) and the section at issue here. 
    3584(a) says that the terms may run concurrently or consecutively, and 924(c) says that they may not run concurrently, that they must run consecutively.

    I mean, that's a xx--

    Mr. Edward O. Bustamante 
    Yes, I believe, Justice Scalia, 19... 924(c)(1) and 1994... 84 was amended. 
    I think it was amended in direct response. 
    Your Honor, to The United States v. Busic and United States v. Simpson, and in truth, Your Honor, there was a time when I feared the language of 924(c)(1). 
    I don't any more, because if you look at the legislative history and if you look at the Congress' direct response to the Busic and Simpson cases, I think it's clear that statute was amended only to correct what they felt were improper decisions by the Court in Busic and in Simpson. 
    Your Honor, section 1 of 924(c)(1) deals with what kind of cases shall be prosecuted under this section. 
    Section 2 deals... states they be crimes that are prosecuted in Federal court. 
    Section 3 states how the crime is committed. 
    Section 4 states that notwithstanding any other provision of law, the court may not prorate the sentence, which really states that you have no discretion to suspend this enhanced sentence, and section 5, Your Honor, I think is the section that nails the coffin into Busic and Simpson and says that nor shall this run concurrent with any other sentence, and I think what they're referring to is that they do not want the court to run the gun enhancement concurrent to the underlying offense at that time.

    Gotcha.
speaker="edward_o_bustamante" startTime="2743.295" stopTime="2939.183">
    Mr. Edward O. Bustamante 
    --this run concurrent with any other sentence, Your Honor. 
    I think what they're saying in nailing the coffin in Busic and Simpson is that a Federal judge may not run that sentence concurrent even though he has to impose a prison sentence, nor shall he impose that concurrent to the underlying Federal offense. 
    I think that, Your Honor, clearly lays out why this only applies to Federal sentences. 
    Your Honor, I think other sections of the Comprehensive Control... Comprehensive Crime Control Act confirm that 924(c)(1) only applies to Federal sentences. 
    The Congress also referred to State and Federal laws in 3564(b) and 3624(e). 
    In both those sections, Your Honor, they were contemplating that Federal probation and Federal supervised release could run concurrent to a State sentence, so they are contemplating that State and Federal sentences shall run concurrently, and they are contemplating that these sections are possible they run concurrently, Your Honor. 
    I think that is highly significant, because it goes to Congress' overall sentencing scheme. 
    Your Honor, I believe that the problem with the Government's argument is that they attach a layman's definition to the term, any. 
    They ask for an expansive interpretation of the term, any other. 
    In fact, they have argued the exact opposite in the past. 
    In the Government's reply brief they refer to United States v. Alvarez... the United States v. Alvarez-Sanchez, and in that case the defendant-respondent was seeking a more expansive term of the term, any. 
    The Government... the court, at the Government's urging, asked the court to apply proper methods of statutory construction and to not allow the term, any to have an all-expansive interpretation, and the court in fact did imply... apply proper methods of construction and stated that the term, any in 18 U.S.C. 3501 only applied to Federal law authorities. 
    Your Honor, I think there's other compelling reasons for the Court to reject the Government's argument in this case as erroneous, and the States, Your Honor, in enforcing criminal conduct clearly have primary authority. 
    I think they should also have primary responsibility in prosecuting persons in their State in enforcing local criminal conduct. 
    I think the Government's interpretation in this case directly affects the delicate balance between Federal and States, and absent a clear statement from the Congress, I've asked the Court to reject the Government's argument and not allow the 924(c)(1) or Federal authorities to interfere with the State's authority to enforce local criminal conduct. 
    I think there's two ways, Your Honor--

    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Well, I don't really see how it does affect State law under the Government's argument. 
    Indeed, I suppose there are many situations where there's a Federal offense, not 924 involved, but some Federal offense, and some State court... some State law will mandate that any State sentence for a State offense based on similar conduct has to run consecutively, or not concurrently. 
    I mean, you could have it in reverse, and I don't see that these schemes prohibit that, these Federal laws.
