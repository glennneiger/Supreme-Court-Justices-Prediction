    Mr. Charles R. Ray 
    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    The issue in this case is whether correctional officers who are employed by a private concern, who perform traditional and historical police power functions, and act under the color of law for 1983 purposes, should have the benefit of qualified immunity. 
    Firstly, we would like to put forth the proposition that should this Court extend qualified immunity to correctional officers of this nature, that the floodgates will not open, and qualified immunity will not be willy nilly conferred. 
    Firstly, there are thousands, literally... maybe hundreds of thousands of contractors who contract with the State of Tennessee, but only those who are found to act under the color of State law as defined by this Court's jurisprudence in Jackson v. Metropolitan Edison would be needful of qualified immunity. 
    Secondly, only objectively reasonable actions on the part of these private actors would give rise to qualified immunity. 
    Of course, if their actions are not objectively reasonable under this Court's jurisprudence they would not have the benefit of qualified immunity.

    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Mr. Ray, would you put together the theory and the fact for me, because just looking at what is alleged here, what would... how would it not be clearly established that it's a violation to take someone who was over 300 pounds and put them in these tight restraints that are bound to cause extreme pain? 
    We are talking about qualified immunity and would a reasonable officer understand from the clearly established law that you don't do this. 
    That is my problem with this case.
speaker="charles_r_ray" startTime="182.131" stopTime="185.763">
    Mr. Charles R. Ray 
    Justice Ginsburg, we never got to that point, and that's the issue.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="185.763" stopTime="189.514">

    What would be the defense? 
    What would be the defense for these allegations?
speaker="charles_r_ray" startTime="189.514" stopTime="202.804">
    Mr. Charles R. Ray 
    Well, perhaps under Woods v. Strickland, if Mr. McKnight can establish that the acts of our officers that he alleges were not objectively reasonable, then we don't have benefit of qualified immunity. 
    That is obvious. 
    But the district court--
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="202.804" stopTime="204.534">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Well, maybe it's an academic question, that--

    Mr. Charles R. Ray 
    --Oh, that question is not academic, in that there are literally hundreds of vexatious and frivolous lawsuits filed--

    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg

    Mr. Charles R. Ray 
    --Well, in cases on down the road where their actions were objectively reasonable the litigation--
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="248.935" stopTime="259.661">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    But not cases on down the road. 
    In this case. 
    I mean, we do have to have a live case, or a real case or controversy, so if you prevail, what good would that do to these parties?
speaker="charles_r_ray" startTime="259.661" stopTime="271.428">
    Mr. Charles R. Ray 
    --I would submit, Justice Ginsburg, that this case would still have to be remanded to the district court for that specific finding, that their actions were not objectively reasonable and they don't have the benefit of qualified immunity.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="271.428" stopTime="286.857">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Well, you make the argument for them when you're saying, now I have the benefit of this qualified immunity defense, so, district court, they are qualified immune, and so the district court goes, tell me what wasn't clearly established in relation to these facts.
speaker="charles_r_ray" startTime="286.857" stopTime="303.309">
    Mr. Charles R. Ray 
    Well, the specific issue before this Court is, we didn't get to that point. 
    The district court said, based on the jurisprudence of Manis v. Corrections Corporation of America, established by this Court, you don't have qualified immunity, Mr. Ray. 
    You're out of here. 
    That's what the Sixth Circuit said.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="303.309" stopTime="312.745">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Yes, but I'd just like you to tell me, suppose he had qualified immunity. 
    What could he do with it? 
    He could try to prove his actions were objectively reasonable.
speaker="charles_r_ray" startTime="312.745" stopTime="355.582">
    Mr. Charles R. Ray 
    That's correct, Mr. Chief Justice, and again, we may fail on that issue, Justice Ginsburg, but the issue before this Court and what we want decided is the fact that qualified immunity should be extended to these individuals who act under the color of State law for 1983 purposes, are subjected to suit on a day-by-day basis, and they perform traditional historical police powers that this Court has extended qualified immunity to their public counterparts in Navarette. 
    So we would submit that though we may ultimately not prevail on that question... that question is not before us here... the question is whether we get over the first hurdle, i.e.--
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="355.582" stopTime="362.517">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    The Sixth Circuit suggested that there might be another standard short of qualified immunity and said maybe good faith--
speaker="charles_r_ray" startTime="362.517" stopTime="448.815">
    Mr. Charles R. Ray 
    --The good faith defense. 
    That's correct. 
    But the good faith defense, as you well know, Justice Ginsburg, still allows us to be subjected to the discovery process. 
    To discover the subjective mind set of my clients we go through what may be needless and extended litigation, expensive litigation, whereas if qualified immunity applies, of course, that ends the dispute at that point. 
    So I would submit that the difference between a good faith defense and qualified immunity is quite, quite different, and the benefits that would be conferred not on my two petitioners, but on the citizens of the State of Tennessee, who would not have to bear the burden of litigating what may turn out to be a frivolous and vexatious lawsuit... which again this Court's jurisprudence from Harlow Ford has made it a consideration that the benefit you want to confer is not on the actors, but upon the citizens, who will benefit from not having their officers, who perform a traditional governmental function that utilizes a great deal of discretion, from being impeded, deterred, made timid by threat of litigation, and threatened with litigation. 
    So we would submit that the question here again is whether you confer qualified immunity on officers who historically have and do provide a fundamental governmental function.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="448.815" stopTime="482.468">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    --Mr. Ray, they do historically provide a... provide what was historically a governmental function, but have they historically had such immunity? 
    I mean, we said in our earlier cases that this qualified immunity is a matter... it's not in the statute, but we say that it came along with the history of the statute. 
    That was simply what existed when this statute was passed, and therefore we think it exists today. 
    Now, have you given us any evidence that a private individual not employed by the State has ever been given immunity?
speaker="charles_r_ray" startTime="482.468" stopTime="489.203">
    Mr. Charles R. Ray 
    Justice Scalia, if I could address prison guards historically in the State of Tennessee--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="489.203" stopTime="504.683">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Anybody historically, even if you could come up with a medical officer who was privately contracted for who somehow was given immunity, or a private policeman. 
    Anything. 
    I don't know that you've shown even one example of this historical exception.
speaker="charles_r_ray" startTime="504.683" stopTime="542.268">
    Mr. Charles R. Ray 
    --I would submit that historically the Attorney General of the United States at one time was allowed to have a private law practice, and when acting in his official function for the Government that I'm sure that immunity would attach to him in any official acts. 
    In England, prior to 1871, when this particular statute was promulgated, lawyers were both public prosecutors and private prosecutors, and when they were acting as public prosecutors I would submit that immunity attached to them. 
    Those are the only examples I can suggest, but let me state that--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="542.268" stopTime="543.197">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    It's a good one.
speaker="charles_r_ray" startTime="543.197" stopTime="615.404">
    Mr. Charles R. Ray 
    --Pierson v. Ray, this Court started out talking about a good faith immunity, which ultimately developed over the course of this Court's jurisprudence to the qualified immunity doctrine. 
    Pierson v. Ray dealt with police officers having a good faith defense to malicious prosecution actions. 
    In Tennessee, pursuant to statute TCA 4-3-609, correctional officers have the same core functions, the same grant of power as police officers do. 
    They have the right to bear arms. 
    They have the right to take people into custody, effectuate search and seizures, secure their facility from both outside invaders or quell disturbances inside. 
    So I would submit that Pierson v. Ray... I think it was footnote 7 where Mr. Justice White cited ample precedent that there was a historical basis for police officers having... excuse me. 
    That was Navarette, footnote 7, that correctional officers have qualified immunity. 
    Given the historical basis in Tennessee of there being coextensive powers between police officers and correctional officers, I would submit that the historical basis is there.
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="615.404" stopTime="625.951">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    What about ordinary tort law? 
    That is, a policeman or a correctional officer working for the Government puts shackles on somebody, or hits them or whatever. 
    That's a tort. 
    That's a battery.
speaker="charles_r_ray" startTime="625.951" stopTime="627.423">
    Mr. Charles R. Ray 
    That's correct. 
    Justice Breyer.
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="627.423" stopTime="646.744">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    And there must be their... State officials, some kind of State law tort immunity that gives a degree of leeway to a State officer who commits the battery where he does it in good faith. 
    Is there any case, anywhere in any of these jurisdictions, that tells us in respect to ordinary tort law whether a private correctional official is treated similarly?
speaker="charles_r_ray" startTime="646.744" stopTime="655.901">
    Mr. Charles R. Ray 
    The... if I may answer it this way, Justice Breyer, the public correctional officer, sovereign immunity would suffice there.
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="655.901" stopTime="658.054">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    Not a suit individually against the officer.
speaker="charles_r_ray" startTime="658.054" stopTime="659.683">

    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    You sue the officer individually, there will be some kind of public-based, not immunity, but it will be a defense, and for good faith, et cetera, and I just wonder if there's any case that you've come across... it seems to me by now it should have come across somewhere... ordinary, garden variety tort law.

    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    Now, for the public person, yes. 
    The question is whether for the private person, if it's not available to you and me in our private capacities when we happen to go out as a joke and put shackles on somebody... not much of a joke, but do you see what I'm driving at?
speaker="charles_r_ray" startTime="734.483" stopTime="765.932">
    Mr. Charles R. Ray 
    I see what you're driving at, Justice Breyer, and I still believe that as you've stated your question the good faith defense would be available to that private correctional officer but not in the context of having any sort of immunity. 
    It would just be a common law defense to... I acted in good... just as if a private security guard at Wal-Mart took someone into custody thinking they were a shoplifter and they turned out not to be a shoplifter, then they're subject to malicious prose--
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="765.932" stopTime="790.929">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    I mean, I don't know if you want to comment on this, but where I'm having trouble with this case, and why I find it difficult, is because there are three interrelated things: a) to what extent does the 1983 apply in the first place when the person is private, b) to what extent is there ordinary tort law immunity, same or different from a private person, and 3) how do we fit into those answers this question here about whether there's an immunity? 
    If that's too general and vague for you to--
speaker="charles_r_ray" startTime="790.929" stopTime="791.509">
    Mr. Charles R. Ray 
    --I'll try to address those--
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="791.509" stopTime="792.088">
    Unknown Speaker 
    --That's what's in my mind.
speaker="charles_r_ray" startTime="792.088" stopTime="827.294">
    Mr. Charles R. Ray 
    --Justice Breyer. 
    Number 1 is without question that we act under color of State law and are amenable to suit under 42 U.S. section 1983 because we do perform those core governmental functions that historically and traditionally have been the police powers of the State, so I think it's not questioned by anyone, at least not by us, that we are amenable to suit under 1983. 
    Now then, the second question becomes, what common law immunity do we have as a private person? 
    I would submit that by contract the State of Tennessee denied us sovereign immunity so we are in a different position than our public counterparts, who are correctional officers.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="827.294" stopTime="838.460">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Well, you just say that liability under section 1983 ought to go hand-in-hand with a qualified immunity defense.
speaker="charles_r_ray" startTime="838.460" stopTime="874.672">
    Mr. Charles R. Ray 
    Justice O'Connor, I think that that would be the common-sensical approach, and I recognize that Wyatt v. Cole was out there I think on the cutting edge of 1983 jurisprudence in that the Court found that there was color of law and amenable to suit because they utilized the replevin and garnishment statutes and went on to find that, because they were two cattle barons in a, if you will, spite suit, that qualified immunity didn't attach, and I don't disagree with that.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="874.672" stopTime="880.887">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Well, it has some relevance, though, here, and the question is, are we just going to apply that notion in this context?
speaker="charles_r_ray" startTime="880.887" stopTime="903.723">
    Mr. Charles R. Ray 
    I would submit, Justice O'Connor, that where a private actor is acting under the color of law, amenable to suit under 1983, coupled with the fact that they are performing a core governmental function that traditionally and historically has been part of the police power of the State, that the reasonable approach would be to grant them qualified immunity.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="903.723" stopTime="951.282">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Why isn't it reasonable to say, look, this is an extraordinary exception, that you hurt somebody and you're not liable. 
    You have this qualified immunity. 
    We want to limit it to those functions that are really core Government functions, and it doesn't seem to us that regardless of whether it used to be a core Government function, the Government isn't that serious about the function if it's willing to farm it out. 
    Why, just as a means of keeping the Governments honest, don't we say, if you're really serious that this is core Government functions, you want this qualified immunity, you have to have your own people doing it. 
    You can't farm it out to private individuals. 
    If you're that concerned about it, you'd exercise master-servant supervision over what's going on. 
    This State hasn't, so the State doesn't care that much, so why should we give qualified immunity?
speaker="charles_r_ray" startTime="951.282" stopTime="966.973">
    Mr. Charles R. Ray 
    Justice Scalia, I beg to differ. 
    The State cares a great deal. 
    The State has on-site a functionaire designated as a liaison who oversees on a day-to-day basis how we run South Central Correctional Facility.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="966.973" stopTime="987.396">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Yes, but I don't want to have to look into this on a case-by-case basis. 
    I mean, we're talking about a general rule of law, and why shouldn't the general rule of law be, look, if you're as much in control of it that it's your own servants who are doing the thing, then we'll consider qualified immunity, but if you're insouciant enough to farm it out, whatever controls you put, we're not going to give qualified immunity.
speaker="charles_r_ray" startTime="987.396" stopTime="1077.877">
    Mr. Charles R. Ray 
    Justice Scalia, I submit that the jurisprudence of this Court has always been that the States are free, as the hothouses of democracy, the laboratories of democracy, if you will, to attempt to chart their own course in how they delegate the duties, how they go about doing what they want to do. 
    If the State of Tennessee thinks it better serves its citizens to contract out the running of the prisons, then that is an issue that's left to the State of Tennessee. 
    Now, whether this Court wants to decide an immunity question on that basis I would submit that that's clearly antithetical to what this Court's done in the past. 
    That's like the amici arguing that you should consider whether or not insurance comes into play, or whether we choose to indemnify our employees, or whether we choose to do... to give bonuses, et cetera. 
    All of these things are things that the State of Tennessee has taken into account when they initially decide that we're going to contract out at least part of our corrections facilities and compare whether a private run facility can operate more efficiently to be to the taxpayer's interest, or whether we should keep this governmental function our own, and I submit that once a State makes that decision, that's a valid and legitimate decision the State has a right to make.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="1077.877" stopTime="1094.740">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    And you would extend that to all contracting out to do a custodial job? 
    Say, you'd apply the same thing to day care centers, that all the employees of the contracting... of the Government contractor would have qualified immunity?
speaker="charles_r_ray" startTime="1094.740" stopTime="1121.848">
    Mr. Charles R. Ray 
    No, Justice Ginsburg. 
    I believe that it should be maintained within the confines of this existing... of this Court's existing jurisprudence. 
    Since Procunier v. Navarette has been decided that State prison guards, and then Cleavinger v. Saxner Federal prison guards are... have the right to have the qualified immunity doctrine applied in their favor, I would submit that it's core governmental functions of that nature--
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="1121.848" stopTime="1134.367">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    How about education, and the Government saying our own schools are rotten so we're going to contract out that function to a private company that's going to do it for money?
speaker="charles_r_ray" startTime="1134.367" stopTime="1139.897">
    Mr. Charles R. Ray

speaker="charles_r_ray" startTime="1143.600" stopTime="1162.324">
    Mr. Charles R. Ray 
    I would say no, because this Court has never extended qualified immunity to educational facilities. 
    In fact, I think there's one case dealing with a contractor who provided educational service to the prison that attempted to invoke qualified immunity doctrine which was rejected by this Court.

    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    I wasn't talking about a private school. 
    I was talking about, it's... the State has been running these day care centers and they haven't worked out very well, so the State decides it, not parents paying tuition to a private school, but the State is going to replace its own operation with a contracting-out arrangement.
speaker="charles_r_ray" startTime="1207.912" stopTime="1293.140">
    Mr. Charles R. Ray 
    --Well, again, I think it would be dependent upon the amount of discretion that the officers utilized in furthering the public good and what this Court's jurisprudence had been in the past about conveying qualified immunity to actors of that nature, and it would be my belief that in the example you've given, Justice Ginsburg, that qualified immunity would not attach to that particular function. 
    But here we have a function that on a day-to-day basis I can't think of any other governmental function that utilizes as much discretion in dealing with a populace or a segment of the population that this Court has recognized where there's an unremitting tension between the keepers and the kept, and an unremitting tension between those folks that are being confined for antisocial behavior, who have a proclivity to make use of the court system in some cases for frivolous and vexatious litigation, and that it's the public good that is to be served by qualified immunity. 
    It's not Mr. Richardson or Mr. Walker that the benefit is meant to be conferred upon. 
    It's the belief by this Court that Mr. Richardson and Mr. Walker should have the right to carry out this governmental function with discretion, without timidity, to take care of business free from vexatious and frivolous litigation.

    That, of course, is why I'm interested in this private part, because pure tort law, if it does apply to this private person like any other private person, would make this all meaningless, what you're saying, because the person would have a cause of action, the injured person, under State tort law, and it really wouldn't matter, and unto all these incentives, and which way the contract cuts and so forth would all be totally irrelevant, really, because it wouldn't matter.

   Argument of David C. Vladeck
speaker="david_c_vladeck" startTime="1441.958" stopTime="1508.462">
    Mr. David C. Vladeck 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    This is a damage action brought pursuant to section 1983, and that provision broadly imposes liability on any and every person who, acting under the color of State law, deprives a person of constitutional rights. 
    It contains no explicit immunities or exceptions. 
    And nonetheless, this Court has recognized that when Congress enacted the Civil Rights Act back in 1871, it did not intend to abrogate wholesale the immunities that existed at that time. 
    Rather, this Court has said, and it has said it as recently as Wyatt v. Cole, that it will recognize immunities where, but only where, two conditions are met. 
    First, that there is some firm historical antecedent for the immunity, and second that there are strong policy considerations consistent with the purpose of section 1983 that preserve the preservation of the immunity, and both conditions need be met.

    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    But isn't it also true that we've often said that the scope of the immunity is measured by the function being performed by the defendant in the office he held, and the function being performed by these private companies is precisely the same as a public function.
speaker="david_c_vladeck" startTime="1521.980" stopTime="1529.685">
    Mr. David C. Vladeck 
    Yes, though the Court has, even in cases that post date Harlow, always looked at the historical basis.

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Mr. Vladeck, can you say for sure that immunity was never extended to nonemployees of the State? 
    I mean, the example brought forward by Mr. Ray is an impressive one. 
    That is, it certainly was the tradition at common law, and it still is the practice in England to have prosecutions conducted by barristers hired by the Crown. 
    I expect that was the case in the early days in this country. 
    Did those private prosecutors not have any immunity?
speaker="david_c_vladeck" startTime="1573.835" stopTime="1592.566">
    Mr. David C. Vladeck 
    --The only case of this Court that addresses that issue is Tower v. Glover, which involved not a prosecutor but a public defendant, and this Court, relying both on history and public policy grounds, held that that... that person was not entitled to the immunity that was sought in that case.

    Mr. David C. Vladeck 
    Well, Your Honor, judicial immunity is a different branch of sovereign immunity than the immunity that we're speaking of here today, and that gets back to my fundamental point, which is that there is no historical antecedent for immunity at common law for nongovernmental actors, particularly in torts involving the abuse of Government power.

    Well--

speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1634.714" stopTime="1647.903">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    In fact, even in England, isn't it true that the hue and cry that was raised to chase the fleeing felon often enlisted the help of all sorts of private citizens in performing police functions in apprehending fleeing felons?

    Mr. David C. Vladeck 
    I think that is very different. 
    I do not know whether those parties had immunity. 
    The only historical evidence we have here is in the brief of the ACLU, which looks at the practice that existed in the turn of the century for privatized prisons. 
    Private prisons were common in the late 1800's, and there are cases from that time involving private jailers who engaged in tortious conduct and they are not afforded immunity.

    I mean, you know, if the immunity question wasn't even involved in the case they're not very good authority.

    --Well--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="1721.051" stopTime="1722.783">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    So the existence of suits doesn't prove anything.
speaker="david_c_vladeck" startTime="1722.783" stopTime="1763.550">
    Mr. David C. Vladeck 
    --No. 
    The question that this Court has looked to in every single case involving the question of whether an individual is entitled to immunity has looked first at the question of is there historical antecedent, and the burden on showing historical antecedent has always been placed on the proponents of the immunity. 
    This Court has ruled again and again that because immunities interfere with the enforcement of constitutional rights, the burden is on the proponent to explain both the historical basis and public policy arguments that support it. 
    The petitioners have never argued that there's a historical antecedent. 
    The courts that have looked at this--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="1763.550" stopTime="1785.535">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Sure they have. 
    Their historical antecedent is, their argument goes like this. 
    What counts is the function. 
    There is plenty of historical antecedent for this person performing this function to be given immunity. 
    It's plenty. 
    And your response is, well, performing the same function, but he wasn't employed by the State, and I... it seems to me that's a good rebuttal argument, but I don't think you can say that they haven't brought forward any historical antecedent.
speaker="david_c_vladeck" startTime="1785.535" stopTime="1887.090">
    Mr. David C. Vladeck 
    --Well, it is true that in common law Government prison guards had immunity, or had a defense that is now called an immunity, but there were... there was quite an extensive experience with private prisons, and there is no evidence that any of those actors were ever accorded immunity either in our jurisprudence or in the English jurisprudence. 
    And to the extent that people have looked at it, the cases that exist... and I agree, they're not perfect on this, but do not accord private actors immunity. 
    But in any event, the policy considerations that I think are germane here argue very strongly against giving governmental immunity to private actors. 
    Our main reason is this. 
    Placing governmental power in the hands of private actors is bound to increase the risk of constitutional torts, and I say that because the key constraints... qualified immunity is a tradeoff. 
    On one hand we accept the fact that there will be unremedied and undeterred violations of law because we find it necessary for Government to perform those functions. 
    It is an altogether different matter when we are transforming Government power to private actors who may operate in very different ways with very different incentives. 
    For example, here, the prison is being run by a for-profit corporation. 
    Corporate... corporations, including prison corporations, have a duty to maximize their profits.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1887.090" stopTime="1892.193">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well, don't they also have a very strong motive to avoid paying a lot of damages?
speaker="david_c_vladeck" startTime="1892.193" stopTime="1903.010">
    Mr. David C. Vladeck 
    Well, they have a motive to avoid paying damages if there's something in place to keep that motivation present. 
    The problem with qualified immunity is it removes the deterrence to do precisely that, Your Honor.
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="1903.010" stopTime="1916.879">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    Well, why is it... I don't see any difference. 
    I know you've made a big point of this in your brief, but I don't really see it. 
    Why doesn't the... a corporation wants to save money. 
    So the Government doesn't give a damn. 
    They always blame somebody else. 
    But boy, when money's at stake, they get busy--
speaker="david_c_vladeck" startTime="1916.879" stopTime="1917.921">
    Mr. David C. Vladeck 
    Well, the easiest way--
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="1917.921" stopTime="1941.006">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    --and therefore they will really hew the line. 
    They will... they don't want these judgments, and therefore, whatever reason we have for giving qualified immunity to private... to public officials, we'll just apply the same there. 
    I mean, why does the fact that they make money mean they're more likely to violate people's rights? 
    You could as easily argue it's less likely.
speaker="david_c_vladeck" startTime="1941.006" stopTime="1943.917">
    Mr. David C. Vladeck 
    --It is for two reasons.
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="1943.917" stopTime="1945.878">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    I'm not saying it is less likely. 
    I just don't see that it's more.
speaker="david_c_vladeck" startTime="1945.878" stopTime="1965.252">
    Mr. David C. Vladeck 
    Well, my first answer, Justice Breyer, is, if we don't know the answer to that question, then the decision should be made by Congress, not this Court, because unless it is clear that the risks of conferring qualified immunity are not substantial and will not do violence to the policies in 1983, this Court has always said we ought not to proceed.
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="1965.252" stopTime="1992.337">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    Why doesn't it... look. 
    The... suppose I were inventing the system, which I won't do, but you might have no qualified immunity for anybody, and just have an insurance policy, which would put terrifically accurate incentives on public officials, but that isn't our system. 
    We have qualified immunity. 
    So if our system is qualified immunity, it must be because we want the people performing this function to feel not totally worried that they're right at the line. 
    If that's the reason, why doesn't that reason apply here with equal force?
speaker="david_c_vladeck" startTime="1992.337" stopTime="2005.467">
    Mr. David C. Vladeck 
    Because the Court has said, in cases like Harlow, that in addition to whatever economic incentives that you're basing your question on, there are other constraints that operate on public officials that certainly are absent here.
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="2005.467" stopTime="2005.918">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    Like what?
speaker="david_c_vladeck" startTime="2005.918" stopTime="2019.346">
    Mr. David C. Vladeck 
    In Harlow, of course... excuse me.

    If there's a lot of trouble the next time around I suppose the State is going to say, gee, we ought to find somebody who doesn't seem to create so much trouble for us.

    Mr. David C. Vladeck 
    There is supervision, biennial supervision by certain of the committees of the Tennessee legislature. 
    That, of course, is much more sporadic than the kind of public oversight that ordinarily obtains with public entities. 
    But when this legislation was passed, the one principal reservation was made by the Attorney General of Tennessee, who said... and this is obviously a paraphrase, but our concern is that suppose something goes wrong with this contract. 
    It is very difficult to substitute a new provider, if you will, on the spur of the moment, and so in some sense we are locked in and we're stuck with the contractor that we....

    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor

    Mr. David C. Vladeck 
    --I think that is correct, Justice O'Connor, but to the extent that a clear line could be discerned in the Government's brief, I think they point to the same two factors that we do. 
    One is the lack of divided loyalty. 
    In all of the hypotheticals that are given in the Solicitor General's brief, the contractor owes its... or his or her loyalty to the Government, and the second portion of their test, as I understand it, is direct and active governmental supervision. 
    Neither of those factors are present here.

    Well, I think if you look at the economic incentives, the provision of qualified immunity is the wrong way to go about enforcing compliance with the civil rights laws. 
    If you're simply looking at it dollars and cents, qualified immunity will save the Corrections Corporation of America, assuming that it indemnifies its employees and pays for their litigation expenses, an enormous amount of money, and removes the incentives--

   Argument of Edwin S. Kneedler
speaker="edwin_s_kneedler" startTime="2572.459" stopTime="2661.387">
    Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    It is the position of the United States that guards employed by a private corporation that is operating a prison pursuant to a contract with the State for the operation of that prison are not entitled to invoke qualified immunity under section 1983 solely by virtue of the fact that they are performing functions that are similar to those performed by a publicly employed guard. 
    However, as we explain in our brief, there are other circumstances not present in this case in which we do believe that private persons should be entitled to invoke immunity. 
    Some of those have been referred to here, and some of them in fact have distinct common law antecedents. 
    There are... there's a common law recognition, for example, for private judicial activities in the area of arbitration. 
    There are common law antecedents for private citizens helping to find... to capture fleeing felons. 
    There are common law antecedents for immunities for informants and other volunteers, such as volunteer fire companies. 
    Where... in situations where the Government cannot get the assistance of private persons in the performance of public functions, the law has long recognized immunities or defenses, and we think in those circumstances that correspondingly under 1983, or Bivens, when a person is acting under color of law, that there would be also a basis for doing that.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="2661.387" stopTime="2692.736">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Do we know that that isn't one of those situations? 
    That is to say, do we know that private companies, deep pockets, apparently, do not have the sovereign immunity that the State has and who are liable, you know, for vicarious master-servant liability for their individual functionaries, is it clear that they would take on these contracts and perform that governmental function if, indeed, they didn't have comparable qualified immunity to the one that the Government s own prison guards--
speaker="edwin_s_kneedler" startTime="2692.736" stopTime="2721.166">
    Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler 
    I think there are really two questions, and that is whether the private corporation would be able to attract employees to serve as their guards, but then beyond that the question would be whether the State could accomplish the function of housing prisoners if that weren't so. 
    And we know from history that the States have operated prisons themselves and have been able to hire employees and attract employees and give them the security of their job. 
    In fact, that's one of the functions of qualified immunity in the public sector.
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="2721.166" stopTime="2771.889">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    --If that's true, then... you're not going to know the answer to this either, I bet, because I bet there is no answer, but try it, but my impression, the qualified immunity thing, it's a creation by this Court interpreting a statute that rests upon common law tort law, and the kinds of immunity that under common law tort law went with public officials. 
    So if we're going back to history I would be quite interested as to how the States, again, have applied their common law tort law to people who suddenly privatize, take over State functions. 
    If, for example, they were to say, no, there is no immunity, you're treated just like Joe Blokes out in the street, that would support your historical argument very much, because then they would have evolved tort law the same way, and the opposite would be the opposite, and you're going to tell me you don't know because it probably hasn't come up yet.
speaker="edwin_s_kneedler" startTime="2771.889" stopTime="2778.793">
    Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler 
    No, my understanding is that that is, that that distinction does exist in tort law.
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="2778.793" stopTime="2779.734">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    All right. 
    So what happens?
speaker="edwin_s_kneedler" startTime="2779.734" stopTime="2808.132">
    Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler 
    For Government officials... and this is really the issue in this Court's decision in Westfall, which dealt with the qualified immunity of Federal employees from State common law torts. 
    The Court there referred to the fact that at common law employees were absolutely immune, essentially for acts performed within the scope of their discretion, and the Restatement of Torts refers to that same immunity for public officials acting within the scope of their discretion. 
    There is no comparable immunity as such for private--
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="2808.132" stopTime="2809.614">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    No, but now what happens when... exactly right--
speaker="edwin_s_kneedler" startTime="2809.614" stopTime="2871.594">
    Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler 
    --for private persons. 
    Now, I'm not aware of any law dealing specifically with contracting out, but I see no reason why contracts awarded to a private corporation for service contracts in this case, or procurement contracts, either way I see no reason why a private corporation in its ordinary functions, whether it's performing a contract for another private person or the Government, would not be subject to the... as a general rule, the same rule, that there would not be a comparable immunity. 
    Now, there may be defenses at common law, and for example, there are privileges or defenses... these things had different labels at common law for... and I'm sure the guards here would have a defense, even a private person would, in assisting in an arrest, and I'm sure that there would be a good faith defense recognized at common law in Tennessee... not an immunity, but a defense in terms of the force that was reasonably believed to be necessary by a guard to restrain someone. 
    That would be a privileged battery, and the question would be whether the battery would be... was reasonable. 
    But--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="2871.594" stopTime="2883.412">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    --Mr. Kneedler, you've confused me now. 
    I thought when you began you acknowledged that there were some instances in which qualified immunity was given to private people where you said it was necessary to call for the services.

    Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler 
    --Right.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="2884.441" stopTime="2889.186">

    Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler 
    No, no. 
    I was explaining the general common law rule of torts that the absolute immunity for Government actors did not apply in the private sector, but even under the common law there were--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="2899.682" stopTime="2902.183">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    We're talking about qualified immunity here, though. 
    We're not talking about absolute--
speaker="edwin_s_kneedler" startTime="2902.183" stopTime="2992.023">
    Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler 
    --No, but I think that there is some parallel as Justice Breyer was suggesting in the tort law to support a distinction between people who are public employees and people who are employees of private corporations, but even under contracts, I do want to make one important point. 
    If a person operating under a contract is acting pursuant to a specific governmental directive, either in the contract that something shall be done in a certain way, or directives in a particular case that something shall be done in a certain way, we believe that qualified immunity should attach to that, because in that situation it is not the private actor but the government that is really accountable for that, and the Government agent or official who made that decision has been responsible for balancing the costs and benefits of doing that. 
    I do think that there is an important distinction, both as a matter of history, constitutional law, and common sense, between Government and private corporations, between the Government way of doing things, or the Government model, and the private market model. 
    For one thing, Article VI of the Constitution requires every executive officer of a State, of the State or Federal Government to take an oath to support the Constitution, and those heads of executive departments, including the State correctional department, have direct responsibility and political accountability for those who work for them. 
    In that climate it is... I think the courts have been willing to assume the regularity of governmental operations. 
    Government officials will be trained, but in any event they will be subject to direct political accountability. 
    When a function is being performed by a private contractor, the Government can't step in and correct--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2992.023" stopTime="2995.516">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    --When you say political accountability you mean the electorate, I suppose.
speaker="edwin_s_kneedler" startTime="2995.516" stopTime="3004.060">
    Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler 
    --The electorate and public attention, public scrutiny on the acts of public officials. 
    That's not to say that the--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="3004.060" stopTime="3016.650">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well, does that... do you think there would be less, say, media attention on a prison riot if the... if prison officials and the workers were contract prisoners than if they were Government employees?
speaker="edwin_s_kneedler" startTime="3016.650" stopTime="3026.765">
    Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler 
    --No, there wouldn't be less media attention, but I believe it may be that the public would hold the public warden or correctional superintendent more directly responsible for what happened, and perhaps properly so.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="3026.765" stopTime="3027.707">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Why on earth would that be?
speaker="edwin_s_kneedler" startTime="3027.707" stopTime="3061.957">
    Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler 
    Because the direct supervision of the guards on a day-to-day basis, anyway, is not the responsibility of the head of the correctional department. 
    The Government has turned over as a package the entire operation of the prison, and there are a series of financial and other incentives for the contractor to both protect the security of the prison and protect private rights. 
    That includes not just what happens in individual guard decisions but the broader questions. 
    The contractor has to decide, the training, the security measures, the way facilities are designed, the programs, all of--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="3061.957" stopTime="3075.138">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Well, you'd better be very careful in picking the contractor. 
    It seems to me you can get just as mad at the State governmental corrections director for being very negligent in his selection of contractors as you can get mad at him for being negligent in his supervision of people who--
speaker="edwin_s_kneedler" startTime="3075.138" stopTime="3147.764">
    Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler 
    --Right. 
    I'm not saying that there's no responsibility, but we do believe that it's attenuated and that in fact there's a pretty important break in the chain of control. 
    The very act of contracting over the operation of an entire institution... we're not talking about individual doctors who may be integrated into what's otherwise a governmental institution, but turning over the operation of an entire institution to a private corporation. 
    The model, then, would be that that private corporation, using whatever it believes would best promote the overall performance of the contract, to use its creativity, to use its financial resources in a way that will both win the contract the next time around and also to guard against constitutional rights, and the Government... I think this Court has been willing to assume that the accountability and the direct responsibility of the Constitution will help to deter constitutional violations. 
    I think that there's less structural basis... I'm not saying necessarily empirical, but structural basis for concluding that the same assumption should not be applied in the case of private contractors, but we do urge this Court not to announce a rule that would say that immunity is not available in any case of private actors, but only in the Government contractor situation.

    Mr. Charles R. Ray 
    Thank you, Your Honor. 
    I promise you I won't use that. 
    In response to the Government, I really submit that their position seems to be a bit elitist, that doctors, counselors, those professions that you're going to have difficulty in bringing into the contracting service should have immunity, qualified immunity, but a mere prison guard, where the rubber meets the road, somehow they don't warrant qualified immunity, and I would submit that--

    Mr. Charles R. Ray

speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="3202.031" stopTime="3247.240">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    Let me ask you this. 
    It's probably not a very great point, because nobody's made it on the other side, but this did occur to me. 
    They mostly argued this incentive thing, which we've been through, but if you go back into the history of these cases, I once thought that the reason this qualified immunity developed at all was the courts are focusing on a particular person who may not have insurance. 
    He's a defendant, and they're saying this poor person, you know, he's trying to do his job, here his life is ruined, he's stuck with $100,000 verdict... we'll hurt the plaintiffs a little bit in order to help him out a little bit. 
    Now, if that was how this thing developed... and certainly Learned Hand probably had something like that in mind, I think, in Gregoire v. Biddle, all right... then it is a different world, isn't it, where people have insurance?
speaker="charles_r_ray" startTime="3247.240" stopTime="3248.321">
    Mr. Charles R. Ray 
    No question about it.
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="3248.321" stopTime="3274.669">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    And if we're going into this different world when people have insurance, like the private companies all must under contract, then that defendant is somewhat less in need of that protection, and that... though no one's made this, so maybe there's some obvious answer to this, but the... if they don't need the protection because we're now in a new world, does that sort of hurt the whole idea of qualified immunity, at least as applied to a field where they have to have insurance?
speaker="charles_r_ray" startTime="3274.669" stopTime="3330.955">
    Mr. Charles R. Ray 
    In the case that was argued yesterday it was quite apparent that insurance played a great role in that particular case. 
    The county had insurance, whether or not it was enough. 
    So governments indemnify their employees just as private concerns do, and I don't believe that this Court has ever let that particular issue decide whether qualified immunity would pass on to a certain governmental official. 
    And again, since Harlow, the focus I would submit has been upon what the public interest is in having qualified immunity conferred on this particular governmental official, who utilizes discretion on a daily basis. 
    We do indemnify our guards, but eventually that cost is going to be passed on to the State of Tennessee, and eventually passed on to the taxpayers of the State of Tennessee, so I would submit that the ultimate goal is to serve the taxpayers of the State of Tennessee, and therefore qualified immunity shouldn't turn on whether or not there's indemnification of our employees.

    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Well, I don't know if that's the ultimate goal. 
    The statute is... was enacted to protect the constitutional rights of people from violation by State officials, and in your hypothesis, you've got a constitutional violation here, but it should go unredressed because of the qualified immunity doctrine.

    Thank you, Mr. Ray.
