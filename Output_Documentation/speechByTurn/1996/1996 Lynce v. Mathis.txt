speaker="joel_t_remland" startTime="9.747" stopTime="82.754">
    Mr. Joel T. Remland 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court: 
    Petitioner challenges a 1992 Florida State law which retroactively redefined punishment prescribed for a 1985 offense, in violation of the Ex Post Facto Clause. 
    Petitioner committed his offense in 1985. 
    He pled nolo contendere and was sentenced in 1986 in accordance with the sentencing formula prescribed by Florida law. 
    The punishment formula in effect at the time of petitioner's offense and at the time of his sentencing provided that a prisoner's actual term of incarceration was equal to the guidelines sentence imposed by the judge less all gain time awarded. 
    The State granted petitioner overcrowding gain time credits from 1987 in the form of administrative gain time through 1991 in the form of provisional release credits. 
    Due to the award of those credits, and pursuant to statutory law, the State established a release date for October 1 of 1992. 
    As petitioner's mandatory non--

    Justice David H. Souter 
    Mr. Remland, may I interrupt you for a moment? 
    Can you tell me whether the figure that the State arrived at in determining what the release date was was calculated under the statute that was in existence at the time of the offense, the '83 statute which is set out on page 27 of the lodging, or whether that figure was calculated under one of the later statutes? 
    I... in candor, I had assumed that it was calculated under one of the successor statutes, but I want to make sure on that.

    Mr. Joel T. Remland 
    --Yes, sir, Justice Souter. 
    It was calculated under one of the successor statutes in 1988, the--

    Justice David H. Souter 
    Okay. 
    Now, if we to... I'm sorry. 
    If we were to conclude that under the Ex Post Facto Clause the only statute that should be considered was the one in effect at the time of the offense, I take it the figure that they calculated and the date which they arrived at would have been different.
speaker="joel_t_remland" startTime="139.402" stopTime="159.694">
    Mr. Joel T. Remland 
    --It's hard to say, because the actual statute in effect in 1985, which was 944-598, had not been triggered at that point, and the credits did not start to issue until a successor statute administrative gain time supplanting provisional... supplanting the emergency gain time statute kicked in--

    Mr. Joel T. Remland 
    --and the actual credits could be used, I believe, according to the statutes in effect when the credits were granted, and I would submit to the Court--

    Justice David H. Souter 
    --Yes, but that may not support an Ex Post Facto argument. 
    That might support... just assume for the sake of argument here that that might just support a due process claim, which is not what we have before us, and I take it the only thing we can say for sure is that if the calculation were made under the statute as in existence at the time of the offense, we don't know that the number arrived at would have been the same number that was awarded under the later statute.
speaker="joel_t_remland" startTime="197.101" stopTime="226.549">
    Mr. Joel T. Remland 
    --I believe the number would have been the same, for two reasons. 
    First of all, in 1985 the... Mr. Lynce was offense-eligible. 
    The petitioner was offense-eligible, and the percentage for the threshold was 98 percent. 
    The two key criteria was the same. 
    The formula in 1983 all the way through, until 1992, when the second, harsher, more oppressive formula was enacted, that changed the situation. 
    But the basic formula was the same from 1983 through 1985.

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Mr. Remland--

    Mr. Joel T. Remland 
    That is correct.

    The first time they--

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    When we took this case we thought we were dealing with a situation which involved a change of the punishment that existed at the time the crime was committed.

    Mr. Joel T. Remland 
    --Justice Scalia, you did, as a matter of fact, because in 1985, when the offense was committed, the offense formula was basically the same as it was in '83 earlier under the statute.

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist

speaker="joel_t_remland" startTime="268.387" stopTime="284.326">
    Mr. Joel T. Remland 
    I think that the actual issue was presented squarely under the statute in effect at the time of the offense under the emergency gain time statute which Mr. Lynce was eligible for under 98 percent of population cap, and he was offense-eligible according to law.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="284.326" stopTime="288.570">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    That statute was applied to no one, ever, right? 
    It was never applied, that statute.
speaker="joel_t_remland" startTime="288.570" stopTime="300.699">
    Mr. Joel T. Remland 
    That statute, although it wasn't triggered in 1986, the cap was reached and the Governor declared a special emergency. 
    We went into special session, and the percentage was raised to 98 percent. 
    It would have been triggered. 
    These--
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="300.699" stopTime="318.350">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    That was all later, but the statute that was on the books at the time the offense was committed is a statute that was never applied to anyone. 
    It's a little hard to talk about anything ex post facto with respect to a law that was never applied to anyone.
speaker="joel_t_remland" startTime="318.350" stopTime="354.631">
    Mr. Joel T. Remland 
    --It's our position that the statute that was in effect in 1985 was essentially the same statute that was in effect in 1988 when the credits were being granted, and moreover there's no question that the effect of the change substantially increased the petitioner's punishment, and that would constitute a violation of the ex post facto law, the Ex Post Facto Clause. 
    It's clear that we've got a substantial increase in punishment over that that occurred at the time of the offense, and the statutory formula in 1985 was established. 
    The petitioner was clearly eligible for credits.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="354.631" stopTime="384.562">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    But Mr. Remland, what about... the statute that was in place was an emergency statute. 
    Could one really say that it was going to operate, or it wasn't at all highly speculative what would become of that emergency measure, then? It's not like your punishment is X, and your good time credit is Y. 
    It was a brand new thing on an emergency basis, and could one say not this... this is... I know what this is?
speaker="joel_t_remland" startTime="384.562" stopTime="438.708">
    Mr. Joel T. Remland 
    Justice Ginsburg, the formula was adopted in 1983 under the Sentencing Reform Act, and that formula was the sentence of the Court minus the gain time equals the actual sentence. 
    In this particular matter, Florida statute 921 authorized any and all gain time to be deducted from the actual sentence imposed, and in 1985 and 1986 there was an overcrowding problem, there's no question about that, and that overcrowding problem continued. 
    The contention or speculative nature of these credits doesn't really impact the fact that the effect of the '92 act totally and retroactively increased the measure of punishment. 
    It stiffened the measure of punishment. 
    It increased the measure of punishment over the statutory formula under 921, the sentencing guidelines law that was in effect at the time of the offense that provided a provisional and mandatory release date.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="438.708" stopTime="518.119">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    But may... on that point, may I ask you a variant of Justice Ginsburg's question? 
    I've gone over the statute as you've provided it to us in the lodging, the statute that was in effect at the time of the offense, and it's not clear to me from reading that statute whether any reduction that did not result in the release of a particular prisoner would have survived the termination of the emergency. 
    It is not clear to me from the statute, for example, that if your client got a 30-day reduction at some point because there was an emergency during his incarceration, but he was not released as a result of it because the reduction didn't get him down to that point, it's not clear to me from the statute that the reduction would have sort of remained on the books, if you will, as a permanent reduction in his sentence once the population had dropped down and that emergency was passed. 
    And I guess my question is, isn't that another reason for saying that under the statute as it existed when he committed his offense it is at best speculative whether he would have obtained the kind of long-term permanent reduction benefit that you are claiming he has been denied improperly here?
speaker="joel_t_remland" startTime="518.119" stopTime="533.090">
    Mr. Joel T. Remland 
    Justice Souter, the focus of the inquiry for ex post facto purposes should be the effect of the '92 law. 
    Not so much emphasis should be placed on the speculative nature of whether or not the trigger is going to be reached.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="533.090" stopTime="573.585">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    But I think what I'm trying to get at is that the effect of the '92 law depends on what he might have been entitled to under the law that was changed and if, in fact, under the law that was changed, under the '83 act if that's what we're going to consider, it is not even clear that he would have been entitled to retain his credit beyond the termination of the emergency during which it was granted, then I can't say that the later statute took away anything. 
    At best I would say, well, it's speculative as to whether it took away anything. 
    There's no case law telling me how to read this in your client's favor, and that's the difficulty I have.
speaker="joel_t_remland" startTime="573.585" stopTime="584.992">
    Mr. Joel T. Remland 
    Justice Souter, the statutes in this case that provided the overcrowding gain time had no provisions which allowed revocation or forfeiture. 
    These credits, once granted, were--
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="584.992" stopTime="595.721">
    Justice David H. Souter

    Mr. Joel T. Remland 
    --I do not believe, Justice O'Connor, that an individual who's committing a crime on the outside is thinking in terms of what specific gain time statutes might exist, and I don't think that kind of a reliance interest is required for a claim under the ex post facto clause. 
    However, I do think that reliance is one of the interest as well as expectations that the ex post facto clause addresses. 
    However, I think in this case in 1985, when the offense was committed, through 1986, there was real overcrowding, there was an overcrowding formula, Justice Stevens, as you pointed out, in 1985 that made him 98 percent... the population cap was there at 98 percent, and the overcrowding was there, and there were newspaper articles coming out. 
    And the Governor in 1986, one month prior to the time of the plea in this case, went into special session and raised the trigger from 98 percent to 99 percent, so there's maybe an objective reliance here on the part of any petitioner in this particular situation, especially when we have in place since 1985 and earlier a statutory formula under--

    Once there's no more overcrowding, no more accumulation, and we wipe away any that exist if you haven't gotten out.

    Now, I take it that your answer to me depends on the fact that the statute uses the word accumulated. 
    I take it your argument is that it wouldn't make any sense to refer to accumulated gain time unless the gain time survived the emergency.

    The Florida supreme court has carved out sort of an exception and tried to distinguish between good behavior incentive gain time on the one hand and overcrowding gain time on the other. 
    I believe--

    Justice John Paul Stevens

    Mr. Joel T. Remland

    As a matter of fact, these credits, Justice Stevens, are nothing more than good time credits during periods of overcrowding, and as Arnold v. Cody out of the Tenth Circuit noted, the contingent nature of the credits emanating after the effective date of the act really just shows you the credits are being awarded. 
    It's an issue of retroactivity. 
    In this particular matter, the real key issue is whether the effect of the law, the focus of the inquiry as in Moralis v. Department of California Department of Corrections was that did this changed formula in 1992 substantially stiffen the measure of punishment? 
    Did it increase? 
    Did it make it more onerous than the formula that Mr. Lynce, the petitioner herein, was eligible for, 98 percent in 1985, and not excluded because of his offense?

    Justice Kennedy, I think that Florida, because of the overcrowding crisis, should be able to address this crisis in any manner it feels reasonable with prospective laws.

    No, no. 
    No, they have a new cap at 90 percent. 
    They just exclude certain offenders, including your client. 
    Hence, because of the 90-percent cap, they release people, and he'll never reach the 98, so in effect they've taken away from him his credit. 
    Would that be lawful?

    They don't make it more harsh. 
    They just provide something for somebody else. 
    What's the difference in that and building a new prison?

    Mr. Joel T. Remland 
    I guess it wouldn't be any difference unless it impacted him adversely from the prior formula. 
    I think you have to just look at both formulas. 
    If it doesn't adversely affect the overall sentence in terms of the duration of his actual term of incarceration, then it wouldn't be a violation of ex post facto. 
    The only test is whether or not the new formula is harsher or more oppressive than the earlier formula, sort of like--

    Well, I guess you've answered the question. 
    Does this formula have to be in the statute? 
    Suppose the prison system just has a policy that when there's... or they're under injunction from a Federal court that they can't have so many... more than so many people in their institutions, and they institute a policy that when we have so many we will let out first of all the pickpockets, and let's assume your client's a pickpocket.

   Argument of Parker D. Thomson
speaker="parker_d_thomson" startTime="1692.036" stopTime="1796.128">
    Mr. Parker D. Thomson 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court: 
    The ex post facto clause is implicated here only if the 1992 statute that terminated the application of the provisional release credits for Mr. Lynce increased the quantum of punishment attached to his crime from the date it was committed. 
    That is the definition of an ex post facto law. 
    A statute must increase the quantum of punishment at that... over that which existed at that point of time, or it is simply not subject to ex post facto attack, whatever other bases there may for attacking it. 
    In looking at the provisional release credits, or the other forms of overcrowding credits adopted by Florida in response to a serious overcrowding problem, a Federal court decree, a settlement of that Federal court case, and then the adoption of certain policies later encapsulated into statute, all of those procedures we submit were not penal. 
    In fact, their purpose was the opposite of penal. 
    It was remedial and procedural. 
    The 1992 act and all the other acts adopted over this period of time were attempted solutions to that same large problem that Florida was confronting.

    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Well, Mr. Thomson, assume that under the law in effect in 1985 the defendant would have been entitled to certain gain time credits based on good behavior and other things, and he went along earning those credits until all of a sudden the State passes a retroactive law that takes away gain time credits already accumulated for him. 
    Can it do that? 
    Is there an ex post facto problem there?
speaker="parker_d_thomson" startTime="1832.092" stopTime="1882.895">
    Mr. Parker D. Thomson 
    The Weaver case tells us that there is.

    Florida remodeled its basic gain time statute to leave the credits where they were, but to modify them prospectively, and this Court held that the State of Florida could not do that. 
    It couldn't modify them at all. 
    Now, I interpret that aspect of gain time as written in Weaver in part by the reference in the Moralis case in 1995 to Weaver being part of a trilogy, the trilogy being the Lindsey case in 1937, Weaver, and the Miller case in 1987.

    These laws were not directed in any way at punishing the individual inmate.

    Mr. Parker D. Thomson 
    There are lots of things that affect the time that an inmate will serve that have nothing to do with the fact of whether punishment is being imposed on him. 
    In this case, the State was dealing with problems that had nothing to do with individual inmates. 
    They were not for the purpose of controlling an inmate. 
    They were not for the purpose of rewarding an inmate. 
    They were to deal with a serious problem of overcrowding which required early release of certain... a certain number of people which the State moved back and forth in light of its other obligation, which was to, as best it could, protect the safety of the streets, and therefore decided who it--

    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    I might understand your argument better if it applied across the board, but it as I understand it the statute took away the provisional gain time from a class of offenders, dangerous people, including an attempted murderer, and I'm not sure how to square that with your assertion that this was not to punish.

    Mr. Parker D. Thomson 
    --Justice Kennedy, it was no more to punish than the Moralis case, which applied a different rule to a certain class of prisoners, in that case double murderers. 
    The overcrowding--

    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    Well, but the rationale in that case was that it was unlikely that there would be really any difference. 
    Here, it is clear there was a difference.
speaker="parker_d_thomson" startTime="2065.905" stopTime="2091.533">
    Mr. Parker D. Thomson 
    --The overcrowding was not by itself. 
    Overcrowding resulted in the release of people, and you can look at the Florida statutes, and they looked at who it was that was going to be released, what classifications of people, and they said, certain classes of people should not be released to the streets to take care of an overcrowding problem. 
    This changed from time to time as overcrowding became a greater or a less problem.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="2091.533" stopTime="2101.801">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    But why isn't that a judgment that one crime is more culpable or more dangerous than another, and therefore more deserving of incarceration? 
    That sounds like punishment to me.

    Mr. Parker D. Thomson 
    Indirectly it has... it makes a judgment of who are more likely to cause a problem by early release. 
    There is no change of the sentence of anybody, those that are released or those that are not released. 
    The sentence remains what it was.

    Then I make judgments within that determination of who should and should not be released consistent with my obligation as a legislator to best protect public safety.

    It was never part of his sentence. 
    It had no relationship to what he did in prison.

    Justice David H. Souter 
    Mr. Thomson, assume for the sake of argument that the terms of the '83 statute would be enforceable under the ex post facto clause. 
    Assume, secondly, though you correct me if you think this is wrong, but at least for the moment assume that under the statutory scheme as it existed at the time of the offense in '83 one simply couldn't tell one way or the other whether one of these emergency credits would, in fact, survive the emergency if the individual was not released. 
    And assume, number 3, if you will, and again correct me later if you think this is wrong, but assume for now, as opposing counsel said, that the credits have in fact, even under the emergency provisions, the emergency credits have been accumulated and have survived the emergencies as a matter of administrative practice. 
    That's what they've been doing. 
    My question is this. 
    Is there anything in... was there anything in Florida law at the time of the offense in '83 that made it... that would have provided, or did provide that the administrative practice had to be what in fact it was? 
    Was there anything in Florida law at that time that says you're supposed to accumulate rather than not accumulate? 
    Or, conversely, would it be fair to say that in '83 what the administrators did was a matter of their grace. 
    They could either accumulate or not accumulate. 
    It was purely up to them, and nobody could say what they ought to do. 
    Which was it?

    Was there any... any law, outside of the confines... confines of what we have in the lodging, that would have indicated that the administrators were supposed to accumulate this, or, conversely, were the administrators free to do anything they wanted simply as a matter of grace? 
    They could either accumulate it and retain it beyond the emergency or not, as they saw fit.
speaker="parker_d_thomson" startTime="2539.089" stopTime="2540.671">
    Mr. Parker D. Thomson

    Justice David H. Souter 
    Okay. 
    How does this... I don't know if you can explain it. 
    Maybe you can just refer me to a source, but it does seem if you could refer me to a source as to how these statutes work, it would be helpful. 
    As I read 598 and then 277 and 276, it seems to me they're identical but for the fact that the latter uses the word 60 days and may, and the former uses the word shall and 30 days as far as we're interested here. 
    What it says you're supposed to do is that, when it hits 98 percent, then you start reducing the prison population, and you do it by giving each person in 5-day increments up to 30 days' gain time. 
    Where did we get the number 1,800 from? 
    It said up to 30 days, and what I... as I read it literally it sounded as if you have 1,000 people in the prison, they're all there under 25 years, which means they're really only 10 years, and then... after you eliminate all the regular gain time they're there for 10 years. 
    And then what you do is, you look through the whole 1,000, you give each of these 1,000 people 30 days off their sentence, which will do nothing for prisor, overcrowding because they're not supposed to be released for a long time anyway, but they all get lighter sentences, and then you come down finally to it might be one person who's about to get out tomorrow, so he gets out. 
    I mean, how does this work?

    There were four statutes.

    Mr. Parker D. Thomson 
    Well, the second one, the one I've just mentioned, administrative gain time, said up to 60 days, and so once an emergency was declared by the administrator, referred to the Governor, the Governor assented, it came back, and the Secretary allocated days from zero to 60 to that particular instant and assigned them to the block of people that were in the eligible pool.

    Mr. Parker D. Thomson 
    --might mistakenly think that there was a direct multiplication, and there isn't. 
    In fact, there were a whole set of certifications and determinations by the Secretary over the period of time that the provisional credits were given, which was from 1988 until the beginning of 1991.
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="2709.650" stopTime="2736.450">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    Okay. 
    Then my question would be this. 
    The statute says, really, what you're saying is that that's what shall happen. 
    The statutes say it shall happen. 
    They say it shall happen as of 1983. 
    Now, since they say it shall happen and you have a later statute that comes along that says in his case it shall not happen, how can we look at it as other than you had a later statute that made his sentence more harsh. 
    Now, what you were starting to say was--
speaker="parker_d_thomson" startTime="2736.450" stopTime="2737.178">
    Mr. Parker D. Thomson 
    Well, I said--

    --because the purpose is different.

    --I said--

    But if the purpose is different, I guess if you had a good purpose you could double everybody's sentence on that theory.

    Mr. Parker D. Thomson 
    --Oh, no. 
    His sentence never changed. 
    His sentence was given to him. 
    It was 22 years. 
    If you accept Weaver, it was shortened by basic gain time at the date of the sentence, because that's the way basic gain time is handled. 
    You lopped about 6 or 7 years off of it. 
    You then have incentive gain time, which in fact the Florida court has construed Weaver applies to and therefore could not be taken away. 
    Those are things that are within his control at least. 
    He can handle those. 
    There's something he can do about those. 
    He can work. 
    He can earn gain time. 
    It cannot be taken away from him. 
    The overcrowding credit in fact relates to the releasing of prisoners. 
    In fact, it shouldn't be looked at until you have to release a prisoner, and during that period of time you ought to be able to adjust to your needs. 
    In fact, for administrative purposes, because the Florida system is so large, credits were booked with respect to these individuals so that they did have an accumulation. 
    It was related to these two statutes, administrative--

    --Yes, Your Honor. 
    On page 52 of the Joint Appendix there is zero... of course, it's not named.

    It was not taken away from him by the 1992 law, and it is not challenged here, but you should know that in fact once the overcrowding issue was ameliorated and the Costello decree was terminated, the legislature revoked all administrative gain time and provisional release credits. 
    That's beyond the time of this statute. 
    So at the time this was written, he still had 335 days on the book for administrative gain time. 
    It says 1360. 
    That is a typographical error below that. 
    It means 1,860 as is shown by the previous page of the affidavit.

    Mr. Parker D. Thomson 
    That is correct, because the alternative was that each day you had an overcrowding problem you would recalculate, and that seemed to be, one would say, a little bit a waste of time, so you... as long as you had a consistent overcrowding problem, once you assigned credits to a person they were just left there.

    What do you mean when you use the expression, booked, Mr. Thomson?
speaker="parker_d_thomson" startTime="2943.745" stopTime="2988.896">
    Mr. Parker D. Thomson 
    I mean that they were entered in his record, and that continued until 1989, the fourth effort, which is called controlled release in Florida, in which, starting as of January of '91, these matters of overcrowding were assigned to the... a controlled release authority, which is really the Parole Commission under another name, and there is no booking with respect to those credits at any time for Mr. Lynce because they were handled differently, and that's the method of dealing with overcrowding that started in 1991 and terminated finally in 1994, when the last overcrowding release occurred in the State of Florida.

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Mr. Thomson, your argument, or at least a large part of your argument is that you shouldn't count this because it's not punishment. 
    It had nothing to do with punishment. 
    It had to do with administrative needs, administrative efficiency. 
    But isn't the same thing true of good behavior release time as well? 
    That has nothing... you know, earned credits for good time credits. 
    That has nothing to do with the heinousness of the crime. 
    It has nothing to do with what is deserved punishment. 
    It has to do with giving people an incentive to behave themselves so that it will be easier to manage the prison.
speaker="parker_d_thomson" startTime="3025.330" stopTime="3035.775">
    Mr. Parker D. Thomson 
    You are correct, Your Honor. 
    All gain time... other than the overcrowding issue, all the gain time is hooked in some fashion to prison management. 
    There is no doubt of that.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="3035.775" stopTime="3041.278">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Which suggests that our prior case law is an impediment to the argument you're making to us.

    Your Honor.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="3042.460" stopTime="3052.157">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Because we have certainly held that you can't take away good time credits, change the system under which you earn them retroactively.

    Mr. Parker D. Thomson 
    What is... what this Court has held in the Weaver case is that basic gain time, which is the one aspect of gain time that is assigned to an individual at the day he enters the prison and therefore may be deemed part of the sentence for purposes of how judges approach it, how defense attorneys and prosecutors approach it, that this Court... I can read Weaver a bunch of ways, but if I read Weaver as a sentencing case, and when this Court refers it to as a trilogy with Lindsey and Miller it seems to me clearly it is, then basic gain time as part of that initial factor makes some sense as being treated as part of the sentence, and I take that as a given.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="3097.566" stopTime="3107.483">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Basic gain time, how is it... does it make any difference, other... is basic gain time assigned on the basis of the length of the sentence?
speaker="parker_d_thomson" startTime="3107.483" stopTime="3112.987">
    Mr. Parker D. Thomson 
    Yes, Your Honor. 
    It is a certain number of days in the statute for years, and it goes up.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="3112.987" stopTime="3117.300">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Does it depend on anything else, other than the length of the sentence?
speaker="parker_d_thomson" startTime="3117.300" stopTime="3152.254">
    Mr. Parker D. Thomson 
    In fact, the way it operates it does not. 
    That is, it's there, and you've got it, unless you do something that causes it to be revoked. 
    Incentive gain time is handled differently, and of course the overcrowding credits themselves are, it seems to me, Justice Scalia, for an entirely different purpose. 
    They aren't related to the individual prisoner and what he does. 
    To be sure, prison management is a goal for him to get a result, but if he does it, he gets it. 
    Overcrowding is in effect an externality. 
    Not only is it iffy, in response to--

    Well, you--

    --Justice Souter's question, but it's an externality. 
    They... you... there's nothing he can do.

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    --It's conditioned on good behavior, though, as you told us earlier, so to that extent it is still somewhat conditioned upon his own behavior.
speaker="parker_d_thomson" startTime="3161.689" stopTime="3208.762">
    Mr. Parker D. Thomson 
    No, I did not say that, Your Honor. 
    The incentive... the provisional credits, there is in the statute a... the words that provisional credits are available only to a person who is earning incentive time. 
    The Florida supreme court has interpreted that to mean that that's just the pool of people. 
    The pool of people that are eligible for those during the period of time that they were given, those overcrowding credits, are those that were earning incentive time and are not subject to one of the exceptions that were contained in the statute. 
    That's just a pool of persons, a definition of who will be available, or who will be treated for overcrowding credit.

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    I'm not sure what... I'm not sure what you mean by... I'm not sure how that responds to my point. 
    He has to place himself within that pool by his good behavior, no?

    Okay. 
    What was the universe for measuring overcrowding? 
    Was it the entire Florida correction systems, or was it prison by prison?
