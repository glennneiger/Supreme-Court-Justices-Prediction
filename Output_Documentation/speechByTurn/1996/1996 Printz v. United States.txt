    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    In the Federal-State context, this Court has upheld laws passed under the spending power, the commerce power, including the power to preempt State legislation, and the Article VI duty of State judges to hear Federal causes of action. 
    The interim provisions of the Brady act at issue here is not an exercise of any of those powers. 
    The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held that, in essence, Congress may commandeer the sheriffs departments of our country as long as the laws concerned do not interfere unduly with their duties. 
    The only alternative for the States is to enact laws which meet Congress' standards to get out from under or exempt themselves from the Federal commands to--

    In regard to the Printz case, we have approximately a dozen officers.

    In the case of Mack, we have testimony that the checks routinely took 1 to 2 hours per day.

    Not at all. 
    These are just the facts of the case. 
    I think that these departments could have plenty of staff and not much to do and these commands would be unconstitutional. 
    We've not heard cited yet a specific provision of the Constitution that justifies these commands. 
    We've seen a lot of dancing around the Commerce Clause and Article VI of the Constitution and my answer is no, that regardless of the burden or lack thereof, that these commands are not constitutional.

    Mr. Stephen P. Halbrook 
    Your Honor, that comes under the spending power. 
    There is a provision in regard to highway funds that provides that to get the highway funds there are a number of burdens on the States, including the drinking age and including--

    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Is that... excuse me. 
    Now, the Government has... the SG has filed a brief citing any number of cases, instances through the years where Congress has required States or local officials to perform some duties, and you assert that in every case it was linked somehow to funding?

    Mr. Stephen P. Halbrook 
    As far as we could determine, the statutes we looked at that were prominently cited by the Government... the one that you mentioned, the fatalities reporting, and then the reporting the missing children relates to the National Crime Information Center, which is a voluntary system of record reporting between the Federal Government and the States... and we haven't found an instance where there was not some nexus with receipt of a grant or some other--

speaker="stephen_p_halbrook" startTime="407.349" stopTime="437.318">
    Mr. Stephen P. Halbrook 
    In our view that clearly comes under Article VI, the special duty of State judges to hear Federal causes of action and to do other things that Congress passes that relate to the Article VI provision and Congress, under Article I, section 8, is empowered to enact a uniform rule of naturalization, and we interpret those early naturalization statutes as being under that provision and then being applied through the State judiciary through Article VI.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="437.318" stopTime="444.832">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    Well, you don't think that under the uniform rule of naturalization that Congress could compel State sheriffs to make background checks of aliens, do you?
speaker="stephen_p_halbrook" startTime="444.832" stopTime="450.168">
    Mr. Stephen P. Halbrook 
    Absolutely not, because the sheriff is not a State judge, and Article VI refers explicitly to State judges.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="450.168" stopTime="462.974">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    Yes, so... but I don't think a whole lot turns, then, on the power of Congress to pass uniform rules of naturalization. 
    Congress is acting within its appropriate sphere, just as it acts within its appropriate sphere under the Commerce Clause.
speaker="stephen_p_halbrook" startTime="462.974" stopTime="493.345">
    Mr. Stephen P. Halbrook 
    And the State judges have to apply that through Article VI, so I think the clearest example of the early Congress that applies here was the same day that Congress passed the Tenth Amendment they passed a resolution that the States would be encouraged to enact legislation authorizing State local officials, rather, to keep Federal prisoners in their jails. 
    It was seen as a completely voluntary function for which the sheriffs would be paid.

    I don't know whether all of them do. 
    I know that several of them do, and these are very... some of them are very obscure laws. 
    I don't know that there's ever been any litigation on them, so I cannot say that there is a specific power in the case of every one of these laws that one could link, for example, to the spending power.

    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Well, my question is, are you saying that there's nothing like this, that in every case there's either something explicit in the Constitution, like the obligation of State courts that you get from Article VI, or extradition? 
    Is this the first of a kind, or is there anything that you would concede is like it?
speaker="stephen_p_halbrook" startTime="560.000" stopTime="581.823">
    Mr. Stephen P. Halbrook 
    Well, I think there may be some of these laws... for example, I believe there's one cited here about underground storage facilities, where the States are supposed to inventory and report underground storage facilities and frankly, Your Honor, I was not able to find a specific item in that statute that related to the spending power. 
    It's just one of those obscure laws that I'm not really sure what the basis of it is.

    May--

    Mr. Stephen P. Halbrook 
    But in terms of precedents for this law that we have here, I think the law in New York v. United States was one that was on all fours with the laws here in terms of the--

    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    --May I ask not about precedent but just about your theory of the case? 
    Is it your position that, without having any spending power at all, but just acting under the Commerce Clause, Congress would not have the power to have States report to it the number of fatalities involving children caused by airbags for... in 30-day period, or something like that? 
    It would not have the power to do that?
speaker="stephen_p_halbrook" startTime="614.745" stopTime="617.807">
    Mr. Stephen P. Halbrook

speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="617.807" stopTime="626.813">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Well, the power... I suppose the argument would be the power is to regulate commerce, and they're trying to improve safety on the highways and all the rest of it by getting this data, but you'd say that the Commerce Clause doesn't authorize that.
speaker="stephen_p_halbrook" startTime="626.813" stopTime="633.825">
    Mr. Stephen P. Halbrook

    Mr. Stephen P. Halbrook 
    No, Your Honor. 
    It's a very vague term, and basically the law says that the CLEO, or the chief law enforcement officer, shall use reasonable efforts to ascertain whether receipt or possession of a handgun is lawful, but then it goes on to say, including, and we interpret this as a minimum that has to be carried out, including research into whatever State and local record-keeping systems are available and in the national system designated by the Attorney General.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="691.855" stopTime="712.549">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    Do you think it would be open to a court, to this Court to construe that reasonable effort criterion as one which turns on the law enforcement officer's own view of what in relation to all of his other responsibilities, and in relation to his resources, is reasonable? 
    Can he be the judge of reasonableness?

    Mr. Stephen P. Halbrook 
    To some extent, perhaps, because the language is there, but I think that there's a vanishing point or an ending point.

    Well, that isn't optional. 
    I mean, if I'm... if I am compelled to make an honest judgment about whether I have the resources to do this, presumably I'm not going to, you know, perjure myself, and I will therefore as a practical matter be compelled to use resources if they are available.

    No, that wasn't the question.

    Mr. Stephen P. Halbrook 
    Which is the perception of the sheriff as not being a law-abiding sheriff. 
    In other words, if Congress enacts a law, constituents in the community, many of them think the law should be enforced if it's on the books, and the sheriff in all cases decides that he doesn't have to do anything and he completely rejects any execution of the law or consideration of execution of the law, then he does have the political damage, and this is a particular--

    Justice David H. Souter 
    Well, he would have... and I think your point is well-taken, but would that... would that place him in the position that the opinion in the New York case, for example, described as being essentially an agent or employee, as it were, of the national Government to carry out a national Government policy? 
    It might put him in a political spot, I think you're right.

    And the... one district court held that that meant exactly what it said in the Mack case, that that was a threat of criminal prosecution when the law was first enacted and, in fact, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms spokesman on this law said that there were criminal penalties that applied to law enforcement officers. 
    However, none of the appellate courts have held that the criminal penalties apply. 
    They have held basically that that issue is moot because the Justice Department interpreted the law not to apply... interpreted criminal penalties not to apply to CLEO's.

    I understood you to say that even if the Federal Government were to send out people to look at State records, that that would not be permissible, and I think that's a rather strange answer, if I understood it correctly. 
    Certainly, in... say, in voting rights cases, Federal, FBI people come and look at State voter registrations. 
    If no activity were required on the part of a State agent, just the Federal Government would send an agent to look at some, say, criminal history records, would that be violative of the Constitution?

    Mr. Halbrook's answers at oral argument are, I believe, fully consistent with the position that they have taken in their brief, and I think for understandable reasons.

    Mr. Walter E. Dellinger, III 
    --The Supremacy Clause resolved that issue, Justice Kennedy, where Congress is acting as it is here, fully within the core of one of its enumerated powers. 
    The three critical points, I think, are first that... just to tell you what I think I would hope to discuss... are first that, because this law does not impermissibly require the States to govern but, rather, essentially applies Federal law to local law enforcement officers and to gun dealers, requiring them to exchange vital information, and because Brady uses local law enforcement as the source of this information for the very good reason that these offices have, for now, the most ready access to the relevant information, and finally, because the interim Brady provisions are by definition so reasonable in their approach that it is necessary to resort to resurrecting a rigid rule like the repudiated position of Kentucky v. Dennison--
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="1828.453" stopTime="1862.338">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    Well, suppose that the Congress had said that because we have an emergency here and we're not up and running, that for 5 years gun permits, gun transfer forms will be processed by the House of Representatives in their field offices, in their home offices. 
    The entire burden of complying with the act was up to the Congress of the United States, the individual Congressmen and their staffs. 
    That would be a clear violation of separation of powers, would it not? 
    You don't think the Congress itself could administer this scheme through its congressional field offices?

    And that is because there are some very basic notions of accountability that underlie separation of powers.

    --Yes.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="2184.300" stopTime="2198.552">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    The notion that the Federal Government can just commandeer State and local government totally to administer some federally enacted program, all the details of which are spelled out, is the question.
speaker="walter_e_dellinger_iii" startTime="2198.552" stopTime="2237.906">
    Mr. Walter E. Dellinger, III 
    I think it is important to note what Congress cannot do. 
    First of all, in answer to your question and Justice Scalia's about the extent of the burden, there is some limit, as this Court suggested in Garcia, to how much of a purely financial burden Congress could put on the States if Congress made all the policy choices itself. 
    That... and answering those hypothetically is difficult, because it would depend on the degree of the national interest. 
    In 1917, Congress had every State government devote its entire resources for a brief period of time to registering people for the World War I draft. 
    You would want to know the degree of flexibility and discretion that were permitted to the States to carry out their own functions.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2237.906" stopTime="2243.119">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Also you would say there was some difference between wartime and peacetime as to congressional authority.
speaker="walter_e_dellinger_iii" startTime="2243.119" stopTime="2325.796">
    Mr. Walter E. Dellinger, III 
    Yes, Mr. Chief Justice. 
    It would depend upon that and all the other circumstances as to how great a burden Congress could put. 
    But I want to be clear that we believe that, under the vital principles of New York v. United States, there are provisions that would be unconstitutional, that are different from the provision here. 
    For example, even if it only cost the State $5 and their officials 5 minutes of their time, the Constitution would be violated if Congress had decided to off-load some of the political responsibility here by requiring each city council and county commission to vote in the provisions of the Brady act. 
    Even though that's fairly costless, requiring them to act like puppets and to call the roll saying, all those in favor raise your hand, and they're required to raise their hand when they're not in favor, or have some other draconian alternative, such as taking title to handgun liability. 
    That would violate the sovereignty principles. 
    Similarly, if Congress had said that the States must, by the year 2010, reduce the number of handgun sales in the State by 50 percent, it would be worse than simply having Congress take the political responsibility for the choices Congress made, because the States would then be forced to undertake what might be politically unpopular choices to solve a problem--

    I mean, what's the line? 
    From what I read, the CAMEL is lots and lots of money in obligations that Congress imposes upon the States all the time.

    So what's the principle of federalism that says they can do that but asking a police officer to report a missing child, or asking a police officer to report a safety statistic, or to look something up in a computer, suddenly is a violation of the Tenth Amendment, but imposing hundreds of billions of dollars of costs, as Congress does in many laws, is not?

    Those are not constitutionally impermissible, but if Congress were to pass the Perfectly Clean Air Act of 1998 and say to the States, you've got to have 99-44/100 percent pure air by the year 2000, Congress gets all the credit, and the States are then forced to choose between adopting mandatory car-pooling, or exorbitant gasoline taxes. 
    That's not what happens here when Congress takes the political responsibility, and I believe that once you're in this area, although we believe and have as our most difficult question thinking about what the outer limit would be if Congress were, contrary to 200 years of its history, to start imposing burdens so substantial, even though they did not implicate sovereignty and accountability, that the States would be impaired in carrying out their functions. 
    I think the more serious question is the one that I think that Mr. Halbrook dealt with as well as he can, which is, what is the principle that tells Congress, that has extraordinary legislative power to regulate these mobile items called handguns, that they simply may not impose these duties on gun dealers and local law enforcement officers who are sitting there on the information, if they'll look it up, to tell Congress when guns are being sold to violent felons and other dangerous buyers.

    What they are... here, Congress is simply telling the States to do something that local, State, and Federal Governments have done for a very long time.

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    No unpleasant policy choices are left for the local government. 
    They... the local government does not have to decide whether (a) to raise taxes, or (b) to divert police officers from hunting murderers and rapists to looking up these records, or (3)... I don't know what, to declare bankruptcy. 
    Aren't these all unpleasant policy choices that the Government has imposed upon the localities?

    Mr. Walter E. Dellinger, III 
    The only policy choice that I think you could honestly call a policy choice that Congress requires the chief local law enforcement officers to engage in here is one that creates the flexibility of the Brady act. 
    It is telling them that the efforts that they need to make need only be reasonable efforts. 
    They give them the flexibility to decide--

    Justice David H. Souter 
    Well, why isn't that enough of a policy choice to create the problem? 
    I mean, it seems to me that even assuming that the scheme is not voluntary, and I take it you're not conceding that it is, the local law enforcement--

    Mr. Walter E. Dellinger, III

speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="2588.430" stopTime="2622.531">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    --Right, so that the local law enforcement officer has got a real policy choice, number 1, in choosing between his Brady act responsibilities and whatever other local law enforcement abilities he's got, and number 2, I suppose even independently of that, he's at least got an initial policy choice to make about how intrusive an investigation is reasonable enough, and I would suppose that that latter decision could be politically a very explosive one in some communities. 
    So even on your own standard, why isn't that enough for unconstitutionality?
speaker="walter_e_dellinger_iii" startTime="2622.531" stopTime="2649.238">
    Mr. Walter E. Dellinger, III 
    Because the kind of policy choice that he's making... if you... I have to agree that you can call anything a policy choice. 
    I don't agree that the way this act works imposes or forces the CLEO to make these decisions about intrusiveness. 
    That is to say, he decides what efforts are reasonable. 
    He gets guidance from... the Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms Bureau of the Department of Treasury has put out guidance and they have said--
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="2649.238" stopTime="2673.565">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    Well, that may be fine, but the people who are being investigated I don't think either know or much care that there may be a BATF memo, and the... to the extent there is flexibility it's the local officer's choice and, to the extent that he is even exercising guidance from BATF in his relationship to his constituents, he is still being placed, in effect, in the position of a policymaker.
speaker="walter_e_dellinger_iii" startTime="2673.565" stopTime="2708.427">
    Mr. Walter E. Dellinger, III 
    --This is, I think, a difficult point in the case, but I think it is a policy choice so limited and so beneficial in its flexibility... that is, rather than saying you must check a certain number of records, what the Brady act says is, we're going to give you flexibility to make the kind of choice you have to make already, of how you allocate your resources. 
    What Brady does is simply to add one more additional item to the list of duties--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="2708.427" stopTime="2734.205">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Well, but it has to be done in 5 days, and so the local county has some massive prison escape, or riots going on, and the sheriff can't send his deputies out to deal with that because he's only got 5 days to apply, and doesn't the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms take a position in the memo that the criminal penalties do apply to these sheriffs? 
    I think there are some problems--
speaker="walter_e_dellinger_iii" startTime="2734.205" stopTime="2761.953">
    Mr. Walter E. Dellinger, III 
    --Justice O'Connor, first of all, the... it is emphatically the case that where there's a prison breakout the sheriff has the discretion to do no, zero, Brady act checks where it's not... where... this is entrusted to his sound discretion. 
    The reason that the reasonable efforts clause is put in there is precisely so that he could choose to carry out his State functions instead. 
    The--

    --Doesn't the reasonableness include the amount of funding that the county gives the sheriff?

    Wouldn't it be declared unreasonable if the county clearly has not provided the sheriff's office enough funds to do it?

    --Justice Souter, when the State says you may not do any Brady act checks, or you may not spend a penny doing Brady act checks, that statute is preempted under the Supremacy Clause by the Brady act. 
    The... every private who sorts potatoes thinks that... between large and small ones thinks that when you get a medium sized potato you're making a policy choice, but here, it is only in the flexibility about the amount of resources to be expended.

    Mr. Walter E. Dellinger, III 
    --My answer would be that it would not be reasonable to make an a priori determination going forward that this was always the last matter to be done. 
    The fact of the matter is, Justice O'Connor I think asked an important question, don't many CLEO's like this law, and they're happy to comply with it. 
    I mean, the answer is not just some, the answer is most, but I mean... in fact, they wanted this duty. 
    They want... the major law enforcement organizations wanted this duty placed on local law enforcement for some of the reasons Justice Kennedy suggested.

    Mr. Walter E. Dellinger, III 
    No, Mr. Chief Justice. 
    My point is that they wanted it for a very good reason, for the reason suggested in part by a question from Justice Kennedy, that the alternative of having these duties imposed upon a substantial Federal bureaucracy when they are more easily done in the 3,000 counties that have more local familiarity--
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="2950.237" stopTime="2964.757">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    Well, but I suppose the answer to that is, as the Constitution recognizes, that each branch of the Government, State and Federal, has to make a certain cost-benefit choice, and if Congress wants to have some huge program, I suppose it can pay the political cost for it.
speaker="walter_e_dellinger_iii" startTime="2964.757" stopTime="3026.356">
    Mr. Walter E. Dellinger, III 
    --In this case the... given the fact that you have, for example, 56 FBI field offices, one for every 30 counties, it would be extraordinarily inconvenient, as well as inefficient, and the relevant records are where local law enforcement is. 
    Congress didn't do this simply to off-load its burdens. 
    That's where the arrest warrants are for fugitives from justice that are not on the NCIC, where you could look up the local search warrants. 
    Justice O'Connor naturally leads to the question why not make it voluntary if most CLEO's want it? 
    I think there's something much more serious than a free ride or problem here. 
    This is a chain that may be no stronger than its weakest link, and I think the reason that local law enforcement offices wanted Congress to make this mandatory was that they understood that if you have one county in a region or a State that simply announces we are not going to look up and find out whether gun buyers are felons, that's the counties where felons will buy their guns--

    I do not think it otherwise varies, except that it is important not to wholly disentangle these issues. 
    This is so fully within Congress' commerce power. 
    Because at the time of the Constitution handguns were made locally by craftsmen and available only locally, it is due in significant measure to commerce among the States and the extraordinary mobility of handguns that guns made anywhere are now available everywhere that roads or waterways or airports can reach, and it was to mitigate the harm of that cheap national availability that Congress tried to take steps in '68 to prevent those guns from being sold to persons who were convicted felons--

    Mr. Walter E. Dellinger, III 
    --Justice Kennedy, I think it is significant that it's not merely their availability, but the fact that they were uniquely well-situated. 
    The frustration is that a gun dealer who is forbidden to sell a gun to a convicted felon but doesn't know who they are... he gets a form that they check off that says they're not convicted felons. 
    The information that this individual may be a convicted felon is right there in the same town. 
    It may be a few blocks away in the office of the local law enforcement chief. 
    So in the 5 years before we get this national system online, which will itself not contain all of the categories of 922(g)... it's a rough and ready way to get the most readily available information with minimal efforts to check reasonable records. 
    It makes all the sense in the world in this interim period. 
    Why not wait until there's a national system with these records available at the gun dealer's desk?
