    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    The question presented by this case is whether Congress has authorized the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to regulate so-called off exchange trading in options to buy or sell foreign currency. 
    In 1974, Congress enacted a series of amendments to the Commodity Exchange Act that created the Commission and gave it authority to regulate trading in a number of non-agricultural commodities. 
    One of those amendments, however, provided an exemption for “transactions in foreign currency” unless it involved sales for future delivery conducted on a board of trade. 
    The case before us today involves transactions and options to buy or sell foreign currencies that were not conducted over a board of trade. 
    The narrow question of law that we decide is whether such transactions are species of exempt transactions in foreign currencies. 
    The reasons stated in opinion filed with the Clerk, we hold, that they are included within the exemption. 
    We, therefore, reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals. 
    Our judgment is unanimous. 
    Justice Scalia has filed an opinion concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.
