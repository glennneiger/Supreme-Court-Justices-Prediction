    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    We'll hear argument next in Number 95-1608, Michele Timmons v. The Twin Cities Area New Party. 
    Mr. Slowes, you may proceed whenever you're ready.
speaker="richard_s_slowes" startTime="19.675" stopTime="116.747">
    Mr. Richard S. Slowes 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    This case is here on a writ of certiorari from the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals. 
    The issue is whether the laws of Minnesota and those of some 40 other States that limit each candidate to one party designation on the election ballot should be overridden by the desire of a party to place on that ballot as its candidate someone who is already on the ballot as a candidate of another party. 
    In this case, Minnesota's law preventing multiple party nominations prevented the respondent New Party from placing on the Minnesota election ballot as its candidate Representative Andy Dawkins, a Democratic-Farmer-Labor legislator who was already on the ballot as the DFL candidate. 
    The case involves a narrow aspect of political party activity. 
    It is not about the ability of a party to generally select its candidates. 
    It is not about the ability of a party to generally get its candidates on the ballot. 
    It is about the narrower issue of a political party that wishes to put on the ballot somebody else's candidate who is already there. 
    Minnesota's law that precludes that activity does not freeze the status quo. 
    In fact, in Minnesota in the 1994 election a third party qualified as a major party.

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Somebody else's candidate that is already there. 
    Who gets the first peck? 
    I mean--
speaker="richard_s_slowes" startTime="125.102" stopTime="138.733">
    Mr. Richard S. Slowes 
    In this instance what happens is, and what really controls here, Justice Scalia, is that the candidate must file an affidavit of candidacy, and on the affidavit of candidacy he must indicate his political party.

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    --Yes.
speaker="richard_s_slowes" startTime="139.352" stopTime="153.901">
    Mr. Richard S. Slowes 
    In this instance, Representative Dawkins had filed an affidavit of candidacy for the Democratic-Farmer-Labor primary. 
    That affidavit of candidacy was already on file when the New Party attempted to file another affidavit.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="153.901" stopTime="166.489">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    What if the New Party had filed... well, the same thing would happen if the New Party had... what if the New Party had put up Dawkins first? 
    Does that mean the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party wouldn't have been able to run Dawkins?

    He would have settled for the DFL.

speaker="richard_s_slowes" startTime="202.333" stopTime="208.268">
    Mr. Richard S. Slowes 
    --Your Honor, that would not be permitted by the law. 
    First of all, the law--

    What is the State interest in preventing that from happening?

    Mr. Richard S. Slowes 
    --The State interests are multiple, Justice Stevens, and what they have to do with, a number of issues that this Court has recognized as compelling State interests, although we don't believe that the Court has to conclude that they're compelling in this instance. 
    One of them is the concern that multiple party candidacies can lead to voter confusion about how to effectively cast your ballot. 
    When the name appears on the ballot numerous times... in fact, this recently happened in Connecticut in one of their elections where fusion was used. 
    Some of the voters thought that they had to fill in every line where the name appeared for the vote to count.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="243.050" stopTime="248.763">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    I guess you could have instructions on the ballot telling people what to do in that event.
speaker="richard_s_slowes" startTime="248.763" stopTime="253.528">
    Mr. Richard S. Slowes 
    Justice O'Connor, in fact that's kind of the narrow tailoring that the Eighth Circuit suggested for that. 
    We think--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="253.528" stopTime="264.425">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    But that would be possible, I guess, to have instructions along with a ballot that did permit parties to name the same person as their candidate.

    Mr. Richard S. Slowes 
    --Yes, Your Honor, it would be possible.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="265.673" stopTime="272.459">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Or, indeed, I suppose you could count the vote whether you voted on one line, two lines, or either, or both.

    I... it seems to me you have to be pretty dense to be confused on this one. 
    [Laughter]
speaker="richard_s_slowes" startTime="278.762" stopTime="286.229">
    Mr. Richard S. Slowes 
    --Well, apparently some voters in Connecticut were, Your Honor, and one of the issues in the recount was how do you deal with the ballots where there are multiple markings.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="286.229" stopTime="310.193">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Yes, but are we supposed to erase from our mind that there is at least one State that has had a lot of experience with fusion candidates, and there's no large confusion. 
    It's not a major problem. 
    So whatever one might speculate about the lack of intelligence of the voters, we do have the State of New York, where this has gone on without huge confusion.
speaker="richard_s_slowes" startTime="310.193" stopTime="312.135">
    Mr. Richard S. Slowes 
    That's indeed the case, Your Honor.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="312.135" stopTime="314.796">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    New Yorkers are smarter, I think. 
    That's probably the answer. 
    [Laughter]

    Mr. Richard S. Slowes 
    I think that I have to be careful, if I'm going back to Minnesota, about making that argument, Your Honor. 
    [Laughter] 
    But I think a State can make a judgment. 
    Indeed, there is that record in New York. 
    But it's a singular record. 
    There is no indication from other States on what will happen. 
    There's not a broad range of empirical experience with this.

    Mr. Richard S. Slowes 
    There are approximately 40, Your Honor. 
    It's difficult to get a precise count, because some of the statutes are ambiguous, and there aren't rulings about them.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="345.388" stopTime="348.477">

    Justice David H. Souter 
    What's your answer to the suggestion that someone made here that, assuming somebody gets confused and votes twice, all the State has to do is count it once? 
    Why isn't that the answer, the simple answer to the voter confusion point?
speaker="richard_s_slowes" startTime="367.902" stopTime="375.126">
    Mr. Richard S. Slowes

    Justice David H. Souter 
    Well, if they marked... if Joe Doaks is running on two lines and they mark Joe Doaks on each line, isn't it a fair inference that they want Doaks? 
    [Laughter]
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="385.243" stopTime="397.962">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Don't you have to know what party they voted for Doaks on in order to determine who gets on the ballot without having to go through a petition process the next time around, or not?

    Right.
speaker="richard_s_slowes" startTime="406.858" stopTime="409.940">
    Mr. Richard S. Slowes

    Okay.
speaker="richard_s_slowes" startTime="410.480" stopTime="417.333">
    Mr. Richard S. Slowes 
    Those... only Statewide elections count in Minnesota for major party status, so that's really not an issue here.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="417.333" stopTime="419.265">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    Well, but I take it the argument--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="419.265" stopTime="423.118">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    --But that argument would be a valid argument in other elections, although not in this one?
speaker="richard_s_slowes" startTime="423.118" stopTime="431.692">
    Mr. Richard S. Slowes 
    If it were a Statewide election there would be that issue, and then the State would have the question of how are we going to appropriately deal with this issue.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="431.692" stopTime="436.927">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    But I take it the respondent's argument would address a Statewide election if the respondent prevails, would it not?
speaker="richard_s_slowes" startTime="436.927" stopTime="461.412">
    Mr. Richard S. Slowes 
    It... they claim that it does not, Your Honor, because there are three statutes that are... affect fusion in Minnesota. 
    One of them specifically addresses that issue, but in terms of a Statewide election, the statutes that are at issue here would apply to Statewide elections as well, so if they are struck down then it would strike down fusion for Statewide elections and you--
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="461.412" stopTime="467.847">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    And then there would be a problem with determining the amount of votes garnered for each party, or a potential problem.
speaker="richard_s_slowes" startTime="467.847" stopTime="484.248">
    Mr. Richard S. Slowes 
    --The State would have to retune its system, figure out how it is going to deal with the issue of how you count the votes for a major party, along with the issues such as are we going to have an aggregated or a disaggregated ballot. 
    That is, does the candidate get a separate line for each party that nominates him.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="484.248" stopTime="523.212">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    But why are these such difficult issues for the State to deal with? 
    Why, for example, can't the State simply decide that in the case in which there is a question of party qualification based on the vote, that one... that the major party will be deemed to have preeminence, and the vote will count for that purpose, that a minor party will not be allowed in an ambiguous case to count the vote. 
    Why can't the State come up with some kind of a tie-breaker rule which would be easier or less restrictive on voter choice than the antifusion rule?
speaker="richard_s_slowes" startTime="523.212" stopTime="558.014">
    Mr. Richard S. Slowes 
    Your Honor, I'm not suggesting that the State's ability or inability to figure out how it wants to count these votes toward major party status is the preeminent interest that justifies the fusion ban, but I think it illustrates a slightly different point, and that is, what goes into creating a fair and orderly and efficient electoral process involves a lot of judgments, essentially a lot of political engineering about how the pieces of the system will work together. 
    This is just one of those pieces, and what we are suggesting is that where the States--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="558.014" stopTime="564.098">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    If that's not the preeminent interest, what is the preeminent interest? 
    If voter confusion isn't your justification, what are your stronger justifications?
speaker="richard_s_slowes" startTime="564.098" stopTime="571.064">
    Mr. Richard S. Slowes 
    --The justifications... I think voter confusion is an interest, Your Honor, and that's a side point of it.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="571.064" stopTime="624.419">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    May I ask with respect to voter confusion if that is not offset by voter information? 
    That is, it's one thing to have a candidate only on the line of major party. 
    It's quite another thing to have that same candidate on the line of minor party that has certain goals and objectives. 
    So when the public sees someone not only in the line of major party but also of minor party, whether it's to the left or right of the political spectrum, that is telling the voters more about that candidate, so isn't... is that irrelevant, that informing function of being, say, on the liberal party line or on the conservative party line in the State of New York, to take that as an example?
speaker="richard_s_slowes" startTime="624.419" stopTime="656.860">
    Mr. Richard S. Slowes 
    Justice Ginsburg, our position is not that it's irrelevant. 
    Our position is that that kind of communicative use of the ballot is not constitutionally compelled. 
    In fact, we don't elect parties at the elections, we elect candidates. 
    We use the ballot to decide which of these candidates is going to hold the official office that the election is for. 
    In fact, if Mr. Dawkins were elected on the DFL ballot, or as a DFLer, there's nothing that prevents him from the next day turning around and becoming a Republican.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="656.860" stopTime="695.756">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    I'm interested in Justice Stevens' question. 
    Where we are so far is, it was suggested first by Justice Scalia that it might be important for the State to determine which party garners the most votes, and then you were asked a question, well, couldn't we presume that the preemininent party gets the votes. 
    I very much doubt that minor parties would agree with such a presumption. 
    And then you said, well, that's not really our interest. 
    That's a side thing. 
    We're talking about, really, the whole election dynamic. 
    And then Justice Stevens said, well, what is your particular interest, and I never did get the answer to that.
speaker="richard_s_slowes" startTime="695.756" stopTime="697.356">
    Mr. Richard S. Slowes 
    I'm sorry, Justice Kennedy, I--
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="697.356" stopTime="699.569">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    Well, you've had a number of questions, but--
speaker="richard_s_slowes" startTime="699.569" stopTime="723.733">
    Mr. Richard S. Slowes 
    --And I... let me try to address that. 
    Other interests that are involved: one of the concerns, and this relates to the confusion as well, is that confusion sets up a situation that is ripe for ballot manipulation. 
    It creates a situation where candidates can, in a sense, create bogus minor parties so that they can get their name on the ballot more than one time to give them an advantage, or perhaps taking it even a step further--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="723.733" stopTime="729.847">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    --But that bogus minor party would have to meet all the State statutory requirements for becoming a party eligible to get on the ballot.
speaker="richard_s_slowes" startTime="729.847" stopTime="731.570">
    Mr. Richard S. Slowes 
    --That's correct, Justice Stevens, and--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="731.570" stopTime="736.922">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    And so they would be splintering their own strength by going out of the way to create another party, wouldn't they, and has this ever happened?
speaker="richard_s_slowes" startTime="736.922" stopTime="741.655">
    Mr. Richard S. Slowes 
    --Let me go back to the first question, Your Honor. 
    In Minnesota we make it very easy for minor parties--

    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Right.

    Mr. Richard S. Slowes

    Right.

    Mr. Richard S. Slowes 
    --to get someone on the ballot. 
    That's all there is to it. 
    It doesn't require party organization.

speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="754.543" stopTime="758.106">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    And you're saying a major party would do that why?
speaker="richard_s_slowes" startTime="758.106" stopTime="797.991">
    Mr. Richard S. Slowes 
    --Because major party candidates might very well, if they're, for example... this wasn't the case with Mr. Dawkins, but if they're in a case, an election where they do have a tough contest with an opposing major party, they might decide that it's to their advantage either to have their name on the ballot more than one time, or they might even prefer to have their name on the ballot not only as a Democratic candidate, but also as the no-new-taxes candidate, and the tough-on-crime candidate, and the fusion system, especially in a State like Minnesota that is friendly to minor parties getting on the ballot and makes it easy to do it, opens the door for that kind of ballot manipulation.

    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor

    Mr. Richard S. Slowes

    Mr. Richard S. Slowes

    Mr. Richard S. Slowes

    And as I was saying, because it is so easy to get on that general election ballot for nonmajor party candidates, it opens the door for this kind of ballot manipulation. 
    The Eighth Circuit and the respondent suggest that we can take care of that by simply raising our signature threshold, make it tougher to get on the ballot.

    May I put another question to you that... what concerns me in the background? 
    I remember when General Eisenhower ran for President there was a real possibility both major parties might have nominated him, and it would seem to me that each of those parties would have had a strong associational interest in picking the nominee of its choice. 
    Now, why is it that they shouldn't be allowed to both nominate General Eisenhower if they wanted to? 
    What is the powerful interest that would prevent each party from picking its own nominee?

    It reduced party responsibility, or reduced responsibility for governing, and there's... actually there's criticism of the New York system, that it does the same thing by allowing major parties to cross-nominate, it can prevent problems. 
    Everybody doesn't see this as a universal panacea. 
    And Justice Stevens, the answer to your question is, again, what this Court has looked at in the past in evaluating election statutes is, is the State setting up formidable barriers to participation, and when it's looked at the rights of parties to nominate the candidates, it really hasn't gone so far as to say that a party has a right to select a particular candidate. 
    It has to have the door open to--

    It just can't select the one it wants and also get it on the ballot.

    Mr. Richard S. Slowes 
    --Yes, Your Honor. 
    We think that Storer is... supports us. 
    In Storer, the Court upheld California disaffiliation statutes that prevented two independent... two former Democratic Party members from running for Congress as independent candidates. 
    The suit was brought not just by those potential candidates, but by some of their supporters. 
    The disaffiliation statute upheld in Storer was far more restrictive of supporters' rights, of parties' rights, because it eliminated a much huger pool of candidates than does a fusion ban, and yet the Court upheld it. 
    And in fact, Your Honor, in Anderson--

    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    But for a limited amount of time. 
    I remember you had to... when you change, disaffiliate from one, it's a waiting period. 
    It's a time period, the disqualification. 
    You can become qualified again. 
    This is a rule that operates forever, no more than one party per candidate.

    Mr. Richard S. Slowes 
    --The disaffiliation requirement in California was 12 months before the primary, so somebody had to disaffiliate, I believe it was, something like 17 months before the general election. 
    It was quite a long time. 
    But there's another difference that makes the Storer case even more of a restriction than this, in that it not only had a much broader range of candidates who were excluded, but they were totally excluded from the ballot.

    It had a justification of preserving the stability of the party system and the electoral system, and that's some of the justification for this statute. 
    I kind of haven't been able to get through them, but that's certainly one of the interests that Minnesota is interested in, and that is avoiding the excessive factionalism that the Court found was problematic in a case like Storer.

    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Why isn't the answer to that, or at least part of the way to an answer, that the major party consents to this, so you don't have the factionalism that you have when... in the... what has been called the sore loser statute that was involved in Storer. 
    Here, if the major party says no go, then there's nothing... nothing the minor party can do.

    Mr. Richard S. Slowes 
    Justice Ginsburg, in Storer, where the same answer could have been that if we just do a consent requirement then that will avoid splintering, the Court, facing a statute that was much more restrictive than Minnesota's, didn't require narrow tailoring. 
    The dissent by Justice Brennan suggested that there were things that could have been done to the California statute to tailor it more narrowly.

    There's nothing in the record about any attempts to get DFL permission, or whether the DFL gave permission and, indeed, there has been much made about the fact that the DFL did not object, but, of course, the law prohibited this, so there was no reason for the DFL to object. 
    Again, getting back to the interests of the State, what we have here is we have issues of confusion, and while the Eighth Circuit... and Justice O'Connor, you suggest that they can use instructions, but we think that part of the reality of voting is that first of all not all voters are as comfortable as everybody might be with a lengthy written ballot with detailed instructions. 
    That's just the reality of it.

    Justice David H. Souter 
    --Mr. Slowes, may I ask you a general question, I think that goes to the weight that we should give, or at least the weight that I should give to all of the justifications that the State is raising here? 
    If we were deciding this case, I guess without the benefit of history, I could listen to your arguments and I would say, there's something plausible about them, and the people who write election laws probably know a lot more about voter behavior than I do, and I may not think these are overwhelming justifications, perhaps. 
    I mean, they don't just hit me that hard, but I probably ought to defer to people who know more about this subject than I do. 
    The trouble that I have in giving any kind of deference that way, however, is the history, and if I understand the history correctly, the reason we've got these antifusion laws in so many States was basically a very widespread effort sometime ago simply to maintain the relative hegemony of the two parties, the Republicans and the Democrats. 
    They weren't worried about voter confusion. 
    They didn't want other parties, and is it unfair... do you think it's wrong for me in assessing the weight that I should give to your justifications to bear that history in mind, and perhaps to be skeptical that the reasons that you very ably give are really the reasons that the legislatures in these many States either gave in the first place or maintain to this day for keeping their laws on the books?
speaker="richard_s_slowes" startTime="1461.070" stopTime="1499.084">
    Mr. Richard S. Slowes 
    Justice Souter, there are a number of responses to that question. 
    First of all, with respect, yes, I think it is unfair for you to look back that many years, particularly because this Court has said in United States v. O'Brien and other cases that a legitimate constitutional State statute will not be struck down merely because there's some allegation of improper motive. 
    And here, to compound that, the allegation of improper motive is a) indirect... there's nothing in the record to suggest what the Minnesota legislature was thinking or said about this statute. 
    There's nothing in the record that reflects what the Minnesota legislature--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="1499.084" stopTime="1525.750">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Well, you wouldn't concede the major point, would you, that there is something wrong about the State establishing its electoral machinery in such fashion as to facilitate and encourage a two-party system as opposed to the kind of systems... proportional voting, for example. 
    That alone favors a two-party system. 
    Is there anything wrong with that, so long as you don't ban third parties?
speaker="richard_s_slowes" startTime="1525.750" stopTime="1544.792">
    Mr. Richard S. Slowes 
    --There is a balancing that has to be done, Justice Scalia. 
    We believe, and this Court has recognized in some cases that, indeed, and that's part of what was animating Storer in some sense, that the State does have an interest, a generalized interest in preserving, in a sense, political stability, and that--
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="1544.792" stopTime="1563.235">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    Well, are you... maybe I misunderstood your argument. 
    I didn't understand you to be putting any weight on the, in effect the preservation of a major two-party system as such, so I just didn't think... I mean, Justice Scalia has raised a good point, but I didn't think it was the point that you were making.

    Suppose I think that this represents a judgment of the legislature to go in the two-party direction as opposed to proportional representation. 
    But as you say, you're not putting any weight on that, so should I simply say forget it and move on to the arguments... what am I supposed to do?

    Mr. Laurence H. Tribe 
    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    I don't think this case is about political engineering. 
    I suppose if we really had a case in which it was demonstrated that we would become Italy or Fourth Republic France unless we compromise the First Amendment we would have a very much more apocalyptic picture, but I think what's interesting is that in the argument that you heard this morning you didn't hear very much about what the State's brief says are the real reasons. 
    I think in answer to Justice Stevens' question, if confusion isn't that big a problem... and it doesn't seem New Yorkers are all that confused and, with respect, I guess they're not that much smarter than Minnesotans... if confusion isn't the problem--

    Mr. Laurence H. Tribe 
    --That's right. 
    Minnesotans might like things to be more orderly. 
    What their brief does is talk about all kinds of somewhat fuzzier values, values, values, they say, that are really more important than the literal rights of association and speech in the First Amendment. 
    They're basically saying... and they say it in their brief at pages 9, 12, 14, 16 to 18, 24, 44. 
    The repeated theme is that even if the ban on consensual fusion literally abridges the right of people to get together in a party and pick their standard bearer and get him on the ballot even if he's already on the ballot, and even if that's one of the rights that you would normally have under the First Amendment, we have to ask whether protecting those rights here would, in their language, serve First Amendment values, and they say it wouldn't, because... here again I quote from their brief... it really wouldn't enrich political discussion with different ideas unless new parties, and I quote, presented candidates overlooked by the major parties. 
    In other words, new faces. 
    That's what third parties are good for, the subtext being that the major parties really have covered the ideological waterfront between them, and unless you're ready to come up with a new face... if it's just Dwight Eisenhower, or Earl Warren, or here... not to put him in the same company... Andy Dawkins all over again, then what else is new? 
    We really think that we should orchestrate the consensual alliances of citizens in political association in such a way as to move things away from... and again, their brief complains about single issue campaigns. 
    They say there would be a tendency, and again I guess I heard this again in the argument this morning, a tendency to end up with various groups that would, heaven forbid, say they were in favor of lower taxes, or some other single issue. 
    Well, you can have a view one way or the other on whether that's--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1956.132" stopTime="1976.175">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    There's some sense to that, isn't there, Mr. Tribe? 
    If a candidate is both DFL and then gets behind small, third party, lower taxes party, tough on crime, it makes the ballot into a form of really communication, which in Burdick we said the State didn't have to do.
speaker="laurence_h_tribe" startTime="1976.175" stopTime="2031.441">
    Mr. Laurence H. Tribe 
    --Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I think that as a theoretical proposition, if there were a demonstrable danger that the ballot would become a laundry list of slogans, and if you could prove that that was at all likely to happen, that it was more than some kind of theoretical possibility, that that would be different. 
    But in Williams v. Rhodes the Court said that theoretically imaginable dangers of multitudinous fragmentary groups getting on the ballot aren't enough, and that you can deal with that by making it less easy to get on the ballot. 
    To deal with it in a slanted way, not by neutrally raising the requirement but by saying you can get on the ballot, it doesn't matter whether you do or do not pass the threshold numerical limit, but what we don't want you to do is be on the ballot if the person you favor is the same one someone else has--

    It's not clear that people should be able to get lots of bites at the same sort of preliminary apple. 
    That is, it may well be that as one of the rules of the road a State could say that at the primary stage if you're running for office through that particular avenue you have to pick one primary or the other.

    Well, to be honest, Mr. Chief Justice, I'm not sure that even that would be justified, but if that would be, it would not be justified unless you gave a veto power. 
    That is, if you said that when both parties are perfectly happy to have this happen, when neither of them vetoes the simultaneous entry of a candidate into both primaries, then the idea that the State would simply be protecting parties from fragmentation wouldn't justify it.

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    In an open primary system a party can't veto a candidate. 
    I mean, in most States if I want to run for the nomination of the Socialist Party and they have an open primary ballot the Socialist Party can't get together and say, well, we don't want him. 
    I have a right to run, and if a majority favor me, I get nominated.

    Mr. Laurence H. Tribe 
    Well, I think, Mr. Chief Justice, that the State does not have an interest that would suffice to prevent that. 
    Where it's possible... I mean, if one said that what this does is pose the problem that Storer involved, that is, a problem in which a political party with its primary loses integrity and finality because those who don't win can pick up their marbles and go elsewhere, that problem can be solved. 
    But unless there's a general system whereby the State can say only certain people are eligible to run in our primary, and it might well be permissible for the State to allow a party to have those rules, to have a rule of this kind is not at all a neutral, politically neutral regulation.

speaker="laurence_h_tribe" startTime="2319.569" stopTime="2325.853">
    Mr. Laurence H. Tribe 
    Well, I think the Court has said that you can't deliberately disadvantage some minor parties.
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="2325.853" stopTime="2436.567">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    That's exactly the point that's bothering me, and I'm putting this a little more strongly than I think, but I want to get your response to this. 
    There are a lot of rules deliberately disadvantaging third and fourth and fifth parties... first past the post, single member districts. 
    There are good arguments for and against such things. 
    Proportional representation in many parties allows parties to grow more quickly and is a better representation of people's views. 
    On the other hand, two parties, which is a much worse representation, and interferes with people's ability to choose what they want, has the advantage that we know whom to hold responsible for good or bad government. 
    Now, you, like I, have read both those positions argued at depth, so where the Constitution is at stake, how can we say that a State doesn't have the right to choose between those two different views of democratic representation? 
    And I know it's a matter of degree, but what I keep coming back to is thinking this was a fairly marginal method of giving the Republicans, if you like, or Republicans and Democrats, an advantage as to the swing voters who were somewhat indifferent, who would go and look at the columns on the ballot and they'd see DFL here, or they'd see New Party here, and if they saw New Party with a popular candidate, they'd vote New Party all the way down the line. 
    You see, that would help that party, and it might better reflect views, but it would undermine the kind of responsibility that the classic argument for a two-party system democratically holds is important, so how am I to judge that? 
    How can I say that the State has no right in these kinds of things to decide either of those two models that it believes is the more... better democracy?
speaker="laurence_h_tribe" startTime="2436.567" stopTime="2544.015">
    Mr. Laurence H. Tribe 
    Well, Justice Breyer, I think that I would urge a distinction between the basic architecture of the system, that is, the decision to have single member rather than multimember districts, and having decided that, therefore ruling out proportional representation within the single member districts. 
    The decision of the basic design, when you said that that was intended to have an effect on minor parties, I think the evidence is that it was, as with most of these things, multifarious in its intentions. 
    There are some people who think that the choice of a single rather then multimember districts has a number of positive effects on avoiding the submergence of certain minority groups. 
    When all of those incommensurables are balanced at the threshold designing the system in general, deciding, for example, whether primaries or petitions are to be used as a way of getting on the ballot, deciding where co draw district lines, at that point, as I think Justice O'Connor said in Vandemer, it would be very hard to have justiciable standards for assessing what the State is doing. 
    Once the building has been designed, once the basic architecture is set, once you have the time, place, and manner regulations, the fundamental architecture, then, if you take aim at the content of political alliances, when you tell two parties within this system you can get together about other things, you can have a mutual nonaggression pact, neither of you will run against the other, you could pool your resources... in 1944--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="2544.015" stopTime="2566.302">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Why does that make any difference? 
    It's sort of like saying you can paint the whole building green but you can't paint the window frets green. 
    It's okay in the most fundamental design of the system, in those aspects that have the most impact, to act out of two-party system motivation, but it's... in the details of it, oh, no, you cannot act out of a two-party system moti... that makes no sense at all.
speaker="laurence_h_tribe" startTime="2566.302" stopTime="2593.159">
    Mr. Laurence H. Tribe 
    --I think, Justice Scalia, with all respect it's less a matter of, you could paint the big picture, we won't touch you, but you can't paint the little dots. 
    It's more a matter of, you can design the overall framework, and we're not going to second-guess the kind of republican form of government you create. 
    But then, when you have essentially content-based rules, when you tell people you can nominate anybody unless the person is popular enough that he might appeal to another party, when you do that--

    It tells the voters, the members of the New Party, that when they go into the voting booth... let's suppose the New Party decides Mr. Dawkins is the one they want to endorse. 
    They spend money on him, and under the laws of the State they can... within 100 feet of the polls they can put up signs saying, we believe in Andy Dawkins. 
    But they don't want to give up the right to have someone on the ballot, so they nominate John Smith, and John Smith is on the ballot, and the voters of the New Party have essentially the choice that members of minor parties have been relegated to in 40 States since the 19... the early 1900's. 
    They go into the ballot box, and they can either waive their right to vote altogether and give it up, or they can vote for John Smith, whom they and their party doesn't really believe in, or they can vote for Dawkins, and they're told that that would be a good thing to do, but then... then the other party gets credit.

    Justice Antonin Scalia

    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor

    There is a right in Minnesota very easily to get someone on the general ballot if you're a minor party. 
    That's not difficult, and at the general election ballot at least all the members of this party can vote for the candidate they truly support.

    Mr. Laurence H. Tribe

    If they vote for Dawkins, and assume for the moment as in many of the cases it's a Statewide candidacy, when they vote for Dawkins they strengthen a party they strongly, or perhaps somewhat disagree with. 
    They also entitle it to public funds because those votes are counted on the DFL line.

    That is, the votes that members of the New Party are permitted to cast for someone on the DFL party line are votes that increase the money, the public money that goes to the DFL later and that helps earn and retain major party status for it.

    In this case, the State says in its ballot laws that next to each candidate's name must be either the word independent, or a party name or principle of three words or less, and that people can write in for someone but they cannot write in the name of someone who's already there. 
    So that there is a specific rule that says even though we've designed our ballot in such a way that you can indicate who you want even if that person hasn't been nominated, you can't indicate who you want if it happens to be the nominee of another party. 
    It is a targeted way, not of saying the purpose of our ballots is not to serve as billboards. 
    It's to exercise power. 
    That the Court said in Burdick is fine. 
    It's a way of saying, we are designing the system, we're engineering it in such a way as to preclude agreement among people of a certain kind expressed not through some use of the ballot that the State hasn't already legitimated, but through the standard use of the ballot so that it in effect is a targeted way of shaping the kinds of consensual alliances people can have. 
    If someone said--

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    I presume that your argument would also extend to the write-in prohibition, that if we found for you in this case we would also say that the State could not prevent you from writing in the Democratic candidate.

    Well, most people actually suggest that it would be far more marginal than the plaintiffs in this case anticipated, mostly because the benefits of a third party nomination are often going to be somewhat dubious, and so--

    Mr. Laurence H. Tribe 
    --Mr. Chief Justice, I don't think someone... if Mr. Dawkins, after a favorable decision, if there were one in a case like this, if he were on the ballot already in a way that would allow a voter to indicate upon choosing him whether the voter is voting for him as a member of the DFL or as a member of the New Party, that there would also be an additional right to say, oh, I don't want to vote for him as a member of the New Party.

    I think the fact is that if... if there is a write-in mechanism the State has... they don't have to have one, but if they have one, I don't think they can tell you that you better write a name that isn't already there, and I don't think that would go away even if we prevail.

    Mr. Tribe, in California, some ballots have over 200 items to mark. 
    If you had a State like Minnesota, or a system like Minnesota where only 500 people are required to petition for a party, I think there is a very, very real danger of confusion which just could bog the process down completely.
speaker="laurence_h_tribe" startTime="3291.269" stopTime="3334.406">
    Mr. Laurence H. Tribe 
    Well, in California, Justice Kennedy, they disallow fusion and they still have these terribly long ballots. 
    I don't know that there's any reason at all, given the history, to believe that confusion would be enhanced by fusion. 
    And in particular, when Justice Souter asked about the history, I think that should tell us a good bit. 
    Not just why were these things enacted, but where is the evidence that in all the years prior to about 1905, that hundreds of fusion candidacies existed, and the evidence in New York up to the present that either the stability of the political system has been seriously injured, or that people have been obvious... you know, utterly confused about what to do--

    --I'll check the history, but it does seem to me that in those times they did not have initiative, they did not have referendum, they did not have the ability of many citizens to make arguments directly to the public via television and radio.
speaker="laurence_h_tribe" startTime="3346.554" stopTime="3382.889">
    Mr. Laurence H. Tribe 
    --Well, I think, Justice Kennedy, that dealing with a problem of unduly long ballots by techniques that are not at least facially neutral, that don't say, well, let's up it from 500 to 1,500, dealing with it by saying we will allow some kinds of political coalitions and not others, we will allow people to have planks in common in their party platforms, words in common in their party names, but we won't allow them to coalesce around a mutually acceptable candidate, it seems to me not a constitutional--
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="3382.889" stopTime="3397.257">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Is it done... with respect to judges, is the States that generally have no fusion, it's not uncommon to have the same good judge the choice of two, maybe three parties. 
    Do you know how that works in States that have general no fusion laws?
speaker="laurence_h_tribe" startTime="3397.257" stopTime="3478.429">
    Mr. Laurence H. Tribe 
    --With non... in the election for nonpartisan offices it is often the case that several parties nominate or endorse, but it's often, and typically the case with judges, that no party label is attached to the judge's name in those States, and that is a possible solution. 
    That is, if one agreed with the position that I think Justice Scalia was in part suggesting, that the point of the ballot isn't necessarily to get information about which party, then there is a solution that's neutral. 
    It perhaps isn't the less restrictive alternative, but it's certainly less targeted against minor parties, and that's to say, no party label on the ballot. 
    Anybody can endorse anyone they want. 
    In Tashjian, both the majority and the dissent assumed that that was a paradigmatic exercise of First Amendment rights. 
    Here, we move from endorsement to nomination, but the only difference is that nomination in a State that does put the party name on the ballot counts for a great many things, and to insist that it not count in precisely those cases when otherwise disparate groups that are not so far from the main stream that they are satisfied to nominate protest candidates coalesce around a nominee, to suggest that that's the one case where it's not permissible--
