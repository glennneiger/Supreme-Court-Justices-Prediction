Atherton v. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    We'll hear argument now in Number 95-928, John W. Atherton, Jr. v. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. 
    Mr. Stevens.
speaker="ronald_w_stevens" startTime="10.572" stopTime="80.202">
    Mr. Ronald W. Stevens 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court: 
    At issue in this case is whether the FDIC, in its capacity as Receiver of a federally chartered savings association, has a Federal common law claim based on simple negligence against the former directors and officers of that association for breach of their fiduciary duty of care, which is the proposition for which the Government contends, or whether the FDIC's sole Federal claim is the statutory claim for gross negligence under 12 U.S.C. section 1821(k), which is the proposition for which we contend. 
    That latter provision was adopted as part of the Financial Institution Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989, otherwise known as FIRREA. 
    Although a divided panel of the Third Circuit found that 1821(k) does not even apply to federally chartered depository institutions, the Government has conceded in this Court that it does. 
    Where petitioner and the Government part company is on the question of whether the FDIC has a preexisting Federal common law claim for simple negligence and, if it does, whether that claim was displaced by section 1821(k).

    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Mr. Stevens, I think, if I remember correctly, the Third Circuit Court of Appeals assumed there was a Federal common law standard here, and left it open on remand to the district court to determine the scope of the standard, is that right?
speaker="ronald_w_stevens" startTime="99.080" stopTime="100.949">
    Mr. Ronald W. Stevens 
    Yes, Justice O'Connor, they did... they--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="100.949" stopTime="108.935">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Did the petitioners here concede in the court of appeals that a Federal common law standard applied?
speaker="ronald_w_stevens" startTime="108.935" stopTime="125.064">
    Mr. Ronald W. Stevens 
    --No, we did not. 
    We argued to the Third Circuit, which argument occurred subsequent to this Court's decision in O'Melveny and Myers, that under that decision there was no general Federal common law right of action that accrued prior to the enactment of FIRREA.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="125.064" stopTime="132.318">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    And do you think that the question whether there exists a Federal common law rule was preserved--
speaker="ronald_w_stevens" startTime="132.318" stopTime="133.503">
    Mr. Ronald W. Stevens 
    Yes, I do.

    --here?

    Mr. Ronald W. Stevens 
    Yes.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="134.503" stopTime="139.241">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    It wasn't... it wasn't set out that clearly in your original cert petition.
speaker="ronald_w_stevens" startTime="139.241" stopTime="208.051">
    Mr. Ronald W. Stevens 
    Well, in the... the second of the two questions presented in the cert petition is as follows, quote, Whether the court of appeals erred in concluding that section 1821(k)... and I'm leaving out some descriptive language of that now... has no application whatsoever to RTC actions against officers and directors of failed federally chartered FDIC insured institutions, and that the liability of officers and directors of such institutions is instead governed exclusively by Federal common law. 
    The second of the reasons for granting the writ which was set forth at page 8 of the petition is, quote, the court of appeals' conclusion that Federal common law instead of section 1821(k) supplies the applicable law in this case violates this Court's longstanding rules respecting the creation and application of such judgemade law, and finally, section 2 of the petition is expressly entitled, quote, the Third Circuit's decision is in direct conflict with this Court's prior rulings respecting the application of Federal common law, and particularly its recent decision in O'Melveny and Myers v. FDIC.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="208.051" stopTime="211.437">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    And what State law do you say applies in this case?
speaker="ronald_w_stevens" startTime="211.437" stopTime="219.443">
    Mr. Ronald W. Stevens 
    It's our contention that the State law that would apply in cases such as this would be the law of the place of the location of the principal place of business of the association.

    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Which is?

    Mr. Ronald W. Stevens 
    New Jersey. 
    In this case, however, the FDIC has waived its State law claim.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="226.529" stopTime="230.850">

    Mr. Ronald W. Stevens 
    No, Your Honor. 
    That was a unilateral voluntary action taken by the FDIC and articulated in its brief to the district court below when the matter was being briefed in connection with the motion to dismiss. 
    It was not an action taken subsequent to the district court's order. 
    It was a voluntary, unilateral decision by the FDIC.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="253.097" stopTime="265.488">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    But do I understand correctly that the district court's opinion said that 1821(k) was the exclusive law applicable to a Federal, federally chartered institution?
speaker="ronald_w_stevens" startTime="265.488" stopTime="266.106">
    Mr. Ronald W. Stevens 
    That's correct.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="266.106" stopTime="268.625">

    And you are not defending that position.
speaker="ronald_w_stevens" startTime="268.625" stopTime="270.175">
    Mr. Ronald W. Stevens 
    No, Your Honor, we are not. 
    It is our--
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="270.175" stopTime="276.545">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    So no one is supporting the district court, who said that 1821(k) is just it, there's nothing else?
speaker="ronald_w_stevens" startTime="276.545" stopTime="299.228">
    Mr. Ronald W. Stevens 
    --Well, let me be clear. 
    It's our position that the only Federal law claim that the FDIC has postreceivership is a claim for gross negligence under section 1821(k). 
    It is our position, however, that that's not the only claim that's available to the Government. 
    The Government would also have a claim under State law for simple negligence if the State law in question provided such a claim.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="299.228" stopTime="305.149">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Yes, so to that extent you agree that the district court was wrong.
speaker="ronald_w_stevens" startTime="305.149" stopTime="305.849">
    Mr. Ronald W. Stevens 
    Yes, Your Honor.

    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    May I ask--

speaker="ronald_w_stevens" startTime="311.552" stopTime="323.426">
    Mr. Ronald W. Stevens 
    Well, to be candid, Your Honor, I think that's why the FDIC waived its State law claim. 
    [Laughter] 
    It's our position that the standard in New Jersey is gross negligence.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="323.426" stopTime="324.962">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    So it really doesn't matter, then, if there's a--
speaker="ronald_w_stevens" startTime="324.962" stopTime="332.116">
    Mr. Ronald W. Stevens 
    I don't think it does. 
    I'm sure the FDIC will argue that it's in fact simple negligence, but at this point it's an academic issue because they've waived the claim.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="332.116" stopTime="355.064">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    --Well, it might not be. 
    They've waived that legal basis for the claim, but I would think there's a question whether the basically alleging the same, you know, misconduct by the defendants in the case. 
    Whether it's too late for them to say an alternative legal base for the claim would be State law even though we haven't argued it up to now, I'm not sure what the answer to that is is all I'm saying. 
    That's why I was curious about whether there is a difference, but the answer to that is, you would disagree with your opponents, probably.
speaker="ronald_w_stevens" startTime="355.064" stopTime="355.581">
    Mr. Ronald W. Stevens 
    Correct.

    Okay.

    Justice David H. Souter 
    Do you--

    Mr. Ronald W. Stevens

    Mr. Ronald W. Stevens 
    Well, it--

    --federally chartered--
speaker="ronald_w_stevens" startTime="372.107" stopTime="375.676">
    Mr. Ronald W. Stevens 
    --Institutions?

    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    --savings and loans?
speaker="ronald_w_stevens" startTime="376.128" stopTime="385.817">
    Mr. Ronald W. Stevens 
    No, and the reason for that is that this Court has made it clear that for Federal common law to apply, two tests have to be met.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="385.817" stopTime="393.070">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Well now, wait a minute. 
    That's a separate question. 
    You could say yes, Federal law applies, but the Federal law in turn refers to State law.
speaker="ronald_w_stevens" startTime="393.070" stopTime="480.628">
    Mr. Ronald W. Stevens 
    Well, that would be predicated upon a finding that the criteria for the application of Federal law, Federal common law is present, but that there is no conflict, and that there's no conflict between the application of State law and Federal law as in Kimbell Foods, where this Court held that the issue there was governed by Federal law, but that there was no reason not to use State law as the rule of Federal decision. 
    But before you can get to that point, you have to decide that there's a uniquely Federal interest present. 
    And it's our position that in this case no such uniquely Federal interest is present because this Court has defined such interest principally to involve the rights and duties of the United States and, as this Court said in O'Melveny, the FDIC is not the United States, and even if it were it, would be begging the issue because the FDIC is asserting claims in this case in its capacity as a receiver for the institution, standing in the shoes of the institution. 
    In fact, the FDIC's position would not only require the application of Federal common law to cases where it's bringing the claims, it would require the application of Federal common law if the institution when solvent was bringing claims like this against its directors and officers or if a shareholder of a solvent institution was bringing a derivative action where the FDIC itself wouldn't be a party, where no United States entity would be a party, where no United States funds would be directly involved, and where not even the insurance fund would be directly involved.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="480.628" stopTime="512.416">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    The only thing to be said on the other side, however, is what... it's... other corporations that are established under Delaware law, New Jersey law, or whatever, they have a clear law to apply when there is a suit by shareholders as far as internal management is concerned. 
    You know what the law is. 
    Is it likely that Congress set up this Federal corporation without any internal procedures governed by Federal law?
speaker="ronald_w_stevens" startTime="512.416" stopTime="533.246">
    Mr. Ronald W. Stevens 
    It's not only likely, it's what they did. 
    They have adopted a statute, HOLA, the Homeowners Loan Act, back in 1933 which has all kinds of statutory provisions in it that talk about what banks and... I'm sorry, what S&amp;L's have to do, how they conduct their operations and so forth, but there's nothing in that statute that talks about a standard of care for officers and directors.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="533.246" stopTime="534.013">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    When was that adopted?
speaker="ronald_w_stevens" startTime="534.013" stopTime="538.650">
    Mr. Ronald W. Stevens 
    1933, and it... and we have had 63 years when Congress--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="538.650" stopTime="540.234">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    It was before Erie, wasn't it?
speaker="ronald_w_stevens" startTime="540.234" stopTime="546.054">
    Mr. Ronald W. Stevens 
    --It was before Erie, but Congress has had every opportunity to amend the statute numerous times after Erie and it hasn't done so, and--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="546.054" stopTime="554.509">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    So I guess what Congress was thinking at the time was that there is up in the sky there a common law concerning directors' liability.
speaker="ronald_w_stevens" startTime="554.509" stopTime="560.980">
    Mr. Ronald W. Stevens 
    --Well, it might have thought that there was a State common law, but it would have been hard to think that there was a Federal common law.

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    No, it didn't. 
    It didn't. 
    There was no such thing as State common law and Federal common law before Erie.
speaker="ronald_w_stevens" startTime="565.384" stopTime="566.384">
    Mr. Ronald W. Stevens 
    I agree, but--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="566.384" stopTime="567.601">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    We made that up after Erie.
speaker="ronald_w_stevens" startTime="567.601" stopTime="598.955">
    Mr. Ronald W. Stevens 
    --Correct, Your Honor, but in this Court's decision in Herrmann v. Edwards and Whittemore v. Amoskeag Bank, the Court made it clear that the mere fact that there was an assertion by shareholders of a national bank against its directors and officers for mismanagement was not sufficient to give rise to a Federal cause of action where the assertion was made under common law. 
    Now, I think the Court was saying in that case, this is a case for the application... in those two cases, those are cases for the application of State law, not Federal law.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="598.955" stopTime="610.496">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    What you're saying is, we... in light of what happened after Erie we should treat corporate law the same way we treat contract law. 
    Although we thought there was a Federal law, having discovered there is not, it goes back to being governed by State law.
speaker="ronald_w_stevens" startTime="610.496" stopTime="616.567">
    Mr. Ronald W. Stevens 
    Well, assuming for the sake of argument that there was a Federal common law pre-Erie in this area, yes, Erie demolishes it.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="616.567" stopTime="643.567">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    But Mr. Stevens, one problem is that there is no entity, no State that has chartered the Federal institution, so let's assume for the minute that we don't have any 1821(k), and the question is simply, what law governs the internal operations of a federally chartered institution? 
    How do you answer that? 
    It wouldn't be the law of incorporation.
speaker="ronald_w_stevens" startTime="643.567" stopTime="660.346">
    Mr. Ronald W. Stevens 
    No, it would be State law where the principal place of business was located, and I would point Your Honor to the recent regulation promulgated by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which regulates all nationally chartered banks. 
    They recently adopted a regulation which is cited in our--
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="660.346" stopTime="661.629">

    You cited that in your brief.

    Mr. Ronald W. Stevens

    I think that--

speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="682.342" stopTime="688.180">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    But under State law the State of incorporation would govern internal operations.

    Mr. Ronald W. Stevens 
    --I understand that, but in 1821(k) Congress itself said, define gross negligence under applicable State law. 
    Congress itself indicated it had no interest in having some Federal uniform standard apply here. 
    And by the same token, it seems to me that the fact that the institution happens to have gotten its charter from the Federal Government is not sufficient to predicate the creation of an entire body of Federal common law, which would--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="717.282" stopTime="737.596">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    That may be, but I think you still have to overcome Justice Ginsburg's assertion that if there is no Federal substantive law there is also no Federal choice of law, so you really can't say for sure that the law which governs is the law of principal place of business. 
    It depends on what the State law of the forum is, doesn't it?

    No, but you're-- 
    --So then you're not... then you're not getting the pointing rule from State law, because State law would say, we look to the State of incorporation to determine matters of internal operations.
speaker="ronald_w_stevens" startTime="820.683" stopTime="853.738">
    Mr. Ronald W. Stevens 
    That's correct, but I think you have to keep in mind that historically the reason they looked to the State law of incorporation was because that was where the principal place of business was. 
    Now, it's true that over time that's changed, and as Delaware passed laws that made it more receptive to corporations, more and more corporations incorporated there even though their principal places of business were elsewhere, but the concept here to my way of thinking is that the Federal Government, the only Federal banking agencies that's indicated any thoughts on this has said the principal place of business is fine.

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    No, but you-- 
    --Mr. Stevens, maybe we have here what is... what conflict-of-laws mavens call "renvoi". 
    That is to say that the State law would look to the place of... to the State of incorporation, the state of incorporation here being the Federal Government, the Federal Government having no rule on the question refers it back to State law, and maybe that's how you get where you want to be.

    Justice David H. Souter 
    Yes, but even on Justice Scalia's analysis, you've still got to have a basis for looking to some State law somewhere, and it seems to me that your answer to Justice Ginsburg boils down to this, that in addition to the O'Melveny standard, there's another source of Federal common law here, and the source is something like necessity. 
    If there's got to be a basis for court dealing with a federally chartered institution, to say what law applies, there is of necessity a Federal common law to the extent of deriving a pointing rule, and you're saying, I think, the necessity here is that Federal laws say that you look to the State of principal place of business.

speaker="ronald_w_stevens" startTime="1014.577" stopTime="1023.183">
    Mr. Ronald W. Stevens 
    Well, this Court, in de la questa, said that the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, which has been succeeded by the OTS, has plenary authority over federally chartered thrifts.

    --Mm-hmm.
speaker="ronald_w_stevens" startTime="1023.849" stopTime="1104.651">
    Mr. Ronald W. Stevens 
    I think that the OTS would have authority to promulgate regulations, all kinds of regulations related to the internal operations by saying you can only make loans that have this loan-to-value ratio, or you have to have this kind of collateral. 
    They could establish standards of conduct for virtually every aspect of the operations of the institution. 
    I don't believe that they could articulate a standard that would create a Federal common law standard of liability for application in Federal court actions, civil court actions, and the reason for that is that Congress in section 1818(b)(6)(a), which was part of FIRREA, has provided an administrative remedy for all the Federal banking agencies to pursue claims against Federal and State-chartered institution thrifts and directors, and to recover losses from those individuals incurred as a result of their misconduct. 
    But in that statutory provision Congress has said that such recoveries can only be had where there is a showing of either unjust enrichment or reckless disregard. 
    Congress imposed that statutory standard, and I don't believe that any of the Federal banking agencies has the authority to adopt a less stringent standard than that in the face of Congress having spoken. 
    I think that's what a number of prior decisions of this Court indicate.

    Mr. Ronald W. Stevens 
    The savings clause in this statute doesn't help the Government here for several reasons. 
    What the savings clause says is that nothing in this paragraph shall impair or affect any right of the FDIC under other applicable law. 
    Other applicable law can't be read in a way that renders the first sentence of 1821(k) inoperative.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="1146.145" stopTime="1164.876">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Well, it isn't inoperative if you look at it from the point of view that at least faced with State law that says you need intentional misconduct, that the Federal law says no gross negligence will suffice, so of course it isn't inoperable.
speaker="ronald_w_stevens" startTime="1164.876" stopTime="1177.116">
    Mr. Ronald W. Stevens 
    It isn't... it doesn't render the language inoperable with respect to State-chartered institutions. 
    It does with respect to federally chartered institutions if you assume the existence of a Federal common law simple negligence claim.
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="1177.116" stopTime="1199.430">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    Yes, but it doesn't if what you just said is the case. 
    That is, if Federal common law is, look to the State where the principal place of business exists, then it means just what Justice O'Connor said, and what we would do if the principal place of business is New Jersey, and if New Jersey has a statute of simple negligence, this statute would retain that cause of action.

    Justice Stephen G. Breyer

speaker="ronald_w_stevens" startTime="1220.962" stopTime="1222.378">
    Mr. Ronald W. Stevens 
    No, I wouldn't agree with that for this--

    Why not?
speaker="ronald_w_stevens" startTime="1222.812" stopTime="1314.238">
    Mr. Ronald W. Stevens 
    --For this reason. 
    In City of Milwaukee, one of the arguments that was made there was that there was a statutory section that dealt with citizen suits, and there was a provision in that section that said that any person was preserved the right to assert any remedy under State or common law, and that respondent in that case argued... petitioner in that case argued that that savings clause preserved Federal common law. 
    The Court rejected that argument and said at most... at most, that language only provided that that section dealing with citizen rights didn't have the effect of impacting a claim under common law, but that didn't mean that the comprehensive nature of the act as a whole didn't displace Federal common law, number 1, and number 2, it made the comment that the term common law as used in that savings clause was highly unlikely to have meant the specific narrowly construed Federal common law as opposed to the more generic State common law. 
    In this statutory provision, the savings clause doesn't even use the phrase, common law, and in our brief we point to a number of statutory provisions where when Congress wanted to save Federal common law it did so expressly. 
    Here, the only phrase used is other applicable law, and we think that means Federal statutory law, State statutory law, State common law, which is the routine common law, but not the narrow, specific, rarely invoked Federal common law.

    Our position is there never was a Federal common law claim. 
    There isn't now. 
    Our alternative argument is, should the court determine that there was a preexisting Federal common law claim for simple negligence that existed prior to the adoption of FIRREA, then Congress' reference to gross negligence standard in that statutory provision displaces that preexisting Federal common law, and that preexisting Federal common law is not preserved by the savings clause, so it's an alternative argument.

    The Third Circuit was in error.

   Argument of Richard P. Bress
speaker="richard_p_bress" startTime="1587.315" stopTime="1625.254">
    Mr. Richard P. Bress 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court: 
    Section 1821(k) is a plainly worded provision, and in our view it means precisely what it says. 
    It provides that the FDIC as receiver may hold officers and directors of failed financial institutions liable for their gross negligence or worse misconduct while preserving the FDIC's preexisting right to assert against those officers and directors whatever claims the institution could have asserted on its own behalf. 
    Now, petitioner's argument to the contrary is based on a supposed negative implication.

    Mr. Richard P. Bress

    Well, the arguments have sort of switched place in terms of what's primary and what's not from the briefing schedule. 
    If you'd like, Your Honor, I can address the underlying law at this point. 
    I'd just like to note before I do it that either Federal common law exists, in which case the statute preserves the FDIC's right to assert it, or Federal law, common law doesn't exist, in which case we're all agreed that State law governs and that the FDIC can assert the institution's State law claims.

    Mr. Richard P. Bress 
    All right, and I'd like to note one extra thing at this point which is, to the degree that there's an argument here that the FDIC has waived its State law claims, there has been no waiver here. 
    In fact, the third amended complaint that's been filed simply alleges counts for negligence, gross negligence, and breach of fiduciary duty.

speaker="richard_p_bress" startTime="1716.597" stopTime="1777.136">
    Mr. Richard P. Bress 
    Your Honor, that can be explained by what the state of the law was at the time that Congress acted, and what Congress' purposes here were. 
    This was emergency legislation, and Congress had a very simple purpose, which was to preempt State insulating statutes that could insulate officers and directors of financial institutions from liability to the FDIC. 
    Now, at that time, while the majority of courts were applying the uniform ordinary care standard of Federal common law to officers and directors of federally chartered associations, some courts were applying State law to officers and directors of federally chartered associations. 
    Congress didn't try to sort out which was the right answer. 
    Congress just wanted to make sure, whatever a court might otherwise apply, the FDIC would always have a suit for gross negligence, so if a court would apply the State's law to a federally chartered association, Congress was telling them, well, apply that State's gross negligence standard. 
    However, if a court were to apply Federal common law the question really would never come up, because under Federal common law the standard is, and has for a long time, been a standard of ordinary care.

    Mr. Richard P. Bress 
    No, Your Honor, but we believe it's the one that makes the most sense out of the language in the following sense. 
    The savings clause preserves the FDIC's rights under other applicable law. 
    Now, at the time, Congress is presumed to enact laws with knowledge of what the surrounding law is, and at that time the vast majority of courts were applying Federal common law to suits against officers and directors of federally chartered associations, so to take their interpretation of the statute you have to believe that Congress missed that entirely and believed that State law was applicable.

    Your Honor, when the statute speaks to the matter at issue this Court has said that that's what... but in order to determine what the statute says when it speaks we've got to look at the words of the statute, and what this statute says is, the FDIC can always sue for gross negligence, but the FDIC can also assert whatever it could have asserted otherwise under other applicable law.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1857.338" stopTime="1864.193">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist

    Mr. Richard P. Bress 
    Yes, Your Honor.

    Mr. Richard P. Bress 
    Your Honor, we're not contending that Congress sorted out and decided what was correct and what was incorrect. 
    All we're saying is that Congress would have been aware that the vast majority of courts were applying Federal common law. 
    Congress didn't try to sort it out.

    Mr. Richard P. Bress 
    All right. 
    I'd like to address that, Your Honor. 
    Let me just preface it with a notion, though, that the statute doesn't purport to affect what the rights of the institution would have against its own officers and directors, so if you adopt the position that Federal common law is supplanted with respect to FDIC suits, you do have a situation where the institution before it fails could sue under Federal common law for ordinary care, but if the officer-directors perform so poorly the institution goes under, the FDIC is limited to the gross negligence standard. 
    That's a bit odd. 
    But now let me address what the underlying law is.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="1950.680" stopTime="1957.834">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg

speaker="richard_p_bress" startTime="1957.834" stopTime="1991.657">
    Mr. Richard P. Bress 
    That's right, Your Honor, and let me now address that. 
    This Court has long understood that a corporation is a creature of law, and that its internal affairs are governed by the laws of the chartering authority, that the chartering authority and no other sovereign is the sovereign that has the predominant interest in those internal affairs. 
    Now, that's not just as a conflict of laws principle. 
    The Court has applied that in the context where you've got Federal preemption in dormant Commerce Clause challenges. 
    It's a principle of sovereignty at its fundamental base. 
    Now--

    --Yes, Your Honor.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="1994.375" stopTime="2014.021">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    You think it would be unconstitutional for a State, for example, to impose upon directors for certain activities a liability higher... to that State's citizens a liability higher than what the corporate State of incorporation would provide?
speaker="richard_p_bress" startTime="2014.021" stopTime="2044.142">
    Mr. Richard P. Bress 
    Your Honor, it flows from principles of sovereignty. 
    It does not make it unconstitutional, but it certainly does flow from principles of sovereignty. 
    This Court has stated that in Burks, in Kamen, in Cohens. 
    With regard to State institutions the Court has said, because it's created by the State, all of the rights and responsibilities flow from that State's laws, and it has also made clear the flip side, that when an institution... the Court has made clear that when an institution is chartered by the Federal Government it's from the Federal Government and from that charter that the rights and responsibilities flow.

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    No. 
    I mean, I said that somewhat facetiously, because I just wondered under the principles of Erie what good reason there is to have a special Federal law that's substantive in relation to banks that are chartered federally that wouldn't also apply to contracts, torts, and a whole bunch of things, and indeed, what is the implication of that for Erie? 
    Are we recreating Federal common law in a new area across the board? 
    That's, I guess, the question you've been asked by others.
speaker="richard_p_bress" startTime="2075.893" stopTime="2099.979">
    Mr. Richard P. Bress 
    Not at all, Your Honor, in this sense. 
    I mean, Erie, the primary purpose of Erie and the primary insight of Erie is that law has to flow from an identifiable sovereign. 
    There's no transcendental common law floating out there. 
    But after Erie, it was not the case that all common law was State. 
    Most common law was, but in areas of unique or essential Federal interest the law is Federal. 
    Now, with regard to contracts, we're not saying that a bank's contracts with third parties are governed by Federal law.
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="2099.979" stopTime="2122.692">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    But that's exactly my question, to be less elliptical, is what is the practical Federal interest here that requires a Federal common law that could not be served as well by a Federal common law pointer rule that said, simply apply the law of the State, a principal place of business, or the Model Business Code? 
    In other words, the things that were cited.
speaker="richard_p_bress" startTime="2122.692" stopTime="2162.902">
    Mr. Richard P. Bress 
    Your Honor, it's certainly true that in many areas this Court as a pointer rule will look to a State's law really as a convenient point of reference, and we think that that's a propriate in many instances. 
    It is not appropriate, however, where analogous Federal law provides you with some idea of what Congress thought about the matter, and in this case, by providing under section 1818(i) and section 1818(e) that the Federal regulators can enforce breaches of fiduciary duties which at the time the statute was created clearly included the duty of ordinary care, Congress is telling us that for Federal purposes enforcement of the duty of ordinary care is an important interest.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="2162.902" stopTime="2193.038">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    But your argument goes well beyond that. 
    It goes to the entire internal management of the corporation if the theory you're putting before us is correct, and I would go further than Justice Breyer. 
    It seems to me that there's a lot more chance of some certainty in the law if we refer to State law than if we try to apply some nebulous Federal common law of internal operations of the corporation. 
    It will take us, you know, 100 years to develop a Federal law of internal management of corporations. 
    We've never done it.
speaker="richard_p_bress" startTime="2193.038" stopTime="2237.617">
    Mr. Richard P. Bress 
    Well, Your Honor, if we were talking about inventing all of corporate law for financial institutions I would be constrained to agree with you. 
    We're not talking about that. 
    All we're talking about is an area where Congress has itself said that the duty of ordinary care will be enforced. 
    Now, matters as demand on the corporation, futility of demand, that sort of thing, sure, a pointer rule would be appropriate, but where Congress has said the duty of ordinary care should be enforced, it would be appropriate to enforce that duty of ordinary care rather than, for instance... let me give you an example. 
    If a State were to completely remove all duty of care from its officers and directors, should that then mean that the Federal institution would have no claim whatever and no ability to enforce fiduciary duties of its own officers-directors, and similarly--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2237.617" stopTime="2239.883">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Are you talking about preinsolvency, or postinsolvency?
speaker="richard_p_bress" startTime="2239.883" stopTime="2252.793">
    Mr. Richard P. Bress 
    --I'm talking about preinsolvency, and similarly, if a State were to enact strict liability as the standard, should that mean that the Federal chartering authority should have no ability to make sure that their institutions could attract officers and directors--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2252.793" stopTime="2261.998">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    But it's one thing to say the Federal chartering authority has no right to do that, but it's another thing to say that the Federal courts should step in on their own and develop a body of law.
speaker="richard_p_bress" startTime="2261.998" stopTime="2290.566">
    Mr. Richard P. Bress 
    --Well, Your Honor, I'm glad you've mentioned that. 
    The OTS, Office of Thrift Supervision, enforces section 1818(i) and section 1818(e), and in the context of agency adjudication has interpreted those sections to refer, when they refer to breach of fiduciary duties, to the duty of ordinary care, and further than that, and in terms of looking for certainty in the law, the OTS has set out the sorts of duties that are expected of an ordinarily prudent director in those circumstances.

    Justice David H. Souter 
    Well, it says it shouldn't depend on the quirks of State law, and yet under O'Melveny don't we have to see whether there is a conflict between the Federal interest and the State law, and it has been virtually conceded here that the law of every State on this point is ordinary negligence. 
    Why, then, do we have an occasion to look to this issue?
speaker="richard_p_bress" startTime="2338.899" stopTime="2360.329">
    Mr. Richard P. Bress 
    Okay. 
    Your Honor, I'd like to address that in two parts, if I may. 
    First of all, the conflict and the degree of conflict that is necessary really depends on what you're doing with regard to State law. 
    In O'Melveny and many other of these courts' cases what you're dealing with is... and in Boyle as well... you're displacing State law that would, in fact, otherwise apply in an area where the State has an interest. 
    Here what you're talking about is--
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="2360.329" stopTime="2367.502">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    And you're displacing that law presumably in favor of a standard substantively which is different from the State law.

    Mr. Richard P. Bress

    What--
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="2372.837" stopTime="2378.708">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Mr. Bress, I think you ought to clarify one thing. 
    It isn't the State law generally that ordinary negligence is the standard, is it?

    --I--

    Mr. Richard P. Bress 
    --Your Honor, most States as a matter of common law and a matter of statutory law, they don't speak in terms of ordinary negligence. 
    What they speak of in terms of is ordinary care is the standard, and they apply that with the business judgment rule, so that you've got to demonstrate ordinary care to even get within the business judgment rule, and if you've exercised ordinary care... and we agree with this. 
    If you've exercised ordinary care you will not be held liable for honest mistakes of judgment. 
    There's no--

    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    But-- 
    --Maybe I'm confused. 
    I thought that the whole reason for 1812 had nothing to do with federally chartered institutions. 
    It had to do with States that were insulating officers and directors from any liability--

    --Okay--

    --so Congress wanted to say at least gross negligence.

    Mr. Richard P. Bress 
    --Your Honor, there are several States, and there was a trend during the late 1980's of States that were, as a matter of statutory law, restricting liability of officers and directors to gross negligence or worse. 
    Many... several of them were restricting it to intentional or wanton misconduct.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="2434.461" stopTime="2441.300">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    Yes, I think where we got confused is that the State common law was ordinary negligence, but the State insulating statutes supplanted common law and that's why we got--
speaker="richard_p_bress" startTime="2441.300" stopTime="2468.034">
    Mr. Richard P. Bress 
    That's correct, Your Honor, and in terms of negligence and ordinary negligence this... it's somewhat helpful, I think, even now to look back at the... at this Court's formulation in Briggs where it said what you're really talking about is ordinary care is the standard, and in some circumstances perhaps slight care is required. 
    For example, it isn't a transaction that really has much impact on the bank. 
    In some instances, however, you've got a bet... your company transaction and great care is required, and you look to whether the director has satisfied the care required under the circumstances.

    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    --May I interrupt with one question? 
    Your argument based on 1818(i) and (e) and the regulatory power, are those regulatory powers of the OTS applicable to State-chartered institutions as well as Federal?

    Mr. Richard P. Bress 
    --They are, Your Honor, and in those instances you do have--

    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Well--
speaker="richard_p_bress" startTime="2485.077" stopTime="2507.909">
    Mr. Richard P. Bress 
    --Well, in those instances you have two separate standards that are going to apply to the officers and directors, because you have two separate sovereigns that have an interest. 
    However, as petitioner has effectively conceded here, I think, while we can point as a pointer rule to the State where the main office is, that doesn't necessarily mean that that State has a substantial interest in the internal workings of a federally chartered institution. 
    We're just pointing to it as a matter of convenience, Your Honor, and in that circumstance--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="2507.909" stopTime="2514.830">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    --Yes, but if you're right that those sections dictate ordinary care across the board, Congress didn't have to enact this statute.
speaker="richard_p_bress" startTime="2514.830" stopTime="2559.544">
    Mr. Richard P. Bress 
    --No, Your Honor, and I think Congress did, because there's no question that ordinary care is the standard for purposes of Federal regulatory enforcement as a Federal standard, because the statute was enacted to protect the Federal interest in the safety and soundness of all banks. 
    However, Congress recognizes that States are the ones that dictate the civil standards of liability for their own institutions, the rights of the institution and the shareholders vis-a-vis the directors. 
    You have two different standards for States because you've got two different sovereigns. 
    Here, you've one sovereign with an interest in it, and under HOLA, as this Court recognized in de la questa, the Homeowners Loan Act, Congress evinced a desire to have uniformity in the regulation of savings and loans. 
    This isn't just the courts invoking the interest of uniformity, this is Congress saying that uniformity is important.

    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    But then in-- 
    --Mr. Bress, what are the problems about the uniformity? 
    You are saying Federal common law, and we look to an administrative agency, OTS, to get that Federal common law, and that... that's rather odd. 
    There is no Delaware corporation statute for the Federal, so we have to get the law from some place, and you say, well, the Federal common law should be what the OTS has pronounced.
speaker="richard_p_bress" startTime="2584.826" stopTime="2606.406">
    Mr. Richard P. Bress 
    If I... if that's how I came across, Your Honor, I'm sorry. 
    I would... and that's further that I wanted to go. 
    What I'm saying is that the statute itself includes a duty of ordinary care in it. 
    The OTS, in enforcing that duty of ordinary care, will, as the expert body, flesh it out somewhat, give an idea of what that entails for officers and directors of federally chartered institutions, and that's going to give you a better idea... I mean, perhaps Delaware does have a--

speaker="richard_p_bress" startTime="2616.464" stopTime="2618.832">
    Mr. Richard P. Bress 
    Well, not quite, Your Honor. 
    What we're really saying is this is--

    Justice David H. Souter 
    Well, how close do you--
speaker="richard_p_bress" startTime="2619.566" stopTime="2639.413">
    Mr. Richard P. Bress 
    --All right... well, fairly close, Your Honor. 
    What we're coming at is really in Kamen what this Court said is if there is an analogous Federal provision that gives you an idea of what Congress would have done in this area, you look to that. 
    This Court did that in Musick and Peeler, the same sort of a thing, where under 10(b)(5) the Court said that you would use the contribution from the '34 act.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="2639.413" stopTime="2694.797">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    --Well, that would be a much stronger argument, I would suppose, if this statute had never been passed. 
    Yes. 
    Because if (k) had never been... if subsection (k) had rever been enacted, then if I follow your argument I would say, well, there's an area which is analogous to something covered by the statute that OTS is administering, but that statute doesn't cover it literally, and therefore I could say, well, there's a place where there seems to be a conflict between perceived Federal interest and State common law, and therefore we better develop some Federal common law for... to govern that. 
    But this statute has been passed which in effect is saying that in the area of possibly perceived conflict the threshold of gross negligence is good enough, so there doesn't seem to be any occasion to develop a common law to supplement that.
speaker="richard_p_bress" startTime="2694.797" stopTime="2740.695">
    Mr. Richard P. Bress 
    Your Honor, I think what the statute's telling you, and I think that what's actually the case here, is that there is a Federal interest, for instance, with regard to all banks whether they're State or Federal, that's clear, and in 1821(k) that interest was the Federal interest as in Shaw, and what Congress did is said... the first draft, in fact, of the Senate bill would have allowed the FDIC to proceed as receiver under any common law action, including ordinary negligence. 
    There were objections to that that were federalism-based. 
    The federalism-based objection said, look, what you're talking about are, you're including corporations that we've chartered, and as to which we dictate the internal affairs, and some States might legitimately believe that gross negligence rather than ordinary negligence is the right standard. 
    So Congress compromised. 
    They said the FDIC will always be able to sue for gross negligence even though, if a State has chosen a lower threshold or a higher threshold--

    Mr. Richard P. Bress 
    --Your Honor, there's no question about that, and that's not where our argument's going. 
    1818(i) and 1818(e) are provisions where the Federal regulator can enforce breaches of fiduciary duties. 
    At the time those provisions were enacted, it was very clear--

    All we're saying here is, you've got a circumstance where you're either going to use a State law pointer rule, or you're going to adopt a uniform Federal standard. 
    Because Congress has said that the uniform Federal standard should be enforced as ordinary care, it's more appropriate to use that Federal standard that Congress has already told us is the standard that should apply--

    What we're saying is that with regard to federally chartered institutions their rights vis-a-vis their own directors and officers are governed by Federal law because they operate under a Federal charter, and in determining what those rights are and what the duties are, we can either look for the State pointer... and by the way, the pointer is not always going to look to States with a well developed corporate law.

Reid... has long said that when the Congress uses a common law term, we look to what that term... whether that term had an established meaning. 
    The term did have an established meaning, and that included the duty of ordinary care, and if you rule against us, Your Honor, what will occur is that officers and directors of Federal institutions will have different and varying duties of care.

    Mr. Richard P. Bress 
    Your Honor, our position is that it really has no practical application.

    Now, where did it find it, and what you're saying is, it found it (a) a rule of law that points you to the principle place of business, no. 
    You say no, correct? 
    It doesn't point you to the law of the principal place of business. 
    Rather, it creates its own standards.

    And now you're only reply to that is to source... is to cite primarily is 1818(e) and (i), and 1818(e) and (i), from my finding it here, are these infinitely long page-full procedural requirements that go on endlessly that I can't find anything that seems to be relevant, except for one sentence that refers to gross or continuing disregard, or something like that.

    All right, Your Honor, let me address that. 
    We're not saying that Congress acted in recognition of the standard under 1818(i) or 1818(e) at the point when it enacted 1821(k). 
    What we're saying is that when it enacted 1821(k), Justice Breyer, the courts, the majority, vast majority of courts at that time were already applying a uniform ordinary care standard.

    Congress had no reason, no desire to sort that out.

    No, what I'm saying is, as this Court has interpreted the Homeowners Loan Act in de la questa, Congress intended at the time that statute was enacted to have uniform regulation of savings and loans. 
    Now, at the time FIRREA was enacted Congress wasn't interested in changing the workings of the internal affairs of banks themselves. 
    All it was saying was, when the FDIC comes in as receiver, in order to protect the insurance fund the FDIC is always going to be able to sue for gross negligence.

    In FDIC v. Thall, a decision which came down in August of 1996 of this year from the Eleventh Circuit, the FDIC argued and prevailed exactly the opposite proposition, that State law should apply to federally chartered institutions.

    The... the... well, the... first of all, 1818(i) is a civil money penalty provision. 
    It's a provision for imposing a penalty, but the provision that deals with conduct precisely analogous to that at issue here is not a civil money penalty section. 
    It's not a fining section. 
    It's 1818(b)(6)(a), which is the section which gives the agencies to recover losses incurred by the institutions, Federal or State chartered, caused by directors and officers, and the standard for recovery there is not simple negligence.
