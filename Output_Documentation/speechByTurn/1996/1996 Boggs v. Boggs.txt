    We'll hear argument next in Number 96-79, Sandra Jean Dale Boggs v. Thomas F. Boggs, et al.-- 
    Mrs. Livaudais.

    Ms. Marian M. Livaudais 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    ERISA is a comprehensive Federal program designed to ensure that employees and their beneficiaries receive their retirement benefits. 
    It is also designed to be applied uniformly throughout the country so that employees in other parts... all parts of the country are treated equally. 
    How does ERISA accomplish this goal? 
    By preemption. 
    Additionally, Congress has created a list of statutory beneficiaries who are entitled to receive benefits under these retirement plans. 
    Only ERISA-designated statutory beneficiaries are included in the list, and only those beneficiaries are permitted to receive benefits.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="107.761" stopTime="115.047">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Well, doesn't your position raise a significant takings issue right off the bat?
speaker="marian_m_livaudais" startTime="115.047" stopTime="115.816">
    Ms. Marian M. Livaudais 
    I don't--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="115.816" stopTime="160.446">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Because a State recognizes a community property interest in something like a husband's retirement plan or other assets that he has acquired during the marriage by virtue of his efforts, that law creates... a community property law would create a property right in the spouse to half of whatever that asset is, and along comes an ERISA law later... after this marriage, the first marriage had been in existence and she had an interest there, along comes ERISA. 
    You say it preempts it, even though that would be a taking of her interest. 
    Is that right?
speaker="marian_m_livaudais" startTime="160.446" stopTime="163.528">
    Ms. Marian M. Livaudais 
    --No, Your Honor. 
    I don't believe--

    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    What's wrong with that analysis?
speaker="marian_m_livaudais" startTime="165.090" stopTime="181.000">
    Ms. Marian M. Livaudais 
    --Well, there are two problems. 
    In the first place, this Court has said on several occasions, including Wissner v. Wissner, that the Federal program does not constitute a taking under the Fifth Amendment.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="181.000" stopTime="195.658">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    But that was a statute that had gone into effect and no one claimed that there was a prior thing that was affected by the statute. 
    Here, this fellow started working in 1949, and ERISA comes along in 1975.
speaker="marian_m_livaudais" startTime="195.658" stopTime="207.907">
    Ms. Marian M. Livaudais 
    This... well, at the time that ERISA comes along it preempts State law, the State community property law, so that it is inapplicable.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="207.907" stopTime="218.606">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Well, I... I'm not sure that's right, but even if it were, it would constitute a taking of the wife's interest acquired to that date.
speaker="marian_m_livaudais" startTime="218.606" stopTime="244.011">
    Ms. Marian M. Livaudais 
    Acquired to that date. 
    Well, the wife's interest that's acquired to that date is similar to putting money into a trust. 
    When she puts this money into the trust, she becomes... if she lives long enough she becomes a surviving spouse and is entitled to benefits as a beneficiary. 
    ERISA speaks in terms of beneficiaries.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="244.011" stopTime="261.884">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Well, under community property law in Louisiana she owned half of whatever he made from 1949 till ERISA at least was passed, and ERISA, even if you give it effect, can't take that without giving her compensation.
speaker="marian_m_livaudais" startTime="261.884" stopTime="276.482">
    Ms. Marian M. Livaudais 
    Her compensation was the anticipation of the benefits she would have received had she become... had she lived long enough to receive them coming out of the back end of the... a retirement program.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="276.482" stopTime="292.802">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Yes, but the Government can't simply substitute one piece of property for another piece of property without them being somehow equal. 
    Her share would simply disappear under your view in 1975, although it had existed from 1949 on.
speaker="marian_m_livaudais" startTime="292.802" stopTime="305.520">
    Ms. Marian M. Livaudais 
    Her anticipated benefits were... she received through the Federal program. 
    That was the basis in the Wissner case that said that the retroactivity in that case--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="305.520" stopTime="309.223">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Yes, but that was a Government life insurance policy. 
    That wasn't private property.

    Ms. Marian M. Livaudais 
    --Well, to the extent that the benefits she would receive as a... had she lived to participate in the retirement benefits are so much greater, and fuels... it's really tax dollars. 
    The tax exemptions and the tax deferrals fuel the ERISA engine that creates the wealth that creates the much greater benefits at the end than she would expect to receive just by investing some portion of her--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="340.985" stopTime="374.527">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    What she would get by outliving her husband isn't what troubles me. 
    It seems to me that's like having an ownership in a lottery ticket, and by the time the event occurs that brings ERISA into it the lottery has been run and the ticket is a loser. 
    It's worthless at that point. 
    So also, it's worthless here once she dies. 
    So it's not her survivor benefits that concern me, but isn't she entitled... isn't she entitled to the... half of all the benefits that the husband receives?

    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    Justice Scalia is completely capable of protecting his own question, but it seems to me that he's asking you-- 
    --Go, Tony, I-- 
    --He thinks that he... I thought that he was asking the question as a matter of Louisiana community property law, and then you tell us what ERISA provides, but as a matter of Louisiana community property law, is Justice Scalia not correct that the wife has an interest in the pension fund which, I take it, would have to be valued if the community is dissolved by divorce and, under... although I was surprised to find this, I understand the premise of the case is that this is subject to bequest under Louisiana law. 
    That's the premise that we take the case on, is it not?

    Justice David H. Souter 
    Well, is it the case, then, if there had been no ERISA at all, would the first wife have had something to bequeath by will?

    That is correct.

    Justice David H. Souter 
    I find that troubling, but what I'm not clear on is whether I have to reach that particular trouble.

    May I also ask in that... does the record tell us when the husband's pension benefits vested?

    --They vested during his first marriage to--

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    No. 
    Well, if there is a takings problem in the case, though, isn't that a reason for interpreting ERISA so that it doesn't raise that problem by saying that there isn't the sort of preemption that you're arguing for?
speaker="marian_m_livaudais" startTime="523.332" stopTime="544.627">
    Ms. Marian M. Livaudais 
    Well, the result there is that if that... if you reach that and you say that there is no preemption, then State law in effect redefines who the beneficiaries of ERISA are, because if you say that there is no preemption of the community property law, then the nonparticipant spouse becomes--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="544.627" stopTime="595.681">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Well, not at all. 
    There's a statutory argument here to be addressed if we wish, I guess, and that's whether there was any alienation here at all under the statutory provision in ERISA. 
    If Dorothy's estate, if she had a community property interest in part of what was distributed to Isaac by virtue of Louisiana law, when she dies, why doesn't that interest, whatever it is, just continue to exist as part of her estate, and once there is a distribution, why doesn't her estate stand in her former shoes and say part of that is mine, and she... that isn't an alienation under ERISA.

    Ms. Marian M. Livaudais

    Ms. Marian M. Livaudais

    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Yes, but Judge Fletcher said one of the many anomalies in this case is, you take a woman who under State law is a coowner, and she stays a coowner. 
    If before she dies, predeceasing her husband, she divorces him, then her coownership can be realized and she can pass it on to her children. 
    But if she should stay with him till her last breath, then her coownership vanishes, and I suppose Judge Fletcher was saying, if there is another construction that's reasonable, we ought to apply that, rather than one that leads to this very odd result.

    Except that the results is that under that... under Judge Fletcher's construction she basically would have the surviving participant who has anticipated receiving these benefits and has contributed to them thinking that he is going to retire, he suddenly has to divide his benefits with people who are not retirees. 
    Granted, they... and they're not necessarily his children. 
    They could... it could be a charity to whom she may have left this money.

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Ms. Livaudais, could I ask you, regarding Justice Breyer's question, do you acknowledge that the only effect of a community property law is to say how the husband's property goes when he dies, which seemed to me to be the hypothesis of Justice Breyer's question? 
    Doesn't the community property law make it her property immediately, before the husband dies, so it isn't a question of the husband getting all the money at the end and State law just saying where the husband's property goes. 
    Your contention is that it is... or the community property law says that it is her property. 
    Half of it is hers at the outset. 
    She doesn't get half at his death.

    No, but it... but my contention is that ERISA preempts the application of that community property law from the moment that ERISA was passed, and therefore ERISA dictates that these benefits are different. 
    They are special property. 
    They are not governed by the State property laws, whether community property or any other kind of State property--

    Mrs. Livaudais, do I understand this to be the practical consequence of your position: for more and more older people, the pension, if it's not the principal asset, but certainly a principal asset, and so to the extent of that pension, the Federal Government has done away essentially with the community regime, and is there anything specific in the statute, or... that suggests that Congress really was trying to undo, destroy the community?

    That was the participant and the participant surviving supouse. 
    The purpose is to assure that these people in their older age are supported and are not... it supplements their social security and they are not dependent on the State for additional support, and that is the purpose behind any... in ERISA. 
    And therefore, in order to make sure that the benefits are confined to the people who are the employee and the employee's surviving spouse... the QDRO's not concerned in that. 
    Only the people who are named in the statute as beneficiaries are entitled to--

    That's acknowledged. 
    And how is it that we would construe ERISA to preempt that, when this may well be the major asset of the couple, indeed their only greatest asset from all those years of work, and you want us to say that Congress just intended to wipe that out, to take it, even if it's a taking, and I think this is a remarkable construction that you're asking us to give this law.

    We believe that the interests in both are preempted, and we start... I'd like to start with ERISA's broad... broad but common sense preemption clause, the relate-to. 
    In our view really the ownership of plan assets is the issue here, and nothing could relate to a plan more than the basic question of who owns the assets in... who owns the assets in the plan, and that's a... that is what the application of State community property law to an ERISA plan--

    And the first thing is, what the first Mrs. Boggs... one has to look to what the first Mrs. Boggs' property interest in the plan would have been before 1974, because it's only pre-'74 where the taking problem might arise, and what she really had was an inchoate or contingent interest in the right to control benefits that she would have received from the plan once Mr. Boggs retired.

    Because even if there weren't a preemption clause in this statute, you've got good old garden variety conflict preemption here as between what ERISA provides for surviving spouses and what community property law, at least as we are suggesting it, could be construed would otherwise provide, and you've got to face the fact, I think you would say, that there is that conflict preemption.

    Mr. Paul R. Q. Wolfson 
    Yes, and in fact when the... when Congress enacted the survivor annuity, and it... it really, I think really when Congress enacted the REA it really sort of addressed directly the situation of spouses' rights and plan benefits and occupied the field, if you will, but it said it has to be actuarially determined under certain rules which would relate to the annuity that the participant would have had if he'd only been... if only he had been around.

    First, in some States domestic relations law is in a separate... you know, in Louisiana, in fact, it's in a separate section of the code than community property law. 
    Domestic relations law would normally be thought of in terms of support as child support and alimony, and--

    Mr. Paul R. Q. Wolfson 
    --I don't think so, because when you put them together, I think what Congress was trying to consider was the law that would be applied in domestic relations proceedings, specifically legal separation proceedings and dissolution of a marriage, and child support proceedings, and it wanted to be sure that the courts could consider the community property law, and there's a specific... could have been a specific reason for that. 
    In Hisquierdo and some other cases, the Court had looked at statutes that allowed division of benefits to enforce alimony orders but not community property orders. 
    I believe in Hisquierdo the railroad retirement benefit statute specifically had an exception to the antialienation clause for alimony but not for community property, so Congress was removing the doubt that the State court, when it was enacting a domestic relations order, could make an equitable distribution of the property by considering among other things any right that might possibly have been said to arise under State law by virtue of the community property regime and not limited to alimony.

    Mr. Edward J. Deano, Jr. 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    The case from the Fifth Circuit which we're seeking to uphold is a simple case.
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="1812.089" stopTime="1864.236">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    I'd like to ask you a question, but I'm afraid you're going to agree with me. 
    But maybe you won't, which would be lucky, and that is, I'm thinking of these as two separate things. 
    One is the annuity, and the second is everything else, just plain dollars. 
    Now, the annuity, it seems to me you run into a big problem of rather specific provisions that say how annuities are supposed to be set up, but as to the other, you're just going to say no. 
    I mean, I don't see what the conflict with ERISA is to leave the $200,000 to your wife, or to your cousin, and if this all happens through community property law, why is that any different than if it were the law of wills, and even if community property governs property during life, so what? 
    I mean, I don't understand... maybe you could explain what their argument against that is and what your reply is.
speaker="edward_j_deano_jr" startTime="1864.236" stopTime="1938.024">
    Mr. Edward J. Deano, Jr. 
    First of all, with regard to the lump sum payments, clearly the antialienation provisions, once they've been paid out of the plan, don't apply, and there's a whole line of jurisprudence that sets that out. 
    But what's I think very important conceptually to understand, and this Court has spoken to that in the Mackey case and also in the Fort Halifax case, is there's a distinct difference between State laws that deal with benefits and those that deal with plans, and that the preemption clause is not designed to preempt State laws that deal with benefits, and that makes sense. 
    If you preempted the law that dealt with benefits, you could never get to defined rights, because those laws would have been preempted, so you couldn't have a QDRO. 
    Everything would end up in Federal court if you preempted the laws. 
    So the remedy to deal with laws that are troubling, State laws that are troubling, are the antialienation provisions, and some cases have said that you preempt laws through the antialienation provisions, which doesn't make a lot of sense either, and I hope that I'm answering your question.

    Mr. Edward J. Deano, Jr. 
    --I think Justice O'Connor drew a point that I think is very salient to that, and that is whether or not a probate order should be defined, or should be able to be qualified as a QDRO, and it's very interesting, I think, to take a look at the antialienation provision in 1056. 
    The general antialienation provision in 1056 pre-REA 1984 was held not to affect property interests, marital property interests. 
    Then there was an additional sentence that was put in, and was held to that, and it's a much narrower antialienation protection, and what it says is... and I'm quoting from section (d) in paragraph... in (3), that this alienation shall apply to the creation, assignment, recognition of a right, a benefit which is payable with respect to a participant pursuant to a domestic relations order. 
    So one of two things happens here. 
    Either the right, which is... certainly was designed to apply to community property inheritance rights which were not contained in the previous general antialienation... the right, in order to be prohibited through the antialienation provision, must be one that is derived pursuant to a domestic relations order. 
    So one of two things happens. 
    Either a probate order is a domestic relations order, in which case that antialienation provision would apply but so would the exception of a QDRO, which requires two things, that it be an anti--

    If that says that specifically in the statute, if there's a community property law that says, sorry, your present wife doesn't get $1,000 a month, rather, that $1,000 a month, which is all that's left of the annuity, goes to the first wife, that would seem like a direct conflict. 
    Why isn't it?
speaker="edward_j_deano_jr" startTime="2101.694" stopTime="2112.300">
    Mr. Edward J. Deano, Jr. 
    Because this Court has decided that those types of conflicts are treated in the context of the antialienation provisions, not the preemption provisions.
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="2112.300" stopTime="2139.889">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    Well then, why? 
    Then tell me, because I don't know this area that well. 
    It sounds to me as if the statute says that your pension has to provide an annuity of $2,000 to Breyer until... as long as he's alive, and then $1,000 to his present wife. 
    The community property law says, sorry, the first wife gets the $1,000. 
    That sounds like a direct conflict under basic principles of preemption law, and I'd like to know why it isn't.
speaker="edward_j_deano_jr" startTime="2139.889" stopTime="2167.525">
    Mr. Edward J. Deano, Jr. 
    Because the provision that provides for the annuity is a directive to a plan to provide for that annuity in its plan. 
    It's a directive to administrators to draft a plan that creates this type of function, so if we began to say, plans drafted by administrators can preempt State law, we wade into very dangerous territory.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="2167.525" stopTime="2184.979">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    So Congress doesn't care what the result is. 
    It just wants... it just insists that the administrators draw up a certain scheme and it's okay if the States adopt their laws in such a way that the scheme doesn't produce any particular result. 
    All Congress wants is the abstract ideal of an administrative plan?
speaker="edward_j_deano_jr" startTime="2184.979" stopTime="2185.537">
    Mr. Edward J. Deano, Jr. 
    No--

    Mr. Edward J. Deano, Jr. 
    --No. 
    What Congress was looking for is that a plan will have to operate first in the context of State laws, but also with the power of its antialienation provisions to operate within State law, so that the antialienation provisions are the power with regard to State laws that deal with benefits.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="2206.841" stopTime="2212.976">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Is the $1,000 annuity that Justice Breyer was asking you about, is that at issue here?

    Mr. Edward J. Deano, Jr.

    Yes, but the result of it would be that the current wife, who's getting something like $1,800 a month, or something like that, that she would in fact have to pay over a piece of that, whatever is the... it could be reduced to a lump sum, but a piece of her monthly benefits.

    Of course not, and--

    Because that annuity--

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    I mean, had he not remarried there would have been no annuity. 
    At the time she died, that was it. 
    The right to an annuity comes about later because he remarries, and now the first wife, who at the time of her death had no claim, gets a right to the second wife's annuity. 
    It seems very strange to me.

    If the money was paid from community funds--

    --That as a matter of State law, husband and wife 1 work together for 30 years, build up a million dollars in an IRA, or in some kind of a retirement account with a pension, and at the end, eventually wife 1 is long... is gone, but eventually that million is used to buy an annuity which says, $2,000 a month to husband, on husband's death, $1,000 a month to wife 2. 
    You are saying under the law of Louisiana, since that $1 million which paid for the annuity was jointly built up during their community, wife 1 is entitled to one-half the proceeds of that eventually, or some share of that.

    And... but I... the other... you have answered my third question. 
    I was going to ask you whether the takings issue had been raised, and you did argue that in the district court and in the court of appeals, and the court of appeals didn't address it--

    Have there been cases in Louisiana where the Louisiana legislature has passed laws changing the rights of spouses in community property, saying that what was once raw expectancy is now vested, and have those... and if that has happened, have any of those under State law been challenged as takings, or retroactive--
speaker="edward_j_deano_jr" startTime="2853.447" stopTime="2860.950">
    Mr. Edward J. Deano, Jr. 
    To my knowledge, the only changes in community property laws that have come about have been where the parties have been able to agree to make those changes.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="2860.950" stopTime="2873.890">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    --May I... I want to clarify one thing on the takings issue. 
    Did you argue that there was a taking in 1974 when the statute was enacted, or when did you say the taking took place? 
    What was your theory?
speaker="edward_j_deano_jr" startTime="2873.890" stopTime="2879.633">
    Mr. Edward J. Deano, Jr. 
    I believe the argument was first of all that there was a takings... one in '74--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="2879.633" stopTime="2882.095">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    You did argue that there was a takings in '74.
speaker="edward_j_deano_jr" startTime="2882.095" stopTime="2882.716">
    Mr. Edward J. Deano, Jr. 
    --And there was one... it was taken--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="2882.716" stopTime="2887.768">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    So you must have argued that there had been a vesting prior to '74, but there's no finding to that effect.

    Mr. Edward J. Deano, Jr. 
    --Right, but also a taking in that the probate order was rendered in this matter in 1980, 4 years before the enactment of the REA act, and there's discretion that the... in section 302 that allows orders that don't meet the qualifications of a QDRO to be excepted.

speaker="edward_j_deano_jr" startTime="2911.974" stopTime="2927.324">
    Mr. Edward J. Deano, Jr. 
    And that is another point as to why antialienation provisions are not allowed to preempt State laws, because they're drafted by plan administrators that do have discretion in the drafting of those plans.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="2927.324" stopTime="2968.271">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    --Is it-- 
    --The Fifth Circuit interpreted the statute in such a way that there was no takings problem. 
    It held for you down the line. 
    But one of the arguments that was raised on the other side about the Federal interest is, sparing the plan from being burdened with all these peculiarities of usufruct and forced heirship and all that, and we're also been told by one of the briefs that there are peripatetic workers who walk in and out of community property States, and the whole thing would be a nightmare for administration, so how do you respond to that?
speaker="edward_j_deano_jr" startTime="2968.271" stopTime="2990.907">
    Mr. Edward J. Deano, Jr. 
    I think the accounting problem is somewhat of a bogus issue in that the administrator just deals with the judgment that's presented to them, and the rights that are contained in the judgment. 
    An administrator is never called upon to do... to touch a calculator with regard to those types of problems.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="2990.907" stopTime="3000.863">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Of course, the administrator would have to comply under present law since '84 with a qualified domestic relations order.

    Mr. Edward J. Deano, Jr.

    Mr. Edward J. Deano, Jr. 
    Well, under the amendments to the REA act, if it's not a qualified domestic relations order, it doesn't come under the enhanced antialienation sanctions that existed before.

    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Well, wait a minute. 
    Under the statute it would be payable, a certain amount to the husband, and thereafter a certain amount to the then surviving wife, if there was one.

    Mr. Edward J. Deano, Jr.

    With regard to a transfer, it would be just a written donation that would be handed to an administrator.

    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    An alienation.
speaker="edward_j_deano_jr" startTime="3120.442" stopTime="3122.865">

    --An alienation if it was to one that was payable--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="3122.865" stopTime="3127.266">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Well then, why isn't a contemporary testamentary provision an alienation?
speaker="edward_j_deano_jr" startTime="3127.266" stopTime="3134.863">
    Mr. Edward J. Deano, Jr. 
    --Because first of all this was not a testamentary alienation. 
    This happened under operation of Louisiana law. 
    This was not--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="3134.863" stopTime="3136.143">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    No will here.
speaker="edward_j_deano_jr" startTime="3136.143" stopTime="3153.086">
    Mr. Edward J. Deano, Jr. 
    --There was a will, but the children's names were not mentioned in the will at all. 
    They were forced heirs, and it happened as an operation of law, so she didn't make... as opposed to the example that you gave, she did not make a transfer, and that has been... an alienation has been defined as a will of transfer.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="3153.086" stopTime="3159.970">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    So according to you, in this situation there was no alienation at all during the existence of the plan.
speaker="edward_j_deano_jr" startTime="3159.970" stopTime="3160.700">
    Mr. Edward J. Deano, Jr. 
    There was a--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="3160.700" stopTime="3174.720">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Because Isaac had retired, and he got whatever he got, and what she did arose... what happened arose by virtue of Louisiana law after the benefits had been distributed.
speaker="edward_j_deano_jr" startTime="3174.720" stopTime="3184.255">
    Mr. Edward J. Deano, Jr. 
    --That's correct. 
    Let me touch just a little bit more on the concept--

    Justice Clarence Thomas 
    Mr. Wolfson, before you go on, two questions.
speaker="edward_j_deano_jr" startTime="3187.508" stopTime="3187.888">
    Mr. Edward J. Deano, Jr. 
    --Yes, sir.
speaker="clarence_thomas" startTime="3187.888" stopTime="3193.422">
    Justice Clarence Thomas 
    One, would you explain for us what happened to the lump sum that was alienated, or that was distributed?
speaker="edward_j_deano_jr" startTime="3193.422" stopTime="3197.966">
    Mr. Edward J. Deano, Jr. 
    The lump sum was rolled over into an IRA.
speaker="clarence_thomas" startTime="3197.966" stopTime="3206.450">
    Justice Clarence Thomas 
    Now, did he have options to... was the money given to him, and did he then put it in an IRA, or was it within the terms of the plan?
speaker="edward_j_deano_jr" startTime="3206.450" stopTime="3213.076">
    Mr. Edward J. Deano, Jr. 
    It's my understanding that he took the... they came into his ownership and then he rolled it over into an IRA.
speaker="clarence_thomas" startTime="3213.076" stopTime="3245.544">
    Justice Clarence Thomas 
    Okay. 
    One other question. 
    Let's say that Isaac, that his wife pre... she passed away in 1979, that he was quite grieved, and did not remarry, and assume that the gift that Justice O'Connor spoke about was made to the kids, or it was passed on as it was in this case, but Isaac did not remarry. 
    What would the children get in those circumstances?
speaker="edward_j_deano_jr" startTime="3245.544" stopTime="3248.877">
    Mr. Edward J. Deano, Jr. 
    First they would have had... they would have received property--
speaker="clarence_thomas" startTime="3248.877" stopTime="3252.950">
    Justice Clarence Thomas 
    Well, let's just... from the plan. 
    That's all I'm interested in.
speaker="edward_j_deano_jr" startTime="3252.950" stopTime="3253.221">
    Mr. Edward J. Deano, Jr. 
    --Oh.
speaker="clarence_thomas" startTime="3253.221" stopTime="3258.003">
    Justice Clarence Thomas 
    Under this plan, what would they get?
speaker="edward_j_deano_jr" startTime="3258.003" stopTime="3261.386">
    Mr. Edward J. Deano, Jr. 
    They would not at that moment get anything, but they--
speaker="clarence_thomas" startTime="3261.386" stopTime="3267.680">
    Justice Clarence Thomas 
    No, when he died. 
    Let's say everything is exactly the same as it is now.
speaker="edward_j_deano_jr" startTime="3267.680" stopTime="3267.941">
    Mr. Edward J. Deano, Jr. 
    --All right.
speaker="clarence_thomas" startTime="3267.941" stopTime="3269.931">
    Justice Clarence Thomas 
    Except, he doesn't remarry.
speaker="edward_j_deano_jr" startTime="3269.931" stopTime="3274.576">
    Mr. Edward J. Deano, Jr. 
    Okay. 
    The only thing... he doesn't get... they do not get a thing from the plan.
speaker="clarence_thomas" startTime="3274.576" stopTime="3277.107">
    Justice Clarence Thomas 
    What about the $150,000?
speaker="edward_j_deano_jr" startTime="3277.107" stopTime="3277.518">
    Mr. Edward J. Deano, Jr. 
    Yes.
speaker="clarence_thomas" startTime="3277.518" stopTime="3294.418">
    Justice Clarence Thomas 
    So the $150,000 you treat separately. 
    Let's say that's... we have to assume that went to a bank account or something. 
    Is that accurate? 
    So the lump... there's a difference between the lump sum and the stock as opposed to the survivor's annuity.
speaker="edward_j_deano_jr" startTime="3294.418" stopTime="3307.706">
    Mr. Edward J. Deano, Jr. 
    That's correct. 
    The consideration for the survivor's annuity, however, was the reduced retirement moneys paid to Isaac during the remainder... upon his retirement, for which he purchased this--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="3307.706" stopTime="3330.792">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Well, but that's the deal. 
    That's just like the husband and wife agreeing to sell a piece of... sell an automobile for a boat. 
    I mean, you don't value what the wife gets on the basis of the boat. 
    If they went into the deal and traded the one for the other, it's gone, and what you have is what's in front of you, so it doesn't seem to me to say, well, they got this money only because they took less of something else... that was what they bought.
speaker="edward_j_deano_jr" startTime="3330.792" stopTime="3360.052">
    Mr. Edward J. Deano, Jr. 
    --Except there was something there at this moment, Your Honor. 
    I mean, it would be like presuming there wasn't something there when in fact there was something there. 
    I would just like to close by mentioning again that the remedy on State laws that confuse or are troubling to Federal concepts with regard to ERISA is not preemption, that it comes under the antialienation provisions.
speaker="clarence_thomas" startTime="3360.052" stopTime="3366.325">
    Justice Clarence Thomas 
    Mr. Wolfson, I'm sorry to interrupt you. 
    Do you have a better argument for the lump sum than you do for the annuity?
speaker="edward_j_deano_jr" startTime="3366.325" stopTime="3373.579">
    Mr. Edward J. Deano, Jr. 
    My argument with regard to the lump sum is the antialienation provisions do not apply once they've left the plan.
speaker="clarence_thomas" startTime="3373.579" stopTime="3376.651">
    Justice Clarence Thomas 
    But do you have a better argument for the lump sum than the annuity?

    Mr. Edward J. Deano, Jr.

    The argument--

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Justice Thomas is asking you to weigh the two arguments, which do you think is the better one, I believe.

    Mr. Edward J. Deano, Jr. 
    --Oh, I would find that there are... there is equal authority from this Court for both of them. 
    Probably the occasion has risen more with regard to the antialienation protections following after the benefits leave the plan. 
    That doctrine may be more grounded--
speaker="clarence_thomas" startTime="3409.853" stopTime="3417.217">
    Justice Clarence Thomas 
    Well, I think where you're losing me... I'm sorry to interrupt, but where you're losing me is, if he had not remarried, what is there to give away?
speaker="edward_j_deano_jr" startTime="3417.217" stopTime="3423.111">
    Mr. Edward J. Deano, Jr.

speaker="edward_j_deano_jr" startTime="3424.073" stopTime="3427.484">
    Mr. Edward J. Deano, Jr. 
    So that his estate would have been larger.

    Justice Clarence Thomas 
    Suppose he gambled. 
    Suppose he decided to go to the river boats and just feed the slot machines.
speaker="edward_j_deano_jr" startTime="3433.569" stopTime="3441.894">
    Mr. Edward J. Deano, Jr. 
    That would not have diminished how much funds he had used during this lifetime that--

    Justice Clarence Thomas 
    It would not have increased the estate.
speaker="edward_j_deano_jr" startTime="3444.125" stopTime="3462.387">
    Mr. Edward J. Deano, Jr. 
    --No, but it would have increased the amount of funds of other people that he would have had use of. 
    He would have received more money from the plan over his lifetime, which was money partially of other people, and he would have had more money that he would have used of other--
speaker="clarence_thomas" startTime="3462.387" stopTime="3465.269">
    Justice Clarence Thomas 
    Okay, let's say he did not remarry.

    --Okay.

    Justice Clarence Thomas 
    And he decided to... for the few years he was single, he was so grieved, he was so full of grief that he gambled a lot. 
    Now, what is it in the estate that they get more of? 
    I don't understand... I just don't understand your argument.

    Well--

    Justice Clarence Thomas 
    That he... there is no annuity. 
    The only annuity available is for the survivor benefits. 
    There is no survivor because he never rem rried, so what is it for the children to get?
