United States v. Brockamp

    Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    In these companion cases a divided panel of the court of appeals held that equitable tolling may be applied to enlarge or suspend the statutory periods that limit the time for filings and the amount of recovery that may be had on tax refund claims. 
    As we recount in our brief, recent decisions of the First, Fourth, Tenth, and Eleventh Circuits have held to the contrary. 
    Our submission is that those four circuits reach a result that is required by the text of the interrelated statutory provisions that govern here, and I would like to turn to the statutory text now, which is set out at pages 2 to 4 of the Government's brief. 
    And we start with the last of the provisions that set out section 7422(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, which the term before last in United States v. Williams this Court referred to as a provision that requires administrative exhaustion.

    Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace 
    On page 4 of the Government's brief, in the gray covers, and it says that no suit or proceeding shall be maintained in any courts, skipping down, until... for a refund, until a claim for refund or credit has been duly filed with the Secretary according to the provisions of law in that regard. 
    And the controlling provisions in our view are those set forth on the preceding two pages, the various provisions of section 6511 of the Internal Revenue Code, and... and that section starts off in subsection (a) with a statement of a period of limitation on filing a refund claim with the Internal Revenue Service. 
    For present purposes, since a tax return is required for an income tax, the claim must be filed within 3 years from the time the return was filed, or 2 years from the time the tax was paid.

    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    May I ask what might be an irrelevant question on that point, but would help with my understanding of the statute? 
    Apparently, in their brief on page 18 it did say as first enacted it said it's within 3 years from the time the return was required to be filed, and when you read the statute... the same thing came up I think last year, you know, in a different case.

    Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace 
    Yes.

    Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace 
    Well, there are... it's under study. 
    I'm not privy to the discussions. 
    There are inherent difficulties in addressing this question because of the massive number of returns that are filed every year, difficulties that we've referred to in this--
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="287.221" stopTime="293.797">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    Was it just an accident they left out the words, were required, or was required, or is some purpose going on that I can't understand?
speaker="lawrence_g_wallace" startTime="293.797" stopTime="570.767">
    Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace 
    --Well, we don't really have an answer to that. 
    There was, so far as I am aware, no explanation of why this change occurred in the text. 
    This is a question that in the Mundy case last term the Court found no occasion to reach, and it seldom makes a difference, because it can make a difference only if the... in a 1-year period, because either you can... you can go back 3 years from when the return was filed to see... to ask for refunds of taxes paid during those 3 years, or else 2 years after the tax was paid, and usually with a really late-filed return no taxes were paid within the 3 years or the 2 years, and it makes no difference, as it makes no difference in either of the cases before us. 
    In any event, let me proceed now to the next provision, and for our purposes the more important provision, subsection (b), which appears on page 3 of the Government's brief, and it starts off with a subsection (1), which states quite unequivocally the consequences if the claim is not filed within the prescribed period. 
    No credit or refund shall be allowed. 
    Now, that... it's hard to see that that provision has much purpose other than to emphasize the strictness of the filing requirements and, as we point out on page 20 of our brief, this point is reemphasized in another provision of the code, section 6514(a)(1), which states that any credit or refund which the Service actually gives on a claim that is filed after the expiration of the statutory periods of limitation is "erroneous" and "considered void". 
    And it's interesting that in the implementing regulation for that provision, section 6514, the Service, after tracking the language of the statute, then has a cross-reference to the provisions authorized in suit by the Government to recover erroneous refunds. 
    But the next subsection seems to us to be what I might refer to as the clincher, the most dispositive obstacle to the respondents and the Ninth Circuit's position in this case, and that is subsection (2) of subsection (b), which is captioned, Limit on the amount of credit or refund that can be given, and I cannot emphasize too strongly that these caps on the disbursement that can be made from the Federal Treasury have their own express limitation. 
    While there is a cross-reference to the claims limitation period for purpose of separating categories of claims, there is no cross-reference to the claims limitation for purpose of defining the cap itself. 
    It says in subsection (A), for example, the amount of credit or refund shall not exceed the portion of the tax paid within a period defined right in this provision equal to 3 years plus the period of any extension of time for filing the return, and in subsection (B) it's the same thing, that the amount of credit or refund shall not exceed the portion of the tax paid during the 2 years immediately preceding the filing of the claim. 
    These are substantive limitations on disbursements from the Treasury that are authorized.

    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Mr. Wallace, can I ask you a general... assume we agree with every... all of your arguments, and that it's too late to file a claim and the taxpayer, or this person, he's not really a taxpayer, I guess, has no right to get the money back, is there anything in the code that would allow the Internal Revenue Service when presented with facts as extreme as they are in this case to say, we're not entitled to this $7,000, we want to give it back? 
    Is there anything that allows the Government to give back money they know they're not entitled to?

speaker="lawrence_g_wallace" startTime="805.643" stopTime="885.166">
    Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace 
    --after the events occurred here. 
    It's... there wasn't any contemporaneous finding about whether this man had the capacity or not. 
    The receipt by the IRS was not an unusual one. 
    Oftentimes elderly taxpayers have capital gains or other sudden increases in income, and there was no explanation for it. 
    The check merely accompanied an extension of time request. 
    Obviously, the family was in a better position to be monitoring his financial affairs than the Internal Revenue Service was, and could have looked into his bank accounts if they thought at the time that there was lack of capacity. 
    They're now saying, 4-1/2 years later, that there was lack of capacity at a time when it's difficult to prove it, and this kind of claim can be made in many cases. 
    I might, as a matter of fact, since we're into the facts, talk a little bit about the facts in the Scott case, where there was actually a bench trial, and--
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="885.166" stopTime="906.791">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    --Mr. Wallace, may I ask before you do if you can just clarify for me what would be within the universe of possible responses beside a private bill? 
    I suppose what the administration was looking for was not a private bill, but something maybe akin to the mitigation rules.
speaker="lawrence_g_wallace" startTime="906.791" stopTime="1153.024">
    Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace 
    --There could be something of that sort. 
    It could be temporally limited. 
    They could expand the time perious upon a showing of certain kinds of incapacity, but they could expand them for only a limited time, because each year you expand it you're adding another 200 million tax returns that possibly could be reopened at a time when there's talk about downsizing the Internal Revenue Service, and at a time when there are budget constraints. 
    And in order for legislation of this kind to be adopted, Congress needs help in preparing a revenue impact assessment of it, rather hard to do, since we don't know easily how to estimate how many additional out of time refund claims might be stimulated once there were a provision that allowed consideration of the individual circumstances of taxpayers. 
    The Service has estimated that it now turns down about 250,000 refund claims a year in whole, without examining whether the refund was warranted or not because they're out of time, but most tax counsel who wouldn't file an out-of-time refund claim today on behalf of a client, might... that figure might increase a great deal. 
    So another possible legislative response to this would be simply to increase the limitations periods in the hope that more situations such as the alleged situation of Mr. McGill would be caught without having to examine the individual circumstances of individual taxpayers, just to give their guardians or relatives more time in which to ferret out examples of this kind, which would be much less administratively burden... there are all kinds of possibilities, but to date nothing has been proposed by the administration to the Congress, nor am I... we'll of course inform the Court if any action is taken either on the Hill or by the administration. 
    In the meantime, it must be recognized that the press release that was issued was issued on the premise that the existing law bars such claims, as we think these caps on the refund do, and there's no point in saying that the claim can be allowed for a longer period if you can't get any payment as a result of filing the claim. 
    So read as a whole, the provision is inconsistent with equitable tolling, as the Court concluded the applicable provisions in the Lampf case were, and I do want to emphasize that with respect to an express cap on disbursements from the Treasury there is no more fitting example of where the traditional rules about waivers of sovereign immunity should be applied. 
    When Congress has explicitly capped the disbursement that is authorized to be made, that cannot be enlarged beyond what the language requires. 
    As the Court has said about waivers of sovereign immunity, a court is not in a position to enlarge it on equitable grounds. 
    It's quite different from just a statute of limitations on the filing of the claim itself.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="1153.024" stopTime="1165.273">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    As far as the equity is concerned, do you need to go... say anything more than the Court did in its decision in the Dalm case?
speaker="lawrence_g_wallace" startTime="1165.273" stopTime="1249.599">
    Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace 
    Well, the Dalm case really addresses everything that's at issue here. 
    What was asked for in Dalm, an expansion of the doctrine of equitable recoupment, was an equitable claim very similar to a tolling claim, and some would refer to it as a tolling claim. 
    It's a form of claim for avoidance of the limitations period that isn't as precisely defined a deferral of the limitations period as the ordinary tolling claim, but it's very similar, and we think the Dalm decision does have a controlling analysis here, and in particular its holding that these provisions concerning tax refund suits must be read in conformity with one another and with all the cross-referencing that's involved here. 
    Let me just talk very briefly about the facts of the Scott case to show what kind of thing we're concerned with here, and in Scott we proceeded all the way to a bench trial with findings, and some of those findings which are set forth on pages 44a and 45a of the appendix to our petition are rather telling here.

    Go ahead, then.
speaker="lawrence_g_wallace" startTime="1269.491" stopTime="1382.164">
    Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace 
    --as one where perhaps the Service's problems were not quite as apparent as they would be in the Scott case from our standpoint. 
    The companion case in Scott involved his 1984 tax liability. 
    What the Service knew was that he himself, even though the claim now is incapacity because of alcoholism, he himself had filed in January of 1985 his estimated tax return and payment. 
    His father had done that with his prior installments of estimated tax for 1984. 
    And then through the bench trial proceedings we were able to find out some facts which we... which the district court has listed on page 44a and 45a, that in 1984 Scott executed a partnership agreement to operate a retail wine shop. 
    In 1985, he entered into an agreement dissolving the partnership so that he could operate the shop on his own. 
    During the time he operated, he filed his State sales tax, and he obtained an attorney to represent him on driving under the influence charges in '87 and '88. 
    He opened and closed his retail business every day and paid his utilities and rent. 
    So even on the basis of what we were able to learn through a trial there was considerable doubt. 
    The district court itself said without the expert testimony in this case, and I'm reading from finding 21, the court might otherwise find the United States' argument somewhat persuasive. 
    Of course, expert testimony is something that doesn't occur until the trial itself.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1382.164" stopTime="1383.816">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    What was the expert testimony about?
speaker="lawrence_g_wallace" startTime="1383.816" stopTime="1471.423">
    Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace 
    It was about how alcoholism can be incapacitating, but... and there were two doctors, one for the Government and one for the defense, but obviously the Service would have to be very wary, the more a claim of incapacity seems specific only to the capacity to comply with the Internal Revenue laws and leaves the person able to comply with many other laws. 
    The administrative finding of... in such a case would not be one where the Service could easily decide that it was an appropriate occasion for tolling. 
    These are very difficult matters to handle. 
    They're not the kind of green eyeshade investigations of a tax return that Service personnel are ordinarily engaged in, nor are the facts easily assembled. 
    We're dealing here with a very difficult administrative question, and one that both the administration and Congress may give appropriate consideration to, but they obviously have to tread with caution, considering the magnitude of the task that is assigned to the Service. 
    If I may, I'd like to reserve the balance of my time.

    That is the facts of this case. 
    He would certainly have the direct... a redress if he were like the rest of us, a competent taxpayer. 
    But throughout the statutory period in 6511, he was disabled. 
    Only through some miracle his daughter discovered the overpayment following the taxpayer's death, and the Government would have us believe that in this circumstance not only is there an unfairness, but that I think the unfairness is perhaps beside the point. 
    The point--

    Why should we be tugged by the equities here, and undoubtedly these are hard cases, tugged more by these equities than the Court was in the Dalm case, which was also a very sympathetic situation?

speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1592.624" stopTime="1601.279">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well, we have a rather elaborate Internal Revenue Code where presumably Congress has revealed its intent in the sections that are dealt with in the briefs.
speaker="robert_f_klueger" startTime="1601.279" stopTime="1755.433">
    Mr. Robert F. Klueger 
    Yes, that is true. 
    I believe that Congress' intent is revealed, albeit darkly, in section 6511 itself, in the structure of section 6511. 
    It is best, I think, to turn to the operation of this statute. 
    This is a statute of limitations which is not unique but rare, in that the clock that starts the statute of limitations may only begin to run but for some predicate act that is performed by the taxpayer, whether it is the filing of the return or, in the case of Mr. McGill, cutting a check. 
    Until one of those acts eventuates, the clock never starts to run. 
    Now, it doesn't seem to be that much of an intellectual stretch to assume that if this is a statute of limitations that can only begin to run but for the taxpayer's act, that the taxpayer's act not be the result of his fantasies or his delusions, but be the act of a rational, competent taxpayer, and if I might, to illustrate this point, a... because the counsel for the Government has discussed the possibility of holding hundreds of millions of tax returns open perhaps indefinitely if equitable tolling applies. 
    This section 6511(a), I submit, contemplates that. 
    If we have someone who does not perform any of these two predicate acts, let us assume he didn't in 1962, and let 30 years go by without paying his tax and without filing his return, and then one day he walks in and files his return and pays the tax, and then a year later figures that he overpaid and files a refund claim, that is a perfectly timely refund claim under anyone's interpretation of 6511. 
    Even though the Government will have had to wait 31 years for the return and the check, even though the litigation to follow, all the facts and circumstances that underlay the tax, occurred 31 years ago, that is the way section 6511 operates.

    In the Irwin decision, we had a procedure for recouping... procedure for suing on a title VII case that is really very similar to what we have where... in the statutory regime for refund claims. 
    We had a situation where an individual goes to his particular agency under the Civil Rights Act. 
    If that claim is denied, he goes to the EEOC, at which point there is a 30-day letter that is sent to the individual. 
    If that is denied, he has the opportunity to sue in Federal court, a very similar statutory regime.

    Mr. Robert F. Klueger 
    --The direct answer, Your Honor, the way we read (b)(2) is that it is not a substantive limitation. 
    To the extent that amounts are limited in (b)(2), it is as a function of the limitation in time. 
    There are plenty of substantive limitations that exist in the Internal Revenue Code. 
    This isn't one of them. 
    For example, the Internal Revenue Code says... provides a limitation on the credit you can get against the State taxes. 
    The code says, it's limited, $192,800. 
    That is a substantive limitation that is contained in the tax court... in the tax code, and no court can change it to $193,000. 
    That's not what we have here. 
    To the extent that it affects the limitation, it is a limitation that is a function of time, and that time in (b)(2) refers back to the time limitations in 6511(a).

    It seems to me in most of these doctrines it's when the claimant discovers the cause of action, that if you say, he's... you know, there's an excusable failure to get the facts sooner, so I don't know why the death is critical. 
    It seems to me the-- 
    --It's only critical because of the way Justice Breyer put the question. 
    You would have to say no, Justice Breyer, not just disability, but disability--

    You can take the position that Justice Scalia did and say, let's bring everything under the umbrella of equitable adjustment. 
    And then there are still distinctions between the cases, and the one is, title VII case was dealing with a situation in which the Government is often in the position of a private individual who normally gets the benefit of equitable tolling, whereas in the revenue situation, the Government is in a position peculiar unto itself, so those would be good reasons to say that there's no reason to think that the... that there would be a spillover of equitable considerations from a title VII case to a revenue case, and that seems to me to make more sense of the fact that these two cases came down in the same term, in which it would be very odd to think that one was being undercut by the other so soon.

    Mr. Robert F. Klueger

    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Right.

    Mr. Robert F. Klueger 
    It was from my reading enacted because equitable recoupment, the cases were going all over the place, and so Congress felt that they should bring some order to this doctrine of equitable recoupment, and so they enacted the mitigation provisions. 
    They are very, very narrow provisions. 
    They arise in only the rarest circumstances. 
    But I think the existence of the mitigation provisions, the statutory mitigation provisions, proves one point, which is that if you have a statutory mitigation provision in the tax code it doesn't necessarily mean that you cannot have an equitable overlay, because we still do have an equitable overlay, and that equitable overlay is the doctrine of equitable recoupment, which exists side by side with the mitigation provisions of the tax code. 
    Those provisions--

    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    If... wouldn't it totally eclipse what's in the code if you could just say, I don't want to deal with that dense stuff, it's so narrow and so technical. 
    Give me equitable tolling writ large.

    Mr. Robert F. Klueger 
    --No, Your Honor. 
    Equitable recoupment applies in a very, very narrow area. 
    It certainly is not limited to incompetent taxpayers. 
    You don't have your choice. 
    It's not like a cafeteria. 
    You don't get equitable recoupment or equitable tolling. 
    Equitable recoupment only can arise when two... when the taxpayer is called upon to pay two... to pay the same tax twice under different theories. 
    That's equitable recoupment. 
    Equitable tolling is a completely different doctrine. 
    It reminds me of what Mark Twain said about fires and fire flies.

    Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace 
    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 
    In Irwin, the Court recognized that waivers of sovereign immunity must be unequivocally expressed, and then said that once Congress had made such a waiver we think the rule of equitable tolling should be applicable to suits against the Government in the same way as to suits against private defendants, and that amounts to little, if any, broadening of the congressional waiver. 
    Those... that rationale applies to tolling of the limitations for filing suit, or for filing claims. 
    It really is not addressed to the obstacle here, which is a substantive limitation, a cap that Congress has imposed on the amount of the refund that's authorized to be disbursed from the Federal Treasury and, as I pointed out earlier, therefore it would require a broadening of a waiver of sovereign immunity beyond the express terms of the waiver to rule that a court may override this cap in the very sensitive area of disbursements from the Treasury, the area that is most related to the constitutional underpinnings of the doctrine of sovereign immunity itself, including the provision we have pointed to in the Constitution, in Article I, section 9, Clause 7, that no money shall be drawn from the Treasury but in consequence of appropriations made by law. 
    Now, it is the fact that in Webb the Fourth Circuit suggested some ways of reading the rebuttable presumption in Irwin more narrowly, and we have done the same thing in a pending petition and reply brief in a case called United States v. Fagin involving the Quiet Title Act, which we have suggested that the Court hold for the decision in this case. 
    But... and I think that these suggestions are well worthy of consideration, and the Court in Webb at the conclusion of its opinion pointed out some other areas involving other Federal statutes where various courts have held that the rebuttable presumption has been overcome even if the presumption of Irwin does apply, but in this particular case we're really beyond the area where it's just a limitation on the filing of the claim that's at issue. 
    If the Court has no further--
