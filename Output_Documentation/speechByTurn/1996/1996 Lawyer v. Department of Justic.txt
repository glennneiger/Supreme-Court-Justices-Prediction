    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    We'll hear argument next in Number 95-2024, C. Martin Lawyer, III, v. the Department of Justice. 
    Mr. Shapiro.

    Mr. Robert J. Shapiro 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    In this case, the district court used an unconstitutional process to achieve an unconstitutional result in the form of plan 386. 
    Before commencing my argument, I would like to make a correction in my reply brief which is important in that it's a reference to the record. 
    On page 14 of the reply brief I referred to the preclearance denial letter of the Justice Department as R. 18... I'm sorry, as R. 13, and it's actually in the record at R. 18, and the full text is at R. 18. 
    I also would like to just briefly refer to the maps which are attached to the briefs. 
    If I may, the first map we have is Appendix A to the reply brief. 
    This is the legislatively adopted plan which was approved by the Florida supreme court in 1992. 
    It's called SJR 2G. 
    This is District 21 in yellow, which is all encompassed within Tampa, Hillsborough County, Florida. 
    The next map we have was the court-ordered plan as a result of the Justice Department's preclearance denial letter. 
    They objected to it. 
    Although there was absolutely no history of Voting Rights Act violations against black voters in Hillsborough County they were covered under section 5 because in Hillsborough County they did not print ballots in Spanish as well as English. 
    So there was no congressional finding whatsoever of any Voting Rights Act violations against blacks in Hillsborough County, and this is in the record at... let's see, if I may. 
    Okay, it's at record at R. 104, which I didn't put in my brief. 
    R. 104, page 3, specifically states that. 
    You can see that this district extends into Pinellas County. 
    This is Hillsborough County. 
    It goes into Polk County. 
    It's called the Polk County finger, and we have the--

    Mr. Robert J. Shapiro 
    That's correct. 
    This was the one that was challenged by the plaintiff in his lawsuit, so this is the one that was the result of the preclearance denial letter by the Justice Department.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="216.258" stopTime="268.502">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Mr. Shapiro, I had a question about the challenge and the choice of forum. 
    You are attacking a decision of the Florida supreme court, and you come into a Federal court to do that. 
    Was there not a means by which you could have fought out your challenge to a district created by the Florida supreme court in the Florida State system so you wouldn't have the embarrassment of a Federal court being faced with a decision of the Florida supreme court that it was impelled to reject? 
    Could you have gotten a remedy by appealing to the State system rather than running to the Federal courts?
speaker="robert_j_shapiro" startTime="268.502" stopTime="277.240">
    Mr. Robert J. Shapiro 
    No, Your Honor, because this was a challenge based on what the Justice Department had forced the Florida supreme court--
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="277.240" stopTime="289.716">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    But that doesn't tell me why you couldn't say... I mean, the Equal Protection Clause governs the State of Florida, as it does the Nation. 
    Why couldn't you then go into the State court system, make precisely the argument made in the Federal court?
speaker="robert_j_shapiro" startTime="289.716" stopTime="310.432">
    Mr. Robert J. Shapiro 
    --First of all, the Florida supreme court did not reserve jurisdiction over this issue. 
    It reserved jurisdiction when it approved this district in 597 So.2d. 
    If you read the opinion of the Florida supreme court it says, we reserve jurisdiction. 
    But when it approved 330 at the insistence of the Justice Department it did not reserve jurisdiction.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="310.432" stopTime="325.751">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    I don't mean in that case. 
    Bring the case... bring another case, in which you're saying, Florida supreme court, we know you've got precedent, but you were acting under the gun of the Department of Justice, so we want to free you from that thrall.
speaker="robert_j_shapiro" startTime="325.751" stopTime="336.208">
    Mr. Robert J. Shapiro 
    Well, Your Honor, the only thing I can say is that the plaintiff had the right to contest this district in U.S. district court, and under the Voting Rights Act.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="336.208" stopTime="361.195">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Mr. Shapiro, I appreciate that you did, but there was a certain anomaly in you coming to a Federal court to in effect override a decision of the State court and then say that the Federal court has not been sufficiently respectful of the State authorities. 
    Maybe you haven't in coming to the Federal court rather than a State court for the solution to your problem.
speaker="robert_j_shapiro" startTime="361.195" stopTime="375.594">
    Mr. Robert J. Shapiro 
    Well, that issue was resolved in the trial court. 
    There were motions... there were actually motions to dismiss filed by the Attorney General in the State of Florida asserting that position. 
    Those were denied by the district court, and that was not appealed.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="375.594" stopTime="382.657">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Do you think you would have had much of a chance had you gone into a Florida trial court and said that what the Florida supreme court did was a mistake?
speaker="robert_j_shapiro" startTime="382.657" stopTime="414.129">
    Mr. Robert J. Shapiro 
    I don't know that a Florida trial court would have jurisdiction in the Voting Rights Act case, Your Honor. 
    I just don't know. 
    I don't think so. 
    I think this would be exclusive jurisdiction in the Federal district court, and Mr. Lawyer had a right to make a Shaw claim in the U.S. district court, and again, there was a motion filed by the Attorney General to abstain, to transfer because of the DeGrandy litigation, which was in progress at the time. 
    This district... this plan was in U.S. district court in the Northern District.

    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Mr. Shapiro, may I just clarify, is anybody now claiming that plan should be defended?

    Mr. Robert J. Shapiro 
    Well, yes. 
    The... in fact, and that's a critical aspect of this case, is that the... at no time in this litigation did... was there ever an adjudication that this plan was unconstitutional.

    Mr. Robert J. Shapiro 
    --The Attorney General... I'm sorry. 
    The State appellants at the least, specifically in their settlement agreement said, we do not acknowledge that 330 is unconstitutional, and we have a right... if their settlement plan was rejected, they retained the right to contest that 330 was unconstitutional, and that's a key aspect of this case, in that there was never an adjudication of liability that that 330--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="465.274" stopTime="470.127">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Well, I thought in this Court though they don't contest that it's unconstitutional.

    Mr. Robert J. Shapiro 
    --I believe they do. 
    They do not concede that 330 was unconstitutional.

    But how does that bear on the arguments you're trying to make?
speaker="robert_j_shapiro" startTime="476.832" stopTime="482.766">
    Mr. Robert J. Shapiro 
    It doesn't bear on the arguments. 
    I do not... they do not admit that 330 is unconstitutional.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="482.766" stopTime="488.409">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    But then, why don't we go to the district which basically we're talking about here, I take it.
speaker="robert_j_shapiro" startTime="488.409" stopTime="518.902">
    Mr. Robert J. Shapiro 
    That's correct. 
    This is 386. 
    This was the settlement plan that was approved by the Federal court. 
    Now, you can see what happened with the map that was produced at the "fairness hearing". 
    There's no political subdivisions that are even included in this, when you talk about disrespect for political subdivisions. 
    Here's Tampa Bay. 
    It's a huge body of water. 
    Although there's the shoreline which is depicted, it doesn't really reflect which portion of Pinellas County... Pinellas County is over here. 
    You don't know that because it's not on here.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="518.902" stopTime="521.582">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    We can't tell where Tampa Bay is on that map.
speaker="robert_j_shapiro" startTime="521.582" stopTime="525.567">
    Mr. Robert J. Shapiro 
    Well, that's the whole purpose of our map. 
    We have enhanced the map.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="525.567" stopTime="527.737">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    We now know where Tampa Bay is.
speaker="robert_j_shapiro" startTime="527.737" stopTime="544.960">
    Mr. Robert J. Shapiro 
    This is a rather large body of water. 
    Now, if... I'm sorry everybody can't see it, but this is... you can now see the contours, for the first time, of the district. 
    The district is a tiny portion of Pinellas County over here. 
    I'm referring now to Appendix B of the brief on the merits for the appellants. 
    This is in--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="544.960" stopTime="546.811">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    That's where St. Petersburg is, right?

    Mr. Robert J. Shapiro 
    --Yes, sir. 
    Yes sir. 
    St. Petersburg is over here, and that is a portion of Pinellas County, but this is all Pinellas County. 
    They chose this portion of Pinellas County. 
    Now, what they did was, they eliminated that part that went over to Polk County, but they retained this at the insistence of the Justice Department. 
    Now, if you look at this little spit of land here, this was included as well, so it goes all the way across, and if you look back at the plan that was presented to the court, it looks like one contiguous compact piece of land.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="577.582" stopTime="579.432">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    But much of that is the lake, is what you're saying.

    Mr. Robert J. Shapiro 
    Yes, sir.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="579.742" stopTime="584.707">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    And you're suggesting that the judges down there didn't know where Tampa Bay was. 
    [Laughter]
speaker="robert_j_shapiro" startTime="584.707" stopTime="604.822">
    Mr. Robert J. Shapiro 
    Well, I don't know. 
    Judge Tjoflat said, well, we assume there's no houseboats there. 
    That's what he said in... at the fairness hearing. 
    Well, there are no... they have a lot of fish there, and they don't vote. 
    [Laughter] 
    But as we... as Mr. Lawyer made clear this is only part of the picture though, the shape of the map and irregular aspect of it.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="604.822" stopTime="610.386">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Is that unusual in Florida, to have a district separated by a body of water?
speaker="robert_j_shapiro" startTime="610.386" stopTime="678.762">
    Mr. Robert J. Shapiro 
    Well, it is not unusual to be separated by a body of water, but it's a totally different proposition when there... when a district has to be... a piece of land has to be in some district, say in an island and the Florida supreme court stated this in their original decision. 
    They said, look, in Florida there's a lot of water, so just because a district encompasses water doesn't necessarily make it noncontiguous. 
    It's another proposition for the district to artificially reach over this huge body of water for the specific exclusive purpose of including black voters in order to boost the population of the entire district, and that was the exact purpose of the designers of this plan, was to go across at this highly dense black community in Pinellas, where they had been in their own district. 
    In fact, it's truly emblematic of this case that if you look at 21, whereas under their plan they presented to the court, the number 21 was in yellow, now the two is submerged in water, so it's... so they have jumped across Tampa Bay and taken these counties, which used to be in other districts. 
    They were in other districts.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="678.762" stopTime="689.880">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    But you're not claiming now, as I think was the case in the earlier district, that they put together rural areas with urban areas on both sides of the rivers, or the bay?
speaker="robert_j_shapiro" startTime="689.880" stopTime="728.657">
    Mr. Robert J. Shapiro 
    No. 
    As a matter of fact, that was eliminated, this finger, but when you create a monster, you can cut the fingers off, it's still a monster. 
    This finger was cut off that led to Polk County, which was rural, but the NAACP opposed the plan of joining Pinellas County over here, because they said there's not even a cohesive black community in the Tampa-Hillsborough area, much less the Pinellas area. 
    They opposed it. 
    But what the Justice Department did was, it insisted that in order to create an additional majority district, that they must join the populations.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="728.657" stopTime="730.958">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    I thought this wasn't a majority--
speaker="robert_j_shapiro" startTime="730.958" stopTime="734.771">
    Mr. Robert J. Shapiro 
    It is not a majority, but the purpose was to create a majority--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="734.771" stopTime="740.254">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    --Why did the NAACP oppose it? 
    What was... why did they think that would harm the interests of the black voters?
speaker="robert_j_shapiro" startTime="740.254" stopTime="772.785">
    Mr. Robert J. Shapiro 
    --Because they... they were correct. 
    This plan... this is striking. 
    Sixty-four percent of all Pinellas County's blacks are now in plan 386. 
    Even more, 74 percent of Manatee County's blacks are in the plan, so they bleach... and the NAACP said, look, you re bleaching the surrounding areas of their influence, because you're taking a pocket of black voters, and you're forcing them into that plan where they don't belong. 
    Now, the Justice Department--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="772.785" stopTime="778.849">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Before you leave that, may I just ask, does the NAACP... are they a party to the appeal? 
    They don't challenge it now, do they?
speaker="robert_j_shapiro" startTime="778.849" stopTime="806.280">
    Mr. Robert J. Shapiro 
    --No. 
    They are not a party to this appeal, and they were not involved in this litigation. 
    But when the... here's the point. 
    When the Florida supreme court considered the idea, at the insistence of the Justice Department, that they cross Tampa Bay to pick up this pocket of black voters, the Florida supreme court in the 601 So.2d copy said, but these... this is not a compact group of black voters.

    No, we don't. 
    But those comments that they made before the Florida supreme court are directly relevant to this case, because they said... they said to the court they objected to any plan... any plan which would cross Tampa Bay and join these populations.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="844.777" stopTime="848.297">

    The problem is, that does an end run around the Florida legislature, which in the traditional cases that this Court has said over and over and over, including Miller, this Court has said it's the province of the State legislature--

    Mr. White they sue, okay, and they say, Mr. White, you're doing a bad thing here, and he says no I'm not, and now they say, four of the five, not your client but the other four say, we'll settle. 
    White says, I won't settle if I have to admit I was wrong. 
    We won't make you admit it. 
    Okay. 
    So four of them settle with Mr. White, and the judge then simply enters a decree embodying their settlement which doesn't admit liability.

    Mr. Robert J. Shapiro 
    I will. 
    The... 330 itself... 386 was approved by the court. 
    Now, what our position is on this case is that, as I said, the original district, 330, was never declared unconstitutional, but it was a product of coercion by the Justice Department. 
    Now, what happened here is--

    Mr. Robert J. Shapiro 
    --Because... it absolutely does, because the coercive order of a Federal court is based upon adjudication. 
    A Federal court can only order a remedy where there has been an adjudication, or there has been some admission of liability. 
    Here, there was never an admission of liability.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="1214.210" stopTime="1262.191">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Mr. Shapiro, since you are making much of this point, Mr. Lawyer submitted a statement together with Plaintiff Scott and others, a statement of the case, representing to the district court as a result of this Court's decision in the Miller case there are no issues of law to be decided by the court in this matter. 
    Accordingly, the only issue which would remain for the court to decide at the trial on this matter is the issue of the appropriate remedy. 
    Now, it seems to me that your first point about how the court has to declare the old district unconstitutional, this is a stipulation that your client joined and said, court, we all agree there's nothing for you to decide but the remedy for this constitutional violation.
speaker="robert_j_shapiro" startTime="1262.191" stopTime="1283.959">
    Mr. Robert J. Shapiro 
    By the remedy he meant how much time... this... how much time the court should give the legislature to decide what the replacement plan would be. 
    He did not specify that the court should actually decide what the plan should be, so he didn't... he said the remedy, meaning how much time to give the court, how much time to give the legislature.

    Mr. Robert J. Shapiro 
    There was never a trial period in this case.

    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    --But I'm just reading the stipulation, trying to find out what that means. 
    One thing it says, there's no issue of law dividing the parties.

speaker="robert_j_shapiro" startTime="1306.563" stopTime="1318.992">
    Mr. Robert J. Shapiro 
    What he meant by that was that he... the remedy meaning the court should determine... assuming that there's an unconstitutional district, the court should then determine how it's supposed to act, and it's supposed to act by referring it back to the legislature.

    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Well, I'm still so confused by your position here. 
    Do you want this Court to just focus on the fact that--

    Mr. Robert J. Shapiro 
    No.

    --Wait a minute. 
    You didn't even hear the question, and you've already answered it. 
    Do you want to hear the question and then answer it? 
    You appear to be here arguing that the procedure followed by the Federal district court was erroneous because it didn't first find unconstitutionality of plan 330, and furthermore it did not then await an opportunity for the legislature to adopt its own plan, so much of the argument centers on that. 
    On the other hand, do you have an argument here at all to the effect that, irrespective of that, what the court ended up with by virtue of the agreement of the other parties, other than Lawyer, is itself unconstitutional.
speaker="robert_j_shapiro" startTime="1380.815" stopTime="1381.586">
    Mr. Robert J. Shapiro

    Yes, we do.

speaker="robert_j_shapiro" startTime="1385.650" stopTime="1490.954">
    Mr. Robert J. Shapiro 
    Yes, we do. 
    What happened in this case, the Court in approving plan 386 did not adequately apply the Miller standards. 
    They held... instead of determining and applying those... that case very carefully they said, well, 386 is better than 330, so we're going to approve it. 
    They said that it was benign and statute satisfactorily tidy, because it was better than 330. 
    That's not an accurate... an adequate application of Miller. 
    Instead of using the community of interest analysis in Miller in looking at the actual objective evidence in terms of what these communities are, they held... they used a fairness hearing as a referendum and said, well, we're... because we have a fairness hearing and we've put a notice in the newspaper that anybody who wants to contest 386 could come to the court and do that, the court in this case, the district court said, well, nobody showed up and objected to plan 386, so therefore there must be a community of interest. 
    The statistics of the case are also important. 
    The statistics are that although 330 had 45 percent black voters of V.A.P., this plan had 36 percent, so that a significant number of black voters were moved from their place over here in Pinellas County into District 21 when they normally would not be there. 
    There was no... and one of the key aspects is... I know I've harped on this, but in adopting the procedure that the court used of using mediation in a secret sessions to design this plan, in effect there is no report or any evidence of the exact factors that the designers of the plan used. 
    Miller absolutely mandates--

    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Wasn't there one point that you had an opportunity to examine the designer of the plan?

    He did, but there was... he was permitted to cross-examine the witness, but there was no oral testimony at that... there was no one under oath, there was no oral testimony whatsoever at the fairness hearing, and there were no findings of fact, which is the most critical aspect of this case, really.

    Mr. Richard G. Taranto 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    The equal protection holding of the district court should be affirmed, we suggest, because there's ample evidence to find, under this Court's recent decisions, that race did not predominate over, did not subordinate other districting principles in the design of plan 386, and the Court should find no Federalism problem here because the district court, acting only after giving the legislature an opportunity to convene, then properly allowed authorized State officials to resolve the serious Federal claim here by proposing a lawful districting plan, giving appellant an opportunity to challenge the lawfulness of that plan--

    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Did the court below ever enter an order saying, and I hereby give 60 days or 90 days or something in which the legislature can act, or did he just accept somebody's statement that the legislature wasn't going to be called into special session?
speaker="richard_g_taranto" startTime="1837.816" stopTime="1866.574">
    Mr. Richard G. Taranto 
    --I think it's a combination of those. 
    In July of 1995, after this Court decided Miller, there was a status conference at which everyone recognized this claim had now become substantially more risky than it had been before. 
    Part of what the district court did was to enter an order directing the State parties every 30 days to file a piece of paper in the court saying whether the State legislature would be convened to address what was now recognized to be a serious Federal claim. 
    That--

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    It's uncontested, is it not, that the legislature had no opportunity, after this Court had determined that the district was unconstitutional and therefore could not be used, to adopt on its own a new district?

    Mr. Richard G. Taranto

speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="1904.408" stopTime="1916.686">

    --I think there is a serious burden on whoever is taking the word of a couple of members of a State legislature that the State legislature as a body concedes to redistricting for the State.

    I'm talking about the assertion that I and one other person have the authority on behalf of the entire legislature of Florida to agree to redistricting of the State. 
    That's an extraordinary assertion.

    Mr. Richard G. Taranto 
    Your Honor, I don't think it's extraordinary. 
    I think State parties are defendants in Federal courts all of the time. 
    It is a matter of State law what authority they have through whoever the party is to settle litigation. 
    We've cited in our brief a number of authorities to show that the Florida authorities, including the Attorney General and the State parties, the State legislative parties, did have that authority, and that has never been contested here. 
    The district court here took great care to assure itself that it was not allowing itself to be used to usurp authority.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="2031.252" stopTime="2060.753">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Well, I think it is one thing to settle litigation. 
    That is, to agree on behalf of the legislature that the State will not oppose the judicially... the judicially imposed districting. 
    That's one thing. 
    But what is being asserted here is that this is not judicially imposed districting, that this is districting that was, in fact, expressing the will of the Florida legislature, which to my mind is an important thing if the prior district was never declared unconstitutional.
speaker="richard_g_taranto" startTime="2060.753" stopTime="2094.476">
    Mr. Richard G. Taranto 
    I think what's going on here is that there is... by the time the summer of 1995 comes around there is a very serious Federal challenge. 
    Authorized State officials I don't think are required or should be stripped of the authority to resolve that litigation voluntarily as other defendants can resolve their Federal claims. 
    That seems to me to turn Federalism principles upside down. 
    Consent decrees are routinely... customarily, as this Court said in Maher v. Gagne, entered without liability findings against State defendants and it would, I think, strip them of an important authority--

    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    --Well, frankly, looking at the series of maps, it didn't strike me as terribly important if we were to say the district judge should have found the plan 330 unconstitutional before deciding which plan to adopt, and if it went back, the court could probably make that finding.

    Mr. Richard G. Taranto 
    --When I say that the issue was not joined, the State appellees are prepared to accept and were prepared to accept back in November 20... November 20, a judgment entering a finding of liability without conceding the constitutional issue. 
    It was not pressed at the point, and not necessary, so we would accept an affirmance under Judge Tjoflat's route. 
    What we do think is that this district, the 1995 district, is constitutional under this Court's standards, and all of what I think this Court said last term in the Bush case and the Shaw case indicates that there is a variety of evidence that bears on that question. 
    Here, the evidence is partly what there is, and partly what there isn't. 
    What there isn't is any block-by-block separation of races.

    Mr. Richard G. Taranto 
    Yes. 
    The one restriction that was pressed by Judge... Chief Judge Tjoflat was a restriction about asking... about putting the Justice Department attorney on the stand and that, I think, is actually a perfectly proper discretionary evidentiary ruling. 
    There is a general rule that says you don't make a lawyer a witness in the case absent compelling need. 
    Before you've examined the man who drew the district, before you've examined the State officials who actually negotiated, you couldn't possibly show a compelling need, and there was no showing of that sort by appellant. 
    Appellant was allowed to submit statistics, allowed to submit a different plan, allowed to submit his own maps, some of these maps... he was invited to put on any evidence he had and under, I think, this Court's decision in Local 93, it is very clear that once the other parties to the case agreed on a decree, that couldn't... that by itself couldn't adjudicate his rights, but he had an opportunity to adjudicate his claim that this district was unlawful. 
    And I think this district cannot be found unlawful. 
    It is not a safe minority district. 
    It is... geographically and economically shares a real community of interest. 
    There's plenty of evidence to that effect. 
    There... this is not a district that had the kind of process flaws of either being dictated by the Justice Department... this was negotiated in a wideranging discussion, including appellant's coplaintiffs who after the fact came in and said, this is not a district that is race-based.

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Mr. Taranto, I'm prepared to accept your analysis as far as whether the district, had it been adopted by the legislature, would be unconstitutional. 
    My problem with this case is, I think it's a serious matter to say that when the Florida legislature as a whole has not been put on notice that its existing districting is unconstitutional, and has not been given an opportunity after that notice to itself draw a district... which might have been like this, but then again it might not have... it isn't enough for me that this district be constitutional. 
    I also would like it to be the district that the voters of Florida wanted to the extent that the Federal court could have given them an opportunity to select it.
speaker="richard_g_taranto" startTime="2468.990" stopTime="2487.131">
    Mr. Richard G. Taranto 
    Your Honor, I don't agree with that rule, because I think that the proper Federalism rule in this context is one that leaves it to State law what officials have the authority to engage in what kind of settlement of litigation, and that's what is undisputed here.

    Mr. Richard G. Taranto 
    Well, several things. 
    The briefing that was submitted in support of the plan, the particular... I think the fullest brief was by the United States... cited the State statutory authority as interpreted in various decisions giving the Attorney General the authority to resolve litigation. 
    There's an affidavit in the joint appendix from the Speaker of the House citing the House rule that specific--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="2568.217" stopTime="2577.313">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    So you didn't even need the Senators. 
    It would have been enough to have the Attorney General? 
    The Attorney General could redistrict the State, or could agree to it?
speaker="richard_g_taranto" startTime="2577.313" stopTime="2607.733">
    Mr. Richard G. Taranto 
    --I think as a matter of Florida law that is probably correct. 
    I think as a district court is being asked to enter a decree that resolves a serious claim, and puts in place a new plan subject to any change that the legislature wants to make, it needs to inquire into all the circumstances. 
    It's a harder case if the House and the Senate both came in and said, we disagree about what should be done. 
    That's not this case.

    Mr. Richard G. Taranto 
    --Well, the State as a party itself is... I think the form of the question is, could it change its State statute by voluntarily settling through the Attorney General a serious piece of Federal litigation? 
    I think the Abramson decision under Florida law is supportive of that. 
    There is the affidavit of the Speaker citing and attesting to the authority under the House rule, and then there was a series of representations I think two or three times in which the attorney for the Senate was asked by the court, are you sure that you really have authority to be representing the Senate here and he said, yes, I'm absolutely sure. 
    I'm absolutely sure.

    Well, I can certainly understand that a State and this Court might be willing to accept the notion that the attorneys on behalf of the State could agree that the former plan was unconstitutional. 
    Now let's go from there. 
    Is it nevertheless a matter of Federal law that the full legislature be given an opportunity, following that, to adopt a plan?

    Mr. Richard G. Taranto 
    --Well, I think it is a matter of Federal law that an... a proper opportunity to be given. 
    I think it's also a matter of Federal law whether there should be a rigid rule saying, you have to have, in this one class of cases, an adjudicated violation. 
    I think that that, in fact, strips States of an important authority that all other litigants have and doesn't--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="2786.808" stopTime="2808.824">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Well, of course, the concern expressed by this Court in saying there should be such was a concern on behalf of the States that the Federal court shouldn't intrude and take upon itself the job of drawing a legislative district without finding a good reason for it, to wit, invalidity of what the legislature had put its task--

    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor

    Mr. Richard G. Taranto 
    --Insofar as the State is concerned, though, it is a consent decree. 
    It's a consent decree between the four other plaintiffs and the State appellees and the other defendants, and by the way, the reason that is plain in this record for why the legislature was not going to convene has nothing to do with whether there had been an adjudicated violation. 
    It has to do with a series of political problems in the State that I think Judge Merryday referred to in the October 26 hearing that a whole series of important, contentious vetoes are triggered for override the minute the legislature convenes, and that was not going to happen. 
    I don't think there was any... that it would have made any difference had there been an adjudication. 
    The same thing would have happened: thank you for the opportunity; we're not going to do it; we think that this ought to be resolved here. 
    The only difference, therefore, that we're talking about in this regard is whether this declaratory judgment that plan 330, the predecessor, is invalid, a different... a declaratory judgment that can't possibly make a difference to appellant, who's already had that plan eliminated by court order.

    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    So your position is that, as far as the State legislature and the State itself is concerned, that counsel had a right to waive any finding of unconstitutionality, and they did so, and the State had a right to waive any opportunity to redraw a district, and they did so. 
    Is that your position, in essence?

   Argument of Irving L. Gornstein
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2914.035" stopTime="2917.298">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Thank you, Mr. Taranto. 
    Mr. Gornstein, we'll hear from you.
speaker="irving_l_gornstein" startTime="2917.298" stopTime="3041.502">
    Mr. Irving L. Gornstein 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    Our position is that the settlement plan is constitutional, and that the district court did not violate any principles of Federalism in approving it. 
    On the constitutional question, I wanted to make three points. 
    The first is that the district court applied the correct legal standard in judging the constitutionality of the proposed plan, that it correctly drew from Miller the principle that a plan is subject to strict scrutiny only when a challenger can show that race predominated in the design of the district. 
    The second point I wanted to make is that district court findings of predominant motive are governed by the clearly erroneous standard of review, so that the district court's finding in this case that District 21 was not predominantly motivated by racial considerations is subject to review in this Court only for clear error. 
    The final point I wanted to make on the constitutional question is that the district court's subsidiary findings show that its ultimate finding on predominant motive is not clearly erroneous, and those findings are that the district is sufficiently regular by Florida standards to avoid any suggestion that race predominated, that the district includes a genuine community of interest, and that the district affords to any candidate, without regard to race, the opportunity to be elected. 
    Now, those findings are all supported by the record and are together sufficient to support the district court's ultimate finding that race did not predominate. 
    On the Federalism question, we think it was entirely appropriate for the district court to resolve the litigation without making a formal adjudication based on the State's consent. 
    It would... it is one of the principle reasons that parties enter into settlements, is to avoid a formal adjudication, to avoid findings of liability.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="3041.502" stopTime="3057.602">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Well, but how can it do so as against somebody who didn't consent, to wit, the petitioner here? 
    How can it avoid some opportunity to have evidence put on and conduct a full inquiry into the validity of plan 386?
speaker="irving_l_gornstein" startTime="3057.602" stopTime="3069.270">
    Mr. Irving L. Gornstein 
    It certainly can have... is required for there to be an inquiry into the validity of 386. 
    What there was not required was an inquiry into the validity of 330.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="3069.270" stopTime="3131.283">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    Well, but the appellant is in the position of suggesting that there be redistricting, or that the old district be approved, and faces, as the court faces, a difficult task in determining what are legitimate criteria for districting? 
    What are community interests? 
    What are legislative preferences? 
    And it seems to me that the court must exercise its discretion to have before it and to have available to the parties the legislative policies, the legislative determinations as to what legitimate district criteria are, and by not referring this to the legislature and accepting too quickly, perhaps, the representations of State officials, the court and the appellant were deprived of that data, that body of guidelines that are necessary to make appropriate and legitimate districting determinations.
speaker="irving_l_gornstein" startTime="3131.283" stopTime="3167.145">
    Mr. Irving L. Gornstein 
    Well, I think that the legislature did... had ample opportunity to convene, and to legislate a plan if it had wanted to. 
    It was faced with more than a very serious claim under Miller, and I think everybody in the legislature must have been aware that the Florida supreme court's plan was extremely vulnerable, and still it did not convene in legislative session, and instead what it did is, its authorized representatives, the Speaker of the House and the President of the Senate, are authorized to conduct litigation, and they negotiated a settlement. 
    Now, the... that settlement says that it shall only--

    I--

    Mr. Irving L. Gornstein 
    --I... to go on to what the legislative opportunity was here, there were then negotiations. 
    Nothing prevented the legislature during that entire time that negotiations were ongoing to intervene, convene, and submit a plan. 
    Then there was a settlement agreement presented to the district court, and that settlement agreement says that this shall only remain into... in effect unless and until the legislature formally enacts a different plan in compliance with Federal and State law, still. 
    Now, there was remedial hearing held in November. 
    The district court did not approve this until March. 
    There was a long period of time in which the legislature knew that if it did nothing there... the district court had before it a proposal that it could resolve at any time to resolve this litigation. 
    Still the district court did nothing, and it has done nothing since to change the plan even though the settlement itself says that it only remains in effect unless and until the legislature formally adopts a different plan in compliance with State and Federal law.

    Mr. Irving L. Gornstein 
    Let me break that down into two parts. 
    There is the prehearing before the remedial hearing, and then there is the remedial hearing. 
    Let me address the prehearing first. 
    An inquiry was made by the Department of Justice, do we have to submit live evidence or can we introduce it in other ways, and I will quote from that.

speaker="irving_l_gornstein" startTime="3296.131" stopTime="3301.926">
    Mr. Irving L. Gornstein 
    It's a pretrial conference, and I'm not sure whether it was an open court or not, but I think it probably was.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="3301.926" stopTime="3303.258">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    Are you going to read from the record?
speaker="irving_l_gornstein" startTime="3303.258" stopTime="3404.359">
    Mr. Irving L. Gornstein 
    I am reading, and this is page 31 of the hearing from November 2, 1995, and I don't have the record cite to that. 
    I apologize for that. 
    But the presentation that the proponents of the settlement agreement are to lead off with: 
    Is it the court's contemplation that it be evidentiary in nature? 
    Should we be prepared to put witnesses under oath? 
    I think Mr. Hill might have mentioned that he thought it might suffice simply to have lawyers present the plan, but if a full evidentiary presentation is preferred, we would be prepared to do that. 
    It is a matter of figuring out what the court's preference is so that we can prepare accordingly. 
    The answer comes, I assume there are some judges somewhere who simply enjoy hearing evidence. 
    No. 
    Now, I take that to be a response that the proponents did not have to put on live evidence, that they could rely on the attachments. 
    I don't take that to be a preclusion of the appellant or anyone else who would have wanted an opportunity to present evidence at that hearing to do that, and I think when we get to the evidence... now, this is in the joint appendix at page 185, at the remedial hearing. 
    The bottom of the page, Judge Tjoflat says, at the very bottom, Mr. Hill has summarized in effect what is in the record. 
    There are affidavits in the record. 
    If you want to examine Mr. Guthrie you're free to do so, or call any witness you want. 
    I think it was quite clear at the remedial hearing that there was a full chance to put on evidence for the appellant. 
    Now, if the appellant didn't think... had misunderstood that he was... and thought he didn't have that chance before, he could have said something about that. 
    He could have said, look, I didn't think that I was going to get that chance. 
    I need more time. 
    He didn't say anything like that.

    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Mr. Gornstein, maybe you can explain something to me about this record, because it does seem that in the beginning the plaintiffs, everybody was trying to settle this. 
    Everybody agreed that the plan was vulnerable under... the old plan under Miller, and there was the stipulation that I read, and then there seemed at some point there was... this harmony that prevailed about, let's stipulate, let's mediate, broke down, but it's not clear to me how that happened.
speaker="irving_l_gornstein" startTime="3430.936" stopTime="3437.492">
    Mr. Irving L. Gornstein 
    Well, I think Mr.... the appellant in this case was not satisfied with the results of mediation, and--
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="3437.492" stopTime="3440.103">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    But going into mediation, everybody was on board.

    Mr. Irving L. Gornstein 
    --Yes, with the idea that it would be a good idea to mediate. 
    Yes. 
    I think that the rule that there should be no precondition, that there... it will always have to be a liability finding is extremely important in facilitating settlements, and it would disserve the principles of Federalism, we would suggest, to make the States the only parties who could not settle cases without either a formal adjudication or an admission of liability, because when an admission of liability is required, that is going to discourage in many cases voluntary compliance in... with the law. 
    It is going to discourage States from entering into settlements, because there are consequences to admissions of liability, so that the value of voluntary--
