    Mr. Norman E. Waldrop, Jr. 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    There were 206,255 class members like petitioners who had fraud claims for substantial money damages as a result of Liberty National exchanging their cancer policies in August of 1986, beginning in August of 1986. 
    The money damage claims of these plaintiff class members were for fraudulently inflated premiums both as a result of the new policy being more expensive and the shifting of policyholders without their knowledge into higher, more expensive age bands.

    Mr. Waldrop, you are here before the Court asking this Court to decide a Federal due process issue, and whether the Federal Constitution requires an opt-out provision for plaintiffs in the class, is that right?

    Mr. Norman E. Waldrop, Jr. 
    If you start on page 21, and then on page 23 of our brief we state that the minimum due process requires that class members be given the right to opt out, to exclude themselves from the class, and there we begin talking about the decision of Shutts v. Phillips Petroleum.

    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    --Well, what were the questions that you raised, the legal issues and the claims in the Alabama supreme court? 
    I thought there were three.

    Mr. Norman E. Waldrop, Jr. 
    Well--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="183.832" stopTime="185.304">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    You raised three issues.
speaker="norman_e_waldrop_jr" startTime="185.304" stopTime="185.885">
    Mr. Norman E. Waldrop, Jr. 
    --Yes, we did.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="185.885" stopTime="197.592">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    And one of those issues was that because there was no opt-out provision for the class it violated the Alabama constitutional right to a jury trial.
speaker="norman_e_waldrop_jr" startTime="197.592" stopTime="199.765">
    Mr. Norman E. Waldrop, Jr. 
    We did argue that before the Alabama supreme court.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="199.765" stopTime="201.606">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Okay. 
    That was one issue that you raised.
speaker="norman_e_waldrop_jr" startTime="201.606" stopTime="202.687">
    Mr. Norman E. Waldrop, Jr. 
    That was one issue.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="202.687" stopTime="214.685">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    And there were two others, but neither of them appeared to me on reading them to raise a Federal due process violation like the failure to have an opt-out provision.
speaker="norman_e_waldrop_jr" startTime="214.685" stopTime="248.406">
    Mr. Norman E. Waldrop, Jr. 
    Well, we felt like we raised it with sufficient clarity, because, for example, the respondents' brief, both class counsel in their very first... the class counsel raised it as one of their statement of issues, and then, when you would look at their brief, for example, in their summary of argument, their very first page starts out by saying the mandatory class and class action settlement on a no-opt-out basis was proper and does not violate constitutional guarantees.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="248.406" stopTime="254.420">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    All right, but we do know, I guess, or will you concede that the Alabama supreme court did not address this issue.

    Mr. Norman E. Waldrop, Jr. 
    Well--

    Did it or did it not?

speaker="norman_e_waldrop_jr" startTime="263.396" stopTime="272.541">
    Mr. Norman E. Waldrop, Jr. 
    --No, the Alabama supreme court did not directly address the no-out, opt-out issue in regard to due process.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="272.541" stopTime="272.892">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Right.
speaker="norman_e_waldrop_jr" startTime="272.892" stopTime="305.084">
    Mr. Norman E. Waldrop, Jr. 
    They did cite the Shutts opinion, but they cited it merely for the fact that a class action was a type of joinder. 
    We felt like it was raised with compelling clarity because class counsel responded to it for some 20 pages in their brief. 
    The Liberty National responded to it for some 29 pages in their brief. 
    So we felt like the issue was in fact thoroughly briefed to the Alabama supreme court, and they chose not to address it.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="305.084" stopTime="310.008">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    And you did not raise it in any of your claimed issues before that court.
speaker="norman_e_waldrop_jr" startTime="310.008" stopTime="319.946">
    Mr. Norman E. Waldrop, Jr. 
    Well, we felt that we did because of our subheading on page 23 of our brief, when we stated that minimum due process required the right to opt out.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="319.946" stopTime="325.720">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    So you refer us now to pages 21 and 23 of your brief to the Alabama supreme court.

    Justice David H. Souter 
    Was your brief that specific? 
    When you recharacterized what was in it a moment ago I thought you said that you had claimed in there that the lack of opt-out did not violate any constitutional provision, and now you refer specifically to due process. 
    Did you say in the brief that it does not violate Fourteenth Amendment due process?

    Mr. Norman E. Waldrop, Jr. 
    Well, we stated it in our head note, Justice Souter, when we said minimum due process requires an opt-out, and then we were discussing--
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="378.970" stopTime="383.585">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    But I mean, that... all I want to know is that statement, minimum due process requires an opt-out, was in your brief?

    Mr. Norman E. Waldrop, Jr. 
    --Yes.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="383.944" stopTime="396.555">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    Okay. 
    But it was in the brief consistently on pages 23 and 24, referring to the jurisdictional right of a plaintiff who is absent from the State. 
    Is that the argument you're making here? 
    I thought you were making quite a different argument.
speaker="norman_e_waldrop_jr" startTime="396.555" stopTime="401.947">
    Mr. Norman E. Waldrop, Jr. 
    Well, we're making the argument here that Shutts requires an opt-out.
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="401.947" stopTime="452.365">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    Yes, but you never raised that point. 
    That is to say, as I read every single sentence on pages 23 and 24 and 25, which I have in front of me, every time that you refer to it you talk about the rights. 
    You say, in Shutts the trial court asserted jurisdiction over nonresident class members in a class suit. 
    Then you quote it. 
    Then you go on to talk about, this action does not provide absent class members the opportunity to remove themselves. 
    The U.S. Supreme Court similarly held that the State wishes to bind an absent plaintiff, et cetera. 
    And I can't find anywhere here the quite different argument that you are now making, which I take it is an interesting question, about whether people who are within a State have a right to be opted out. 
    If you're making the argument about absent plaintiffs, I guess it was decided in Shutts, and you're certainly right about that one.
speaker="norman_e_waldrop_jr" startTime="452.365" stopTime="473.532">
    Mr. Norman E. Waldrop, Jr. 
    Well, two things, Justice Breyer. 
    First, the very last sentence we made on page 25, where we state that the United States Supreme Court clearly held that if a State wishes to bind an absent plaintiff, and our term, absent plaintiff, we believe in Shutts means residents and nonresidents.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="473.532" stopTime="474.732">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    But it certainly didn't in Shutts.
speaker="norman_e_waldrop_jr" startTime="474.732" stopTime="491.004">
    Mr. Norman E. Waldrop, Jr. 
    Well, Mr. Chief Justice, we believe that Shutts v. Phillips Petroleum does, in fact, say that absent plaintiff in fact refers to residents and nonresidents.
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="491.004" stopTime="513.520">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    But it doesn't say that in the brief, and moreover, the clause you didn't quote says it's our view that it has to provide minimal procedural due process protection. 
    It requires absent class members be given the right to opt out, which is the point that you're making in this section of the brief, so where in the brief do you make the claim which you're now making that resident class members have to be given the right to opt out?
speaker="norman_e_waldrop_jr" startTime="513.520" stopTime="523.967">
    Mr. Norman E. Waldrop, Jr. 
    Well, our view is that on page 23, when we said in our head note about minimum due process, we were referring across the board. 
    We--
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="523.967" stopTime="526.208">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    Is there a word in the brief anywhere that says it's across the board?
speaker="norman_e_waldrop_jr" startTime="526.208" stopTime="549.973">
    Mr. Norman E. Waldrop, Jr. 
    --Well, only the head note, Justice Breyer, on page 23. 
    We have... of course, in our petitioners we have residents and nonresidents in our group. 
    We believe that Shutts v. Phillips Petroleum in fact states that it applies to residents and nonresidents.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="549.973" stopTime="588.027">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Well, let's just suppose that we don't agree with you that it dealt with non-State residents and furthermore that we conclude that the question you want this Court to address on the Due Process Clause and an opt-out requirement for residents of the State was not cleanly presented by you below, and that the Alabama supreme court did not address it. 
    Now, let's say we get that far in our analysis. 
    Is that failure jurisdictional or is it simply a prudential concern we might have?
speaker="norman_e_waldrop_jr" startTime="588.027" stopTime="675.486">
    Mr. Norman E. Waldrop, Jr. 
    Well, we, of course, believe it would be a prudential concern, because we believe that the Alabama supreme court did not want to look at Shutts v. Phillips Petroleum because in our situation we had objectors who were nonresidents. 
    If you look at Shutts, and if you... the most narrow reading in Shutts would have declared at the very least there would have been opt-out rights granted to nonresidents. 
    For example, if I could refer you to the joint appendix in volume 1, on page 238 and 239 you would see, for example, at the trial court level there were notice of opt-outs filed, for example, at the... in the Barbour County Circuit Court and citing Phillips Petroleum v. Shutts. 
    There were also pleadings filed, for example on behalf of Mississippi residents saying that the fraud had occurred in Mississippi, and they were... and the policies were delivered in Mississippi. 
    So we believe that the reason that the Alabama supreme court did not, in fact, want to look at Shutts even in the most narrow sense is because opt-out rights would have surely had to be granted in that type of situation.

    Mr. Norman E. Waldrop, Jr. 
    Well, we have... the objectors, the petitioners are 543 people, and we have 30 petitioners who are nonresidents.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="690.977" stopTime="692.840">

speaker="norman_e_waldrop_jr" startTime="692.840" stopTime="750.177">
    Mr. Norman E. Waldrop, Jr. 
    That's correct, and... well, as far as being nonresidents, that particular number was not available to us, although we know that these policies were sold in seven or eight States, so we know that the number has to be in the ten of thousands of nonresidents, because when the class was certified in Barbour County it was... it covered all the States, and the problem was, that was one of the problems in the Barbour County Circuit Court. 
    There was no discovery that was ever conducted in any of the other States. 
    Now, in regard to the type of money damages that the absent plaintiffs have, in addition to the fraudulently inflated premiums there were money damage claims in this case for the denial of certain medical benefits, for chemotherapy, radiation, and drugs outside the hospital. 
    There were money damage claims for mental anguish, and there were money damage claims for punitive damages.

    Mr. Norman E. Waldrop, Jr. 
    There were 32 cases outside the class when the class was certified on March 10, 1993. 
    To my knowledge, all of those cases that had been filed sought money damages.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="818.217" stopTime="821.587">

    How about the two that were... there were two brought by class counsel.
speaker="norman_e_waldrop_jr" startTime="821.587" stopTime="873.283">
    Mr. Norman E. Waldrop, Jr. 
    Class counsel filed on behalf of five individual clients, and in each one of those there was a claim for money damages. 
    What we believe is... in regard to Shutts, where Shutts says that... and when it establishes that an absent plaintiff who has a claim for money damages is entitled to the due process right of opt out, what we believe is this. 
    In trying to determine when there is a claim for predominantly money damages, we believe that the test should be three things. 
    First is, we believe that the Court should look at the cause of action that is constitutionally protected. 
    In this case, it's a fraud cause of action. 
    What is the traditional remedy for a fraud cause of action? 
    The Alabama--

    But how... I think that's up to what the individual wants. 
    One individual might say, I've been defrauded by this insurance company. 
    I want nothing more to do with this insurance company. 
    I want money in my pocket and I'll find another insurer. 
    Another plaintiff might say, well, I'd like to have my insurance contract reformed so it will get rid of the form... fraud, and so the claim for fraud, it can be regarded as neuter in that respect. 
    One individual might say, I've got a good common law claim for money for fraud, and another one could say, I like this contract, some things about it, so I just want it to be reformed to get rid of the fraud. 
    So how can you say that just the fraud inevitably is money? 
    It could be whatever the individual wants, right?

    --Well, no in this sense, that the remedy... the Alabama courts have held in regard to fraud in regard to an insurance policy, they have held numerous times that you can affirm the contract and sue for money damages, or rescind the contract and sue for money damages. 
    That is what has been traditionally held is the remedy. 
    The second thing we think that the Court should look at is, what is the absent plaintiff being asked to give up?

    It's referring to... there seem to be two claims you're making. 
    One is, Alabama court, if you characterize this as anything other than a money claim you're going to run afoul of the United States Constitution in respect to absent plaintiffs. 
    Cite, Shutts. 
    I read that as what you were talking about on pages 23 and 24. 
    Then I found another claim on 21 On 21 you say, look, given these absent plaintiffs out there who have a claim under Shutts for due process, don't, please, characterize this as if it were nonmoney. 
    Now, maybe that's the same argument, or maybe it's two, but I don't see anything at all, not a word, that seeks to generalize the Shutts claim to the problem of the resident non... plaintiff, which is a totally different problem, or quite a different problem. 
    Now, what is your response to that? 
    I'm not... I'm... you'd say maybe I'm wrong, or you'd say it doesn't matter. 
    It has to be one of those two.
speaker="norman_e_waldrop_jr" startTime="1396.234" stopTime="1427.095">
    Mr. Norman E. Waldrop, Jr. 
    --Well, Justice Breyer, all I can say is that we felt like, starting on page 21, that we had raised it, and we felt like we had made that argument, particularly by our head note. 
    It is absolutely true that we argued the right to trial by jury to the Alabama supreme court very strongly, because that is something that they look at. 
    We felt that the Alabama supreme court would be much more interested in that issue, but we did, in fact, raise the no-opt-out, and we felt that we had raised that issue. 
    We--
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="1427.095" stopTime="1480.553">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    May I ask you one question on the merits, which I... which I... how we get to this. 
    It just... is this your view... I'm trying to understand how this works, but suppose that we have a defendant who is being asked by different groups of plaintiffs to do inconsistent things, the classic case where you don't get an opt-out, and each of those plaintiffs adds a clause to his complaint saying, in addition I'd like punitive damages. 
    What's supposed to happen then? 
    In your view, is the addition of the words punitive damages... if you go to each of the plaintiffs, by the way, and say is it important to you, they say, sure is. 
    It might be a lot of money. 
    So is the simple addition of the word, punitive damages to a class action that plainly is not an opt-out class suddenly converted, making it an opt-out class, or making it a no-opt-out class?
speaker="norman_e_waldrop_jr" startTime="1480.553" stopTime="1522.462">
    Mr. Norman E. Waldrop, Jr. 
    --Well, yes, and for this reason in Alabama it would be an unliquidated claim, and it would... that would be the case everywhere, but secondly in Alabama if the settlement fund in the class was sufficient to punish the defendant, then opting out would serve you no good under Green Oil v. Hornsby, because if you opted out, if there was already a sufficient fund, the Green Oil curtain would come down in Alabama. 
    So we believe that under Alabama law that punitive damages in a class action, you should have the opt-out right. 
    I mean, I'm aware from other jurisdictions--
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="1522.462" stopTime="1543.094">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Well, isn't it true that it doesn't have to be all one thing or another? 
    You want to have a class for punitive damages, but then you're... doesn't Alabama, in addition to having part of the award go to the State, have some sense that you don't punish the same defendant 5,000 times? 
    Is there none of that in Alabama case law?
speaker="norman_e_waldrop_jr" startTime="1543.094" stopTime="1598.110">
    Mr. Norman E. Waldrop, Jr. 
    --There is in Green Oil, v. Hornsby. 
    One of the things that you look at is successive punitive damage awards. 
    In this particular case, for example, in the settlement 99.9 percent of the absent plaintiffs don't share in the funds for punitive damages. 
    The respondents make the argument about punitive damages, but in this case 99 percent of them are not going to share at all in anything to do with punitive damages. 
    They traded their punitive damages claims for nothing. 
    So in this case opting out in regard to punitive damages would clearly be the thing to do, because they were traded for nothing, and so that is the reason in this particular case that, as we say, they all had money damages, compensatory, they had money damages, punitive damages. 
    If I might reserve the remaining time.

    I thought it was decided in 1836 in Justice Story's opinion in Crowell v. Randell. 
    More recent opinions have said that it's unsettled, it may be prudential, and the Court's been careful not to decide that question, usually saying the prudential reasons are sufficient for us not to find a waiver, and we think that's the case here as well. 
    The most obvious one is the federalism concerns. 
    If this Court were to address the Federal due process issue without the Alabama supreme court having been afforded an opportunity to do so, it will be reversing a State judgment when, for example, the Alabama supreme court may have adopted a different construction of the rule that might have avoided the Federal issue, or it may have... or at least it should be given the opportunity to address it in the first instance.

    There are a lot of issues in which there's disagreement about the record, a lot of things we don't know about with respect to some of these particular issues because it wasn't raised below.

    Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr. 
    I think it's based primarily on... well, a number of things. 
    First of all, Crowell v. Randell and then the recodification of that statute after that opinion is on the books, a federalism concern that this Court should not... that the authority that this Court has to review a State court judgment rests on the assumption that it contains within it a decision on an issue of Federal law that may be erroneous. 
    Now, if it does not because the highest court in the State has not been afforded the opportunity to address that question, then that authority is not present.

    We sometimes grant, vacate, and remand in light of new congressional statutes, in light of the decisions of this Court. 
    I'm not sure, if we say that this is jurisdictional, that that wouldn't confine our authority in those cases, if we say it's jurisdictional if the State hasn't even raised it because there's good reason for it not to have done so.

    Well, the State courts, of course, can always address the question in another case, the next case that comes along. 
    I don't think this is quite... I think there's more flexibility in the Federal system. 
    The Alabama supreme court is not an inferior court with respect to this Court, so that you could say, take a look at this a little more closely or something, as you may with respect to one of the Federal circuit courts.

    We have no power to vacate the judgment of the State--

    Correct.
speaker="john_g_roberts_jr" startTime="2166.725" stopTime="2224.443">
    Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr. 
    My point is simply that one, we think it's jurisdictional for the... at least for the reasons given by Justice Story, and if not, the prudential reasons cut strongly against deciding a Federal Constitution, particularly concerning the validity of State court rules, when the State supreme court has not had an opportunity to address that question. 
    Turning to the merits, petitioners' property interest, their choses in action, typically may be resolved in an individual lawsuit brought at a time and place of the plaintiff's own choosing, but nothing in the Federal Constitution prevents a State for good and sufficient reasons from providing that in certain circumstances they must be resolved in a different manner through another remedial mechanism. 
    And when the State does that, the question is whether the procedural protections provided in that different mechanism comport with due process, not whether the petitioners, the prospective plaintiffs, have some overriding right to avoid the chosen procedure and opt for an individual lawsuit instead.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="2224.443" stopTime="2281.122">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Mr. Roberts, if that's what Alabama had done... and it sounds to me like things States do all the time. 
    They take away tort remedies and give you Workers Compensation instead. 
    But that's not what Alabama did. 
    Alabama said, Edith McAllister, you get a thousand dollars in your pocket and a million in compensatory, and there are 30 other suits like that. 
    Indeed, this class counsel brought two such suits. 
    So that seems to me very odd that Alabama should say, we need to have everybody treated alike in this pot, but not those 30 suits, including two that class counsel filed for straight money. 
    That's what mixes me up about this. 
    How can Alabama say it must be a unitary thing, and yet the Alabama supreme court very shortly before it decided this case affirmed that award?
speaker="john_g_roberts_jr" startTime="2281.122" stopTime="2291.101">
    Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr. 
    The procedure, the mandatory class action, depends upon a representative plaintiff coming in and invoking it. 
    In Mrs. McAllister's case, that was prior to the institution of this class action.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="2291.101" stopTime="2303.579">

    Well, at least the two that were begun the day before this complaint was filed, shouldn't they have... shouldn't Alabama have said, okay, now we have... we have a representative action going.

speaker="john_g_roberts_jr" startTime="2303.579" stopTime="2310.134">
    Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr. 
    Well, that's in fact what happened with those suits. 
    They were dismissed so that the plaintiffs in those suits became members of the class.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="2310.134" stopTime="2312.826">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg

    Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr. 
    There... none going forward now. 
    There was one, the Peel suit, where the plaintiff refused to have the suit dismissed and the counsel disassociated himself from carrying that forward. 
    The class action mechanism, once it's invoked it doesn't go back and say, now, last year one of these claims was raised, and start at the beginning, but it says from now on we're going to resolve... the claims that have not already started, haven't already left the gate, we're going to resolve them in one proceeding.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="2338.696" stopTime="2356.628">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Now, I can understand saying that, but it does seem to me that class counsel would be taking inconsistent positions if at the same time that he's putting people, even people who don't want to be in this pot, there and saying, but I have my private clients and I'm taking care of them.
speaker="john_g_roberts_jr" startTime="2356.628" stopTime="2429.121">
    Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr. 
    The concern in each of those cases was that... the particular members in the two suits that you're referring to were former officers of Liberty National. 
    There was a concern that they may not fit the definition of the class, and the individual suits were filed. 
    When it became clear that they would be covered by the class as certified, the cases were dismissed and they recovered as members of the class and no more. 
    Now, once Alabama says that from now on, prior cases... the issue hadn't come up, but now it's come up we're going to resolve your claims in the procedural device of a mandatory class action, the question is are the procedural protections in that mandatory class action sufficient to satisfy due process, not whether there's an overriding right to file an individual lawsuit, and here there plainly were in two complementary and overlapping respects. 
    Individual class members received written notice and an opportunity to be heard before their choses in action were resolved. 
    That was individual written notice. 
    The opportunity to be heard was in court before a judge, with counsel, including the right to examine witnesses, present expert witnesses, and other evidence. 
    It was a right that the petitioners fully availed themselves of in this case. 
    They had their own day in court. 
    It was January 20, 21, and 24, 1994.

    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Mr. Roberts, I don't think anybody is questioning that there was notice and there was an opportunity to come in, but what does seem strange is a person who says, I've got this insurance policy that I acquired because the company was fraudulent. 
    I don't want to have anything to do with that company. 
    I want to take my money and buy another policy. 
    And then in this class suit this person is being told, you're going to get a better policy from the same company and you must stay with them. 
    There's something unseemly about that, isn't there?
speaker="john_g_roberts_jr" startTime="2468.454" stopTime="2484.806">
    Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr. 
    Well, I can certainly understand that reaction, but the question is not whether any individual class member had that reaction, but what was appropriate relief for the class as a whole. 
    The district court, the trial court found that the policy that was given in the settlement was not available anywhere else in the market.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="2484.806" stopTime="2497.515">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    So we have a new rule now of Federal... well, this is State procedure... the greatest good for the greatest number, and the fact that some people who would have had perfectly good individual money claims, that's too bad.
speaker="john_g_roberts_jr" startTime="2497.515" stopTime="2523.702">
    Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr. 
    No. 
    To deal with the last part of your question first, they did not have perfectly good money claims. 
    The trial court found that these claims for higher premiums were largely speculative because the policies that they received by and large with rare exceptions provided more total benefits. 
    They looked at the McAllister case. 
    The evidence developed in this case demonstrated that for the vast majority of insureds the new policies were better.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="2523.702" stopTime="2533.499">

    I'm not talking about your case. 
    I'm talking about, just look at what Edith McAllister won, a thousand dollars compensatory, a million punitive. 
    That was based on the litigated determination of fraud. 
    Now, couldn't person number 2 say, I like that. 
    In fact, I don't even need the punitives.

    Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr. 
    No. 
    The evidence of record on which Mrs. McAllister relied involved specific interactions with the agent, and the evidentiary record that came in a later case was the broader question of the policy program that the agents were operating under, and it was a different evidentiary record. 
    It demonstrated... the trial court was aware of the McAllister verdict. 
    It... and the supreme court of Alabama was aware of its affirmance in McAllister when it decided this case, and the evidence demonstrated that in the vast majority of cases the higher premiums were justified because there were more benefits.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="2641.090" stopTime="2651.418">

    No, and they never would.

    Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr. 
    --The question, when you're trying to decide whether the relief under the class that the class is given is equitable and monetary is, what is the appropriate relief for the class as a whole? 
    The reason these people took out cancer insurance policies was not to get a thousand dollars, it was to get coverage, and the way you get coverage is to reform the policies to give them what they say they should have, the benefits under the old policy, and to compensate further, give them also the new benefits under the new policies. 
    They got, as it was said, the best of both worlds, something they couldn't get anywhere else. 
    That's the most appropriate relief, because the complaint is, you took away our coverage. 
    The answer is, give it back. 
    Not, here's a thousand dollars. 
    That doesn't give them the coverage they wanted. 
    That's why I think it was appropriate--

    So it is the idea of the greatest good for the greatest number. 
    Now, I understand when there's a finite sum and that's all that there is, and you have to find some way of equitably distributing it. 
    I also understand when somebody has to conduct themselves in a certain way, and it's got to be one way and it can't be two ways.

    Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr. 
    --If... that is their claim, and it has no basis. 
    Claims for money damages are frequently resolved in some fashion other than an individual lawsuit. 
    Your Honor mentioned Worker's Compensation, a good example. 
    Bankruptcy. 
    You may have a chose in action against someone. 
    If they declare bankruptcy you don't get an individual lawsuit, and what Alabama has done here, along with 39 other States and the Federal system, is say one situation in which your chose in action, normally resolvable in an individual lawsuit, may be resolved in some other manner is when the prerequisites for a mandatory class--
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="2924.037" stopTime="2966.914">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    That may be different in Alabama, because this is all rules, and the Worker's Compensation and the other things we've been talking about, bankruptcy, these are highly statutory. 
    Alabama does copy to considerable extent Federal Rule 23, and one thing we know about the Federal rules is that the Federal courts are not authorized to write statutes. 
    They can write rules of procedure. 
    So when I brought up the Worker's Compensation model I had that in mind, that that's a substantive legislative judgment, and I think there would be a serious question if you would interpret a Federal rule to take away from somebody a good damage action.
speaker="john_g_roberts_jr" startTime="2966.914" stopTime="2982.074">
    Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr. 
    --The issue is whether the procedure that they've been provided under these rules comports with due process. 
    There's no overriding right to assert under the Federal Constitution that your chose in action must be resolved in State court.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="2982.074" stopTime="3004.930">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Would your answer be different if we were talking just about the Rules Enabling Act? 
    Let's just switch for a moment, because Alabama does seem to think it's instructive, to the Federal rule, and the Federal rule says that... the Rules Enabling Act says that such rules, rules of procedure, shall not abridge and... or modify any substantive right.
speaker="john_g_roberts_jr" startTime="3004.930" stopTime="3013.517">
    Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr. 
    I don't think this is abridging or modifying a substantive right. 
    It's setting forth another procedural mechanism to resolve the chose in action.

    What if the State of Alabama had simply removed... had eliminated the action for fraud against insurance companies?

    Well, it would really convert this into something other than a procedural due process case.
speaker="john_g_roberts_jr" startTime="3037.875" stopTime="3047.398">
    Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr. 
    --Yes, and the point I want to emphasize is that here, as far as procedural due process goes they had notice and opportunity to be heard, and the complementary protections of the class action rules.

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    And you would say, Mr. Roberts, that the State could abolish that cause of action for fraud not only by legislation but by judicial decision if it chooses to operate that way, and that that wouldn't violate due process.

    --Yes. 
    The only point was that Alabama, since it seems to try to follow Federal Rule 23, might be influenced by how the Federal development went. 
    There would be a problem.

    Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr. 
    --I think your question highlights again a reason that... a prudential reason the Court shouldn't reach out and decide the issue, because we don't know how they would have addressed it in this instance because it wasn't presented to them. 
    There were two different regimes at issue here. 
    Petitioner's view, even though its choses in action were shared by 400,000 other people, that each one has a right to an individual lawsuit even though the courts found it would lead to a race of the courthouse, windfalls for a few, and nothing for the vast majority, or the rule that Alabama has adopted, which is when the two requisites for mandatory treatment are met we're going to bring everybody together, we're going to resolve all the claims in this one instance, and give the people who... the class members individual notice and opportunity to object, and only have this issue come up after we've determined that they're adequately represented in a class action. 
    I think it's the former system that is subject to a serious due process challenge, not the latter one that Alabama adopted and that the Alabama supreme court affirmed in this case. 
    Thank you.

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Thank you, Mr. Roberts. 
    Mr. Waldrop, you have 2 minutes remaining.
speaker="norman_e_waldrop_jr" startTime="3148.329" stopTime="3277.533">
    Mr. Norman E. Waldrop, Jr. 
    Well, we believe that a cause of action, a fraud cause of action, this Court had already said in Mullane v. Central Hanover Bank back in 1950 that a cause of action is a constitutionally protected right. 
    In... so in this case, once... and under Alabama law once you have... a cause of action for fraud is vested, it cannot be taken away. 
    Secondly, this settlement perpetuated the fraud, because the various class members had to continue to pay premiums if they were to get any benefit out of the settlement at all. 
    Lastly, in regard to Shutts, we believe that if Shutts in fact was only a territorial jurisdictional case, which we believe that it was not, we believe that fundamentally it should apply across the board for two reasons. 
    One, there's no fundamental difference between a nonresident and a resident. 
    If you're going to put them together for money damages on the front end for certification... that is, they have the same unity, cohesiveness, typicality, and commonality on the front end... then on the back end you can't make a difference as to whether they should have a right to opt out or not, because that would be arbitrary if you're going to put them together on the front end in regard to money damages. 
    Secondly, in regard to Rule (c)(2) of the Federal rules as well as the Alabama rules, in regard to (b)(3) actions, which are normal money damages, it is a mandatory notice that the... that you have notice and opportunity to be heard and the right to opt out. 
    The advisory comments to the Federal rule says that that has constitutional underpinnings. 
    In its cites... Mullane, and it cites Hansberry v. Lee. 
    In fact, this Court in 1974, in the Eisen case, cited those advisory comments with approval, so we think that if Shutts was only a territorial jurisdictional case, which we don't believe that it was, because when the court in footnote number 3 in Shutts said that we're going to limit our holding--
