    We'll hear argument now in Number 95-1184, Dan Glickman, Secretary of Agriculture v. Wileman Brothers and Elliott, Inc.-- 
    Mr. Jenkins.
speaker="alan_jenkins" startTime="10.228" stopTime="58.211">
    Mr. Alan Jenkins 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    In this case, respondents' challenge on First Amendment grounds, payments toward advertising designed to promote the products that they offer for sale, whether they're measured under the integrated bar and union line of cases that we believe is appropriate, or under the Central Hudson test for restrictions on commercial speech, the generic advertising programs pass constitutional muster. 
    In our view, the regulatory framework at issue here is most analogous to the integrated bar and union context. 
    This Court has applied the Central Hudson test where Government has restricted or prohibited the dissemination of truthful commercial information, but the marketing order provisions at issue here do not ban, suppress, or restrict respondents' speech in any way.

    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    May I ask a question at an early stage, Mr. Jenkins? 
    I think you take the position here that you didn't... that the Government didn't argue that the Abood line or the union line cases wasn't argued in the Ninth Circuit because of the Cal-Almond decision in that court, but the administrative law judge suggests that the Government at least in that forum said that the Abood line didn't apply, and I'm just wondering if the Government has waived that, if we can't just assume that the Central Hudson test applies--
speaker="alan_jenkins" startTime="104.011" stopTime="105.071">
    Mr. Alan Jenkins 
    Well, I don't--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="105.071" stopTime="107.572">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    --in light of the posture taken below.
speaker="alan_jenkins" startTime="107.572" stopTime="116.717">
    Mr. Alan Jenkins 
    --I don't think so, Justice O'Connor. 
    In fact, the Government has argued throughout this litigation that these programs satisfy both Central Hudson and the Abood line of cases. 
    We... pardon me.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="116.717" stopTime="125.043">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    But it does appear that the Government below chose not to urge the Abood line, took that tactic, and I don't know why we should address that here.
speaker="alan_jenkins" startTime="125.043" stopTime="158.965">
    Mr. Alan Jenkins 
    Well, Your Honor, I disagree with that characterization of our position below. 
    I believe that in our briefs in the district court in particular we argued expressly that the Abood standard was satisfied and that the Central Hudson test was satisfied. 
    It is true that we did not argue in the district court or in the court of appeals that that was the only appropriate test, but I do think that we've argued consistently that both tests are satisfied. 
    In the court of appeals, as you've said, it's true that we were laboring under the adverse precedent in Cal-Almond, where the Central Hudson test was applied, but we did refer to the Frame case from the Third Circuit, which did rely in part on Abood, so I think that argument is preserved.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="158.965" stopTime="162.539">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    And both of those lines of cases, of course, deal with the First Amendment, don't they?
speaker="alan_jenkins" startTime="162.539" stopTime="165.701">
    Mr. Alan Jenkins 
    Quite so, Mr. Chief Justice. 
    That's certainly the case.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="165.701" stopTime="210.100">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    Mr. Jenkins, assuming that we apply one or the other test in a way that requires us to determine the value of the Government's interest, do you claim that the value of the Government's interest depends on a Government concern over and above that of the growers whose products they are advertising, or, on the other hand, do you claim that the Government's interest is essentially derivative, that it's important simply because the growers themselves want to do this, and that desire, that vote in fact on their part establishes its importance? 
    Which is it?
speaker="alan_jenkins" startTime="210.100" stopTime="243.430">
    Mr. Alan Jenkins 
    Well, I think it's the latter, Justice Souter, but I think it's even broader than that. 
    The Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act expressly sets out the goals of that statute and of the marketing orders, which include establishing orderly market conditions for the covered commodities. 
    Congress, as in the integrated bar context and as in the union context, has chose to leave in the first instance to the regulated industry the determination whether, in a particular region, as for a particular commodity, that interest is threatened, but we think that both the overwhelming support by the industry and the record in this case indicate that that interest was certainly implicated here.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="243.430" stopTime="255.829">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    But the growers, as I understand it, do not vote in any narrow or specific sense as to whether the interest is threatened. 
    They simply vote as to whether they want the advertising program or not, isn't that it?
speaker="alan_jenkins" startTime="255.829" stopTime="274.633">
    Mr. Alan Jenkins 
    Well, I think that's correct, Justice Souter, but that just is at the core of the Government's interest. 
    Where private industry and, I would add, the Secretary has to make a determination that private... that generic advertising would further... tend to further the interest of the act, that is because in a particular region, under a particular marketing order, the need exists.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="274.633" stopTime="305.010">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    Is that how you would explain the... what struck me, at least, as the peculiarity in this case that apparently there are, I guess, peach-growers, for example, in some 30 States, but the only ones who seem to have expressed a need for this advertising scheme are California peach-growers. 
    Is the explanation for that that there simply has not been a demonstrated instability in markets elsewhere?
speaker="alan_jenkins" startTime="305.010" stopTime="307.892">
    Mr. Alan Jenkins 
    I think that's true, Justice Souter, but I'd also like--
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="307.892" stopTime="309.284">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    Does the record support that?
speaker="alan_jenkins" startTime="309.284" stopTime="314.025">
    Mr. Alan Jenkins 
    --It does not, and let me make clear the way in which this act operates.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="314.025" stopTime="357.506">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Mr. Jenkins, before you do that may I ask you, I think a question that is of a similar basic kind? 
    You latch onto the Abood and Keller cases. 
    What is the Government interest here that compares to the labor peace or the regulation of the bar? 
    That's what I don't understand. 
    Why is it so important that we have these orders? 
    What purpose that compares with collective bargaining underlies all of this?
speaker="alan_jenkins" startTime="357.506" stopTime="387.487">
    Mr. Alan Jenkins 
    Justice Ginsburg, as I've said, first the broader interest is in orderly market conditions. 
    I think the legislative history of the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act, the 1954 legislative history of the adoption of promotional programs, and the record of the formal rulemaking that gave birth to the advertising provisions of the marketing orders indicate the economic hardship that results and the economic instability in the Nation as a whole that results when there's wide fluctuation of market prices, when particularly farmers but other elements of the industry--
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="387.487" stopTime="399.161">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Well, I could understand that if this was across the board, if you said there this compelling need, and so we do it for all agricultural commodities, but it seems to be rather haphazard.
speaker="alan_jenkins" startTime="399.161" stopTime="451.928">
    Mr. Alan Jenkins 
    --Well, I think that relates to my answer to Justice Souter's previous question, which is that taking, for example, that one of the proposed disparities is between California-grown peaches and Georgia-grown peaches... and I think it's important to look at the regulatory framework here, which is commodity-specific, and region-specific. 
    Taking peaches as an example, first, California is responsible for the majority of peaches that wind up on people's shelves, but more importantly, between two different regions there are vast disparities in labor costs, in quality. 
    The length of the season in California is much longer. 
    California-grown peaches have a Nationwide market, whereas Georgia-grown peaches are basically locally grown and consumed along the Eastern seaboard. 
    There are transportation costs that are different. 
    There are investment costs that are different. 
    But I think the particularized nature, commodity-specific nature and region-specific nature of these marketing orders reflects narrow tailoring rather than arbitrariness, but Justice--
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="451.928" stopTime="466.728">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    How can it be narrow tailoring when the... when in effect the tailoring is done by a nongovernmental entity? 
    I mean, the tailoring to which you are referring, market-specific, region-specific, is simply done by a vote of the people who are growing the peaches.
speaker="alan_jenkins" startTime="466.728" stopTime="491.743">
    Mr. Alan Jenkins 
    --Well, that's not entirely true, Justice Souter, insofar as the marketing... the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act treats different commodities in different regions differently, but you're certainly correct that it's the industry in the first instance, a supermajority, two-thirds majority producers, that caused the marketing order to come into being. 
    That's because Congress I think reasonably has determined that people in the industry, operating day-to-day, are the best measure of need.

    The thirties. 
    Or the thirties. 
    [Laughter] 
    And this is a remnant of the National Industrial Recovery Act when this kind of an argument was made for every industry in the country, and indeed, they tried to have marketing, the equivalent of marketing orders for every industry in the country. 
    It was found not to be true and not to be effective. 
    Now, do we have to believe it, that somehow it is effective for agricultural marketing orders, but having the Government in cooperation with the industry, the corporate State, it is called, in Italy, as an efficient mechanism for producing economic prosperity?
speaker="alan_jenkins" startTime="534.341" stopTime="549.870">
    Mr. Alan Jenkins 
    I think so, Justice Scalia, for two reasons. 
    First, as we've indicated in our brief at footnote 3, Congress since the court of appeals decision in this case has reaffirmed the importance of these programs and, in fact, expanded them and made significant factual findings regarding their importance, but... pardon me.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="549.870" stopTime="552.454">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Just for agriculture. 
    I mean, Congress hasn't done it for everything else.
speaker="alan_jenkins" startTime="552.454" stopTime="554.966">
    Mr. Alan Jenkins 
    Has not done it for every commodity, that's true.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="554.966" stopTime="556.806">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    I mean, it seems to express the belief that elsewhere that isn't true.

    Again, if I can--

    That market disorder is okay. 
    Indeed, it's what drives the market.
speaker="alan_jenkins" startTime="562.288" stopTime="574.897">
    Mr. Alan Jenkins 
    --Well, no, Justice Scalia. 
    I think the determination first is that there may not be significant market disorder and fluctuation in those industries where... private industry where producers have not felt a need to invoke the Government's aid, but if I can analogize--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="574.897" stopTime="579.780">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    They will invoke the Government's aid anywhere. 
    Where have they not felt the need to invoke the Government's aid?

    Mr. Alan Jenkins 
    --Well--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="580.301" stopTime="582.154">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    They'll take the Government's aid wherever they can get it.
speaker="alan_jenkins" startTime="582.154" stopTime="610.991">
    Mr. Alan Jenkins 
    --Well, I don't think so. 
    For example, there are a number of commodities for which marketing orders are authorized, but where the industry has not chosen to use them, to ask for them. 
    In plums, for example, in 1991 the California... the aspects of the marketing order that relate to plums were terminated because there was an industry-wide referendum and plum producers found that it was no longer important. 
    But if I could again analogize to the union context, not every workplace is unionized. 
    It's only where a majority of workers feel that a union will effectuate their interest and therefore Congress' interest in labor peace.

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well, isn't it at least, or couldn't Congress find as a fact that in agriculture, at least since after the First World War, there's always been a problem. 
    If there's a good crop the prices are low, and if the prices are good, there's virtually no crop. 
    It's a totally different situation from most other kinds of marketed goods.
speaker="alan_jenkins" startTime="632.604" stopTime="637.359">

    That's certainly true as a technical matter, Your Honor, but it's also true that in adopting both... in adopting promotional programs Congress found, and in adopting these particular marketing order provisions the Secretary found that these... the ability to invoke generic advertising activities has a beneficial effect, and in fact directly advances--

    And ties it in to the Government's assertion that Abood governs here. 
    Let me read you what I wrote in an opinion joined by Justices O'Connor, Souter, and Kennedy in a case called Lehnert v. Ferris Faculty Association: 
    What is distinctive, the opinion said, about the free riders who are nonunion members of the union's own bargaining unit, is that in some respects they are free riders whom the law requires the union to go out of its way to benefit even at the expense of its other interests. 
    In the labor union context, the union has a fiduciary obligation to every one of the employees, whether they're union members or not, and sometimes has to sacrifice its own interest to those obligations. 
    That is not the case as I understand this program. 
    It can be the case that advertising will benefit a mere majority of the handlers and severely impair the interests of a minority of members. 
    You don't assert that there is a fiduciary obligation here on the part of the organization, as there is with unions, do you?
speaker="alan_jenkins" startTime="1035.590" stopTime="1047.990">
    Mr. Alan Jenkins 
    We don't, Justice Scalia, assert that there's something comparable to the duty of fair representation in this context, although that is similarly true in the integrated bar context, that there is no concomitant duty of fair representation.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="1047.990" stopTime="1065.091">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Well, I think the bar is a special situation, and have always felt that, but as far as unions go, you have the distinctive fiduciary obligation. 
    I just don't see how you can take Abood and apply it to this situation, where a majority can harm a minority's interests.
speaker="alan_jenkins" startTime="1065.091" stopTime="1085.553">
    Mr. Alan Jenkins 
    Well, Justice Scalia, I also think that the majority cannot, as an overwhelming, either as a goal or as the effect harm the minority's interest. 
    There are significant safeguards in place, both regulatory and statutory, to ensure that there is not overwhelming harm or even significant harm to handlers as individuals. 
    I'd also point out in the integrated--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="1085.553" stopTime="1087.415">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Some of them here say they're being harmed.
speaker="alan_jenkins" startTime="1087.415" stopTime="1088.917">
    Mr. Alan Jenkins 
    --I'm sorry, I didn't hear you.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="1088.917" stopTime="1104.955">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Some of them here say they're being harmed, that the mere advertising of, generically, peaches harms them because they are trying to convince the public that all peaches are not fungible, that some kind of peaches are really good peaches, and their interests are harmed by any generic peach advertising.
speaker="alan_jenkins" startTime="1104.955" stopTime="1133.206">
    Mr. Alan Jenkins 
    But Justice Scalia, I don't see how that removes this from the Abood line of cases. 
    It's similarly true that if I'm an employee and I'm opposed to maternity leave, and the union nonetheless negotiates a maternity leave clause in our contract, I have no First Amendment right to prevent that. 
    Although I feel that I'm being harmed and my, both my First Amendment interests, I feel, and my practical interests are being harmed, there's no violation of the duty of fair representation, nor is there a violation of the First Amendment.

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Mr. Jenkins, supposing there's such a thing as the Beer Institute, which is a private organization devoted to generic advertising for beer, and supposing some of its members feel that some of the micro breweries who aren't members are kind of free-riding on the generic, could the Beer Institute go to Congress and say, look, we want to have a kind of a marketing agreement and some generic advertising. 
    We want to bring these freeloaders on board, so let's assess everybody who produces any beer.

    Mr. Alan Jenkins 
    --No comment on that, but I do think that... of course, it's up to this Court to determine as a matter of law whether the interest that Congress in this case seeks to achieve is an important or a substantial one.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="1189.102" stopTime="1230.208">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Mr. Jenkins, on that point, I understand the portion of these marketing orders that deals with inspection quality controls, and nobody is contesting that everybody can be required to pay for the cost of inspecting and assuring health and safety standards. 
    But the... whatever importance that interest has, does that spill over to, that advertising is an important interest? 
    Aren't these quite discrete, so one could say yes, the Government's got a very important interest to making sure that health requirements are met, but the advertising, the promotional interest doesn't have the same strength, does it?
speaker="alan_jenkins" startTime="1230.208" stopTime="1256.975">
    Mr. Alan Jenkins 
    Well, Justice Ginsburg, I just have a two-part answer to that. 
    First, I think that the other things that these marketing orders allow have to do with increasing consumption. 
    They're not safety and health regulations. 
    Those are regulated through a different set of programs. 
    So the question is, if there's an adequate justification for those aspects, does the availability of generic marketing, generic advertising, also help to achieve that goal? 
    The question... pardon me.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="1256.975" stopTime="1267.613">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    It may also help, but does it have the same importance as maturity standards and the inspection controls?
speaker="alan_jenkins" startTime="1267.613" stopTime="1292.719">
    Mr. Alan Jenkins 
    Well, I think, Justice Ginsburg, under this Court's cases the question has not been, is the means toward the end as important, is one means as important as another, but first is the end important and then, secondly, does the means chosen advance the end, and so I think the record in this case does demonstrate that the end of orderly market conditions and sustained demand for these products is significantly advanced by the means that's chosen, including generic advertising.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="1292.719" stopTime="1373.511">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    But your argument is on that, as I understand it, that we have generally accepted the proposition that advertising induces people to buy what is advertised. 
    I mean, do you... there's kind of an assumption as a matter of law that advertising works to some degree, and I will grant you that, but is that enough in a case like this, because it seems to me, number one, that advertise... the assumption that advertising works doesn't tell us very much about whether the advertising is creating or advancing an orderly market as opposed to a less orderly one, and it doesn't tell us very much about what the difference is between the effect of advertising either on consumption or orderly markets in California and the failure of advertising with respect to markets everywhere else. 
    I guess to put the... my question in a nutshell, are the peach growers in the other, whatever it is, 29 States making less of a profit in a chaotic market as opposed to the California growers who, as a result of this advertising program, are making measurably more money in an orderly market? 
    Do... does the record indicate that?
speaker="alan_jenkins" startTime="1373.511" stopTime="1406.453">
    Mr. Alan Jenkins 
    Justice Souter, let me answer the second part of your question first. 
    You asked earlier about the record. 
    I think it's important to note that here the Government was defending a particular program, and so the record doesn't reflect, for example, why Georgia peaches are not regulated. 
    As I've indicated, there are reasons why different markets are treated differently, but the record doesn't reflect it because in our view our burden is to demonstrate that this program satisfies constitutional requirements, and we think that the evidence amply demonstrates first that advertising, generic advertising programs advance the interest of consumer demand for these products, and in fact--
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="1406.453" stopTime="1408.964">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    It makes consumers buy them, is what you mean.
speaker="alan_jenkins" startTime="1408.964" stopTime="1409.765">
    Mr. Alan Jenkins 
    --That's correct.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="1409.765" stopTime="1410.085">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    Yes.
speaker="alan_jenkins" startTime="1410.085" stopTime="1428.248">
    Mr. Alan Jenkins 
    And both of the courts below found that, and that secondly, viewed in the context of this act, it provides the Secretary and the commodity committees with a tool for influencing consumer preferences, and I think it's the inevitable... the conclusion is inevitable that that aids in regulating market conditions. 
    If the Secretary... insofar as the Secretary--
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="1428.248" stopTime="1464.732">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    Well, I... it regulates only in the sense that it... we will assume that it creates some demand that would not have been there otherwise. 
    But when we're faced with a situation in which there are in fact contrasting markets, and we want to know, even under a comparatively relaxed standard, what the causal connection is between the advertising and orderly markets, it seems to me sensible to look at the markets where the advertising isn't going on to see if they are depressed or disorderly, and I take it we cannot do that in this case, because the record just doesn't tell us anything about it.
speaker="alan_jenkins" startTime="1464.732" stopTime="1467.862">
    Mr. Alan Jenkins 
    --I think that's generally correct, but I would also note--
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="1467.862" stopTime="1471.315">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    Isn't it fair to say... and I'm sorry, I didn't mean to cut you off. 
    Go ahead.
speaker="alan_jenkins" startTime="1471.315" stopTime="1476.350">
    Mr. Alan Jenkins 
    --Well, I was just going to say it's also the case that these markets are very different, so that if there is sufficient demand--
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="1476.350" stopTime="1477.800">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    But how do we know that?
speaker="alan_jenkins" startTime="1477.800" stopTime="1483.844">
    Mr. Alan Jenkins 
    --We don't, Justice Souter, but as I've said, I don't think we need to know that in order to answer the question that's at issue here.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="1483.844" stopTime="1505.549">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Mr. Jenkins-- 
    --So you're saying... I'm sorry. 
    To take a specific case, in this record there's nothing like there was in the case before the Third Circuit, the meat case, where the Court said, well, we can understand... the Government has made a case that this industry is in disastrous shape, but there's nothing of that kind here, that the peach and nectarine industry is about to fall apart, is there?
speaker="alan_jenkins" startTime="1505.549" stopTime="1531.125">
    Mr. Alan Jenkins 
    Well, Justice Ginsburg, I think the record in the Frame case was quite similar, but the program was somewhat different. 
    The beef program focuses almost exclusively on promotional programs and advertising, and so insofar as Congress perceived a problem and the only thing it did about it was to create promotional advertising programs, the Third Circuit concluded correctly, we think, that there was a problem existing that Congress sought to address. 
    Here, Congress has used a larger number of tools, but--
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="1531.125" stopTime="1546.054">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Am I wrong in having the impression that Congress made a determination with respect to the state of the meat market and said we have to respond to that terrible situation, and there were no such findings by the legislature here?
speaker="alan_jenkins" startTime="1546.054" stopTime="1560.193">
    Mr. Alan Jenkins 
    --I think with respect, Justice Ginsburg, that's incorrect. 
    I think the district court in particular made findings as to the type of problem that Congress was trying to get at, and in fact cites the Congressional Record indicating that there were in fact gluts of supply, that there was suppressed demand--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="1560.193" stopTime="1565.047">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    But the question is whether Congress made the findings, not whether the district court did.

    Mr. Alan Jenkins

    Citing the findings, or--

    --That's correct.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="1582.298" stopTime="1584.660">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    But there was no congressional finding?
speaker="alan_jenkins" startTime="1584.660" stopTime="1590.674">
    Mr. Alan Jenkins 
    Well, Your Honor, I think in the act itself there's a congressional finding that programs are necessary, that--
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="1590.674" stopTime="1603.951">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Programs, but is there anything... are you telling me that the record from Congress is comparable, that there was no more that Congress said about the meat industry than it said about the fruit industry?
speaker="alan_jenkins" startTime="1603.951" stopTime="1647.641">
    Mr. Alan Jenkins 
    --I think it is comparable, but I want to be specific, because I don't want to mislead the Court. 
    Congress made findings both in 1937, when it adopted the act, and then in 1954, when it added promotional programs, not advertising specifically. 
    It... Congress subsequently added advertising as among the promotional programs, and we think Congress was not required to make additional findings, as when it had already indicated what it found promotional programs to accomplish. 
    It's also true that in the formal rulemaking by the Secretary the record, when the advertising specifically was adopted, their extensive findings... in fact, even the court of appeals found that there were extensive findings in rejecting respondent's APA challenge, that this type of advertising did effectuate the goals of the act. 
    That's a statutory requirement. 
    If I could, I'd like to reserve the remainder of my time.

    We sue before an ALJ employed by the Secretary of Agriculture. 
    She gave the Government every opportunity possible... as a matter of fact, they stipulated that Exhibit 297, and they made that stipulation at Stipulation Number 57... I'm sorry, 59, that that was the exclusive rulemaking record.

    In other words, what's the First Amendment interest here that isn't shared in thousands of regulatory situations by millions of members of the public whose money the Government often takes to spend, or have other private people spend, on messages that they might not want to pay for?

    Mr. Thomas E. Campagne 
    Your Honor, we would have no objection whatsoever if the Secretary of Agriculture was taking money out of the General Treasury and--

    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    No, no, they didn't... I'm saying the Civil Aeronautics Board, the Interstate Commerce Commission... I mean, I thought the Constitution would permit the public, mistaken or not, to have regulatory systems to regulate every industry, perhaps, if they wanted to, to have a nonfree enterprise system perhaps if they didn't want to. 
    I don't know. 
    I thought those were basically democratic questions. 
    But if we have a system where the industry is regulated, I'm asking what is the First Amendment interest that is different from the same First Amendment interest of every flier, every customer of a trucker, every customer of a utility... I'm just repeating myself, but it seems to me that there are vast numbers of consumers who used to have to spend lots of money they didn't want to spend for messages that regulators would either permit or require.

    Mr. Thomas E. Campagne 
    --The First Amendment issue, Your Honor, is two-pronged. 
    First of all, they're forcing us to associate with our competitors, and it's not like the milk board, where milk is white and wet, and so the milk board doesn't have much opportunity to prefer one product over another. 
    When you buy milk, you don't know if it's a Jersey or a Guernsey milk you're drinking, whereas in our commodity, we have over 100 varieties of plums. 
    My clients happen to grow some green plums. 
    If I tell you today--
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="2105.002" stopTime="2117.459">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    Well then, you would point out, I suppose, that you're not objecting to expenditure of money for advertising or for any other purpose by the Government. 
    The United States doesn't contend in this case that these are Government expenditures, does it?
speaker="thomas_e_campagne" startTime="2117.459" stopTime="2122.043">
    Mr. Thomas E. Campagne

speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="2122.043" stopTime="2140.046">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    So it's not Government speech, which would pose a different issue, so we can get rid of a whole lot of those regulatory programs that Justice Breyer was referring to, and only limit ourselves to those in which a privately run organization spends money that is assessed against competitors. 
    Namely, all of the programs.

    There's over 100 varieties, and if you grow that variety in South Carolina it's going to taste the same as that variety tastes in California. 
    It's a lie.

    Well, of course, you're forced to associate, using your term, by the terms of the marketing order anyway. 
    If there were no promotional advertising you'd be "forced to associate". 
    So what we have here is a program that I think, insofar as its regulatory mechanisms other than promotion, is clearly lawful and valid and constitutional, and it seems to me that you're building on that base. 
    Once you have in place a marketing order, a marketing system, it seems to me logical that that marketing entity engage in generic advertising.

    We give almost a million dollars a year, of which 53 percent is devoted to generic collective advertising, to our competitors who grow fruit we don't grow, primarily, and then when we do have a little bit of money left over and try to advertise our own brands, we have to spend a lot of it trying to change the minds of the consumer--

    Of course, to the extent that the marketing order without the promotional aspects of it helps everybody to market their peaches, I suppose you're helping to market Red Jim through the marketing order.

    Whether you like it or not, big growers may be helping smaller growers to market their products, and maybe that's not cost-effective for you and you'd rather have something else, but you begin with the premise that this is a valid program.

    Mr. Thomas E. Campagne 
    But you're forgetting a very key important point, Your Honor. 
    At least we're playing on a level playing field when the agency says you can't sell a nectarine, whether it's a Red Jim nectarine or a Tom Gran yellow nectarine, if it has a worm in it. 
    We're not going to advertise to people and change our message that we want you to eat worms. 
    But when 50 percent of this advertising dollar goes to spending, as their own testimony indicates, towards varieties that are controlled by 40 to 60 percent of... single varieties controlled by 40 to 60 percent of the handlers that aren't us, we're not playing on a level playing field.

    I agree with you that a peach is not a peach. 
    I really do. 
    [Laughter] 
    I mean, absolutely. 
    I love those juicy peaches which you can hardly ever get. 
    I understand that. 
    But I'm also concerned about turning First Amendment district courts into regulatory agencies, and therefore I'm worried about this problem of the Air... I promise you I disagreed a lot with what the Air Transport Association might have advertised. 
    In the rate base the customer pays, and I pay for it a flyer. 
    That's what I'm worried about. 
    Now, you brought up PG&amp;E as a precedent, but then I look at PG&amp;E and I look at it and think, my goodness, that was a case where there was a more clear First Amendment problem, because it was the company's property. 
    The company had to put the message in the envelope. 
    It was absolutely clear that the company was underwriting this message with which it disagreed, rather than analogize it to like a public forum. 
    So I'd like you to talk a little bit more about that case, because as I looked at that plurality opinion quickly, it seemed to me that yours was a more attenuated interest by a long shot than the interest there, but I raise that so you can discuss it.

    Mr. Thomas E. Campagne

   Rebuttal of Alan Jenkins
speaker="alan_jenkins" startTime="3392.394" stopTime="3470.776">
    Mr. Alan Jenkins 
    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 
    I'd like to begin just very briefly by stating that as to the administration of this program most of the factual findings that respondent's cite come from the ALJ's findings on the APA claim against these programs. 
    Those were overturned by the judicial officer, who found those findings as to bias, as to red is better, and what-have-you, to be clearly erroneous. 
    Both of the courts below affirmed that holding, the APA holding, and so I think those findings are simply out of the case. 
    The Court need not necessarily ignore them completely, but no final adjudication has been made upholding these findings of bias. 
    If I could turn to the question of the Government interest here, I think we have demonstrated that there's a free rider problem that's important and comparable to the union and integrated bar context, that in agriculture, and particularly as to these commodities, there are many small producers who could not engage in the kind of economies of scale that's available under this program. 
    That's not necessarily true in some other industries. 
    The record does speak, for instance, to the California almond industry, and this Court has repeatedly held that where Congress finds a problem and deals with it in a way that is constitutionally justifiable, the fact, at least outside of the strict scrutiny context, that it has not chosen to employ those remedies elsewhere does not render unconstitutional its action where it has done so.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="3470.776" stopTime="3488.909">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Does anything in the law prevent bias? 
    Does anything in the law... let's assume that 51 percent of the California growers grow red peaches, or red nectarines, or whatever color red things we were talking about. 
    Anything in the law would prevent this money from being spent with advertisements showing only the red fruit?
speaker="alan_jenkins" startTime="3488.909" stopTime="3492.122">
    Mr. Alan Jenkins 
    I think so, Justice Scalia, as a practical matter.

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    What provision is that?

    Mr. Alan Jenkins 
    May I complete my answer?
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="3494.162" stopTime="3494.553">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Yes.
speaker="alan_jenkins" startTime="3494.553" stopTime="3515.037">
    Mr. Alan Jenkins 
    The AMAA provides that the Secretary must find that particular activities are... tend to effectuate the goals of the act. 
    The Agricultural Marketing Service has guidelines which, for instance, prevent the criticism of other commodities or products, so I think both as a practical matter and as a legal matter there are checks on misuse of this system. 
    Thank you.
