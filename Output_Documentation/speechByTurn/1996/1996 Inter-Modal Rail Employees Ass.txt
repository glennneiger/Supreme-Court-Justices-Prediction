    Mr. Schwartz, you may proceed whenever you're ready.

    Mr. Richard E. Schwartz 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    The railroad workers who are the petitioner in this case have been denied their day in court by the dismissal of their petition in the district court. 
    This case pleaded... presented today pleaded a unique, egregious conspiracy to deprive a particular group of employees of their welfare plan benefits. 
    They have pleaded specific intent to commit acts prohibited by section 510 of ERISA. 
    They have pleaded and their case involves the use of deceit leading to coercion used to implement this sham transaction. 
    The conduct pleaded fits squarely within the congressional intent in the enactment of section 510. 
    The railroad workers here have pleaded a conspiracy to interfere with the specificity sufficient to comply even with Rule 9 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Mr. Schwartz, is it true that this employer could not use the change route that you say could have been used to accomplish this purpose? 
    That is, these benefits do not vest. 
    Therefore, the plan could be amended to reduce them. 
    The benefits could be terminated.
speaker="richard_e_schwartz" startTime="127.933" stopTime="139.824">
    Mr. Richard E. Schwartz 
    Justice Ginsburg, these benefits were contractually vested as part of a Nation-wide multiemployer bargaining pattern with the Teamsters Union.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="139.824" stopTime="144.359">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    That... so you are... the answer to my question is there was no amendment route here--
speaker="richard_e_schwartz" startTime="144.359" stopTime="144.894">
    Mr. Richard E. Schwartz 
    No.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="144.894" stopTime="156.785">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    --because it was a multiemployer plan. 
    Therefore, suppose an employer wants to accomplish that objective just as a matter of cutting costs. 
    You're saying it's impossible.
speaker="richard_e_schwartz" startTime="156.785" stopTime="169.093">
    Mr. Richard E. Schwartz 
    It would be possible only if they were willing and able to go back and bargain for a change in the contractually agreed benefits and then, pursuant to that, make the necessary--
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="169.093" stopTime="178.699">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    But the same thing that you are calling a conspiracy and... could have been done were this only a single employer plan as distinguished from a multiemployer plan.
speaker="richard_e_schwartz" startTime="178.699" stopTime="187.654">
    Mr. Richard E. Schwartz 
    --I do not believe that's correct, because we're still dealing with the element of the contractual vesting of the benefits, Justice Ginsburg.

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist

    I--

    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Now, if there were no union agreement the law clearly allows the employer to just get rid of these welfare benefits under the plan. 
    Is that true?

speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="210.003" stopTime="222.061">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Right, and the problem here is that there is a union agreement under which the... under the terms of which the employer must provide these benefits. 
    Is that the problem?
speaker="richard_e_schwartz" startTime="222.061" stopTime="231.416">
    Mr. Richard E. Schwartz 
    That's certainly an element in our contention, that they could not legally have gone about doing this had they not resorted to this subterfuge.

    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor

    Justice David H. Souter 
    Well, then you're saying in effect that they could do in a... with a single employer plan, no contrary collective bargaining agreement, they could do in two steps what you're saying they can't do in one step here, because number 1, they could simply eliminate the benefits, and having eliminated the benefits they could then eliminate their division or fire all those employees who had been getting the benefits, and so the different... it seems to me that your argument is a very formalistic argument.
speaker="richard_e_schwartz" startTime="270.041" stopTime="292.491">
    Mr. Richard E. Schwartz 
    Justice Souter, I believe that we need to make a proviso... and I believe that the Government may talk about this. 
    There is some basis, I believe, for the opinion that even plan amendments can't be made without... when they're done for a specific discriminatory purpose. 
    I am not prepared to--
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="292.491" stopTime="315.302">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    Well, but why is it a discriminatory purpose simply to say I am... you know that they can be eliminated, period, can't they? 
    They're costing me too much. 
    There's no collective bargaining agreement that I would violate. 
    There's no multiemployer plan, so I have autonomy here, and I'm simply going to eliminate them. 
    That they can do as a general proposition.
speaker="richard_e_schwartz" startTime="315.302" stopTime="317.271">
    Mr. Richard E. Schwartz 
    --As a general proposition, yes.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="317.271" stopTime="337.684">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    All right. 
    And what, then... if they can do that, why does it then become discriminatory when, having eliminated those benefits they say, I probably would be better off to have an outside company doing this work, so I will eliminate the employees, too. 
    How does that suddenly turn the prior action into a discriminatory one?
speaker="richard_e_schwartz" startTime="337.684" stopTime="354.296">
    Mr. Richard E. Schwartz 
    We're dealing with a situation here, what is generally called a fire and hire situation. 
    They wanted to keep these employees. 
    They're highly trained and productive. 
    But they wanted to keep them without the benefits, and therefore they had to go through this elaborate--
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="354.296" stopTime="359.950">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    Yes, but they... on your theory I guess they didn't. 
    All they had to do was to say there won't be any more benefits.
speaker="richard_e_schwartz" startTime="359.950" stopTime="368.888">
    Mr. Richard E. Schwartz 
    --Well, I think it's a great deal more complicated than that. 
    They have to make the necessary plan amendments and, making plan amendments, they incur consequences with their own workforce.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="368.888" stopTime="388.516">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    But if they wanted to go to the... oh, you are quite right there's a countervailing sort of political consideration within the marketplace because you then end up with a bunch of employees who are mad, but if, as a matter of law, they want to accept that burden, they can... the employer could do that and couldn't have... could have done it here, I take it, is that right?
speaker="richard_e_schwartz" startTime="388.516" stopTime="396.622">
    Mr. Richard E. Schwartz 
    Certainly I do not think it is correct that the employer here could have done it without modification of their contract.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="396.622" stopTime="399.391">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    All right, because you had a CBA, yes. 
    Yes.

    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    May I ask this question? 
    I understood you to say earlier in your presentation that the rights at stake here had already vested, which puzzles me because you're relying on a statute that talks about being... losing... being discharged in order to prevent a right from becoming vested, or attainment and so forth.

    Are the rights vested or not?

    Mr. Richard E. Schwartz 
    --We believe that the rights are contractually vested for the duration of the collective bargaining agreement. 
    This was a--

    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Oh, I see, being vested in an unusual sense.

    --Yes.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="431.759" stopTime="446.185">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    And if you had a vested right, why don't you just sue to recover that right? 
    You don't need the statute, it seems to me, to recover... to get compensation for the destruction of a vested right. 
    The statute is designed to prevent, discharged in order to avoid vesting.

    Mr. Richard E. Schwartz 
    Yes.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="448.335" stopTime="450.387">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    And I'm not quite clear exactly what your position is on that.
speaker="richard_e_schwartz" startTime="450.387" stopTime="458.742">
    Mr. Richard E. Schwartz 
    The position is that they were vested for a limited period under the terms of the CBA, Justice Stevens.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="458.742" stopTime="472.050">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    All right. 
    Give me an example of a particular individual who had a vested right and is not able to just sue for that right without relying on the statute. 
    Maybe he'd gone to the dentist and ran up a dental bill or something. 
    He had the right to have it paid. 
    Is it that sort of thing you're saying? 
    Or--

    Mr. Richard E. Schwartz 
    --It's important to understand that within the context of the CBA, of course, we're dealing with section 301. 
    We're dealing with a lot of elaborate grievance and arbitration machinery, and exclusive remedies. 
    We're also dealing here with a bankrupt Teamsters local that was not able to share those burdens.

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well, Mr. Schwartz, the question presented in your petition for certiorari is based entirely, as I would read the question, on section 510 of ERISA, and that certainly was the basis for the Ninth Circuit's decision, and some of my colleagues I think are expressing the view what has the collective bargaining agreement and all that got to do with it if you're claiming under section 510?
speaker="richard_e_schwartz" startTime="514.828" stopTime="524.269">
    Mr. Richard E. Schwartz 
    We are claiming exclusively under section 510. 
    We believe that the collective bargaining agreement, Mr. Chief Justice, is important in terms of understanding the context in which this arose.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="524.269" stopTime="538.194">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Those are kind of weasel words. 
    The... important in understanding the context in which it arose. 
    If it's based on 510, tell me specifically, if you would, what the collective bargaining agreement has to do with it.
speaker="richard_e_schwartz" startTime="538.194" stopTime="551.436">
    Mr. Richard E. Schwartz 
    I believe the collective bargaining agreement has to do with evaluating the respondent's arguments relating to targeting their claim for a judicially crafted exception to section 510.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="551.436" stopTime="561.144">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well, as I read the respondent's brief they no longer support the reasoning of the Ninth Circuit in that respect, or at least they say you don't have to read the Ninth Circuit opinion in that view.
speaker="richard_e_schwartz" startTime="561.144" stopTime="568.148">
    Mr. Richard E. Schwartz 
    Our understanding is that they no longer support the Ninth Circuit's rationale for the decision in the case.

    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    You mentioned something about the bankrupt Teamsters Union, and as I understand it both the old employer, the Santa Fe group, and the new employer, the ITS, both were units that had Teamsters representing the workers. 
    Is that not so?
speaker="richard_e_schwartz" startTime="594.698" stopTime="614.861">
    Mr. Richard E. Schwartz 
    These workers in large part were given a last minute opportunity to apply for reemployment with the substitute employer, respondent Internal Services. 
    The Teamsters Union signed them to a contract with greatly reduced benefits.

    None whatsoever.

speaker="richard_e_schwartz" startTime="639.827" stopTime="648.166">
    Mr. Richard E. Schwartz

    The health insurance coverage was dramatically reduced.

    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Okay, but not for any coverage for things that had already occurred. 
    We're talking about future benefit opportunities. 
    Is that what we're talking about?

    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    But we aren't talking about people who had incurred an injury and wanted medical benefits. 
    We're talking about people who might in the future incur injuries or illness and need medical benefits.

    Mr. Richard E. Schwartz 
    We... Justice O'Connor, we're talking about people who enjoyed for a period of at least 1 year longer before the implementation of this transaction an ongoing coverage of entire medical care.

    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Well, they had health insurance, but we're not talking about people who had gotten sick and incurred medical bills already, and then they weren't paid. 
    We're talking about future opportunity to do that.

speaker="richard_e_schwartz" startTime="734.939" stopTime="745.413">
    Mr. Richard E. Schwartz 
    In addition, Justice O'Connor, we're dealing with a loss of vacation pay, a loss of sick pay, and the welfare--

    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    But not vacation pay that had already... there would be an obligation to pay, just future vacation pay. 
    It's a reduction in the amount of vacation pay that would be paid in the future, rather than cutting off some that had already been earned, is that correct? 
    You're kind of vague in your answer.

    Mr. Richard E. Schwartz 
    The Teamsters contract is extremely elusive, because they went from the nationally bargained Teamster contract to what is known as a white paper contract, which was a very short, specifically focused contract--

    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    We're trying to talk about section 510, though. 
    We're not trying to talk to you about the union contract, because the claim is made under section 510 of ERISA, and that's what we're trying to find out from you, how to make it fit under section 510 of ERISA.

    Your claim, that is.

    Mr. Richard E. Schwartz 
    --Justice O'Connor, we think it's from the plain language and the underlying legislative history and the purpose of Congress in enacting ERISA that the second clause of section 510 covers this situation precisely. 
    The language, interference with the attainment of a right to which participant may become entitled--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="825.146" stopTime="831.985">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Wouldn't you say attainment, though, suggested something that was to be... to happen in the future?
speaker="richard_e_schwartz" startTime="831.985" stopTime="860.987">
    Mr. Richard E. Schwartz 
    --Yes, but it doesn't necessarily imply vesting, and in this particular situation, Mr. Chief Justice, we had a situation where people expected that if their children had doctor appointments in April or May they would be covered under the Teamsters plan. 
    If they needed to go in for a previously scheduled operation in June, that would have been covered prior to March 19, when the people were suddenly informed that they were going to have the opportunity with the new employer on April 1.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="860.987" stopTime="871.944">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    But I suppose the employer's argument is that if something had not been attained as of the date this action was taken, it didn't violate that section, section 510.
speaker="richard_e_schwartz" startTime="871.944" stopTime="893.224">
    Mr. Richard E. Schwartz 
    I hesitate to speak for Mr. Holzhauer, but it's our understanding with their... they have... I believe they have essentially conceded and would no longer take the position that the welfare, health and welfare benefits such as are involved here are not covered by the second clause of 510. 
    I think that's apparent throughout their brief.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="893.224" stopTime="898.928">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    No, I understood their argument to focus more on the phrase accompanying the word attainment.
speaker="richard_e_schwartz" startTime="898.928" stopTime="920.127">
    Mr. Richard E. Schwartz 
    I... what we find is the more interesting and perhaps troublesome issues deal more with their argument relating to targeting, Mr. Chief Justice. 
    Clearly, attainment and may become entitled indicate some element of maturity, certainly.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="920.127" stopTime="938.255">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    I mean, supposing you've been working at a place 11 months and you don't get medical benefits until you've been there for a year. 
    It seems to me that would fit very nicely under the attainment clause. 
    You're fired at the end of 11 months because the employee doesn't want you to get medical benefits. 
    But that really isn't this case, is it?
speaker="richard_e_schwartz" startTime="938.255" stopTime="951.396">
    Mr. Richard E. Schwartz 
    No, it's not, because here... it might be the case that if you were working at that hypothetical employer under a contract that had another year and... another 13 months to go, instead of being an at-will employee.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="951.396" stopTime="975.345">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Can I ask you one hypothetical question? 
    Supposing there's no union agreement or anything involved, and the employer finds out that a segment of his workforce performing one specific task, they... they're entitled to welfare... health and... health benefits, and they find out that if they subcontracted all that work out to others they would save the cost of those benefits, and they decide that's the reason they want to make that change, and they do it. 
    Have they violated the statute?
speaker="richard_e_schwartz" startTime="975.345" stopTime="996.008">
    Mr. Richard E. Schwartz 
    I believe that's... they have, Mr. Justice Stevens, and I believe that that's pretty much what occurred here. 
    The railroad targeted the one group in the entire railyard that was dealing with... that was covered by ERISA-protected benefits rather than living under the... explicitly under the railroad retirement plans.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="996.008" stopTime="1024.544">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    But you would say, I take it, that if there had been further reasons, in addition merely to the cost of providing these benefits, for wanting to get rid of this division and contract out, that if the existence of those further reasons... say they were... they happened to have a bunch of very inefficient employees and so on... the existence of those further reasons would preclude a violation of the statute.

    Well, it is in theory, although it would be difficult in practice, because if you concede, and if we were to hold that so long as the avoidance of the medical... the cost of welfare benefits was only one among other reasons that that would be legitimate, then every employer who wanted to do what this employer did would simply claim other reasons, so it would be difficult of proof, even though in theory there would be a bright line.

    Ms. Cornelia T. L. Pillard 
    Yes. 
    Thank you. 
    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    Our position is that section 510 is not limited to pension rights or rights capable of vesting, but also covers rights to welfare benefits. 
    The court of appeals' holding to the contrary cannot be squared with the language of the statute. 
    Section 510 uses the general term, employee benefit plans, which the statute defines to include both pension plans and welfare benefit plans.

    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Well, the respondent seems to pretty well agree with this much of your argument. 
    What do you do with my hypothetical case, just a clean-cut example of trying to cut costs among others by welfare... you know, by contracting out to save the money there? 
    That's clearly an economic motive, and there were no vested benefits in the sense that there were no unpaid medical bills based on injuries that had already occurred.
speaker="cornelia_t_l_pillard" startTime="1249.624" stopTime="1270.870">
    Ms. Cornelia T. L. Pillard 
    In our view, generally that situation would not show proof of the prohibited purpose, with one caveat. 
    If the choice of the employees whose jobs were being contracted out were based on the fact that they were a group of employees who were imminently going to vest, or who the employer knew were ill, for example, as a result of--

    No, I'm assuming none of that... none of that.

    Ms. Cornelia T. L. Pillard 
    This is a very common scenario, where an employer has offered health care coverage with particular coverage levels, and when an employee becomes ill, although the employer would be free generally to amend the plan to eliminate coverage for an illness that seems too expensive or burdensome, instead, the employee keeps the plan in place with respect to other employees but discharges the employee to interfere with the attainment of the right to claim coverage under the plan.

    If you told me those are real life situations that happen often, you've answered a question I was about to ask.

    I'm not... you know, I don't think... I don't know of any that exist like that. 
    You could create one. 
    But I was trying to figure out what Congress had in mind bringing these other things in, and it's this situation that you've just described. 
    Or, for example, an employee who has a child with a serious heart condition, and the employer knows that to take care of that child is going to cost hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of health care. 
    Now, if that happens, does that cause the employer's premiums to go up, basically?

    I hope we can get to this case, because the examples you've been given of retaliation, of discharging a particular employee because that employee is going to cost too much, there are a number of court of appeals cases dealing with that discrimination, but here we have something different. 
    We have not, we're going to discharge employee A because we've heard he has a heart disease. 
    It is en masse. 
    It is faceless. 
    It says, all of the workers in this unit go, and then we're going to have a subcontract. 
    That's quite different than what Congress had in mind when it says, don't fire the guy just before his pension vests, and you say that same thinking transposes to health and welfare benefits, but what about the significant difference that this isn't a case about discharging a particular employee.

    That's right, Justice Ginsburg, and I do want to get to this case, but I would note that as a prudential matter we don't think the Court should reach the alternative grounds, because they were not argued in the court of appeals. 
    They were not decided by that court.

    Section 510 should not be interpreted to require employers to ignore a very real element of labor costs when they make fundamental business decisions about the scope and nature of their operation and whether they're going to do work in-house or subcontract work, whether they're going to have something done at all, or decide to close a particular operation. 
    The language of the statute--

    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Well, Mr. Holzhauer, you take the position that the employer may decide that the cost of welfare benefits under the Railway Labor Workers Act is just too expensive, and if we can get rid of that whole requirement, we will be better off economically, and so we'll have this termination here.
speaker="james_d_holzhauer" startTime="1851.233" stopTime="1852.418">
    Mr. James D. Holzhauer 
    --That's correct, Your Honor.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="1852.418" stopTime="1855.620">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    And that that is not prohibited by section 510.
speaker="james_d_holzhauer" startTime="1855.620" stopTime="1872.147">
    Mr. James D. Holzhauer 
    That's correct. 
    The employer here, an employer can determine that its obligation to continue its benefit costs, no matter where they're from, are too expensive, and we found out that we can subcontract the work and reduce those costs. 
    That does not violate section 510.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="1872.147" stopTime="1879.402">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    So what do we do with the attainment... for the purpose of interfering with the attainment of any right language in 510?
speaker="james_d_holzhauer" startTime="1879.402" stopTime="1912.707">
    Mr. James D. Holzhauer 
    Well, the attainment language, interfering with the attainment of any right to which a participant may become entitled talks about becoming eligible, or in our view refers to becoming eligible, arriving at, or attaining a ripe old age is the way Black's defined it, citing some old cases, reaching or becoming eligible for a benefit. 
    And in section 510, like elsewhere in ERISA, attain and attainment are used regularly to talk about attaining a particular age, attaining years of service, attaining a qualification that's necessary to become eligible for a benefit.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="1912.707" stopTime="1940.124">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    So the act has to be specific to the employee? 
    In other words, if it is specific to the employee... A is about to become 60 years old, B is about to have a tooth extracted, what-not. 
    That is the kinds of attainment that you're talking about here, and therefore the line is drawn between acts intended to... in effect to preclude benefits to specific individuals as opposed to acts on a more global scale. 
    Is that where you draw the line?
speaker="james_d_holzhauer" startTime="1940.124" stopTime="1973.947">
    Mr. James D. Holzhauer 
    I think that's generally correct, although I would say this. 
    First of all, I think the tooth extraction case might come under the exercising part of section 510, but in the Third Circuit case, the Gavelette case, the Court determined that the employer decided that a large group of employees at one plant were about to become vested at one point, or were subject to vesting and were about to reach the vesting point, which is possible, considering that vesting is over time. 
    It might be a plant that was just opened 5 years ago. 
    Under those circumstances I think an argument, a strong argument can be made that section 510 has been violated even though the decision is not on an individual basis.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="1973.947" stopTime="2008.370">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    But I don't see how this squares with your attainment argument. 
    You began by saying attain means that you're about to reach something. 
    This is the Black's Law Dictionary. 
    But then you said, now of course this doesn't apply to... you had a wisdom tooth hypothetical, or Justice O'Connor's hypothetical of a very expensive particular case. 
    Suppose that that employee was receiving benefits. 
    He or she had attained the right in that sense, and the employer terminates in order to avoid the coverage.
speaker="james_d_holzhauer" startTime="2008.370" stopTime="2032.503">
    Mr. James D. Holzhauer 
    Well, I think that could quite likely be a violation of the exercising clause of section 510. 
    The attainment clause talks about attaining rights to which the participant may become entitled, and I think that's another future-oriented kind of reference in that provision. 
    Clearly, it would violate section 510 to fire someone because they filed a claim, an expensive claim relating to having their wisdom teeth extracted.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="2032.503" stopTime="2034.319">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    But isn't it equally clear... let me just be sure I get one thing clear.
speaker="james_d_holzhauer" startTime="2034.319" stopTime="2034.636">
    Mr. James D. Holzhauer 
    Sure.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="2034.636" stopTime="2048.161">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    That if you took my hypothetical and said, instead of health benefits, we're concerned that 90 percent of these people are about to reach 20 years of service and therefore have vested benefits, and you took out the whole division and substituted with a contract, that would clearly violate it, would it not?
speaker="james_d_holzhauer" startTime="2048.161" stopTime="2113.771">
    Mr. James D. Holzhauer 
    That would be correct. 
    I think vesting, the maximum period for vesting now is 10 years in a multiemployer, between 5 and 8 in other plans, but if it was on the cliff for vesting, and you said everybody in that plant... this plant was just opened 5 years ago, and everybody in that plant is about to vest, and therefore I'm going to close that plant and maybe open it up again next week or subcontract out the work or whatever, I think that would be a section 510 violation. 
    Now, Justice Kennedy, in your question, the person that had the tooth extracted clearly would violate section 510, the exercising clause, to fire him because he filed a claim. 
    I think a strong argument can be made that if the employer sees him coming down the hall with his claim form and a stack of medical bills with it, it might violate 510 then as well, and it might violate 510, the exercising clause, if the employee... employer knew that that employee has a particular illness or particular condition that is going to require, or has already required large expenditures or benefits. 
    But that's not what we have here. 
    What we have here is something very close, as counsel for petitioners acknowledge, to Justice Stevens' hypothetical, an employer who decides that benefit costs are too high.

    I'm not going to pay those benefits, or I'm not going to pay that rich a benefit program.

    Reduce the benefits. 
    But what we don't want you to do is this other way of trying to achieve a similar result, firing everybody, rehiring them.

    You have some burdens and you have some benefits. 
    It's a compromise.
speaker="james_d_holzhauer" startTime="2362.346" stopTime="2392.365">
    Mr. James D. Holzhauer 
    --Well, of course, there's nothing in section 510 that talks about employers being required to amend or terminate plans, but in many situations that's not going to be practically possible. 
    We might have a situation, for example, where an employer's obligations under a collective bargaining agreement require the employer to pay benefits and is not going to be able to unilaterally amend or terminate their plan, but that collective bargaining agreement might also provide that the employer is entitled to subcontract work, or the National Labor Relations Act might give them a right to subcontract work. 
    Same thing happens with wages.
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="2392.365" stopTime="2397.417">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    So if you want to have this right, you work it out with the union.

    Mr. James D. Holzhauer 
    Sure.
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="2397.936" stopTime="2406.625">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    Well, all right. 
    Bring it up on the table. 
    Say what we can do. 
    Amend the plan. 
    Why... why is it a problem for the employer? 
    I mean, I understand what they'd like--
speaker="james_d_holzhauer" startTime="2406.625" stopTime="2501.087">
    Mr. James D. Holzhauer 
    Sure. 
    Well, in some circumstances the employer might also take this position with regard to wages. 
    The union contract sets a certain wage but allows the employer to subcontract. 
    The employers... the collective bargaining agreement sets certain benefits, but the employer is allowed to subcontract, or the National Labor Relations Act gives a procedure or mechanism for subcontracting out work. 
    There are other circumstances where it makes no sense to amend or terminate a plan. 
    Often insurance contracts, if it's an insured plan, will provide that we want to cover all your employees. 
    We don't want you to carve out little groups of employees because we're afraid you might do it in a way that's to our disadvantage, or we just want the big business or no business at all. 
    Under those circumstances the employer may not be able to amend or terminate. 
    It also might not solve the situation at all in a variety of circumstances. 
    Suppose an employer had two different plants, and it had to decide which one to close. 
    They both had health insurance benefits, but one was very costly, and one was less costly, perhaps because of the region of the country they were in. 
    Under those circumstances that would be a violation of section 510 to make that decision based on benefit costs if you followed the petitioner's argument, but it would be just a legitimate economic decision based on what's more expensive for the employer. 
    There's no evidence in the legislative history of ERISA, and there's certainly no requirement, even if we can flip from obtain to attain and argue that that clause can be read much more broadly than it is, there's certainly no requirement in section 510, no language that would dictate that we reach a result that would require employers to ignore very real economic costs that they face, and costs that employers base very similar decisions on every day.

speaker="james_d_holzhauer" startTime="2521.750" stopTime="2549.068">
    Mr. James D. Holzhauer 
    It would apply to pension benefits generally in the sense that, suppose we had a workforce that had vested pensions, or not vested pensions, but were just accruing pension benefits rateably over time. 
    There was no circumstance where we were focusing on people who were about to vest, but we just decided that the benefit costs of that plan are too expensive, and the benefit costs that we were concerned about in that plan were pension benefits. 
    Under those circumstances I still say that that would not violate section 510.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="2549.068" stopTime="2559.423">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    So you're rejecting the Ninth Circuit line in two ways. 
    First you say that there isn't this distinction between pension plans and health and welfare plans.
speaker="james_d_holzhauer" startTime="2559.423" stopTime="2562.106">
    Mr. James D. Holzhauer 
    No.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="2562.106" stopTime="2569.695">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    No, and that as far as the pension plan goes, the Ninth Circuit was wrong, although you didn't take a cross-appeal.
speaker="james_d_holzhauer" startTime="2569.695" stopTime="2662.055">
    Mr. James D. Holzhauer 
    Well, the Ninth Circuit held... again, the Ninth Circuit's treatment of both of these issues was rather cursory, so it's really hard to understand exactly what their reasoning was, but quoting Ingersoll-Rand, the Ninth Circuit held that 510 protects plan participants from termination motivated by an employer's desire to prevent a pension from vesting. 
    Santa Fe saw no need to cross-petition on that issue, because it's quite confident that when it goes back on remand it's going to be able to show that it didn't take any action to prevent pensions from vesting. 
    We thought that that's what the Court talked about as the pension part of 510, on remand we'll be fine. 
    If they're using the term more broadly than they say they were using it, the same argument would apply. 
    Now, section 510 was adopted as a corollary to ERISA's vesting requirement, which was essential to the statutory scheme put in place by Congress, and for the first time Congress required that pension benefits become nonforfeitable after a set period of time. 
    Congress recognized that employers might circumvent that vesting requirement by discharging employees who were about to become vested, and they installed section 510 to deal with that problem. 
    It makes perfect sense in that context to say it protects you, the attainment clause of section 510 protects you until you become eligible for the benefits, but doesn't provide you with meaningful protection thereafter, although the exercising clause might.

    Mr. James D. Holzhauer 
    --Well, I think that a strong argument can be made, and it's not involved in this case at all, but a strong argument can be made certainly that... well, clearly it would violate section 510 to fire that employee just after they file that claim, because they filed that expensive claim. 
    Can an employer circumvent the exercising clause by doing it just before they file the claim? 
    I think one can make a strong argument that it would. 
    I also strongly disagree with the Government's representation that that hypothetical is in any sense real. 
    The reality of that hypothetical ignores COBRA benefits. 
    An employer, once an employee is terminated, the employee generally is entitled to COBRA benefits which will keep insurance in place--

    Mr. James D. Holzhauer 
    --Often... more often they get exactly what the plan gives. 
    The most common COBRA benefits is exactly the health insurance that they get. 
    They don't get the other kinds of benefits, but they would get the health insurance.

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Mr. Holzhauer, given your response to Justice O'Connor's question, of what use is the application of the attainment clause to plans other than pension plans?
speaker="james_d_holzhauer" startTime="2822.609" stopTime="2857.247">
    Mr. James D. Holzhauer 
    Justice Scalia, earlier you asked whether it was ever... whether it was common to have plans that allow you to get health insurance after being there for a year, or after passing a probationary period, which might be 90 days. 
    It's very common. 
    That's common throughout industry, and that could very well be the kind of situation. 
    An employee often has to work a certain period of time in the sense of hours per week, or hours over an accumulated period of time, in order to become a full-time employee for benefits purposes. 
    It could violate section 510's attainment clause to stop somebody from working over that threshold.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="2857.247" stopTime="2861.401">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    And you think that's what Congress was worried about, that there are a lot of employers who keep--

    --90 days, firing people after 89 days?
speaker="james_d_holzhauer" startTime="2865.269" stopTime="2881.647">
    Mr. James D. Holzhauer 
    --I think Congress was concerned about vesting pension benefits, but Congress talked about employee benefit plans, and I think there could be analogous circumstances under which section 510's attainment clause would apply to welfare benefits as well, and that's one very analogous circumstance.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="2881.647" stopTime="2891.753">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    But you insist it applies only to eligibility. 
    But then why, in answer to Justice O'Connor, did you get into the question of circumvention? 
    You've either attained or you haven't attained.
speaker="james_d_holzhauer" startTime="2891.753" stopTime="2894.122">

    Justice David H. Souter 
    The exercise clause. 
    If we allow that the exercise clause can be circumvented, how do we draw... that circumvention of the exercise clause would state a violation, how do we draw the line? 
    Why doesn't that swallow the attainment issue?
speaker="james_d_holzhauer" startTime="2909.632" stopTime="2958.378">
    Mr. James D. Holzhauer 
    Well, I think the exercising clause was intended to deal with a kind of individual... not global plant closing or plan design situation, but an individual situation where you were focusing and targeting a particular individual and saying, that person's going to be too expensive. 
    I am going to terminate that person because their benefits are too high. 
    Clearly, it does violate the exercising clause by any reading to do that after the employee has started filing those benefits... oh, he's exercised his right to benefits too much, I'm going to fire him as a consequence of doing that. 
    The question is whether, in the very same circumstances, where you're looking at an individual employee who's about to file a lot of claims because he has bad wisdom teeth, or he has other problems, whether that would violate the exercising clause in section 510, and I think an argument could be made that it would.

    The specific employee, rather than a global, cost-based organizational change. 
    What has been going on in this case was a fundamental change in the way Santa Fe operated its business. 
    It was no longer going to be using its own employees to do that work. 
    It was subcontracting that work out to other employees.

    Mr. James D. Holzhauer 
    --I think that there certainly... there are circumstances... generally speaking, pension benefits are required under the statute to accrue rateably over time, not to have these kinds of cliffs in which you're entitled under the plan to additional money.

    Mr. James D. Holzhauer 
    Yes. 
    There are circumstances... for example, I think the Heath case was one of those, in the Seventh Circuit, where an employee was entitled to early retirement, additional benefits if they reached a certain age, and I think that he would become eligible for those benefits if they stayed on the workforce.

    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    What you're saying the Court did say there.

    Mr. James D. Holzhauer 
    That's right.
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="3029.925" stopTime="3030.892">

    It's an attainment matter.

    Right.

speaker="james_d_holzhauer" startTime="3075.954" stopTime="3099.769">
    Mr. James D. Holzhauer 
    Well, I think the purpose of the overall statute was to deal with the vesting circumstance, and then to prevent people from circumventing someone from vesting, and I think when there are analogous circumstances like someone about to become eligible for early retirement benefits, under those circumstances that would be a similar eligibility threshold, and crossing that eligibility threshold would be involved, but nothing like that is going on here. 
    This is a global prospects change.

    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    --So are you saying that the D.C. Circuit approach in the Andes case, they didn't even need to get to anything like, what does the word discharge mean?
speaker="james_d_holzhauer" startTime="3105.140" stopTime="3165.594">
    Mr. James D. Holzhauer 
    Yes, I agree with that. 
    I found that decision puzzling, because the Court said on the one hand these employees weren't discharged and we didn't... Congress didn't use the words layoff and termination in that case, but then it said that well, there might be some circumstances where a particular attribute of that workforce might call it into play. 
    I assume they were referring to the Gavelette case, or that kind of hypothetical in their situation, where it would apply. 
    Well, if it's not a termination to subcontract out work under these circumstances, how would it be a termination or a discharge under those second set of circumstances? 
    I think the D.C. Circuit was struggling with what several other courts have struggled with as how to fit section 510, how to square section 510 with these kinds of fundamental business changes, cost-based changes that employers ordinarily do, and this is very much like the kind of change that Peter Drucker talked about in his Wall Street Journal article some years, Sell the Mailroom. 
    These kinds of changes are not the kind of thing that ERISA was intended to encompass.
