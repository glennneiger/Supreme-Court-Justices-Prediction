    Mr. Deval L. Patrick 
    It... we... it is usually referred to and has been in the litigation as Bossier Parish, but in Louisiana it's Bossier.

    Bossier, okay.

    Allons. 
    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    The Bossier Parish School Board adopted the redistricting plan at issue in this case with a discriminatory purpose, plain and simple, and in finding otherwise, the district court ignored evidence that this Court has required fact-finders to consider since its decision in the Arlington Heights case, evidence of racial block voting and of the recent history of discrimination in voting and otherwise in Bossier Parish, evidence that was undisputed, indeed was stipulated below.

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Mr. Patrick, when you say the district court ignored the evidence, you don't mean that it excluded it as a matter of admission of evidence, but just that it refused to take it into consideration in making its conclusion?

    Mr. Deval L. Patrick 
    Frankly, Mr. Chief Justice, it's very hard to say. 
    There was not an evidentiary ruling in the classic sense, in... because all of the evidence came into the record by way of stipulation without objection by the parties, but what is plain is that the court did not even mention the Arlington Heights case or the Arlington Heights standards, and in one point in the decision went so far as to say that it would not expressly consider the evidence of the history of discrimination in the school board, and when you... excuse me, Mr.--

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist

    Mr. Deval L. Patrick 
    --There are two kinds of evidence that bends to the question, Your Honor, about how we know they didn't take account of it. 
    First of all, the evidence of racial bloc voting. 
    This is a community where the parties have stipulated that 80 percent of the voters in the parish will not vote for a candidate of a race different than them. 
    That is stipulated at 122a of the record.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="224.001" stopTime="245.413">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    But didn't the... I mean, the response that's made by the appellee here is that the court... that all that that would prove is that therefore, since there was bloc voting, it would advantage the black voters if there were majority black districting, but didn't the court assume that to be true?
speaker="deval_l_patrick" startTime="245.413" stopTime="246.825">
    Mr. Deval L. Patrick 
    No, Your Honor. 
    I don't think--

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    It didn't assume that... I thought it--

    Mr. Deval L. Patrick

    Did you... I'm sorry.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="248.966" stopTime="259.993">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    --Yes. 
    I thought that the court's discussion just takes as a given that it would be to the benefit of the blacks if they had a majority-minority district.
speaker="deval_l_patrick" startTime="259.993" stopTime="313.487">
    Mr. Deval L. Patrick 
    I'm not sure that we can fairly assume that from the district court's opinion. 
    What the district court said is that evidence of this kind is relevant to section 2, there's no question about that. 
    But we contend, and Arlington Heights supports us, that it is independently relevant to the question of purposeful discrimination. 
    There is no evidence, in fact, on this record which is relevant to the one question, the section 2 question, but not relevant to the purpose determination in the case and, indeed, the court expressly refused in its opinion at 34a, footnote 18, the evidence that the board itself was in violation of the Federal desegregation order with respect to the schools, so that when you take into account the evidence that was excluded and the... both the racial bloc voting and the history of discrimination, all of which is stipulated and uncontested below, and you think... and you consider that in light of the other evidence that was considered, that the plan--

    What this Court has done--

speaker="deval_l_patrick" startTime="346.350" stopTime="397.205">
    Mr. Deval L. Patrick 
    --I rely on Rogers v. Lodge, which is a... which, as you know, is a case where the court has said that the Arlington Heights factors are probative of the judgment about whether there's purposeful discrimination under the Voting Rights Act. 
    I think what is key in your analysis and consideration of this case is that you bear in mind all of the facts, as Arlington Heights requires, all of the facts and circumstances known to the board at the time, and ask yourself, does it add up? 
    This is a plan, you understand, that is against the school board's own interests, both its districting and its governance interests. 
    This is a school board that is typically concerned about distributing the schools among the school districts, and yet adopted a plan that has some school districts with no schools in it at all. 
    That is stipulated at 112a and 73a of the record. 
    It--

    Mr. Deval L. Patrick 
    We take that to mean that the factors... that the school board has to show a nondiscriminatory purpose within the meaning of Arlington Heights by taking into account the totality of the circumstances, looking at the actions and inactions in this case of the school board, in reaching the conclusion they did, all the facts and circumstances known to the board at the time.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="442.646" stopTime="445.699">

speaker="deval_l_patrick" startTime="445.699" stopTime="480.891">
    Mr. Deval L. Patrick 
    That's right. 
    I was saying that the... about the plan that they did adopt that this is a plan which it is conceded does not respect school attendance zones. 
    That's also stipulated in this record, at 112a. 
    It pits incumbents against each other. 
    The way the district court put it was that it wreaks havoc on incumbent... incumbency. 
    That's 28a in the court's opinion. 
    About half of the parish was placed in one district. 
    That's also at 120a, and in other places it fractures neighborhoods, 110a to 111a. 
    These are all stipulated facts.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="480.891" stopTime="540.421">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    Mr. Patrick, would it have been open or was it open at the district court to accept all of this and say, look, all of this evidence does point in the direction of intent to discriminate, but there's a piece of counterevidence here and that is, the moment at which the board seemed to turn around and suddenly embrace the police district plan, which it did not originally want, was the moment at which it became apparent that there was going to be a fight about this. 
    It was the moment following the NAACP's submission, I think, of a couple of plans. 
    And it is findable on this record that what the board wanted to do was to avoid 7 years of litigation, and basically the board said, look, we'll take peace, even though we don't like the way we're getting it. 
    We'll take peace with all of these defects. 
    If that was the court's reasoning process, would that have been clearly erroneous, or, indeed, was that clearly erroneous?
speaker="deval_l_patrick" startTime="540.421" stopTime="544.642">
    Mr. Deval L. Patrick 
    It was clearly erroneous. 
    It's not entirely clear that that was the court's--
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="544.642" stopTime="545.252">

    I realize that.
speaker="deval_l_patrick" startTime="545.252" stopTime="559.681">
    Mr. Deval L. Patrick 
    --the court's reasoning. 
    What the court said was that it might be a legitimate reason to seek easy preclearance. 
    What Your Honor's question implies is that the reason was that they wanted to avoid a controversy with the black citizens, but--
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="559.681" stopTime="562.113">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    Well, they wanted to avoid litigation, and they could see it coming.
speaker="deval_l_patrick" startTime="562.113" stopTime="579.093">
    Mr. Deval L. Patrick 
    --If that's what it was. 
    I do think Your Honor is right that the process and the sequence of events leading up to the decision is extremely telling and, indeed, Arlington Heights requires that that be considered as well. 
    This was a process that was undertaken more than 3 years before they needed the plan.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="579.093" stopTime="597.776">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    So if we didn't have the process and the sequence, if we just had a lazy school board that said, oh, the police jury got this plan, and it was precleared, so we'll take it with all its faults, if it hadn't been that, would this... would it have been okay?
speaker="deval_l_patrick" startTime="597.776" stopTime="640.816">
    Mr. Deval L. Patrick 
    I think it would be a very different case. 
    Clearly, the... that's not the case we have here, because we have a board that expected to draw a plan different from the police jury plan at the outset. 
    That is stipulated, too, as well in the record and, indeed, we have a board that had a different plan from the police jury for a decade or more before they were faced with the redistricting considerations. 
    This is a board that hired a cartographer with the expectation he would spend 200... 250 hours drawing a plan different from the police jury and went about that at a leisurely pace for over a year. 
    Everything changed when the black citizens came forward and asked that they be fairly represented in the districting--

    Mr. Deval L. Patrick 
    Well, we're certainly not contending that you can build a section 5 out of only... section 5 case out of only that, but frankly there is no way to understand the district court's opinion by saying that it won't consider for section 5 purposes evidence that's relevant to section 2 on a record where all of the evidence is relevant both to section 2 and section 5, as other than... meaning the purpose prong of section 5 as other than--

    Mr. Deval L. Patrick 
    That no black person had ever been elected to the school board. 
    That's stipulated at 115a. 
    That there had never been more than one black member of the police jury. 
    That's in the joint appendix at 55 to 60. 
    That blacks had rarely been elected anywhere in the parish at the time. 
    That's stipulated at 127a----
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="721.107" stopTime="723.069">

    Mr. Deval L. Patrick 
    --That's right, and then in terms of the history of discrimination, at the time of the decision this board was in violation of its duty to redress school segregation under Brown.

    Mr. Deval L. Patrick 
    --You're right that they're all in the record, Justice Kennedy, there's no question about that. 
    What is apparent, however, is that the district court was not taking them into account as is required by Arlington Heights in making its judgment about purposeful discrimination. 
    And with respect to the history of discrimination, remember, this is a school board that stipulated on the record that segregation has increased since the court... since they've been under Federal court order and, indeed, that they were assigning teachers to schools on racial grounds. 
    This is a... the district court said expressly in footnote 18 of its opinion that it would not consider evidence that the board itself was in violation of its duties under the Federal court order to desegregate the schools. 
    That's the evidence that was not considered. 
    That is the evidence that should have been considered under the Arlington Heights standard, and if you add to that, and I'm going to come back to the sequence issues in just a moment, but if you add to that that this is a school board that came before the United States district court, to say nothing of the Attorney General, and urged false reasons... false reasons for why it was... why it made the decision it did, I... we submit that a jurisdiction with a clean, nondiscriminatory motive does not come to the United States District Court and urge false reasons, and--

    It's on page 34a of the appendix to the jurisdictional statement. 
    Defendant mentions the continuing duty of the school board to 
    "remedy any remaining vestiges of the dual school system under the order in Lemon v. Bossier Parish School Board, citing in particular the school board's failure to maintain a biracial committee. "

speaker="john_w_borkowski" startTime="937.739" stopTime="982.368">
    Mr. John W. Borkowski 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    I'd like to start with the question Justice Scalia just asked about footnote 18, because that shows very clearly, I think, what has been going on in Bossier Parish. 
    The evidence that the court didn't look at that dealt with the board's exclusion, admitted exclusion of blacks from educational policy issues. 
    The court had ordered that a committee be established to allow blacks to have an opportunity for input into school board issues. 
    This is the kind of nonresponsiveness, the kind of exclusion that is exactly what happened in the redistricting process.

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well, if we're... if you're going to get into the sort of detail that you say Arlington Heights requires us to get into, I would think that it would be important to know whether the school board's failure to maintain a biracial committee was the result of hostility to the idea, neglect, maybe unable to have the funds, maybe just got lost in the shuffle. 
    In other words, just saying it failed to maintain a biracial committee, if we're going to get into the sort of textual detail that Arlington Heights says, you have to know more about it than that.

Busbee v. Smith and Port Arthur... also apply to Arlington Heights, and it's the constitutional standard, and... so I'm just talking at this point about the purpose argument.

    Mr. John W. Borkowski 
    Well, there are three different statements, and one of the statements that... the statement you referred to could be interpreted that way, but Judge Kessler in dissent says to the... says in footnote 4 on page 42a that the majority is not considering this evidence, and the majority never says it is. 
    If you look at the evidence the majority analyzes, it only analyzes two types of evidence, and doesn't look at all sorts of evidence. 
    You asked what was excluded. 
    The fact that the board's plan fractures black neighborhoods, the same neighborhoods that the school board members consciously kept together in drawing 75-percent black school attendance boundaries were fractured by the plan. 
    That's a... those are stipulated, unrebutted facts on this record that appear nowhere in the majority's discussion of discriminatory intent, because they would also be relevant to section 2. 
    There are communities of interest that our clients have and other black voters in Bossier Parish have that are established by the testimony. 
    That is nowhere discussed in the majority's opinion. 
    The... what this Court has called the inexorable zero, the fact that no blacks have ever been elected to the school board, is nowhere discussed in the analysis of the board's purpose, and we think these... this kind of evidence cannot logically be excluded just because it's also relevant to a section 2--

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    I mean, there are two different points. 
    Number 1 is that the court didn't even consider it, and if I agree with your interpretation of the language we were just discussing, then you would have established that the court didn't even consider it, but arguably the court could have considered it but not have thought it germane enough or significant enough to be mentioned in its opinion. 
    Would that also be a violation?
speaker="john_w_borkowski" startTime="1370.359" stopTime="1433.980">
    Mr. John W. Borkowski 
    I don't believe it would be a violation per se simply not to mention evidence that is considered. 
    The point here is that if the court actually did consider this evidence, which in every category of evidence in Arlington Heights shows discriminatory purpose, it could not have reached the conclusion that it reached. 
    As Judge Kessler said in dissent, this is... the evidence is far from being equally convincing on either side. 
    If you look at all of the stipulated and unrebutted evidence, this is not a close case. 
    The problem here with the majority's approach, and the problem in... if this Court would affirm the majority's decision, is that it would effectively eviscerate the purpose prong of section 5. 
    It would mean that the only kind of discriminatory purpose that would be reachable under section 5 would be publicly admitted or covertly tape recorded discriminatory purpose, because every other category of evidence that this Court has said in Arlington Heights requires a sensitive inquiry is here.

    There was also evidence that the court considered that the court offered its own explanations for, which we cite in our briefs as another legal error. 
    The only evidence, contemporaneous, direct evidence of the board's intent are admissions that tend to show discriminatory purpose.

    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    Let me begin by focusing on the standard that the district court actually did apply in assessing the evidence. 
    Appellants would have this Court believe that the district court had in front of it a body of evidence that it considered probative to the question of purpose, and it sifted through that evidence and threw out all the evidence that it also thought was relevant to section 2, but of course the district court did not say that, and did not do that.

    Okay. 
    I will agree that some of the court's statement about what it was doing with evidence perhaps were ambiguous and lent themselves to your interpretation, but at the bottom of the page the court quotes from-- 
    --Twenty-three a? 
    Yes, page 23a. 
    The court quotes from a panel opinion of a different panel but at the same court, and this is what it says: 
    As the panel noted, the court in Miller reaffirmed that the purpose prong of section 5 must be analyzed within the context of section 5's purpose, which has always been to ensure that no voting procedure changes would be made that would lead to a retrogression in the position of racial minorities. 
    Now, it seems to me that the court is there making it clear that the only purpose evidence it would consider was evidence of purpose to effect a retrogression, as opposed to a broader purpose to discriminate. 
    Isn't that fairly clear?
speaker="michael_a_carvin" startTime="1638.265" stopTime="1639.654">
    Mr. Michael A. Carvin

    Then explain that.
speaker="michael_a_carvin" startTime="1640.455" stopTime="1721.700">
    Mr. Michael A. Carvin 
    First of all, the case he is citing from did not... was making the point that in analyzing purpose you must look at the limited purpose of section 5 and not get into these additional section 2 issues that the Justice Department had urged upon the court in Texas and was also urging upon the court here. 
    But more directly to answer your question, of course, it was stipulated in this case that there was no retrogressive effect of the plan, so under your understanding of the district court opinion, the district court would have only been looking at, at did they have a purpose to effect a retrogression? 
    This would have been a very short opinion indeed if that had been its analysis. 
    It did not look at the purpose of the new plan compared to the status quo ante. 
    It looked at the purpose of the new plan as compared to the maximization alternative proposed by the NAACP. 
    The plan adopted had no black majority districts. 
    The NAACP plan had two black majority districts. 
    The district court spent its entire opinion analyzing, did the board do that... it's decision because of its negative impact on minority voters or in spite of it? 
    Did it have legitimate nondiscriminatory motives for rejecting the NAACP plan, or was it motivated by a racial reason?

    Mr. Michael A. Carvin 
    --No, but in isolation it may not, but the context is this, Your Honor. 
    You have five section 5 courts who were trying to analyze why did the submitting jurisdiction make a change? 
    What was the purpose behind that change? 
    And they are examining all the circumstantial and direct evidence relating to the change. 
    The Justice Department in all five of those cases and here says, don't just look at what was motivating the board at the time. 
    We also want you to consider all of this additional section 2 evidence, as they're arguing here. 
    We want you to consider racial bloc voting in prior elections. 
    And the district courts in section 5 cases have consistently responded to the Justice Department, section 5 has a much more limited purpose.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="1774.685" stopTime="1789.234">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    Well, what is your position here? 
    Is it your position here that the only purpose that is relevant under section 5 is purpose to cause retrogression, as distinct from purpose to discriminate by effecting a purposeful dilution?
speaker="michael_a_carvin" startTime="1789.234" stopTime="1806.374">
    Mr. Michael A. Carvin 
    Oh, no. 
    No, not at all. 
    I think that decision, the Court's decision in Richmond and Pleasant Grove has already decided that issue and, indeed, since it was stipulated that it didn't even have the effect of retrogression, you can obviously assume they didn't have the purpose to retrogress, and this would have been a one-paragraph opinion.

    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    So if everybody agrees on that, if everybody agrees that the purpose is really the purpose to cause discrimination, not just the purpose not to retrogress, if everybody agrees at least sometimes a lot of this section 2 evidence in this case would be relevant, if not dispositive... not necessarily dispositive but relevant to showing that, and all we're arguing about is how ambiguous the district court's opinion is, why don't we just send it back to the district court to work it out and say, be clear, take it into account and do it?
speaker="michael_a_carvin" startTime="1853.334" stopTime="2000.913">
    Mr. Michael A. Carvin 
    There is no dispute as to what the district court did. 
    Appellants have now changed their opinion as to the legal standard applying. 
    Let me proceed in two steps. 
    The district court, in analyzing whether or not two nonretrogressive plans reflect discriminatory purposes, compares the maximizing alternative to the plan adopted and again asks, do we have a legitimate, nondiscriminatory purpose? 
    There is an impact here. 
    One's got black majority districts, one does not. 
    Now, what the appellants are asking the district court to do is, after they've figured out whether that impact is motivated by a discriminating purpose, go ahead and analyze racial bloc voting. 
    Well, what would that show you? 
    All racial bloc voting is relevant to is whether the black majority districts have an impact. 
    If you have no racial bloc voting, if you have no history of discrimination that currently excludes blacks, then there's no difference, as this Court noted in Johnson v. DeGrandy, between white majority districts and black majority districts. 
    Blacks can be elected in both districts. 
    So if the district court had gone on this detour that appellants insist they... insist it do, and agreed with them entirely, it would have returned to precisely the place it started, which is, yes, the NAACP plan, the failure to adopt it has an impact, but the relevant question under section 5 is whether that was motivated by a discriminatory purpose. 
    You see, all of the confusion comes here is because they keep quoting cases where plaintiffs, minority plaintiffs have the burden and, of course, in section 5 the burden is reversed. 
    So yes, in Rogers v. Lodge and Gingles and all of those cases, plaintiffs must prove racial bloc voting. 
    They must prove that you can create a compact black majority district, and then they must show that the failure to do so has an effect, and as Justice Brennan noted quite clearly in Gingles, it only has an effect if there is racial bloc voting. 
    So that is plaintiff's burden and, if they had the burden in the court below, they would have had to show that, but we had the burden, and we were making a much simpler argument. 
    We were saying, fine, the plan has an impact, but that's not the reason it did it... didn't... took the police jury plan over the NAACP plan. 
    We took the police jury plan over the NAACP plan because the NAACP plan clearly and irretrievably violated State law.

    Justice Antonin Scalia

    It said, I am considering evidence that is relevant to purpose. 
    No, Your Honor, it didn't say what it's implicit assumptions were, just like this Court in Miller. 
    This Court in Miller analyzed a section 5 purpose case, and it compared the legitimate nondiscriminatory reasons for adopting the plan with less majority black districts than the plan with more majority black districts. 
    The Justice Department in that brief urged upon them to... in this Court to independently consider the stark evidence of racial bloc voting in Georgia and the history of discrimination and all those sorts of things.

    The court summarizes the argument that it's responding to. 
    Defendant argues that even if we decide that a section 2 action cannot be brought in a section 5 preclearance proceeding, we must still consider evidence of a section 2 violation as evidence of discriminatory purpose under section 5. 
    Again, we disagree. 
    As we have said, the statutory language sets forth differing standards for the two sections. 
    Isn't that, when read in relation to the quote that I started from, the bloc vote from the earlier opinion, isn't that a pretty clear indication that what the court was finding was, or assuming was, not that this evidence was cumulative or superfluous, but that it was irrelevant?

    Justice David H. Souter

    Mr. Michael A. Carvin 
    --Right. 
    You must still consider evidence of a section 2 violation. 
    Now, that means that section 5 courts trying to figure out the purpose of this discrete change must engage in the amorphous and very complicated analysis of whether... not, the change is purposefully discriminatory, but whether the underlying electoral system has the result of discriminating.

    Mr. Michael A. Carvin 
    If the court had said, we are not going to consider evidence that is relevant to both section 2 and section 5, you would be correct. 
    But what the court said was, we'll consider evidence that's relevant to section 5 but not relevant only to a section 2 violation. 
    How do the two statutes differ? 
    One has a purpose standard, and one has a result standard. 
    Some evidence of section--
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="2330.779" stopTime="2332.472">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    No, they both have purpose standards.

    Mr. Michael A. Carvin 
    --Yes, they both have that in common, but how do they differ? 
    They differ because section 2 can be violated wholly without regard to purpose and, therefore, the evidence for a section 2 violation has been consciously constructed to focus the court's inquiry not on the purpose for adopting this plan but on the results of the system, racial bloc voting and those sorts of things, and it was that subset of evidence that the court clearly said was the only evidence it wasn't--
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="2360.139" stopTime="2367.114">
    Justice David H. Souter

    Justice David H. Souter 
    What is your position?

    --We--

    Mr. Michael A. Carvin 
    --It would be relevant but superfluous. 
    Therefore, what section 5 courts should do is not exclude it as a matter of law, but pay attention to it only if it furthers the inquiry. 
    What appellants are asking this Court to do is to rule as a matter of law that they must always consider racial bloc voting, and my question again is, how does that further the analysis? 
    You have just gone through a comparison of a plan that you assume is better for black voters compared to one that you have assumed is not good for black voters, and you've found it is legal because it's not motivated by a discriminatory purpose. 
    Now, you could spend 20 or so pages discussing the extraordinarily voluminous evidence showing that, indeed, plans with black majority districts are better for black voters, but I don't think that this Court as a matter of law should rule that section 5 courts must engage in that sort of thing.

    Mr. Michael A. Carvin

    I didn't think that plan was put forward as a rival to some other plan. 
    This case is not like the one we just heard in that regard. 
    I thought that plan was just put forward to show that it would be possible to create minority districts, not that this was a finished plan that was a rival to some other plan.

    Mr. Michael A. Carvin 
    --Well, whether it was a work in progress or a final plan, the point is that it is stipulated that it is impossible to create even a single black majority district without splitting a precinct, and it is also quite clear from Louisiana--

    Mr. Michael A. Carvin 
    --Yes, and appellants have confused this issue, and it's very important that the Court be clear on it. 
    The police jury had no power under State law to split any precincts. 
    It was a facial violation for the police jury to split a precinct. 
    it was a facial violation for the board to split a precinct. 
    That is on joint appendix at 277.

    Mr. Michael A. Carvin 
    Because from April 1, '91 through May 15, 1991 police juries can split precincts. 
    The board here asked to work with the police jury at that time so they could split the precincts in April and May of 1991. 
    That's stipulated. 
    The police jury rejected the overture. 
    After May 15, 1991, it was impossible for the police jury to split precincts or the board to split precincts, and that is because that window of opportunity that the State legislature had consciously given to police juries so they could account for the '90 redistricting was now gone.

    That's joint appendix 277, Justice Scalia, and it says, notwithstanding any other provision of the law, the precinct boundaries shall not be divided, abolished, consolidated, or the boundaries otherwise changed until after December 31, 1992. 
    Now, could the board have waited until after December 31, 1992 to do its redistricting as appellants contend? 
    The answer to that is found at the joint appendix on page 65. 
    The United States' own chronology of events states quite explicitly at the top of 65, 12/31/92... of course, the same date... date under Louisiana law by which school boards must reapportion. 
    So during the time that the school board was legally obliged to reapportion, the police jury and the board were legally prohibited from splitting a single precinct.

speaker="michael_a_carvin" startTime="2956.579" stopTime="3027.568">
    Mr. Michael A. Carvin 
    It is highly relevant. 
    The court looked at the NAACP as an alternative, and then asked itself the question, the proportionate plan, was this alternative objectively reasonable, and was the board's rejection of it motivated by discriminatory purpose, and in doing so, just to eliminate any ambiguity on this, it went through precisely the analysis that this Court articulated in Arlington Heights. 
    It did not cite Arlington Heights by name, I agree. 
    The court had noted earlier on in its opinion citing cases where minority plaintiffs have the burden makes it confusing when you're dealing with a section 5 case where, of course, the burden is on the other side, so it cited this Court's voting rights cases of City of Richmond and McCain v. Lybrand, the purpose cases under section 5. 
    But if I could briefly go through the Arlington Heights factors, did it look at the specific sequence of events? 
    There is a heading in the court's opinion that says, we'll now look at the specific sequence of events. 
    Did it look at the contemporary statements of the affected board members? 
    It spends about two pages walking through what it ultimately concluded were these ambiguous statements by other board members.

    Mr. Carvin, I take it from what you said that you do accept that Arlington Heights is a relevant precedent.
speaker="michael_a_carvin" startTime="3032.410" stopTime="3032.771">
    Mr. Michael A. Carvin 
    Sure.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="3032.771" stopTime="3038.535">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Right, so you think that it was just so understood that the district court didn't need to mention it.
speaker="michael_a_carvin" startTime="3038.535" stopTime="3055.635">
    Mr. Michael A. Carvin 
    Your Honor, to be candid, I don't think what people look at, what district courts look at in discriminatory purpose cases is a very complicated inquiry. 
    I mean, I think they looked at the direct and circumstantial evidence of, why did the board do this, and do we believe them, and is it objectively reasonable?
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="3055.635" stopTime="3060.948">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    The factors of Arlington Heights are not so arcane. 
    If you asked somebody on the street, what would you look at, he'd probably come up with the same things.
speaker="michael_a_carvin" startTime="3060.948" stopTime="3084.414">
    Mr. Michael A. Carvin 
    So I really must insist that the appellants here are really seeking to elevate form over substance. 
    They're seeking to require district courts to recite the blazingly obvious. 
    We're now looking at the black majority district, and we're looking at the other plan. 
    The black majority plan, if it's not chosen, has an impact. 
    The court didn't do that in Miller. 
    I don't know of any purpose case that does--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="3084.414" stopTime="3100.805">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    If the appellants' argument is that the findings were clearly erroneous because there was so much other evidence pointing in the other direction, that isn't requiring the district court to put its opinion in some sort of procrustean bed. 
    That's an ordinary clearly erroneous argument.
speaker="michael_a_carvin" startTime="3100.805" stopTime="3171.872">
    Mr. Michael A. Carvin 
    --Oh, sure, and... but I don't think they think they can win the clearly erroneous argument, because no race-blind actor would have behaved in any way different from this board. 
    Again, the NAACP plan violated State law. 
    The police jury plan did not. 
    Even assuming there was this loophole that appellants talked about, you could only make the NAACP comply with State law by going to the police jury, taking some affirmative steps. 
    The argument to the police jury for complying with State law would have been objectively irrational. 
    It would have been, we'd now like you to create 65 additional precincts in a district with 56 precincts. 
    No rational person would have taken the NAACP plan if you were blind to the racial composition, so their clearly erroneous case reduces to the proposition that it's not plausible to believe that this board did the only rational thing for rational reasons. 
    You must conclude, as a matter of law, that this board did the rational thing for a racial purpose. 
    I concede that that is conceivable, but I don't think it's grounds for finding the district court's contrary conclusion clearly erroneous, particularly since, again, it was a facial violation.

    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Why was it rational to set up school districts with some districts that had a few schools, several schools, and some districts that had no schools at all? 
    It just seems a very odd kind of a school districting.
speaker="michael_a_carvin" startTime="3185.110" stopTime="3214.329">
    Mr. Michael A. Carvin 
    Your Honor, school districts represents parents and children, they don't represent buildings. 
    It was never a redistricting criteria in Bossier Parish to have a school building in each district. 
    Mrs. Jackson's testimony below was that under the 1980 plan, the old plan, she did not have a building in her district. 
    It is stipulated that well before the NAACP plan ever came into existence they did not provide their cartographer, Mr. Joiner, with school attendance zones, so--
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="3214.329" stopTime="3217.750">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    But I thought that was one of the reasons why they were resisting the jury police--

    Mr. Michael A. Carvin

speaker="michael_a_carvin" startTime="3218.772" stopTime="3237.833">
    Mr. Michael A. Carvin 
    --That is what the appellants are attributing to them, and there is a stipulation that school boards typically look at that, but the undisputed evidence is, this school board did not care about that, and we know that to a certainty, because it didn't give their line-drawer any evidence of where the school buildings were, so--

    Mr. Michael A. Carvin 
    --And the incumbency paled in significance to the advantages of the police jury plan for guaranteeing preclearance. 
    Pairs of incumbents are, of course, only a problem if both incumbents are going to run again. 
    There was two pairs of incumbents here.

   Rebuttal of Deval L. Patrick

    Mr. Deval L. Patrick 
    Thank you, and if the... Mr. Chief Justice, if the Court please, I'd just like to return to a question I didn't answer very well from Justice O'Connor. 
    You asked about cases where the Court has, in the section 5 context, reflected its respect for the Arlington Heights standards, and they... those cases are cited... they're beyond Rogers v. Lodge. 
    They're cited in the first full paragraph on page 17 of our brief. 
    I'm sorry it wasn't very complete earlier. 
    Also, there was a statement made about precinct changes and precinct-splitting that was... has been argued by the parish. 
    In fact, precincts could be split, indeed, were split by the police jury. 
    They split 20 precincts. 
    You'll see that on... stipulated at 88a and 88... 89a. 
    The only argument is, the only--
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="3316.568" stopTime="3322.051">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    Did they do that within the window that the legislature gave them?
speaker="deval_l_patrick" startTime="3322.051" stopTime="3339.141">
    Mr. Deval L. Patrick 
    --I believe they did, yes, and the only argument, Justice Kennedy, is that the school board could not split precincts without the police jury's permission. 
    The school board never tried to get the police jury's permission. 
    They expected to do so. 
    They set out to draw a different plan--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="3339.141" stopTime="3346.607">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    No, the argument's a little further than that, as I understood the last argument. 
    That is, even the police jury itself could not do it once the window of opportunity had closed.
speaker="deval_l_patrick" startTime="3346.607" stopTime="3354.802">
    Mr. Deval L. Patrick 
    --Well, but the window of opportunity opens again on... after the 1st of January, 1993, and that's important. 
    That was known to the school board at the time--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="3354.802" stopTime="3360.606">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    But they had... but again, the argument made was that they had an obligation to come up with districts before then.
speaker="deval_l_patrick" startTime="3360.606" stopTime="3366.170">
    Mr. Deval L. Patrick 
    --Well, that's right. 
    They... I understand that argument, but what we do know is that--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="3366.170" stopTime="3368.200">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Is it wrong? 
    Did they have no obligation to come up with--
speaker="deval_l_patrick" startTime="3368.200" stopTime="3448.944">
    Mr. Deval L. Patrick 
    --I'm not convinced it's right, Justice Scalia, but what is clear is that consolidation after the window opened again has happened in Bossier Parish. 
    It was done by the police jury and could have been done, and indeed the record indicates that the school board could have drawn a plan with two majority-minority districts in it that ended up with fewer precincts in it than the police jury plan. 
    The other point I wanted to make is that the Court needs to understand that this is not a choice. 
    This case is not about a choice between the plan they adopted and the NAACP alternative. 
    That is a... that's a ruse. 
    It's very important to understand that this is about the school board's unwillingness to consider any alternative at all to the plan that they knew at the time was dilutive, and which they admit on the record at the time they knew they could have drawn one with two reasonably compact majority-minority districts. 
    It is not maximizing for the Department of Justice to question a jurisdiction that draws a plan which hardly serves its own interests, that pits incumbents against each other, that distributes the schools in irrational ways, and is dilutive, rather than adopting a plan that is fair, and that is really what this case is about.
