Robinson v. Shell Oil Company

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    We will hear argument next in No. 95-1376, Charles T. Robinson, Sr., v. Shell Oil Company. 
    Mr. Lenchek.
speaker="allen_m_lenchek" startTime="21.645" stopTime="128.696">
    Mr. Allen M. Lenchek 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and if it please the Court: 
    This case presents the question: Does the provision of Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act that prohibits retaliation against, quote, employees, unquote, for filing charges of discrimination or otherwise availing themselves of their rights under Title VII... namely Section 704(a)... does that section cover former employees, employees such as Petitioner, Charles Robinson, who were discharged prior to the alleged retaliation? 
    In this case, after Charles Robinson was terminated by Shell Oil, he filed a charge of discrimination against Shell under Title VII, and subsequently, Shell gave him a negative job reference. 
    He then brought the present action, alleging that that negative reference was made in retaliation for his earlier charge of discrimination. 
    The Fourth Circuit held that Charles Robinson was not even entitled to have the court determine whether that reference was retaliatory, because he was not employed by Shell at the time of the reference. 
    If Shell had given him that reference the day before he was terminated, everyone agrees, he would have had that right to a judicial determination.

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well, if you're right, it's... it's a rather sure way to make... make sure you don't get a bad reference; you just file a complaint with the EEOC a couple of days after... or a couple of days before you're fired, even though the firing is completely justified.
speaker="allen_m_lenchek" startTime="144.845" stopTime="153.062">
    Mr. Allen M. Lenchek 
    Well, that is not, in fact, what actually happens.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="153.062" stopTime="180.040">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    No, it may not be what in fact happened in your case, but it certainly might happen in a number of other cases if we sustain your position. 
    Or even if you're not going to be fired, even if you just intend to quit, it would be very wise, before you quit, to file an EEOC complaint. 
    Because then, if... if the employer gives you a bad reference in... in your later job, he takes the risk of being sued for that, on the basis of retaliation. 
    He's buying a lawsuit.
speaker="allen_m_lenchek" startTime="180.040" stopTime="189.794">
    Mr. Allen M. Lenchek 
    There are, in fact, disincentives to frivolous charges built into Title VII, which hopefully would take care of that problem.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="189.794" stopTime="191.985">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Well, what are... what are they?
speaker="allen_m_lenchek" startTime="191.985" stopTime="201.322">
    Mr. Allen M. Lenchek 
    A principal brings a frivolous lawsuit under Title VII may be hit with attorney's fees and costs.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="201.322" stopTime="209.338">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    What about, are there any disincentives to filing a frivolous complaint with the EEOC? 
    Any similar disincentives?
speaker="allen_m_lenchek" startTime="209.338" stopTime="220.385">
    Mr. Allen M. Lenchek 
    There... there are... no, the EEOC can't apply any disincentives like that. 
    That's true. 
    But we believe that the language--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="220.385" stopTime="240.508">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    What other remedies are available to someone who, after he's... he's been terminated, thinks that a reference was erroneously made and given by the former employer? 
    Is there any other action at law that would be open for redress?
speaker="allen_m_lenchek" startTime="240.508" stopTime="246.482">
    Mr. Allen M. Lenchek 
    --There are possible actions under State law.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="246.482" stopTime="247.133">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Right.
speaker="allen_m_lenchek" startTime="247.133" stopTime="341.906">
    Mr. Allen M. Lenchek 
    But it is well established that Title VII is intended to give parallel remedies to any other remedies that may be available. 
    We believe that the language of Title VII, and the purpose of Section 704(a), indicate that Congress intended former employer... employees... to be covered by the retaliatory section. 
    Section 704(a) provides that it shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer to discriminate against any of his employees or applicants for employment because he has opposed the charge or because he has opposed an unlawful practice or because he has made a charge or participated in an EEOC proceeding as a possible witness. 
    I emphasize that Section 704(a) protects an employee who has made a charge, because the substantive provision of Title VII, Section 703(a), cited in full and verbatim in the Respondent's brief at page 14, makes it an unlawful employment practice to discharge any individual because of his race, and so on. 
    An individual--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="341.906" stopTime="344.046">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    And that... that complaint was made here?
speaker="allen_m_lenchek" startTime="344.046" stopTime="345.837">
    Mr. Allen M. Lenchek 
    --That's exactly what happened in this case.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="345.837" stopTime="346.458">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    And... and the plaintiff lost?
speaker="allen_m_lenchek" startTime="346.458" stopTime="364.711">
    Mr. Allen M. Lenchek 
    Right. 
    That's right. 
    Now, an employee who is discharged will necessarily file his charge of discrimination after he ceases working for that employer. 
    So when Congress wrote Section 704(a)--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="364.711" stopTime="369.384">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well, he'll file his charge if... if he claims the discharge is discriminatory?
speaker="allen_m_lenchek" startTime="369.384" stopTime="369.713">
    Mr. Allen M. Lenchek 
    --Yes.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="369.713" stopTime="376.167">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    He could... the employee could remain employed and file a complaint that a failure to promote was discriminatory, couldn't he?
speaker="allen_m_lenchek" startTime="376.167" stopTime="407.827">
    Mr. Allen M. Lenchek 
    That's right. 
    But he would remain an employee, and if he were retaliated against because of that charge, he would ordinarily still be an employee and clearly be covered by the Act. 
    The point I want to make is that when Congress wrote this statute, it contemplated that people would file charges alleging that they were discriminatorily discharged--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="407.827" stopTime="414.452">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    It... it's the time of the discrimination that... that... that's relevant for 704(a)--
speaker="allen_m_lenchek" startTime="414.452" stopTime="414.923">
    Mr. Allen M. Lenchek 
    --Exactly.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="414.923" stopTime="417.844">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    --and the person who is fired because he filed a complaint--
speaker="allen_m_lenchek" startTime="417.844" stopTime="418.616">
    Mr. Allen M. Lenchek 
    Exact--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="418.616" stopTime="421.808">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    --was an employee at the time he was fired.
speaker="allen_m_lenchek" startTime="421.808" stopTime="422.687">
    Mr. Allen M. Lenchek 
    --Exactly.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="422.687" stopTime="426.971">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    So he would be... he would be well covered, even if "employee" means only current employee?
speaker="allen_m_lenchek" startTime="426.971" stopTime="438.509">
    Mr. Allen M. Lenchek 
    He would be covered by 7... 703(a). 
    The issue in this case is, if he's no longer an employee at the time of the retaliation, is he covered be the statute?
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="438.509" stopTime="443.321">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Well-- 
    --If he's fired as a means of retal... if he's either not promoted or fired--
speaker="allen_m_lenchek" startTime="443.321" stopTime="444.172">
    Mr. Allen M. Lenchek 
    Of course, if he's--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="444.172" stopTime="445.574">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    --as a means of retaliation--
speaker="allen_m_lenchek" startTime="445.574" stopTime="446.723">
    Mr. Allen M. Lenchek 
    --Of course, that--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="446.723" stopTime="451.177">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    --he would be covered under 704(a), even if 704(a) is just limited to current employees, right?
speaker="allen_m_lenchek" startTime="451.177" stopTime="451.548">
    Mr. Allen M. Lenchek 
    --That's right.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="451.548" stopTime="452.266">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Okay.
speaker="allen_m_lenchek" startTime="452.266" stopTime="452.657">
    Mr. Allen M. Lenchek 
    That's right.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="452.657" stopTime="453.188">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    So--
speaker="allen_m_lenchek" startTime="453.188" stopTime="501.520">
    Mr. Allen M. Lenchek 
    But the point I want to make is that Congress knew that people would be subject to retaliation under 704(a) when they were no longer employees, because there would be people who file charges alleging that they were discharged because of race and so on, and those people would necessarily be no longer employees at the time they might be retaliated against. 
    So Congress must have contemplated that people who would be firing... fired, would be filing charges and then might be retaliated against when they were no longer employees.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="501.520" stopTime="509.435">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    --Well, do we have to look at the definition in the applicable section here of the word "employee"? 
    Is that how we should proceed?
speaker="allen_m_lenchek" startTime="509.435" stopTime="519.302">
    Mr. Allen M. Lenchek 
    Un... unfortunately, that definition has... this Court has said that definition doesn't help us much--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="519.302" stopTime="527.187">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Well, the definition says the term "employee" means an individual employed by an employer. 
    And that is ambiguous in your view?
speaker="allen_m_lenchek" startTime="527.187" stopTime="529.157">
    Mr. Allen M. Lenchek 
    --Well, this Court--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="529.157" stopTime="533.321">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    It could include former employees, a person employed?
speaker="allen_m_lenchek" startTime="533.321" stopTime="548.293">
    Mr. Allen M. Lenchek 
    --That is precisely what we're saying. 
    Because, as the Court has said in Darden, that definition is a circular definition, which doesn't help much in deciding who is an employee. 
    And as--
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="548.293" stopTime="551.245">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    --a purpose that's not relevant in this--

    Mr. Allen M. Lenchek 
    --That's right.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="553.746" stopTime="559.681">

    --a traditional common-law type employee versus an independent contractor.

    That--
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="560.332" stopTime="565.845">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    So it's not... it's not circular for that purpose, but it just doesn't speak to what's at here?
speaker="allen_m_lenchek" startTime="565.845" stopTime="585.617">
    Mr. Allen M. Lenchek 
    --That's right. 
    But as... as Your Honor pointed out in the earlier argument, a word in a statute may have different meanings in different... different parts of the statute, and one must look at the purpose of the statute to decide what that particular meaning is in a given place in the statute.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="585.617" stopTime="607.101">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    Well, I understand it to be your position that the... circular though the... the definition may be, it is helpful to you in the sense that it is as consistent with the reading, who was employed by an employer, as with the reading, who is employed by an employer. 
    So... so you're still in the game, even though the word "employed" is the modifier.
speaker="allen_m_lenchek" startTime="607.101" stopTime="608.251">
    Mr. Allen M. Lenchek 
    That's right.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="608.251" stopTime="608.511">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    That's your argument?
speaker="allen_m_lenchek" startTime="608.511" stopTime="609.192">
    Mr. Allen M. Lenchek 
    That is exactly right.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="609.192" stopTime="609.783">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    Yeah.
speaker="allen_m_lenchek" startTime="609.783" stopTime="649.040">
    Mr. Allen M. Lenchek 
    And... and in order to decide which of the multiple meanings the word "employee" has in this statute, one must look to the purpose of the statute. 
    And the purpose of the statute, obviously, is to protect those people who get discharged and then file charges of discrimination, and may be subject to retaliation. 
    And Congress clearly contemplated that those people would making charges, would be subject to retaliation, and wrote the retaliation provision, using the simple--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="649.040" stopTime="677.527">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Why should Congress contemplate that? 
    I would... if I were a congressman, I would have had a hard time figuring out how an employer could retaliate against somebody who is no longer an employee. 
    He could retaliate by refusing to rehire the guy, perhaps. 
    But, in that case, he's covered, because he would be an applicant for employment. 
    But the notion that he could retaliate once... once the employ... employment relationship is terminated... I mean, I guess he could... he could send somebody over to... to mug him or something like that, but-- 
    --How about cutting off his pension benefits?
speaker="allen_m_lenchek" startTime="677.527" stopTime="678.178">
    Mr. Allen M. Lenchek 
    --That's right.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="678.178" stopTime="681.371">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Well, that... surely that would be unlawful, wouldn't it?
speaker="allen_m_lenchek" startTime="681.371" stopTime="683.371">
    Mr. Allen M. Lenchek 
    No question about it; this Court has said so.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="683.371" stopTime="687.752">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Well, would... would you need this Act to... to prevent his... that's like sending somebody over to mug him.
speaker="allen_m_lenchek" startTime="687.752" stopTime="689.815">
    Mr. Allen M. Lenchek 
    Yes, one does need this Act.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="689.815" stopTime="691.015">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    You don't have to worry about that? 
    You have laws against it.
speaker="allen_m_lenchek" startTime="691.015" stopTime="765.273">
    Mr. Allen M. Lenchek 
    Yes, one does need this Act. 
    In Arizona Governing Committee, which was cited in Hishon, which we cite in our case, this Court said that cutting off pension benefits or discriminating with regard to pension benefits on the basis of sex was a violation of the substantive provision of Title VII. 
    The reason one needs this Act is because, if an employer chose to cut off pension benefits as a retaliatory measure, and then were... was... was charged under the substantive provision of Title VII... the claim would be you cut off my pension benefits because I'm black... the employer then... if this Court upholds the Fourth Circuit... could come in and use the fact that it was motivated by retaliation as an affirmative defense to the charge that it was motivated by sex or race. 
    If this Court upholds the Fourth Circuit, an employer will have carte blanche to retaliate against discharged employees. 
    As a matter of fact--
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="765.273" stopTime="797.243">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    I'm not sure... I'm not sure, in the context of a pension or a bonus, that there is not a sufficient ongoing relation, so that the discrimination that you are hypothesizing would be against an employee, even though the employee has been terminated. 
    I think there still are certain subsisting relations between the... the individual and the employer, one of which is entitlements to pension, which would mean that he's an employee for that purpose.
speaker="allen_m_lenchek" startTime="797.243" stopTime="815.957">
    Mr. Allen M. Lenchek 
    --Yes, Justice Kennedy, that's right. 
    That would take care of... of that one particular class. 
    But there's a broader class that would not be covered if this Court upheld the Fourth Circuit. 
    And that is all those people who have no remaining relationship with that employer. 
    And if the Court upholds the Fourth Circuit--
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="815.957" stopTime="822.452">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    I... I was... I was just directing my... my comments to the pension and bonus example.

speaker="allen_m_lenchek" startTime="822.452" stopTime="856.192">
    Mr. Allen M. Lenchek 
    --Yes. 
    But consider... consider what Shell Oil or any employer could do if this Court upholds the Fourth Circuit. 
    The day after this Court hands down its decision, Shell Oil could announce a policy that any terminated employee who then later files a charge of discrimination against the company will be subject to retaliation. 
    We will retaliate against you. 
    We will cut off your pension, if you have one. 
    We will cut off your health benefits, if you have--

    Mr. Paul R. Q. Wolfson 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    Under the Court of Appeals reading of Section 704(a), any employee who was discharged and who went to the EEOC with a complaint of discrimination would lack protection against his former employer for... for... against retaliation by his former employer. 
    I want to focus for a minute on why that seems just to be implausible that Congress would have carved out such a large category of employees from the reach of Section 704, especially since discharged employees are probably among the... the category of employees that are really--

    Because the--

    It--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="1137.148" stopTime="1144.675">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    So all we're arguing about is whether one of the limitations is a limitation between present employer and former employer.
speaker="paul_r_q_wolfson" startTime="1144.675" stopTime="1222.574">
    Mr. Paul R. Q. Wolfson 
    --Right, present employer and... and former employer. 
    And... but it's not... but it isn't just references that... that is at issue. 
    I mean, Justice Kennedy had a colloquy... a colloquy earlier about the... the... the problem of pension benefits. 
    Contesting an unemployment claim is a situation that you would... might see. 
    And the Court, in the sixties, had a case called Nash against Florida Unemployment Commission, where it said that, under the NLRA, that contesting an unemployment claim could be prohibited retaliation under the National Labor Relations Act. 
    And that, I think, is a... a situation that one might very well expect to see. 
    Somebody quits or is fired, believes that he was discharged, went to the EEOC, filed an unemployment claim, and, immediately thereafter, the employer decides, well, this one we'll contest, even though most unemployment claims for compensation we let go because it isn't worth it, because we're just... we're mad at the employee for filing a claim of discrimination. 
    And references are also, I think, a situation where an employee might very well find that he receives an adverse reference or he receives no reference in all... at all... an employee... an employer might normally have a practice of saying, well, we... we say reasonably nice things about our employees once they've gone, but... but did he... because this one has filed a discrimination charge, this one, if we get any requests for a reference, we're just going to pitch the request in the bin and not say anything at... at all. 
    That could be--

    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    --But, Mr. Wolfson, may I ask you a question right there? 
    One of the troubling things about the case is, even assuming a former employee may be an employee within the meaning of the statute, can file a charge and so forth, is it clear that the employer can discriminate against a former employee? 
    Why is it discrimination?
speaker="paul_r_q_wolfson" startTime="1280.731" stopTime="1314.373">
    Mr. Paul R. Q. Wolfson 
    --Well, it doesn't say... the statute doesn't say specifically... 704, unlike 703, doesn't say discrimination in the terms, conditions or privileges of employment. 
    It just says discrimination. 
    But I would... but even if... even if that's not the case, I certainly would think that failing to give a reference or giving an adverse reference... if... if a reference is under the normal course of what an employer does for his employees once the employees leave the... leave the company... if that... if an employer decides, for one employee, because he's filed an EEO charge, I'm going to treat him differently--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1314.373" stopTime="1323.149">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Yeah, but their policy assumes to tell the truth in all... in all... you know, whether they like the employee or not, they say, we didn't like this guy... that's discrimination?

    Mr. Paul R. Q. Wolfson 
    --on the... on... not to affect a reference because the employee filed an EEOC charge. 
    One of the things, though, is that this... this is something that it doesn't really turn on just former... it doesn't turn on former and current employees. 
    That is, the lower court says... it pointed out that giving someone an adverse reference as retaliation for filing an EEO charge is some... something that a current employee could bring also. 
    So it doesn't... whatever problems there may be with what is retaliation, and is giving an adverse reference, you know, quote, you know, discrimination, or is it in... as retaliation? 
    It... it doesn't... it's not directly addressed to the analytical question in this case. 
    And I don't think the Court has to reach any of the... the specific, difficult issue... the difficult issues that might arise on any specific factual circumstances about, you know, would a bad reference be a retaliation in a particular case? 
    Turning to the question of employee, our position is that employee is... is susceptible of... of two meanings, and one... and certainly including former employee.

    You are saying, commonly, people know that they're on their way out, and so they start looking around for a job earlier. 
    So, the... exactly, the employer is... faces the same problem with respect to references for people who are currently on the work force, but they didn't get the promotion, so they're just biding their time till they get a new job.

    No, I don't.

    It does serve a purpose: to distinguish between individuals and employees. 
    I think that that distinction between the two is very apparent when you look at Section 703. 
    If you look at Section 703(a), which is at page 14 of my brief, you can see that "employee", or "employment", is a status that is obtained by an individual.

    Yes.

    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    --who happens to be a former employee. 
    But the statute identifies that individual as "employee", and everybody knows that "employee"... the word "employee", in that statute, means former employee.

    Mr. Lawrence C. Butler 
    I... I disagree with the construction, because I do think it depends on when you have to identify the employee. 
    Now, the words are the same. 
    It is used the same. 
    But I would add something else, Justice Ginsburg--
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="1736.714" stopTime="1742.969">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    When the statute says an employee may file a charge within X number of days--

    Mr. Lawrence C. Butler 
    --Right.

    Mr. Lawrence C. Butler 
    It can mean either... it can mean an employee at the time the event occurred. 
    Also, under 703--
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="1754.706" stopTime="1764.803">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    Yeah, but the person who's filling out the form, at the time he fills out the form is what the statute is talking about. 
    And at the time he fills out the form, he's not an employee; isn't that correct?

    Mr. Lawrence C. Butler

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    But that's a different argument. 
    And I don't know why you don't make that argument, that... that it can mean other things in... in other contexts, but in this context it doesn't. 
    I really think you're taking on a terrible burden, to say that it always and everywhere means a current employee. 
    It quite obviously doesn't.
speaker="lawrence_c_butler" startTime="1785.167" stopTime="1814.506">
    Mr. Lawrence C. Butler 
    Your Honor, I do accept that argument. 
    But I would point out there is an additional word that I think does bear looking at under Section 704. 
    Employers are told that they are responsible for his employees. 
    And I think if you go... if you take the common usage of that term and you go to any employer in this country, and you say, for whatever purpose, you're responsible for your employees... his employees... no one is going to assume that, well, gee, I guess that means I'm responsible for Joe Blow who works for me--

    --Exactly.

    Certainly.

    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Mr. Butler, I... I know there's an answer to this, and I'm really asking you for help on it. 
    In 704 that's quoted on page 4 of your text, there's also reference to discriminating against any individual.
speaker="lawrence_c_butler" startTime="1846.176" stopTime="1846.847">
    Mr. Lawrence C. Butler 
    That's right.

    Why--
speaker="lawrence_c_butler" startTime="1848.056" stopTime="1850.408">
    Mr. Lawrence C. Butler 
    That's because if you look at who that--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1850.408" stopTime="1852.461">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    --That can't be right.
speaker="lawrence_c_butler" startTime="1852.461" stopTime="1860.396">
    Mr. Lawrence C. Butler 
    --affects, the "individual" language is used for employment agencies. 
    So if an employment agency... I'm sorry, I'm looking at 703--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1860.396" stopTime="1864.629">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    You mean, it refers back... it says for--
speaker="lawrence_c_butler" startTime="1864.629" stopTime="1883.459">
    Mr. Lawrence C. Butler 
    --Yeah, I'm sorry. 
    Right. 
    It... it... it does relate to employment agencies, joint labor management committees. 
    Well, certainly the person would not be an employee of the agency or the labor management committee or other training programs. 
    That's why they have to use the word "individual" there. 
    But I think it's telling that they didn't use "individual" throughout.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="1883.459" stopTime="1892.816">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    --Well, it's not all that telling. 
    Because "individual" is a lot broader than "present and former employee".
speaker="lawrence_c_butler" startTime="1892.816" stopTime="1893.627">
    Mr. Lawrence C. Butler 
    Yes.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="1893.627" stopTime="1901.462">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    I mean, you can... you could want "employee" to include former employees without wishing it to include everybody in the world, former employee or not.
speaker="lawrence_c_butler" startTime="1901.462" stopTime="1912.839">
    Mr. Lawrence C. Butler 
    That's... that's certainly true. 
    And I think the point there is that it demonstrates that 704 is a narrowly constructed statute. 
    It is not even--
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="1912.839" stopTime="1944.900">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Mr. Butler, would it cover a case where an applicant... an employee... current employee... doesn't get the promotion and is... stays on the payroll, continues to work, but is looking for another job; in the course of that job search, gets a reference which that employee says is retaliatory? 
    Such a person would have both the discrimination claim, the 703 claim and the retaliation claim, right?
speaker="lawrence_c_butler" startTime="1944.900" stopTime="1945.531">
    Mr. Lawrence C. Butler 
    --That's right.

    It may be a baseless claim, it may be a frivolous claim, but he has it?
speaker="lawrence_c_butler" startTime="1949.334" stopTime="1950.646">
    Mr. Lawrence C. Butler 
    That's correct.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="1950.646" stopTime="1985.338">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    So, now, let me go back to the question that I was putting before to Mr. Wolfson. 
    Doesn't that scenario mean that the employer, once he doesn't give the promotion to this person, should say, And you're out, because if the employer keeps the person on for any interval, then the employer is subject to retaliation charge; but the employer can insulate the company from any retaliation charge by saying, if we don't promote this person, they're out the door... we don't keep them on?
speaker="lawrence_c_butler" startTime="1985.338" stopTime="1996.193">
    Mr. Lawrence C. Butler 
    I would... I would agree with you to this extent: That once the employment is over, yes, 704 does not apply. 
    If the employment relationship is ongoing, yes, it does apply.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="1996.193" stopTime="2000.167">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    So the incentive for the employer, of your reading, is get rid of the person?
speaker="lawrence_c_butler" startTime="2000.167" stopTime="2001.617">
    Mr. Lawrence C. Butler 
    Yeah.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="2001.617" stopTime="2004.418">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Then we insulate ourself, at least from the retaliation charge?
speaker="lawrence_c_butler" startTime="2004.418" stopTime="2010.142">
    Mr. Lawrence C. Butler 
    To the extent an employer is motivated by a desire to give negative references, I'd agree with that. 
    But that's a little--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="2010.142" stopTime="2019.139">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Well, he doesn't have to fire him. 
    He could just... he could just tell him, I'll... I'll write you a letter but... but not now. 
    My policy is to write reference letters after you've left the company.
speaker="lawrence_c_butler" startTime="2019.139" stopTime="2020.511">
    Mr. Lawrence C. Butler 
    --Sure.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="2020.511" stopTime="2026.695">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    That... that would handle the problem, wouldn't it? 
    You don't have to fire him; just say, I... I don't give any reference letters for anybody while you're still employed here.
speaker="lawrence_c_butler" startTime="2026.695" stopTime="2068.563">
    Mr. Lawrence C. Butler 
    That's correct. 
    I do think that the statute does contain a bright-line test. 
    And that bright line is whether or not you have an employment relationship. 
    I listened with great interest to the case that was argued just before mine. 
    And what interested me was not whether or not the Court decides between the payroll plan or the day-by-day plan and counting the number of employees, but the fact that each of the speakers in this morning's argument said that, at least to be an employee under that section of the statute, you had to have an ongoing employment relationship. 
    And I couldn't agree more. 
    You cannot have an ongoing employment relationship... and if you do not have an ongoing employment relationship, I don't see how you can be covered by the statute.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2068.563" stopTime="2077.228">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    But, of course, there, in... in the previous case, the test was whether a small employer is covered. 
    And that's probably a narrower definition of "employee" than someone who is entitled to sue under... under the Act.
speaker="lawrence_c_butler" startTime="2077.228" stopTime="2088.755">
    Mr. Lawrence C. Butler 
    That's certainly true. 
    But I do think that it... it's a strained argument to suggest that "employee" means different things in different places within the Act. 
    And to... for the EEOC to insist--
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="2088.755" stopTime="2100.704">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    Yeah, but you've just admitted that. 
    I mean, in response to Justice Scalia's attempt to help you out, you said, Well, yeah, that's right; I'd accept that argument. 
    [Laughter] 
    You're... you're not going to... you're not going to kick him now, are you?
speaker="lawrence_c_butler" startTime="2100.704" stopTime="2111.650">
    Mr. Lawrence C. Butler 
    --Perhaps I should have accepted his help. 
    [Laughter] 
    But I think that the test that has been established--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="2111.650" stopTime="2114.873">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    You're sowing all sorts of dissension in the Court here, you know. 
    [Laughter]
speaker="lawrence_c_butler" startTime="2114.873" stopTime="2147.093">
    Mr. Lawrence C. Butler 
    --I think the test that has been established does make some sense... not that I'm trying to divine the will of Congress from 32 years ago. 
    I don't think any of us can do that. 
    But the point that you brought up, Justice O'Connor, about there being other remedies available under common law, is certainly true in this instance in particular. 
    And in fact, it seems to be a burgeoning area of the law for the States to enact employment reference statutes that protect both the employee and an ability to get an employment reference and the employer, to protect them against frivolous claims.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="2147.093" stopTime="2169.216">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Mr. Butler, assuming... and I think we would all recognize that your interpretation is a reasonable one. 
    If one also thinks that the EEOC's interpretation is a reasonable one, without giving any undue deference, shouldn't the Court respect the agency that is administering the statute day in and day out?
speaker="lawrence_c_butler" startTime="2169.216" stopTime="2194.285">
    Mr. Lawrence C. Butler 
    Well, I would disagree in this case certainly, Your Honor. 
    I think that the reason for that is because the EEOC position, the petitioner's position, is not supported by the statutory language. 
    I mean, it's all well and good to speak about the policies and purposes of the Act, but Congress doesn't pass declarations of policy. 
    It doesn't pass resolutions of purpose. 
    It passes statutes. 
    And we have to read the statute to see what it is they wanted to do.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="2194.285" stopTime="2199.646">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    But the word "employed by" can mean past tense or present, I suppose?
speaker="lawrence_c_butler" startTime="2199.646" stopTime="2210.225">
    Mr. Lawrence C. Butler 
    If you want to look at it from a linguist's standpoint, I think that's absolutely true. 
    But statutes aren't passed for linguists; they're passed for ordinary citizens. 
    And if we accept--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="2210.225" stopTime="2215.087">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Well, I don't know. 
    This Court gets pretty picky sometimes about what language-- 
    [Laughter]
speaker="lawrence_c_butler" startTime="2215.087" stopTime="2235.580">
    Mr. Lawrence C. Butler 
    --I think if you... if you try to analyze the language into whether it's active or passive voice, and whether it's past or present tense, you completely lose sight of what any ordinary individual would read when they read 704... that an employer cannot do certain things to his employees.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="2235.580" stopTime="2260.128">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Yes. 
    But if you go back to the... if you go back to the pension example, there are some pension plans that allow disability benefits or, say, benefits based on length of service and so forth. 
    And the disability plans will often require a medical examination to qualify for that particular benefit. 
    And you're suggesting that the company could say to the doctor, black former employees, find them not disabled, but doctors, of others employees, they could. 
    And that doesn't seem likely to fit into the scheme of the statute.
speaker="lawrence_c_butler" startTime="2260.128" stopTime="2264.539">
    Mr. Lawrence C. Butler 
    I... I would say it would be highly illegal, but not necessarily under this Act.

speaker="lawrence_c_butler" startTime="2294.148" stopTime="2337.966">
    Mr. Lawrence C. Butler 
    I find the statute, alone, impenetrable, so the legislative history, I doubt it'd be any help. 
    I would conclude, Your Honor, by suggesting that a strained interpretation or, in fact, really, a rewording of 704 is what the petitioner is asking for... to include terms that were not included when this Act was passed 32 years ago. 
    And if you do that, then you will lead to absurd results. 
    It will create is disincentive for employers to ever issue any reference. 
    They'd either issue no references, all good references, or all bad references. 
    Because if they do anything else, they're setting themselves up for a claim of retaliation by anyone who had previously filed a charge, valid or not.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="2337.966" stopTime="2350.115">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    That's true. 
    But as... as... as Justice Ginsburg points out, that problem isn't... isn't entirely solved by how we come out on this case. 
    Because you do have the problem of references for current employees. 
    And... and you do subject yourself--
speaker="lawrence_c_butler" startTime="2350.115" stopTime="2350.706">

    Mr. Lawrence C. Butler 
    That's true.

speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="2356.839" stopTime="2360.322">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    No, you don't even have to show that.

    So you don't... so you're putting out that this is a problem... yes, it's a problem, but the problem doesn't depend upon whether former employees are covered. 
    The problem exists for current employees.

    I mean, suppose I run a very small business and... and somebody... what happens is what happens here... somebody files a... a discrimination complaint that is totally groundless. 
    I don't fire the individual, because I'm... I'm afraid that that'll be considered retaliation.

    Mr. Lawrence C. Butler 
    Exactly right. 
    The words VII, so it is... it's different. 
    You know, you don't need to look any further than the facts of this case to see what types of results can accrue. 
    Because we have tried the discrimination case. 
    And as part of the discrimination case, we had to prove... I had to put on evidence that showed all of the events that form the basis for the discharge.

    Mr. Lawrence C. Butler 
    Absolutely. 
    And that's what Justice Motts... Judge Motts, in Baltimore, ruled, that there was no discrimination. 
    We put on that evidence and, in effect, proved the reasons for discharging the individual.

    Not discrimination on the basis of sex or religion or national origin, but, rather, discrimination on the basis of having filed a charge or participated in a proceeding. 
    Now, but I do think that I'd be entitled to collateral estoppel effect for the evidence that was put on, on the events themselves that led to the discharge. 
    Well, those events were the basis for giving a bad employment reference.

    And he is an odious and hateful person. 
    All right.

speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="2756.075" stopTime="2769.284">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    So you have to convince a jury that this is not only true, but that the real reason you wrote that letter was... was what... I don't know... to be helpful to the new employer, rather than to retaliate against this fellow you've called hateful and odious?
speaker="lawrence_c_butler" startTime="2769.284" stopTime="2773.136">
    Mr. Lawrence C. Butler 
    Exactly right.

    Mr. Lawrence C. Butler 
    --That's true. 
    That's true. 
    So, you know, even though we have proved the truth of the underlying basis, that truth forms no defense, absolute, against a claim of retaliation under 704(a).

    It precludes that?

    Mr. Lawrence C. Butler 
    That's correct. 
    But, Your Honor, I would also point out that that does... the Act itself does give a cause of action to someone caught in that situation. 
    And the Act points them to the direction of the next employer, the prospective employer. 
    Because if the second employer will refuse to hire somebody, will not accept their application in retaliation for having filed a charge or participated in a proceeding, that is a 704--
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="2903.213" stopTime="2934.413">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    But why wouldn't somebody who is not yet an employer retaliate? 
    That... I know that was in your brief, but that seemed to me very strange. 
    The... the employer that has fired a person gives a bad reference, and then your suggesting, well, there may be a claim against the next person who won't hire that person in reliance... I mean as a... as a lawyer, don't you, don't you have a much stronger case against the one who gave the reference, allegedly false, than the one who credited it?

    Mr. Lawrence C. Butler 
    I... I would think not. 
    But... you know, it wasn't extensively discussed in any of the briefs, but I was struck by an analysis that Chief Justice Toflatt, in the 11th Circuit, wrote in 1990, where he analyzed this whole claim under Court v. Ash, and whether there would be an implied cause of action under that test. 
    And he said there's no conclusion other than it cannot. 
    Because there is a remedy contained within the statute. 
    And what you're doing is trying to broaden that statute for an additional remedy against additional parties. 
    And that's not... you know, that's not what you should be doing, in recognizing a new cause of action. 
    I think the... the language of the statute is very plain. 
    I think it... it's plain to employers, certainly. 
    And we can only assume it was plain to Congress when they wrote it. 
    This Act applies to employees and applicants for employment. 
    It does not apply to anyone else. 
    Those two groups will always be able to claim their rights under 704, regardless of the outcome of this case. 
    But to rewrite this Act to include former employees will only destroy the Act by destroying the certainty of the statute itself. 
    If you rewrite it, then no one will be sure what it means in the future, and to whom it will apply. 
    I think we're best sticking with the bright line. 
    Once the employment is over, any rights under 704 have terminated.
