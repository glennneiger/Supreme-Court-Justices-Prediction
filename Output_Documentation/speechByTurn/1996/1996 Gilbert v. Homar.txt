Gilbert v. Homar

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    We'll hear argument first this morning in Number 96-651, James E. Gilbert v. Richard Homar. 
    Ms. Mosley.
speaker="gwendolyn_t_mosley" startTime="11.888" stopTime="116.787">
    Ms. Gwendolyn T. Mosley 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court: 
    The issue presented in this case is whether due process requires a public employer to provide a hearing in every instance before suspending one of its employees without pay. 
    The Third Circuit held that a Loudermill-type hearing providing for hearing and a notice to be heard must be given to an employee in every case before suspending him without pay, regardless of the reasons for the suspension, regardless of the governmental interests involved, regardless of the purpose to be served, no matter... regarding the substantial assurance of reliability, regardless of the duration of the suspension. 
    We think this is wrong. 
    We think that the better rule is that which was announced in Mallen. 
    In Mallen, the Court said an important governmental interest accompanied by substantial assurance that the deprivation is not without basis may, in limited circumstances, justify the postponement of a hearing until after the deprivation. 
    What we are asking for here is for the Court to make explicit what was suggested in Mallen, that the university's interest in the prompt removal of a police officer arrested for drug-related charges justified Mr. Homar's suspension without a hearing and without pay.

    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    So you would-- 
    --Ms. Mosley-- 
    --Excuse me. 
    --it was my understanding that the Third Circuit wasn't saying you must have a full dress hearing, just give the officer an opportunity to say why he shouldn't be payless during the suspension period, just an opportunity, I think the words were, to tell his side of the story.
speaker="gwendolyn_t_mosley" startTime="142.204" stopTime="178.370">
    Ms. Gwendolyn T. Mosley 
    Yes, Your Honor. 
    In this case, we're suggesting that such an opportunity would be useless. 
    In this particular case, we have... in this particular case, we have a police officer who was arrested on very serious charges, and that particular arrest itself required prompt action, just as in Mallen the Court said that the mere fact of the arrest is enough to undermine the public confidence and the public trust.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="178.370" stopTime="211.420">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Well, the problem, Ms. Mosley, is not apparently on whether the suspension can occur. 
    I don't see either side disagreeing that under these circumstances the officer can be suspended. 
    I guess it really turns on whether there should have been some opportunity promptly to discuss the pay situation during the suspension, right? 
    I mean, that's what we're really talking about, not whether there can be a suspension, because I guess your opponents agree there could be.
speaker="gwendolyn_t_mosley" startTime="211.420" stopTime="214.153">
    Ms. Gwendolyn T. Mosley 
    Yes. 
    In our case, however--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="214.153" stopTime="229.111">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    And in this case, we've never had a determination on the facts. 
    I guess it turned out that the charges were dismissed very promptly, but there was no opportunity to discuss the pay situation for a while.
speaker="gwendolyn_t_mosley" startTime="229.111" stopTime="259.870">
    Ms. Gwendolyn T. Mosley 
    --That's right. 
    What we're saying is that there are important interests furthered by his prompt suspension and his prompt suspension without pay. 
    The government had important interests at stake here, not just the interest in promptly removing a police officer following his arrest on drug-related charges, but there was the interest in maintaining the public's confidence in the integrity of the police force and the police officers' confidence in the integrity of the police force.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="259.870" stopTime="263.073">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    So you do not apply this to every State employee.
speaker="gwendolyn_t_mosley" startTime="263.073" stopTime="275.602">
    Ms. Gwendolyn T. Mosley 
    With respect to the arrest on a felony charge, we're saying that the arrest, or that the suspension would be without pay, but we're suggesting--
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="275.602" stopTime="279.744">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    So it's with respect to all employees, or just police officers?
speaker="gwendolyn_t_mosley" startTime="279.744" stopTime="281.717">
    Ms. Gwendolyn T. Mosley 
    --With all Commonwealth employees.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="281.717" stopTime="316.549">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    Well, is the suspension automatic? 
    I mean, it seems to me that one of the things I think we're arguing about in this case is whether you're really applying this regulation, and the regulation that you set out on page 3 of your brief makes the suspension automatic on arrest. 
    There doesn't seem to be a substantive objection to the regulation as such, so if it's this regulation which is being applied, then the only real issue of fact would be, was the person arrested or charged or not?
speaker="gwendolyn_t_mosley" startTime="316.549" stopTime="317.728">
    Ms. Gwendolyn T. Mosley 
    Correct.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="317.728" stopTime="361.679">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    And yet if I understand what the other side is saying, they're saying that really isn't the standard that they apply, that in fact it's... number 1, it's not consistently applied. 
    Number 2, if it had been alone what was being applied the individual would have been reinstated when the charges were dropped, and he wasn't, and so they're saying that the real issue in the case is... or in the case of a suspension is not whether there was an arrest or charge, but something to do with the merits of the arrest or charge, and if the latter point is true, then there really is a lot more to talk about at a hearing than the mere fact of the arrest or not. 
    Could you comment on that issue?
speaker="gwendolyn_t_mosley" startTime="361.679" stopTime="373.758">
    Ms. Gwendolyn T. Mosley 
    Yes, Your Honor. 
    What we're saying is at the point of time when the suspension was made, there was only one issue, and that issue was, was there an arrest, and was the nature of the charge a felony, and--
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="373.758" stopTime="390.277">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    And you apply the regulation to everybody, and so far as you know, are there any exceptions in the sense that the inquiry might have been more far-ranging, or there might have been a... an exercise of discretion on the part of the suspending authority? 
    Do you know of any such instances?
speaker="gwendolyn_t_mosley" startTime="390.277" stopTime="401.935">
    Ms. Gwendolyn T. Mosley 
    --As far as I know, Your Honor, there is no discretion, and that this particular regulation is applied in every instance involving an arrest of a Commonwealth employee for a felony.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="401.935" stopTime="403.614">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    All right. 
    Now, if... I'm sorry. 
    Go ahead.
speaker="gwendolyn_t_mosley" startTime="403.614" stopTime="410.851">
    Ms. Gwendolyn T. Mosley 
    Well, the only issue then is, does the employee's charge or arrest fall within that regulation, and--
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="410.851" stopTime="419.397">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    All right, but if that is so, and that is the standard, why wasn't he simply reinstated when the charges were dropped?
speaker="gwendolyn_t_mosley" startTime="419.397" stopTime="434.596">
    Ms. Gwendolyn T. Mosley 
    --Your Honor, that particular issue simply doesn't appear to have been addressed. 
    It was not addressed by Mr. Homar. 
    It was not addressed by the district court, and it wasn't addressed by the Third Circuit.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="434.596" stopTime="449.446">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    But neither was this regulation that you're relying on. 
    That sort of comes in... it's barely there until your brief in this Court, and the deposition of, what was his... Mr. Levanowitz?
speaker="gwendolyn_t_mosley" startTime="449.446" stopTime="449.847">
    Ms. Gwendolyn T. Mosley 
    Yes.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="449.847" stopTime="466.706">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    --said that he used it not as a law but as a guide among other guides, so it doesn't sound like it follows like the night the day. 
    At least that wasn't how the personnel supervisor conceived it. 
    He thought it was just one of the guides he had.
speaker="gwendolyn_t_mosley" startTime="466.706" stopTime="521.583">
    Ms. Gwendolyn T. Mosley 
    Well, we understand that Mr. Levanowitz from his deposition testimony certainly should be understood as saying that that was one of the things that he considered. 
    However, insofar as he's suggesting that he has discretion, he was merely wrong. 
    And also, we're saying that although we did not place a great deal of emphasis on the existence of the Governor's code, that is certainly referred to, and that particular aspect relates only to the issue of the value of additional process. 
    That is the point of having that particular code of reference, or a code of conduct in the case. 
    What we're suggesting is, in the balance, when you talk about the various factors that you're considering, one of those factors is, what is the value of having any additional process? 
    What is the value of having the employee come in and say anything--
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="521.583" stopTime="528.649">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    Well, but you don't have a balance, because you began by telling us that this was a police officer and that that's important, and I can understand that.
speaker="gwendolyn_t_mosley" startTime="528.649" stopTime="529.040">
    Ms. Gwendolyn T. Mosley 
    --Right.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="529.040" stopTime="532.152">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    But you say it applies across the board to all employees. 
    That's the rule you're defending.
speaker="gwendolyn_t_mosley" startTime="532.152" stopTime="538.634">
    Ms. Gwendolyn T. Mosley 
    Well, no. 
    What I'm suggesting is that we have a rule, and there's no discretion, so as to that element of the balance--
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="538.634" stopTime="556.066">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    May I just make it clear? 
    You are saying that the rule you want us to adopt is that there is an across-the-board rule that is... that meets constitutional requirements for a State to suspend any employee who is charged with a felony without a hearing and without pay. 
    Isn't that your submission?
speaker="gwendolyn_t_mosley" startTime="556.066" stopTime="571.226">
    Ms. Gwendolyn T. Mosley 
    --What I'm suggesting, Your Honor, is that where there's an important interest, and there's some assurance that the reason for the action taken is not without basis, and there's a need for prompt action, then the court may, in those instances, suspend without--
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="571.226" stopTime="572.958">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    You mean the State may.
speaker="gwendolyn_t_mosley" startTime="572.958" stopTime="575.800">
    Ms. Gwendolyn T. Mosley 
    --The State may suspend without pay.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="575.800" stopTime="581.743">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    So then you're not arguing for the broad rule that I suggested at the outset of my question.
speaker="gwendolyn_t_mosley" startTime="581.743" stopTime="582.544">
    Ms. Gwendolyn T. Mosley 
    No.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="582.544" stopTime="591.848">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    You don't need to defend a rule across the board, I take it. 
    Your position here could simply be limited to police officers.
speaker="gwendolyn_t_mosley" startTime="591.848" stopTime="642.402">
    Ms. Gwendolyn T. Mosley 
    It could be, because clearly the removal of a police officer on charges such as were involved here is a very important issue. 
    However, we're not suggesting that the interests implicated by some other employee might not also raise very fundamental, compelling interests to warrant his or her suspension without pay as well. 
    What we're suggesting is that there... we're not really arguing for a new rule, or the announcement of any new kind of approach in these types of cases. 
    What we're saying is that the rules that have been in force, such as the Mathews balancing test, and the rule that was announced in Mallen, are adequate to deal with this particular situation.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="642.402" stopTime="647.886">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    Well, if you're going to have a case-by-case rule for every employee, depending on who he or she is, you might as well have a hearing.
speaker="gwendolyn_t_mosley" startTime="647.886" stopTime="682.748">
    Ms. Gwendolyn T. Mosley 
    Well, Your Honor, one of the reasons that we're suggesting that there would not have been a need, or there would be no value, is that it really does depend on what the purpose or the function of the action is. 
    We're saying that there's nothing new with respect to saying that due process is a flexible concept. 
    There is no rule that fits every single situation, and that in fact the Court has suggested in Mallen, or in Mathews and other cases that there is a balancing. 
    There is a balancing in every single situation.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="682.748" stopTime="688.982">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    What we want to... I mean, what we want to know is whether in this case there should have been a hearing or not.
speaker="gwendolyn_t_mosley" startTime="688.982" stopTime="689.493">
    Ms. Gwendolyn T. Mosley 
    Right.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="689.493" stopTime="773.920">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    And let me suggest an argument to you and get your response to it. 
    The argument would be this. 
    If you had a regulation that provided every employee shall be suspended upon arrest, suspended without pay upon arrest, and you applied that across the board, and that regulation as such was not attacked as somehow being unconstitutional, then you would have an argument to the effect that look, the only issue is whether there was an arrest or not, and there's not likely to be a mistake about that. 
    Or if you had a regulation that said, every police officer shall be suspended upon arrest, you could make the same argument. 
    The only question is whether there's an arrest. 
    But if, in fact, this regulation, which seems to cover everybody, does not in fact cover everybody, then, at least, it seems to me there... or the argument would run that in any given case an employee could say, look, it shouldn't apply to me. 
    You apply it to some, you don't apply it to others, regardless of what it says on its face, and it shouldn't apply to me, and that's a much... I suppose a much more complicated issue than whether there was an arrest or not. 
    If that's the issue, there would be a good reason for having a pre-suspension hearing. 
    What is your response to that?
speaker="gwendolyn_t_mosley" startTime="773.920" stopTime="795.032">
    Ms. Gwendolyn T. Mosley 
    My response, Your Honor, is that there are no facts in the record, or there are no facts of which I am aware, that suggest this particular regulation does not apply in every instance when there's been an arrest of a Commonwealth employee and a charge of a felony. 
    In that particular case, the inquiry is the same. 
    It is whether--
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="795.032" stopTime="798.644">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    So you are going to defend it on the grounds that it does apply to everybody.
speaker="gwendolyn_t_mosley" startTime="798.644" stopTime="815.585">
    Ms. Gwendolyn T. Mosley 
    --It does apply to everyone. 
    It does apply to everyone, so the inquiry at the point of consideration of what to do once you receive that information is, you know, is this a Commonwealth employee, has there been a formal charge, and is that charge a felony?
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="815.585" stopTime="825.512">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Had there been no Governor's code, you would lose. 
    Is that... then you're relying on the Governor's code as the reason why there should be no opportunity to tell his side of the story?
speaker="gwendolyn_t_mosley" startTime="825.512" stopTime="848.577">
    Ms. Gwendolyn T. Mosley 
    No, we're not, Your Honor. 
    What we're suggesting is, as I've stated, is there is a balancing. 
    There has to be an important governmental interest which we do have here. 
    We do have reliable information which would be supported by the State police arrest of this person, so there's no suggestion that the action taken is baseless.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="848.577" stopTime="871.822">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Then what use is the Government code? 
    I'm really... I'm having a hard time understanding what use you're making of that. 
    Is it your position that the Government... that the Governor's code makes it unnecessary to have a hearing, because it applies universally, however, you concede that in some cases that may be unconstitutional? 
    Is that your position?
speaker="gwendolyn_t_mosley" startTime="871.822" stopTime="877.886">

   Argument of Ann Hubbard
speaker="ann_hubbard" startTime="1229.717" stopTime="1281.541">
    Ms. Ann Hubbard 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    Under the Third Circuit's per se rule, any public employee who is suspended without pay in advance of a hearing is entitled to seek money damages for a constitutional violation. 
    This is contrary to the Court's precedents, and could impair the Federal Government's interest in needed flexibility in employment matters. 
    Because of deficiencies in the record, however, we believe the Court should reject the Third Circuit's rules, vacate its judgment, and remand the case for further proceedings. 
    I'd like to focus first on why Mallen and Barchi tell us that a government may, in appropriate circumstances, suspend an employee without pay and in advance of the hearing.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="1281.541" stopTime="1289.246">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    I take it, then, the rule you're going to submit to us is that it depends on the nature of the employee and the work that the employee does.
speaker="ann_hubbard" startTime="1289.246" stopTime="1296.361">
    Ms. Ann Hubbard 
    Under Mallen and Barchi, and as well under Mathews, you have to identify the government interest in prompt action.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="1296.361" stopTime="1306.978">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    So does the government... the government does not have an interest in suspending any employee who's been arrested and charged with a felony without a hearing and suspending without pay?
speaker="ann_hubbard" startTime="1306.978" stopTime="1313.542">
    Ms. Ann Hubbard 
    We think it's an easier case to say that you could do it with a law enforcement officer.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="1313.542" stopTime="1317.486">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    I know that. 
    That's why I'm asking. 
    [Laughter]
speaker="ann_hubbard" startTime="1317.486" stopTime="1323.178">
    Ms. Ann Hubbard 
    It's unclear. 
    I'm not sure why the... that would be defensible.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="1323.178" stopTime="1331.103">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    And is there a difference between the suspension of duty, performance of duty and the deprivation of pay?

    Ms. Ann Hubbard 
    Generally--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="1333.183" stopTime="1335.585">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Might there be a different balance between the two?
speaker="ann_hubbard" startTime="1335.585" stopTime="1351.086">
    Ms. Ann Hubbard 
    --Yes, Justice O'Connor. 
    Generally, if the government suspends an employee with pay it does not implicate a protected property interest, so you would not have to go through this balancing test. 
    We think Mallen and Barchi are properly understood--
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="1351.086" stopTime="1355.451">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    Why does the government have to give somebody a paid vacation if they've been charged with a felony?
speaker="ann_hubbard" startTime="1355.451" stopTime="1365.384">
    Ms. Ann Hubbard 
    --It doesn't if it can satisfy the Mallen and Barchi test that it had a compelling interest or adequate interest to suspend them.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="1365.384" stopTime="1371.160">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    How does the government show this compelling interest, other than if it's not a policeman, if it's a groundskeeper?
speaker="ann_hubbard" startTime="1371.160" stopTime="1382.177">
    Ms. Ann Hubbard 
    I think it would be harder with a groundskeeper. 
    I mean, this Court has already identified other circumstances... if it's a bank director accused of fraud. 
    If there's a public safety concern.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="1382.177" stopTime="1411.406">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    That was a private individual. 
    I mean, it's different when the government as regulator is knocking a private individual out of his private job. 
    Can't the government have a policy and, indeed, don't many governments have such a policy, we do not employ felons, and if there's any suspicion of somebody being a felon, you're off the payroll until that suspicion is eliminated? 
    Why isn't that a reasonable rule? 
    I don't care if you're a police officer or not.
speaker="ann_hubbard" startTime="1411.406" stopTime="1417.600">
    Ms. Ann Hubbard 
    It may well be, Justice Scalia.

    What I'd like--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="1417.600" stopTime="1439.713">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Of course, if you continue paying the charged felon, can the government get the money back? 
    What do you do bring a lawsuit to get back the money you've been paying after the person is finally convicted if you continue paying the salary? 
    How much would it cost you to bring a lawsuit to get back the pay that you... I mean, it seems to me there's a substantial government interest there, isn't there?
speaker="ann_hubbard" startTime="1439.713" stopTime="1463.539">
    Ms. Ann Hubbard 
    --Justice Scalia, you have identified one of the primary problems with the Third Circuit rule. 
    The effect of the rule is that even if the Government constitutionally can suspend you, it constitutionally is required to pay you in all instances, and we think this is not compatible with the Court's precedents or, indeed, with our basic understanding of the employment relationship.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1463.539" stopTime="1489.415">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    One of the benefits of the Third Circuit's rule, and one of the benefits of the contrary rule... either you can suspend without pay, or... is that it avoids all the kind of building castles in the air and factual analyses that you don't know when the supervisor first confronts a situation... if he has to go through some Mathews balancing test every time, it's not very workable in the real world.
speaker="ann_hubbard" startTime="1489.415" stopTime="1507.889">
    Ms. Ann Hubbard 
    That's correct, Mr. Chief Justice, and we believe that where there's any doubt about which way the balance would tip, the prudent employer can protect itself by suspending the person with pay for the time necessary to decide whether or not further action is warranted.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="1507.889" stopTime="1519.926">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    By suspending the person with pay. 
    So you're saying that the presumption should be that you can only suspend with pay, unless there's no... unless the Mathews balance is undoubtedly in favor of the State. 
    That's the rule you propose?
speaker="ann_hubbard" startTime="1519.926" stopTime="1547.085">
    Ms. Ann Hubbard 
    No, Justice Kennedy. 
    We're saying that the employer always has the option to dispel any constitutional doubt by suspending the employee with pay, but if the employer concludes that this is one of those cases that falls within Mallen and Barchi and it is permissible to suspend the employee without pay, then if that determination is correct, it should not be liable for damages.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="1547.085" stopTime="1556.702">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    Well, if you can't tell us whether the cases are easy or hard, how is the employee's supervisor to do it? 
    I mean, it's--
speaker="ann_hubbard" startTime="1556.702" stopTime="1564.615">
    Ms. Ann Hubbard 
    We think there... it is the nature of a balancing test that there will be hard cases, and--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1564.615" stopTime="1594.175">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    --May I just interrupt... I don't mean to interrupt you. 
    I guess I have, but-- 
    [Laughter] 
    But just pursuing the Chief Justice's point for a moment, if you took the Third Circuit's rule and said that's the law, you can't take his pay away until you at least give him an opportunity to give his side of the story, he can... you can do that in a day or two, so it may be that only a day or two's pay is at stake in this huge constitutional fight, because if you called him up and said, hey, Joe, what happened, and he tells you his story, he says, I'm sorry, that's not enough, you're arrested, you're off the payroll.
speaker="ann_hubbard" startTime="1594.175" stopTime="1603.411">
    Ms. Ann Hubbard 
    --That's very often the case, Justice Stevens. 
    This is the minimal Loudermill hearing, and it would not in most cases be so burdensome to call the employer in.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1603.411" stopTime="1613.236">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    So we're not talking about indefinite pay. 
    We're talking about pay for the 2 or 3 days that's necessary in order to give the fellow a chance to tell his side of the story.
speaker="ann_hubbard" startTime="1613.236" stopTime="1643.816">
    Ms. Ann Hubbard 
    That's absolutely correct, but we do believe that if this is a Mallen Barchi case and the government was justified in suspending him without a hearing, even during that period between the suspension and the hearing, if the suspension was lawful in that he was given all the process he was due, the employer is not constitutionally required to pay him. 
    The nature of the property right at issue here is the right to continue to work and to earn a living.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="1643.816" stopTime="1684.954">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Ms. Hubbard, you went through a lot of ifs, and I... following up Justice Stevens' question, if the employee is arguing all I want is a chance to tell my side of the story, all that's involved... all that's at stake for the government is a couple of days, at most, of my pay, why doesn't any balance work in favor of the employee? 
    The government can take him out of the job, and the only question is the pay for a couple of days. 
    Why doesn't the employee win on that kind of balance?
speaker="ann_hubbard" startTime="1684.954" stopTime="1699.443">
    Ms. Ann Hubbard 
    It might well, but in the balance that you're proposing, you're positing 1 or 2 days' pay. 
    In other cases it may take longer to resolve the issue, as in Mallen or Barchi, for instance.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="1699.443" stopTime="1707.110">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    But if you say the only process that's due is a chance to tell his side of the story, period, no full evidentiary hearing. 
    That can come later.
speaker="ann_hubbard" startTime="1707.110" stopTime="1722.788">
    Ms. Ann Hubbard 
    Right, but there may be government justifications for having to postpone even a Loudermillstyle hearing for a week or two, and we're just saying that the Court needs to use its framework for balancing those questions.
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="1722.788" stopTime="1739.999">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    Have you come across anywhere... I'd be quite curious. 
    The last time the Court said that kind of thing was I think in Goss v. Lopez, wasn't it, where they said, all it is you just give the student a chance to tell his side of the story before you suspend him. 
    Well, how is it worked out? 
    I mean, it seems to me--

   Argument of James V. Fareri
speaker="james_v_fareri" startTime="1852.985" stopTime="1886.228">
    Mr. James V. Fareri 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    I'd like to begin by speaking about this Governor's code of conduct that is so heavily relied upon by the Commonwealth in this case. 
    It was not brought up or even raised until this case got to the Supreme Court. 
    If you look in the joint appendix, Mr. Levanowitz testified that he did not even feel that he was obliged to follow the Governor's code of conduct. 
    I would submit to you that the Governor's code of conduct is not even relevant for the determination as to what quantum of due process should have been afforded Mr. Homar under these facts.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="1886.228" stopTime="1933.870">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    Well, maybe we should leave that issue for the circuit or the district court on remand. 
    If we were to do that, let me ask you what your answer to this question would be. 
    If we assume that the Governor's code of conduct requiring the automatic suspension at least applies to all law enforcement officers and should be, by its terms, enforced, then the only issue would be in a given case whether, in fact, there had been an arrest or a charge. 
    Under those circumstances, do you believe that a pre-suspension hearing is necessary if pay is not to be continued during the suspension?
speaker="james_v_fareri" startTime="1933.870" stopTime="1940.532">
    Mr. James V. Fareri 
    If pay is not to be continued, yes, Your Honor, because that would be an issue, as to whether or not the individual can continue to receive his pay.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="1940.532" stopTime="1970.151">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    Well, but the issue would turn solely on the question whether there had been an arrest or a charge, and is that the kind of issue upon which there is a sufficient risk of error to require the pre-termination, the pre-suspension hearing? 
    I mean, there's a pretty good argument that that issue is so simple, it's so unlikely that there is going to be a mistake about that, that it really would be justified to say no, the hearing could take place afterwards.
speaker="james_v_fareri" startTime="1970.151" stopTime="2030.132">
    Mr. James V. Fareri 
    I would concede that if the Governor's code of conduct is in the case and it is supportable and it is constitutional, then I would agree with you, Justice Souter, on that point. 
    It is our position in this case that the general rule crafted by the court of appeals below is fundamentally correct. 
    However, the Court need not reach that. 
    It need not reach the issue of the propriety of such a rule in order to affirm the holding below. 
    Rather, the result reached below may be obtained by applying the three Mathews factors to the facts of the case, and I'd like to go over those with the Court now. 
    The first Mathews factor is an assessment of the private interest that would be affected. 
    In this particular case, I would submit that there is a very strong private interest that Mr. Homar had of continuing his employment. 
    The Court has recognized in many cases in the past such as the Loudermill case, then the Mallen case, that an employee has a great private interest in continuing with their employment and continuing to receive their wages.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="2030.132" stopTime="2048.362">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Well, I suppose how significant that interest is would depend certainly upon, you know, how many other funds the individual has. 
    I mean, if this individual is independently wealthy and is just being a police officer for fun, I suppose it wouldn't be very important, would it?
speaker="james_v_fareri" startTime="2048.362" stopTime="2050.583">
    Mr. James V. Fareri

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well, isn't there something to be said for a rule that's more or less automatic, rather than requiring the supervisor to sit down in each case and read a study like this that says a third of these people... and trying to figure out whether this employee was in that third or not, for either saying that with respect to a police officer you can suspend upon arrest without pay or perhaps, as the Third Circuit says, you can't suspend. 
    There are just a great deal of transactional costs in this balancing test.

    Mr. James V. Fareri 
    Mr. Chief Justice, I couldn't agree with you more. 
    That's why we think that the rule crafted by the Third Circuit is correct. 
    You cannot engage in a Mathews balance in each and every case. 
    As you indicated, that is completely unworkable in the real world.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="2135.161" stopTime="2193.469">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Mr. Fareri, the... that rule, the automatic rule that there must be some opportunity to tell his side of the story, it isn't entirely clear to me what is entailed, how much it costs the State. 
    So for example, if the position is, the State says, you've been arrested. 
    You've been charged. 
    Does the State have to do anything more at that point? 
    They could say, now tell us your reason, but you told us that there has to be a notice. 
    He did have notice. 
    A reason... is the reason... is it an adequate reason for the employer simply to say, you've been charged, and then, okay, you have a justification. 
    Tell us. 
    Is there anything more... is there any more process that's due the employee than what I just described?
speaker="james_v_fareri" startTime="2193.469" stopTime="2214.423">
    Mr. James V. Fareri 
    I think what you're describing, Justice Ginsburg, is a Loudermill-type process, and we are not arguing that the employee is entitled to anything more than that. 
    What we're talking about in this case is something... it couldn't be any more simple. 
    Notice... notice of the problem, and an opportunity to say, I'm innocent. 
    This gentleman did not have even that simple process in this case.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="2214.423" stopTime="2233.975">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    No, but I thought the question was not whether he's innocent, but whether he's been charged. 
    Suppose you have a State that simply adopted that rule. 
    If you were charged with a felony, you will be suspended without pay, period. 
    So the only issue before the supervisor is, have you been charged with a felony? 
    Do you need a hearing for that? 
    That's a matter of public record, it seems to me.
speaker="james_v_fareri" startTime="2233.975" stopTime="2238.667">
    Mr. James V. Fareri 
    Given... if you take the Court's premise that that rule is valid--

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Right.

    --Then--

    You agree with that.

    Mr. James V. Fareri 
    We didn't, Mr. Chief Justice, the reason being, again, we feel strongly that the rule is not in the case, because the personnel director himself testified that he did not rely on the rule. 
    And additionally, as one of the members of the Court indicated when they were asking counsel for the State a question, after the... all charges were dismissed, and all charges were dismissed 6 days after his arrest for insufficient evidence after a preliminary hearing, the human resources director continued on with his suspension for a period of 23 days, during which Mr. Homar did not receive his pay. 
    Now, if they're going to rely on that rule, why didn't they lift that suspension and reinstate him after all charges were dismissed?

    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    Can I go back to the... what I think is your main argument? 
    I take it Judge Serokin wrote, a governmental employer may not suspend an employee without pay unless the suspension is preceded by some kind of pre-suspension hearing. 
    He means never, all right?

    Mr. James V. Fareri 
    Yes, Your Honor.
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="2497.257" stopTime="2563.709">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    Okay. 
    So I would like to know whether there aren't some circumstances where you could suspend him without a preceding hearing. 
    A bank guard at Fort Knox robs Fort Knox and is charged. 
    We're not sure, but he's charged formally. 
    A teacher, State university, sexually assaults a student and is charged. 
    A policeman is a major drug dealer and is charged. 
    The authorities say, there's a charge. 
    We therefore have probable cause to think he did it. 
    We will give him a prompt post suspension hearing where he can say everything within one pay period and give him his money back unless we think that he really is guilty. 
    Okay? 
    Now, what's wrong with that? 
    The reason they want to do it is because they think it's impossible to run a police force, a university, or Fort Knox with people like that having been charged on the payroll doing their job.

    The--

    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    And if you say, oh, just don't pay them, they laugh at that and say, what do you mean? 
    If we send him a paycheck it's a paid vacation. 
    Of course the taxpayers want to have people who are paid at work doing something. 
    Now, that's the argument, and I want to hear your response. 
    Your Honor, I think even in those circumstances where it's absolutely clear that there's been some wrongdoing on the part of the employee that there is always a value to the pre-suspension process. 
    And I think the reason there should be pre-suspension process is because the wage earner's interest in his employment is so critical and so important, and sometimes a matter of being able to support himself and his family, and the skin off the nose of the government, so to speak, is so slight, because what we're talking about is a Loudermill process, that I would argue that you should have a pre-suspension process even in those types of cases that the Court-- 
    --Suppose the employee doesn't ask for one? 
    Suppose in one of Justice Breyer's hypotheticals that the employee does... who has the burden... I take it that you're saying that in every case the employer must take the initiative, even if the employee didn't ask to have any kind of pre-deprivation hearing. 
    Is that so?
speaker="james_v_fareri" startTime="2643.133" stopTime="2657.840">
    Mr. James V. Fareri 
    --I would say yes, Justice Ginsburg, because I think there are some employees who probably aren't sophisticated enough to ask for one, and I think because the governmental employer is in the position of running the workforce, that that should be their obligation to provide one.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="2657.840" stopTime="2665.246">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    And that was this case, wasn't it?

    Mr. James V. Fareri 
    That's correct, and that exemplifies what I'm saying. 
    I don't think he had the knowledge to know that he was even entitled to that, and he didn't understand what his rights were until after he consulted counsel, which was sometime after that.
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="2680.136" stopTime="2741.315">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    Could I follow up my question with-- 
    --Mr. Fareri, I guess there are two really separate questions here. 
    One is whether you need a pre-deprivation hearing, and the second one, and I'm not sure what your answer to this is, whether you can continue the deprivation until the charge is dropped or resolved. 
    In other words, it's no big deal I suppose if you say you can suspend without pay but you have to provide a prompt post-deprivation hearing, which means in 2 or 3 days he gets a hearing. 
    That's not the State's position. 
    As I understand the State, the State's position is, we don't have to provide a hearing until the felony charge is resolved either up or down, which is really not a prompt... I mean, depending upon how promptly the felony is disposed of. 
    What is your position on the latter question?

   Argument of Gregory O'Duden
speaker="gregory_oduden" startTime="3075.510" stopTime="3158.915">
    Mr. Gregory O'Duden 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    Let me begin if I may by discussing the issue of what governmental interests are at stake in the situation that we face in this case. 
    We think that the Court's cases are quite clear that in order to satisfy its burden of denying somebody a pre-deprivation hearing the government has to show that there is a significant administrative burden, and the argument that we hear today is really a general argument that suggests that, as Justice Breyer put it, we can't do this because if we do the public will be outraged. 
    We don't denigrate or trivialize the argument that's made by the State, but we think that the long experience of the Federal Government's practice defeats the argument, because the fact of the matter is, the rule that we advocate here today has been the routine practice for many, many years, and there has been no suggestion at any point that the public has in any way been outraged. 
    Justice Scalia, are you--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="3158.915" stopTime="3164.298">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    No. 
    I was just going to say, how's the Federal budget doing? 
    [Laughter]
speaker="gregory_oduden" startTime="3164.298" stopTime="3172.533">
    Mr. Gregory O'Duden 
    --The Federal budget isn't doing well, Your Honor, but I can assure you it's not because people are being given Loudermill-type hearings, and I think it's also important--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="3172.533" stopTime="3174.375">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    A million dollars here, a million dollars there--
speaker="gregory_oduden" startTime="3174.375" stopTime="3208.347">
    Mr. Gregory O'Duden 
    --No, I don't think it translates into that at all, and I think there's one other important thing to be kept in mind here. 
    If an erroneous decision is avoided, what does that do? 
    That saves the government money, because it means that in that situation the employer doesn't have to go out and hire a substitute, and it doesn't have to expend the resources to train that substitute and, of course, it also means that it avoids what could be the very significant cost of having to pay that employee back pay.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="3208.347" stopTime="3216.230">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    --If it is in fact in the government's best interest to do that, presumably the government will do that without being told that the Constitution requires it.
speaker="gregory_oduden" startTime="3216.230" stopTime="3239.876">
    Mr. Gregory O'Duden 
    Well, I wish the world were that simple, Your Honor. 
    I think that the Court recognized in Goss v. Lopez that notwithstanding the good intentions of those who are in a position to impose discipline, it often doesn't work out that way, and that's why we have the Constitution, to defend citizens, to defend employees from deprivations of their property.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="3239.876" stopTime="3248.244">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    It's not a... I don't think it's a good constitutional argument to say this is really not only in the employee's best interest but in the employer's best interest, too.
speaker="gregory_oduden" startTime="3248.244" stopTime="3248.792">
    Mr. Gregory O'Duden 
    Well, Your Honor--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="3248.792" stopTime="3251.775">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    The employer presumably can look out for his own best interest.
speaker="gregory_oduden" startTime="3251.775" stopTime="3276.961">
    Mr. Gregory O'Duden 
    --The reason that we're talking about the employer's interest at all is, of course, we're faced with having to deal with the Mathews test, and therefore we're having to respond to the government's assertion that their interests are somehow compromised by giving somebody a pre-deprivation hearing. 
    I think it's important in looking at this case for all of us to keep in mind what the due process framework here is.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="3276.961" stopTime="3285.156">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Well, what... let's keep in mind what the suspended person here would argue at the hearing. 
    What would you expect him to argue at the hearing?
speaker="gregory_oduden" startTime="3285.156" stopTime="3289.560">
    Mr. Gregory O'Duden 
    In this situation, I'm putting aside the issue--
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="3289.560" stopTime="3289.989">
    Unknown Speaker 
    I was not indicted?
speaker="gregory_oduden" startTime="3289.989" stopTime="3302.521">
    Mr. Gregory O'Duden 
    --I'm putting aside the issue... well, he wasn't indicted. 
    I'm putting aside here the issue of the Governor's code. 
    He could say that he was at the wrong place at the wrong time, that he wasn't guilty, that he was innocent.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="3302.521" stopTime="3322.472">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    No, but the response to that is, we have a policy that all State employees, or at least police officers, will be suspended if they're under indictment. 
    We do not want indicted police officers walking around enforcing the law, and since they're not going to be walking around enforcing the law, we're not going to pay them. 
    That seems pretty reasonable to me.
speaker="gregory_oduden" startTime="3322.472" stopTime="3330.948">
    Mr. Gregory O'Duden 
    Well, of course, that's not the policy that we're talking about in this case, Your Honor. 
    What we're talking about here is a code, as my--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="3330.948" stopTime="3333.011">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    All right, but's assume it is. 
    I mean, that--
speaker="gregory_oduden" startTime="3333.011" stopTime="3334.881">
    Mr. Gregory O'Duden 
    --Okay. 
    You're moving now to a hypothetical situation.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="3334.881" stopTime="3354.085">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    --Right... well, maybe, maybe not, but we can let the lower court resolve it. 
    Assuming it's a policy that at least police officers will be suspended without pay if they are under indictment, what would the hearing have consisted... you know, what good would the hearing have done here?
speaker="gregory_oduden" startTime="3354.085" stopTime="3364.941">
    Mr. Gregory O'Duden 
    If... assuming that were the policy, that your hypothetical is true, one of the things that he could have argued is that the policy was unconstitutional. 
    He could have made that argument to the decisonmaker.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="3364.941" stopTime="3369.473">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Let's assume it's constitutional. 
    Does he have any other argument?
speaker="gregory_oduden" startTime="3369.473" stopTime="3376.018">
    Mr. Gregory O'Duden 
    Well, in essence what your hypothetical sets up is a situation where there is no point to the hearing.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="3376.018" stopTime="3377.069">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Right. 
    Well, I'm--
speaker="gregory_oduden" startTime="3377.069" stopTime="3385.064">
    Mr. Gregory O'Duden 
    Okay, and you're assuming that it's constitutional-- 
    [Laughter] 
    So you're talking all of the arguments out of the employee's hands. 
    In that case, obviously, there is no--
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="3385.064" stopTime="3391.780">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    --Well, Mathews v. Eldridge hearings are not to determine what's constitutional or not. 
    They're to determine what the facts are under a balancing test.
speaker="gregory_oduden" startTime="3391.780" stopTime="3392.511">
    Mr. Gregory O'Duden 
    --That's right, Your Honor.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="3392.511" stopTime="3412.292">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    And if we hypothesize that it's an adequate and defensible interest for the government not to have police officers who are under criminal charges enforcing the law then it is constitutional, so I think you're avoiding the question when you say what the hearing is going to establish.
speaker="gregory_oduden" startTime="3412.292" stopTime="3421.890">
    Mr. Gregory O'Duden 
    No. 
    I think I said that if those were the facts, then there would be little point to the hearing at all. 
    In fact, there would be no point to the hearing. 
    But I do want to emphasize that those are not--
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="3421.890" stopTime="3429.926">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    Well, so then you have to say that it's unlawful for the State to have the policy of suspending officers that are under criminal charges.
speaker="gregory_oduden" startTime="3429.926" stopTime="3435.429">
    Mr. Gregory O'Duden 
    --Ultimately he would be reduced to making that kind of argument.
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="3435.429" stopTime="3437.800">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    No, you mean suspending without pay... without pay.
speaker="gregory_oduden" startTime="3437.800" stopTime="3438.889">
    Mr. Gregory O'Duden 
    Suspending without pay, yes.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="3438.889" stopTime="3443.944">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    It's an argument you're perfectly willing to make. 
    I mean, you think that that's the case, that it is unconstitutional to suspend--
speaker="gregory_oduden" startTime="3443.944" stopTime="3451.107">
    Mr. Gregory O'Duden 
    Yes, given the fact... given what this Court has said about the significance of the fact of an arrest.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="3451.107" stopTime="3469.701">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    --Certainly a supervisor isn't in a position to make any intelligent, informed decision about whether a policy is constitutional or not. 
    I mean, we're talking about this very quick telephone call and the guy at the other end says, of the telephone says, your policy's unconstitutional. 
    [Laughter]
speaker="gregory_oduden" startTime="3469.701" stopTime="3484.189">
    Mr. Gregory O'Duden 
    Well, in this situation, where the code calls for a suspension to the extent practical that may well give the supervisor pause before he goes ahead and imposes that action.
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="3484.189" stopTime="3502.292">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    Well, you're... I take it that... I don't want to put words in your mouth... that you're saying there's no circumstance in which simply phoning the person before suspending him without pay and to say, is there some exceptional circumstance, is there something to your side of the story, you're saying that that's always required.
speaker="gregory_oduden" startTime="3502.292" stopTime="3503.013">
    Mr. Gregory O'Duden 
    I'm sorry--
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="3503.013" stopTime="3507.845">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    It could be very simple. 
    It could be very simple, a telephone call, what's your point... what's your point of view. 
    Is that--
speaker="gregory_oduden" startTime="3507.845" stopTime="3508.336">
    Mr. Gregory O'Duden 
    --That's right.
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="3508.336" stopTime="3509.698">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    --That's basically what you're arguing.
speaker="gregory_oduden" startTime="3509.698" stopTime="3540.056">
    Mr. Gregory O'Duden 
    Yes, Your Honor, that is. 
    With respect to the Mallen case, since that has come up here, I do want to emphasize in my remaining moments that Mallen does not reach the issue that is presented here. 
    Mallen obviously turned on the Court's very real concern about there being an actual government interest that was going to be jeopardized, namely, public confidence in the banks, the concern about protecting bank depositors. 
    There was a congressional finding on--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="3540.056" stopTime="3547.433">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Well, there's a much greater interest, of course, in assuring the public that their police officers are not indicted for felonies.
speaker="gregory_oduden" startTime="3547.433" stopTime="3548.792">
    Mr. Gregory O'Duden 
    --There is a public interest--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="3548.792" stopTime="3554.007">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    I think the policy is at least as great, if not significantly greater than in Mallen.
speaker="gregory_oduden" startTime="3554.007" stopTime="3579.753">
    Mr. Gregory O'Duden 
    --Your Honor, as the Solicitor General points out, that interest is addressed by removing the employee from his duties. 
    It does not follow from that, however, that the State has established an adequate justification to deprive that employee of his pay. 
    That is a separate matter, and those justifications that are asserted here by the government do not justify its summary deprivation of the employee's pay.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="3579.753" stopTime="3592.910">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Mr. O'Duden, is this something that a union could bargain about with the public employer, say, now we want to have a code. 
    You can suspend people, of course, but you have to have some kind of hearing before you take away their pay.
speaker="gregory_oduden" startTime="3592.910" stopTime="3637.609">
    Mr. Gregory O'Duden 
    Yes, and in fact the record here does show that the employee here did in fact grieve under the collective bargaining procedures his suspension, and that is yet another fact that belies the petitioner's last-minute argument here that this code is actually binding. 
    We think it's very clear, based on the undisputed record in this case, that this Governor's code was in no way binding on the petitioners. 
    It obviously wasn't binding on the decisionmakers, and the university's own rules of conduct, if I may make one final point, they provide that before a person is to be suspended, he is to be given an opportunity to be heard in his defense. 
    That again is in the recbrd of this case, Your Honor.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="3637.609" stopTime="3656.543">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    But if this is a bargainable subject, then I take it what you're asking for here is to say the Constitution takes care of it, the union doesn't have to bargain for it, so the union can bargain for other things, because the Constitution will require in every case some kind of hearing before pay is removed.
speaker="gregory_oduden" startTime="3656.543" stopTime="3660.374">
    Mr. Gregory O'Duden 
    I'm sorry, I'm not sure that I follow--
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="3660.374" stopTime="3661.456">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    You answered my question--
speaker="gregory_oduden" startTime="3661.456" stopTime="3662.077">
    Mr. Gregory O'Duden 
    --Okay.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="3662.077" stopTime="3680.679">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    --earlier that a union could bargain with a public employer not to take away people's pay without some kind of hearing. 
    Now, what I'm saying to you is, if the Due Process Clause does that job, then the union doesn't have to bargain for it. 
    It can bargain for something else.
speaker="gregory_oduden" startTime="3680.679" stopTime="3696.030">
    Mr. Gregory O'Duden 
    That's quite right. 
    It puts it in the position of being able to focus on whatever post-deprivation procedures may be warranted. 
    It would mean that it would not have to bargain for those pre-deprivation rights. 
    That is quite correct, Your Honor. 
    Unless there are further questions--
