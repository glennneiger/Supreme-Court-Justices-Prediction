    Mr. Carter G. Phillips 
    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    The issue in this case is whether the value of collateral that a Chapter 13 debtor proposes to retain and use should be determined by what the secured creditor could obtain if it foreclosed on that property and sold it, or by what the debtor would have to pay in order to acquire a comparable property. 
    Our argument is that Section 506(a) of the Bankruptcy Code declares that the value of the property should vary, depending on whether it is proposed to be used or proposed to be disposed of, and that a hypothetical disclosure value is insufficient and ignores the language of the statute. 
    Accordingly, the Court of Appeals erred when it undervalued the secured interest of the Petitioner in this case. 
    This is a Chapter 13 case in which the Respondents proposed a plan that would permit them to keep a tractor trailer truck, which served as collateral for a debt owed to the Petitioner. 
    At the time of the bankruptcy, the Petitioner was owed approximately... well, not approximately... was owed $41,171, and it had perfected a lien on the... under State law. 
    Petitioner sought, under Section 362, to lift the automatic stay and to repossess the truck. 
    Respondents objected, sought to keep the truck as necessary for their reorganization, and asked the court to value the truck at $28,500. 
    They proposed to pay that amount, plus interest, and then to strip the lien from the... from the Petitioner. 
    Both sides offered expert testimony on the value of the truck. 
    The Respondents' expert valued it at retail, at $42,500. 
    Our expert valued it at $41,000. 
    And the... the Respondents' expert also valued it at wholesale, at $31,875, which he got to by discounting by 25 percent the retail value. 
    And all of these numbers were derived, essentially, from standard industry bluebooks. 
    The Bankruptcy Court, the District Court and the Court of Appeals all concluded that, under these circumstances, they had to decide the question as a matter of law, which is the proper method of valuation, wholesale or retail. 
    In doing so, they quite properly turned to Section 506(a) of the Code. 
    Unfortunately, they misconstrued that provision. 
    506(a) has two sentences. 
    The first sentence tells you what you value. 
    And as this Court held in Timbers, that phrase simply tells you that you value the creditor's collateral. 
    The first sentence says nothing about how you value the collateral. 
    The second sentence, which is reproduced on page 3 of the Petitioner's brief, says that the way you value collateral is that you... is that you value... shall be determined in light of the proposed disposition or use of such property. 
    Now, the Court is fond of observing, generally speaking, that--

    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    You left out part of the sentence, though, I think, didn't you, Mr. Phillips?

    Mr. Carter G. Phillips 
    --I'm sorry, Your Honor?

    You left out part of the sentence.
speaker="carter_g_phillips" startTime="223.809" stopTime="227.410">
    Mr. Carter G. Phillips 
    That's true. 
    You're supposed to do it in light of the purposes of the valuation and--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="227.410" stopTime="229.191">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Is it... or of the... or, and of the proposed disposition.

    --Right.

    Unknown Speaker 
    Yes.
speaker="carter_g_phillips" startTime="231.422" stopTime="236.485">
    Mr. Carter G. Phillips 
    I will reread it: shall be determined in light of the proposed disposition or use of the property. 
    Suggesting, as we... as we say--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="236.485" stopTime="240.769">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    No, in light of the purpose of the valuation and of proposed disposition.
speaker="carter_g_phillips" startTime="240.769" stopTime="245.261">
    Mr. Carter G. Phillips 
    --That's correct, Your Honor. 
    Although there is no dispute between the parties about the purpose of the valuation, so I... I skipped over that.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="245.261" stopTime="246.743">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    What was the purpose of the valuation?
speaker="carter_g_phillips" startTime="246.743" stopTime="258.731">
    Mr. Carter G. Phillips 
    Well, the purpose of the valuation here was to decide the full extent of our... of our collateral, for purposes of deciding how much money should be paid as part of... as part of the Chapter 13 reorganization. 
    And there's no dispute over that.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="258.731" stopTime="277.561">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Now, I suppose, if the higher value had been placed on it, that the reorganization might not have occurred... at least that's what Respondents say. 
    They couldn't have made the payments. 
    And then your client would have had to take a truck back and sell it, presumably at wholesale value.
speaker="carter_g_phillips" startTime="277.561" stopTime="289.730">
    Mr. Carter G. Phillips 
    That... that is correct, Your Honor. 
    But we would have been perfectly happy with that, because that's what we proposed in the first instance. 
    But it's not at all clear, and it's simply speculation as to whether or not this Chapter 13 reorganization would have succeeded or not.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="289.730" stopTime="301.129">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Well, in any event, the thing proceeded, and Respondents made payments for 5 years, and presumably have completed this thing. 
    Now, if you prevail, what's going to happen on remand?
speaker="carter_g_phillips" startTime="301.129" stopTime="316.037">
    Mr. Carter G. Phillips 
    Well, what the Respondent said in opposition to the stay in the Bankruptcy Court was that they remain on the hook to pay back Associates for the amount of money that's owed. 
    And it's approximately $7,000... is the difference between what they paid and what we think they should have paid. 
    So--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="316.037" stopTime="330.348">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Now, there are no warranties, I guess, left on the truck as far as the debtor is concerned at this point... I mean at the point they kept the truck. 
    Does that have to be taken into consideration in setting a value?
speaker="carter_g_phillips" startTime="330.348" stopTime="339.283">
    Mr. Carter G. Phillips 
    --Well, the appraiser can... ordinarily, I think the appraiser would take into consideration what is on the truck. 
    I mean what you're being asked to do is to replace the truck that that particular--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="339.283" stopTime="344.847">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Yeah, and it might... it might not be straight blue book wholesale value.
speaker="carter_g_phillips" startTime="344.847" stopTime="363.097">
    Mr. Carter G. Phillips 
    --Right. 
    But then the appraiser could... could adjust it, to take into account precisely what's on the truck. 
    Just as if, for some reason, there was something very special that he put on the truck that he paid for that wasn't part of the secured interest. 
    I don't think that we would get the higher value of that, as we say in the brief. 
    You know, you would look at it as a truck to replace, essentially, what the secured interest is, what is the collateral.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="363.097" stopTime="370.092">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    Well, just on this preliminary point, there was some payment to be made to the unsecured creditors I think a few years down the line, was there not?
speaker="carter_g_phillips" startTime="370.092" stopTime="371.765">
    Mr. Carter G. Phillips 
    Yes, there was money paid to unsecured creditors.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="371.765" stopTime="379.900">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    All right. 
    So... so if the replacement value had been granted, maybe this is just a question between the secured and unsecured creditors, not between the debtor and the secured creditors?
speaker="carter_g_phillips" startTime="379.900" stopTime="384.051">
    Mr. Carter G. Phillips 
    Generally speaking, that is going to be the case. 
    Is this... the question is whether or not the unsecureds get anything--
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="384.051" stopTime="425.738">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    Well, then-- 
    --Sorry. 
    No, that's okay. 
    Were you finished? 
    Or if it would be the case, and I think it would be. 
    The words "wholesale" and "retail" don't appear in this statute. 
    So I take it Congress wanted to leave it up to the bankruptcy judge, pretty much. 
    And why wouldn't the bankruptcy judge be sensible in saying, well, the value includes whatever will be disputed between the unsecured and secured creditors? 
    But, as in this case, if you value it at 41,000, and then he can't even go into the... Chapter 13 because he just doesn't have that money, that couldn't possibly be the value. 
    There's no theory on which that would be the value, because if you value it at that, there won't be a Chapter 13 reorganization.
speaker="carter_g_phillips" startTime="425.738" stopTime="426.139">
    Mr. Carter G. Phillips 
    --Well, but--
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="426.139" stopTime="439.418">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    So we cut back the value in order to make certain he gets into the reorganization, he puts in his disposable income that you get the amount insofar as it's in dispute between the creditors. 
    Now, that kind of result seems fair. 
    And it would be very case specific.
speaker="carter_g_phillips" startTime="439.418" stopTime="443.660">
    Mr. Carter G. Phillips 
    --Well, no, that kind of result seems to undo the statute. 
    Chapter 13 is not--
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="443.660" stopTime="445.102">
    Unknown Speaker 
    It doesn't say.
speaker="carter_g_phillips" startTime="445.102" stopTime="456.109">
    Mr. Carter G. Phillips 
    --essentially, a right that all debtors have. 
    They have a choice between Chapter 7 and Chapter 13. 
    And if their debts are... are too great to allow them to reorganize under Chapter 13, then they have to put up with... under... with Chapter 7.
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="456.109" stopTime="469.957">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    But how could the... the value for purposes of a Chapter 13 reorganization, insofar as that exceeds what your client would get in a liquidation, couldn't... it's nonexistent if there isn't going to be a Chapter 13 reorganization.
speaker="carter_g_phillips" startTime="469.957" stopTime="488.350">
    Mr. Carter G. Phillips 
    But... but it seems to me that you... you... you have to look at the language of the statute. 
    And Section 506(a) says look at the proposed disposition or the proposed use. 
    Now, if... if he cannot use it and successfully come out of Chapter 13, then he is required to go under Chapter 7. 
    And you don't avoid the Chapter 7 problem by--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="488.350" stopTime="495.696">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    In other words, you... you don't agree that... that a secured interest is not a secured interest if... if its existence would prevent Chapter 13?
speaker="carter_g_phillips" startTime="495.696" stopTime="497.086">
    Mr. Carter G. Phillips 
    --Exactly. 
    Exactly.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="497.086" stopTime="498.187">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    That sounds reasonable to me, too.
speaker="carter_g_phillips" startTime="498.187" stopTime="498.758">
    Mr. Carter G. Phillips 
    Thank you, Your Honor.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="498.758" stopTime="514.546">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Isn't it also relevant, Mr. Phillips, that... and... the Chapter 13 proposal was not that your client get the security back at whatever value, but that the security remain in the hands of the debtor and continue to depreciate?
speaker="carter_g_phillips" startTime="514.546" stopTime="536.061">
    Mr. Carter G. Phillips 
    That's... that's... that's exactly right, Mr. Chief Justice. 
    And... and the point I was starting to move toward, which is the rule of construction, that the Fifth Circuit relied upon and that I think, really, is where they made the fundamental error in this case, is by saying that the State law rights that are implicated here favor requiring us to show by clear and unambiguous language that our interpretation of the statute is the correct one--
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="536.061" stopTime="589.606">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Mr. Phillips, may I... may I ask you about the Fifth Circuit, because I thought that the main point for Judge King was based on the Federal statute as much... well, more than the State law point that you were about to deal with. 
    She looked to 1325, and she said, now there are two things the debtor can do in this situation. 
    And one is surrender the collateral. 
    Give it back to the creditor. 
    And then it would have what's been called wholesale value. 
    The other thing is leave it with the debtor and value it. 
    The question that she put was, why should there be different results whether which of those two routes the creditor who doesn't want to go along with the reorganization... which... which route that is... is picked by the debtor.
speaker="carter_g_phillips" startTime="589.606" stopTime="622.488">
    Mr. Carter G. Phillips 
    --Right. 
    And the answer to that is twofold. 
    One is that the language suggests... proposed disposition or proposed use... which suggests that there are different methods of valuation. 
    And second of all, there's no reason to assume equivalence between what you do if you give up the property and what you do when you retain the property and use it as part of a successful reorganization. 
    There's clearly a difference in the valuation. 
    Both parties agree on that. 
    And the only question is who should get the benefit of the difference in the valuation. 
    If you use always a hypothetical foreclosure value, then... then... then there's... you never have any advantages.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="622.488" stopTime="647.345">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    But I thought the question was putting... what... what rationale would the legislature have for having two different... one much more favorable to the secured creditor? 
    And I thought that that was the point. 
    Wouldn't one logically expect, in the balance between the secured and unsecured, either of those routes to yield the same end result?
speaker="carter_g_phillips" startTime="647.345" stopTime="685.620">
    Mr. Carter G. Phillips 
    Well, again, I don't think so. 
    And the reason is, in part, the Congress envisioned that there would be negotiations between the parties on these kinds of issues. 
    And you can only negotiate if you have some kind of differential in the valuations. 
    And if you use the same hypothetical foreclosure valuation, you'll always end up with the same number. 
    Which means there is no basis for negotiation between the debtor and the creditor in any particular case. 
    And it seems clearly... and there's nothing in anything that supports the notion that going along on the disposed use... I mean going along with the proposed use, as opposed to proposed disposition, is meant to get you to the same value. 
    It doesn't. 
    The assumption is, is that it will create more value, because it's going to be used.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="685.620" stopTime="697.488">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    If... if that is your... your theory, if we adopt that theory, then would it be an abuse of discretion or a violation of the statute for a judge... a bankruptcy judge to adopt Judge Posner's solution, which is just split the difference?
speaker="carter_g_phillips" startTime="697.488" stopTime="722.863">
    Mr. Carter G. Phillips 
    Yeah, it would be a violation of the statute, because, again, the statute tells you to look at the proposed use or proposed disposition, and... and Judge Posner's analysis does neither of those things. 
    It does an amalgam of the two. 
    And so, therefore, it has no statutory basis. 
    It's much like the rule that the Court condemned in BFP, the 70 percent rule, that said if you deviate by 70 percent. 
    I mean it's a good rule and it might make good policy and Congress might want to adopt it, but there's nothing in the statute that... that remotely supports it.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="722.863" stopTime="749.661">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    But, in particular-- 
    --Go on. 
    No, please. 
    Go. 
    In particular cases that might be a sensible thing for... for the... for the judge to do, I take it. 
    The judge might very well say, well, you know, I don't know whether they buy it for a dollar more than the foreclosure value or a dollar less than retail. 
    And the evidence is unclear. 
    So the only fair thing for me to do in this particular case is to split the difference. 
    I... I take it you're not ruling out that possibility in individual cases, or are you?
speaker="carter_g_phillips" startTime="749.661" stopTime="762.541">
    Mr. Carter G. Phillips 
    Well, I'd have to see the particular case. 
    It seems to me that if the evidence in the record is that there are two very distinct appraisal values and they are supported by solid testimony, it seems to me you'd probably be obliged to take one rather than the other, rather than split the difference.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="762.541" stopTime="784.685">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    Well, one party says, well... we... we can reasonably hypothesize three bidders at the foreclosure for the... for the disposal of the... of the property, and there's a fight about that. 
    There might be cases in which the court could say, look, I... I... I can't calibrate these probabilities, and the only sensible thing to do is to say it's somewhere in the middle. 
    You don't rule out that?
speaker="carter_g_phillips" startTime="784.685" stopTime="798.722">
    Mr. Carter G. Phillips 
    I don't rule that out. 
    The important part about that, though, to keep in mind is, is that's not the difference between the hypothetical foreclosure value and the use value. 
    What I'm looking at... what you're talking about are two different use values and trying to resolve those by splitting the difference.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="798.722" stopTime="804.318">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    But your argument is you simply cannot construe the statute, as a matter of law, to require that median figure?

    Mr. Carter G. Phillips 
    That's correct.

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Mr. Phillips, let me ask, while I do not agree with Justice Breyer's suggestion that the valuation should be whatever it takes to enable the 13 to proceed, there is some textual basis for... for saying that. 
    What meaning do you give to the... to the other portion? 
    You say both parties agree as to what the purpose of the valuation was. 
    But... but what... what is the meaning of that: Such value shall be determined... we're discussing here... in light of the proposed disposition or use? 
    But it also says: in light of the purpose of the valuation. 
    What... what does that mean?

    And a lot of different purposes. 
    Why would its valuation be different for one purpose rather than another? 
    I'm not sure.

    Mr. Carter G. Phillips 
    --Well, it depends on--

    Give me an example of... of--

    Mr. Carter G. Phillips 
    --Of a situation where that--

    --in which the purpose would... would... would produce a different valuation.
speaker="carter_g_phillips" startTime="855.069" stopTime="867.116">
    Mr. Carter G. Phillips 
    --Well, my guess is it might make a difference whether or not you are trying to decide whether the outstanding debt puts you into Chapter 13 in the first place, because there are limits on how much debt you can carry into Chapter 13. 
    So you might value that differently.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="867.116" stopTime="868.568">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Now, why... why should that affect the valuation you give?
speaker="carter_g_phillips" startTime="868.568" stopTime="886.801">
    Mr. Carter G. Phillips 
    Well, if Congress had made clear... and... and I'm speculating here, because I don't know the answer to this... but if Congress indicated a preference at the edges to have more cases into Chapter 13, where it's close, you might, under those circumstances, attempt to value the outstanding debt in a way that would make it, you know, less in order to bring them into Chapter 13.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="886.801" stopTime="889.283">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Okay. 
    But you don't think Congress has indicated any preference for Section... for Chapter 13?
speaker="carter_g_phillips" startTime="889.283" stopTime="930.861">
    Mr. Carter G. Phillips 
    Not... not with the language "proposed disposition or use". 
    I think what Congress has clearly indicated is that if you have a proposed use, then you should value it from the perspective of what the debtor would pay in order to be able to acquire that exact same property and to use it. 
    And... and I think it's important... I want to go back to the rule of construction, because I think it's vital to the... the proper outcome of this case. 
    We're dealing with a situation here where the Court of Appeals said that the problem is... is that your rights under State law are measured by foreclosure value. 
    Now, our rights are not measured by the foreclosure value. 
    Our rights are measured by the lien. 
    And the lien, it protects us all the way through to the actual payment. 
    It's supposed to protect the stream of payments. 
    That's the vital element of what our State rights are. 
    And to come in here--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="930.861" stopTime="936.534">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Yes, but it only gives that protection to the extent that there... the value of the lien can be realized through sale of the collateral.
speaker="carter_g_phillips" startTime="936.534" stopTime="955.825">
    Mr. Carter G. Phillips 
    --No, that's not true, Your Honor. 
    I mean it is true that you have a remedy to sell the collateral, but that's not the end of your right. 
    You're still entitled to a judgment for the amount of the debt that's outstanding. 
    And that's how your State law right is defined. 
    And that really is the mistake that the Court of Appeals made. 
    We have a much broader State law right, which ought to be valued here. 
    And this Court said both Radford and in--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="955.825" stopTime="960.379">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    I'm really puzzled by that.

   Argument of Kent L. Jones
speaker="kent_l_jones" startTime="1022.820" stopTime="1049.778">
    Mr. Kent L. Jones 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    The common sense... the history of the statute, in this Court's opinion in Whiting Pools, all reflect that when collateral is retained for the use of the debtor, it has a going concern or fair market value that exceeds its liquidation value and that enhances the value of the secured claim. 
    This additional value--

    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Mr. Kent, could you... could you explain to me, then, what Judge Easterbrook meant, because you just made this common sense proposition. 
    This is quoted in the appendix to the petition for cert at 30-31... it's something the Fifth Circuit seemed to rely on... that there was no real difference between these two values when you take out of the so-called retail value the things that don't relate to the object itself.
speaker="kent_l_jones" startTime="1075.165" stopTime="1082.008">
    Mr. Kent L. Jones 
    --Well, Judge Easterbrook, in that part of his opinion, in the, what, Hansen case, I believe, was... was thinking--
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="1082.008" stopTime="1083.370">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Samson against Alton Bank.
speaker="kent_l_jones" startTime="1083.370" stopTime="1127.390">
    Mr. Kent L. Jones 
    --Ah, okay. 
    Judge... that's a different opinion than the one I was referring to. 
    What Judge Easterbrook may have been referring to is the difference between cost, replacement cost, and value. 
    Replacement cost could include items that would not need to be spent if the item were to be replaced from the own inventory, if you will, of the debtor. 
    But that doesn't have... that cost doesn't relate to the value of the asset. 
    The value of the asset is dependent upon what... is dependent upon what the use... what use can be made of it. 
    And a debtor can't reasonably say that the value of the asset in his possession has a different value than it would in the possession of anyone else who used the same sort of property. 
    Congress used an objective term, "value". 
    And value in that sense is what--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1127.390" stopTime="1131.213">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    May I, just before... you're talking about replacement... market value rather than replacement cost?
speaker="kent_l_jones" startTime="1131.213" stopTime="1148.823">
    Mr. Kent L. Jones 
    --Replacement cost is... is a term that can be used to describe value in the sense that value is what a willing buyer would pay a willing seller to... for the right to use the same property. 
    That's the way the Court defined it in the BFP case. 
    And there's something important in BFP that really is--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1148.823" stopTime="1151.964">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    In your submission, is that the same or different from replacement cost?
speaker="kent_l_jones" startTime="1151.964" stopTime="1160.361">
    Mr. Kent L. Jones 
    --Well, replacement cost is normally what a willing buyer would pay a willing--

    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    You can't answer it yes or no, our favorite thing to lawyers?
speaker="kent_l_jones" startTime="1161.671" stopTime="1163.443">
    Mr. Kent L. Jones 
    --Well, I would say it's the same, but I--
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="1163.443" stopTime="1163.842">
    Unknown Speaker 
    It's the same, okay.
speaker="kent_l_jones" startTime="1163.842" stopTime="1205.621">
    Mr. Kent L. Jones 
    --But I... but... but it depends on who is paying it. 
    I mean if you use the objective concept of the willing buyer and the willing seller, it's the same. 
    Yes. 
    BFP makes the point that the difference between a liquidation value and a fair market value is that fair market value is realized if an ample opportunity is given to realize the full value of the collateral. 
    That's exactly what a Chapter 11 and Chapter 13 reorganization do. 
    They give the debtor the opportunity, the ample opportunities, the Court said in BFP, to realize the full value of the collateral. 
    Now, that is the value... the difference between the fair market value and the liquidation value, that premium or surplus, whatever you want to call it, is the heart of the reorganization concept.

    --As a practical matter, it seems to me they might be pretty close together.
speaker="kent_l_jones" startTime="1227.487" stopTime="1341.461">
    Mr. Kent L. Jones 
    --What... what Section 506(a) does, by distinguishing between disposition and use, distinguishes between a liquidation and a reorganization. 
    And in a reorganization, what Congress had in mind was that there would be this surplus value created. 
    It's... it's like Pareto optimality. 
    Everyone, debtor and creditor alike, are going to be made better off. 
    And no one is going to be made worse off than they would be in a liquidation. 
    The provisions of Sections 1325 and 1129 that... that invoke this valuation process make clear that Congress didn't intend a liquidation value to apply when collateral is retained by the debtor. 
    There is a little bit of text here, but I've got to go through it. 
    1325(a)(5) and 1129(b)(2) both provide that the debtor can retain the collateral in a reorganization if it pays the allowed amount of the secured claim as determined under Section 506. 
    Sections 1325(a)(4) and 1129(a)(7), by contrast, say that an unsecured creditor is only guaranteed to get, in a reorganization, what he would get if the property had been liquidated. 
    So Congress clearly distinguished between the treatment of a security... secured claim and an unsecured claim in reorganizations. 
    What the Court of Appeals did in this case was to say, we're going to give them exactly the same train, we're going to... treatment... we're going to abolish the distinction, because a secured creditor, like an unsecured creditor, will only receive the liquidation value of the asset... what he would have gotten if there had been a liquidation. 
    That result plainly violates a fundamental principle of statutory interpretation, because it nullifies the careful distinctions that Congress made between secured and unsecured claims in these reorganization cases. 
    Section 506(a) itself, of course, specifies that this value is to be determined based upon the proposed disposition and use of the property.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="1341.461" stopTime="1347.225">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Yes. 
    And what... do you have any notion as to what the other thing, in... in light of the purpose of the valuation... do you have any notion--
speaker="kent_l_jones" startTime="1347.225" stopTime="1367.077">
    Mr. Kent L. Jones 
    Well, an example of a... of a different purpose for the valuation would be to... when a creditor wants adequate protection for the use... for the temporary use of the asset during the period before... during... for example, before a liquidation or at some point during the process of the reorganization. 
    361--
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="1367.077" stopTime="1370.239">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    --Well, why would you give it a different valuation for that purpose than you would for--
speaker="kent_l_jones" startTime="1370.239" stopTime="1404.552">
    Mr. Kent L. Jones 
    --Well, it's not some... it's not necessarily the... I'm no... I can't answer, in the abstract, that there would be a different valuation for that. 
    It's just that you would want to know what the purpose of the valuation was. 
    Because, in 361, when you're determining whether... what you're supposed to decide is whether the collateral is diminishing in value by its use during the reorganization procedures. 
    And so, in deciding how much it's diminishing in value, I suppose you... the purpose would be to focus on that. 
    Whereas here, the purpose is to determine what is the value to be realized from the use of the collateral... what would a willing buyer pay a willing seller for the right.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1404.552" stopTime="1417.971">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    --You're always going to have a possible difference in valuation. 
    If you simply take something out and sell it at forced sale as opposed to, say, renting it for a couple of years and... with an assured tenant, there is going to be a difference in valuation.

    Mr. Kent L. Jones 
    Absolutely. 
    And... and in Whiting Pools, this Court noted that Congress fully understood that you... that... that the... in a reorganization, when the debtor is allowed to retain the collateral, that the... the value would be greater than what I think the Court said it would be if they scrapped it, if they sold it at a foreclosure sale. 
    And in BFP, as I've already mentioned, the Court explained that the difference... well, I didn't mention this... I meant to... that in BFP--

    That is what reorganizations give you. 
    They give you that ample opportunity to get that value.

    Mr. Kent L. Jones 
    The only reason we're... the only purpose of the valuation involved in this case is if he does qualify for a 13, if there is a surplus that will be realized. 
    Sometimes debtors can't--

    Mr. Kent L. Jones 
    --Sometimes debtors' business situation is such that they cannot... they cannot generate the surplus. 
    They cannot... don't forget, 1325(a)(5)(B) will require that debtor to pay the value of this collateral if he's going to use it. 
    And Chapter 13 is only available if a debtor can meet that requirement. 
    And a debtor who can't meet that requirement, because, for example, his business roots might... might... might not recognize the income available from such an asset, is a... is a debtor who may not qualify under Chapter 13. 
    Congress did not mean to let anyone qualify. 
    They were very severe about the requirements.

    Justice John Paul Stevens

speaker="kent_l_jones" startTime="1563.625" stopTime="1593.365">
    Mr. Kent L. Jones 
    Well, that's exactly what he has to give unsecured creditors. 
    That's what he has to make sure unsecured creditors get. 
    And that was the point I was making earlier. 
    1325(a)(5) says that for a secured creditor, he's got to give them the allowed amount of the allowed secured claim as determined under Section 506. 
    By doing that, Congress meant clearly to provide a different result for the secured creditor than the unsecured creditor. 
    But what the Court did here was to treat them identically. 
    And that deprived the words of the statute of any plausible meaning.

    Mr. John J. Durkay 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    The issue before the Court today is the value of a truck. 
    And the context is this: Instead of allowing the secured creditor to take back the truck and put it on the market to sell, the debtor is going to be allowed to retain the truck and use it in his business. 
    If I can make one comment, Chief Justice Rehnquist, about that that came up in one of your statements of concern earlier. 
    Remember, the secured... the debtor is not just going to retain the collateral. 
    He's going to do a lot more than that. 
    He's going to be required, under the system to pay interest. 
    He's going to be required to answer to the strongest collection agent in the country, the Chapter 13 trustee. 
    The minute he's late there's going to be a motion to dismiss the bankruptcy. 
    He's got to maintain full insurance at all times.

    Mr. John J. Durkay 
    The secured creditor can insist that that depreciation never be faster than the amount of payments.

    Mr. John J. Durkay 
    Correct. 
    Finally, of course, he has to promise to preserve and maintain the collateral. 
    You know, your point is well taken in this sense. 
    But, remember, nobody knows what property is going to be worth in the future. 
    That's part of what we're doing. 
    We're trying to find out. 
    Now, one of the things we do to try and find out is we go to people that know. 
    I'd like to raise another question, I think, that's been raised already in argument, that there were two experts here. 
    If you read in the transcript on page 90, at the end of the hearing, the bankruptcy judge said there's only been one expert in this case. 
    One of the problems with the whole posturing of the case to this point in time, from the point of view of understanding where it's coming from, is in order to make sure that the Rashes were going to win their hearing and get a good confirmal plan, Mr. Baron and I made a tactical decision that we weren't going to come in and try to prove a forced sale or foreclosure sale or any of that. 
    We brought an appraiser in, who testified as to fair market value. 
    The fair market value of this truck is $31,875. 
    And the judge, listening to the testimony, totally rejected the so-called testimony of... brought by the Associates. 
    The witness from the Associates had never seen the truck. 
    He admitted it.

    Mr. John J. Durkay 
    I think, in the bottom line, what reorganization is all about is trying to create value, as opposed to Chapter 7, which is liquidation, close the door, let's see what we've got. 
    The way you measure whether or not a reorganization is a good reorganization is you measure it against the standard of what would happen in a 7. 
    If we're going to have a 7, what are the results? 
    That's what is the so-called liquidation analysis, the Chapter 7 analysis. 
    All right. 
    Now, if its reorganization is able to do better than that, okay, it probably should go forward. 
    That's the goal, to do better than the straight liquidation. 
    In this case, there are a lot of parties that are then going to look to that additional amount of money. 
    The Rashes get to live on some of the money that they make, within the bounds of the disposable income test. 
    The Chapter 13 trustee in the system gets some compensation. 
    At the point in time when you begin to distribute this extra value, this extra value is almost totally attributable to the fact that an individual made a commitment to go to work in this context, in this system. 
    He did that because he wanted to pay his bills. 
    That should be shared among the creditors on a fair basis.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="2028.410" stopTime="2043.721">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    So is the unsecured creditors' additional income that they... that they derive from letting this person stay in business. 
    And you say, you know, that's the deal, by letting him stay in business, you get more than you otherwise would.
speaker="john_j_durkay" startTime="2043.721" stopTime="2044.229">

    Correct.

speaker="john_j_durkay" startTime="2050.864" stopTime="2055.148">
    Mr. John J. Durkay

speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="2055.148" stopTime="2072.128">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    It would seem to me Congress wants to preserve the security and... and wanted to give the secured creditor a benefit in Chapter 13, just as it gives to unsecured creditors a benefit. 
    But you're not giving him any... any benefit as a secured creditor. 
    You're... you're treating him as though the whole thing came to an end, then, although... although you don't treat the unsecured creditors that way.
speaker="john_j_durkay" startTime="2072.128" stopTime="2087.909">
    Mr. John J. Durkay 
    Well, I guess my simple answer, Justice Scalia, is I don't... I understand that, but I don't find any... anything in 506 that says that one of the things you take a look at is a... a premium or a kicker to the secured, for the privilege of allowing this to happen. 
    The secured has to allow it to happen.

    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Mr. Durkay, can I interrupt, just to be sure? 
    I may not understand it right. 
    But I thought that the... to the extent that the secured creditor does not realize on the collateral, he's an unsecured creditor.
speaker="john_j_durkay" startTime="2097.715" stopTime="2098.026">
    Mr. John J. Durkay 
    Correct.

    --I guess--

    It's rather odd that the secured creditors are the one class that... that are not treated any better.

    Mr. John J. Durkay 
    --As a creditor, they are treated better. 
    Their collateral isn't treated better. 
    They get the same good deal that any unsecured creditor gets to participate in the fruits of the successful reorganization. 
    And, frankly, a secured creditor's incentive is exactly that. 
    Now, a secured creditor can still say, even though I made $2,000 more, I don't want to do this, because I don't want to have to fool with this, among all these cases. 
    But that's what Congress said, no, you do have to. 
    That's the difference--
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="2174.876" stopTime="2187.065">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    Are... are there other cases which are not maybe quite so close as the one involving a truck? 
    Suppose there's a business where the secured property is all... is all fixed, is machinery, a small business like a laundromat or something.
speaker="john_j_durkay" startTime="2187.065" stopTime="2187.285">

    Justice David H. Souter 
    And the... the foreclosure value of this... of this is... when it's taken out is very, very low, because the machinery is ripped out and sold for almost scrap. 
    It doesn't seem fair that... that that should be the sole value, if the option... the alternative is to keep this business as a going business, where the... where, in place, the machinery is worth much, much more. 
    I think this case is a little distorted because we have a truck and we're all used to the idea of bluebook values and so forth.

    Mr. John J. Durkay 
    Well, in... in the case you give, again, if the laundromat operates, it's going to raise revenue for the... the secureds, generally, including the unsecured. 
    That's why, really, part of the scheme is the bifurcation of claim. 
    The secured creditor comes in, it's undersecured, and they get two claims. 
    They have the status as secured creditor... that's defined one way... then--
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="2238.238" stopTime="2241.020">
    Justice David H. Souter

    Mr. John J. Durkay 
    --Correct. 
    Let me... let me address that issue specifically, and Justice Breyer's comments about the discretion of the bankruptcy judge. 
    There are three key words in 506 that you can't lose sight of. 
    Those three key words are "in light of". 
    What 506 requires the... the judge to do is to put the valuation in a context. 
    It used to be... this was a very common practice in the Southern District... when you first file a bankruptcy, you'd go in and you'd value everything, sight unseen, to see what kind of hand you got dealt. 
    Then you'd start to work your reorganization theory based on the fixed values that were set down. 
    That's not how you do it. 
    What 506 says, when you conduct a valuation, put it in context. 
    Why are you getting this valuation? 
    What do you plan to do with the property? 
    What are you contemplating? 
    What are the res judicata effects? 
    What are the collateral estoppel effects? 
    What's this going to mean in the real world of this bankruptcy? 
    But it says "in light of". 
    It says put it in a context. 
    There's no mandatory language there. 
    There's... the judge has... has eminent discretion in connection with this factfinding process to come up with what you're really asking him to do, which is the common sense answer, in context.

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    --And don't you think all of the appraisers would agree that if there had to be a forced sale in 30 days, the value would be less than if they were allowed a year to find a buyer?
speaker="john_j_durkay" startTime="2351.724" stopTime="2417.124">
    Mr. John J. Durkay 
    Absolutely. 
    Justice Rehnquist, the formulation I propose, which is the net proceeds to the secured creditor on repossession and liquidation of collateral, doesn't require that you have to consider a forced sale. 
    I... I don't see why you can't allow the secured creditor the luxury of coming in and saying, I would do better than that. 
    In fact, at the trial, that was exactly the Associates' position. 
    They said, you shouldn't hang us with wholesale because we can get retail when we sell our collateral. 
    The only problem was their witness said they couldn't. 
    He said he saw 15 sales and nobody showed up at 12 at... of them and he just said that was company policy. 
    A secured creditor ought to be able to come in and say, if I hold this property. 
    In fact, there's a very simple way to do this. 
    I mean what the secured creditor does is he comes in with a buyer with a commitment. 
    That's good... that's how a trustee would do it. 
    He wouldn't say, I think it's worth this, I think it's worth that. 
    He'd go find a buyer that's willing to sign up to that. 
    To... to take a good example... and the reason why the United States is here... and there's some real problems, I think, with the presence of the United States in this case and the posture they're taking. 
    Of course, they're here because of the Taffi case. 
    The Taffi case--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2417.124" stopTime="2418.116">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    The... the what case?
speaker="john_j_durkay" startTime="2418.116" stopTime="2473.682">
    Mr. John J. Durkay 
    --The Taffi case. 
    In... in the Taffi case, In re Taffi, which is the Ninth Circuit case that... that has come here in connection with this, there was a stipulation presented that the home had a fair market value of 300 and a forced sale value of 250. 
    And the... and the first and second liens were 233,000, and the question then was, what was the value of the IRS claim. 
    Well, in the first place, as a practical matter, you're not going to find an appraiser... you're not going to find an appraiser willing, to give any value to that third lien. 
    That's so far back in the train, that caboose just doesn't have value. 
    To give, in the stipulation, any value at all to the IRS was very generous. 
    But, secondly, and more importantly, in the real world of bankruptcy, the general way that would be handled is if you're a third lien and you really think there is equity in that collateral, you write a check to the first and second and take the first position. 
    This isn't a... a formula or a mathematics. 
    This is real business in the real world.

    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    But in... in that context, assuming, which I do think this statute is really opaque on this question, you can make excellent arguments on both sides. 
    So... so if you think what Justice Kennedy said, which is that in many businesses, perhaps small businesses, the creditor doesn't really expect to repossess and sell?

    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    It seems to me, Mr. Durkay, that in agreeing with all of this, you understate the position of the... of the secured creditor. 
    It isn't just that he has the... the power to get back the distress value of... of what he's able to yank, but he is able to say to the... to the businessman, you pay me what you owe me or I'm going to close your business down by taking away the washing machines or whatever you have that's essential for your business. 
    So the businessman says, well, I'll pay you first, because you can close me down entirely. 
    Now, you're setting up a Chapter 13, which deprives him of that benefit of being able to close the... the business down. 
    And yet, at the same time, you're telling this... this debtor that he doesn't have to pay him what he would have been able to... to extract from him had there not been a Chapter 13.

    Mr. John J. Durkay 
    --Justice Scalia, I totally agree with you in the way you frame your hypothetical. 
    What puzzles me is what you've said is what I've said all along, which is the only reason that the Associates wants this extra value is to have leverage and power in the transaction. 
    And the one thing the United States Congress said was, we're not going to play a power game. 
    The bankruptcy court is going to hand out assets fairly. 
    And we're not going to accommodate the leverage, the power, the authority, or the transaction. 
    That's gone.

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Well, they say... they say they're not going to let the... they're not going to let the... the secured party prevent the Chapter 13. 
    But it... it's the whole purpose of... of this discussion to... to determine whether they have said, we're going to, moreover, deprive the... the secured creditor of... of the value that he has of... of keeping the business a going concern, so that he can get his money out.
speaker="john_j_durkay" startTime="2666.929" stopTime="2694.107">
    Mr. John J. Durkay 
    That isn't value in an appraisal sense. 
    That's power and it's leverage. 
    Right off the bat, when a bankruptcy is filed, that secured creditor is told, hands off, you're stayed. 
    That power and leverage is gone until the court says otherwise. 
    And as long as you can extract the economic value of your loss, your depreciation, over time, adequate protection, that stay is going to stay in effect. 
    This is a... this is a debtor remedial statute.

    May I ask you a question that was prompted by the example you gave earlier. 
    Supposing in this case, just as the bankruptcy judge was about to rule, the creditor, the secured creditor, got a buyer, somebody who was interested in antique Kenworth trucks or something.

    What is your explanation of that language?

    The strong position I took with the Fifth Circuit that's embodied in the King opinion is that it is a genuine non sequitur to say that simply because the debtor proposes to retain the value... the property... in and of itself, it suddenly has an inherently enhanced value. 
    You have to think about those issues, but it doesn't automatically follow that that means that number changes.

    Mr. John J. Durkay 
    The trustee comes in and says, I want to sell the Kenworth. 
    It's a Chapter 7 now. 
    And the reason I want to sell it is I think I can get $50,000 for it at auction. 
    And that's equity above and beyond what the Associates claims their first lien is. 
    And for my first witness I'm going to call a fellow and he's going to come in and he's going to give an income valuation of that truck that says it's worth $50,000. 
    The judge would say, wait a minute, you're proposing to auction this property. 
    What are you going to get at auction? 
    I don't want to hear about what somebody says it's worth on an income approach. 
    You're saying, I'm going to auction it; what's the auction value? 
    That's the proposed user disposition. 
    And under those circumstances, that language gives you a little bit of information. 
    Remember how much ground 506 has to cover. 
    I mean it has to cover every imaginable type of property and every proceeding and bankruptcy, and that's a lot of ground. 
    You know, if you read 506, and you sit it next to the Canons of Ethics of the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice that tell you what an appraiser needs to know before conducting an appraisal, the language is remarkably similar. 
    It's remarkably similar. 
    What both are saying is, do this in the real world, in context. 
    No hypotheticals, no theoreticals. 
    Let the appraisers know everything there is to know. 
    Give accurate, honest answers. 
    Judge, take all the proper context into consideration before you make your determination. 
    Don't do any blind appraisals.

    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Well, are you suggesting that in the hypothetical that Justice Kennedy gave, where you've got a laundromat and the forced sale would be almost zero, but the income-generating value of the property would be significant, that there you would use some kind of a... a cash flow valuation?
speaker="john_j_durkay" startTime="2976.863" stopTime="2984.980">
    Mr. John J. Durkay 
    You might be able to do that. 
    Correct. 
    If... if an appraiser were able to provide that kind of analysis, that may well be acceptable. 
    But under this scenario--

    And he would get the cash flow. 
    He'd come in and start operating it. 
    I mean you're going to have to have some good evidence on this, but that's at least theoretically possible. 
    In the case of a truck, there's no going-concern value for a truck. 
    The truck is a truck is a truck.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="3008.144" stopTime="3020.272">

    Mr. John J. Durkay 
    Yes. 
    I can't say it's the only... but, yes.

    Justice Antonin Scalia

    Mr. John J. Durkay 
    And the secured creditor gets all the cash flow from the operation of the laundromat, because he's probably the major unsecured. 
    Remember, he's got that backup position. 
    Now, one thing, also, to do with 506 that I think is important, don't use 506 to judge the quality of the bankruptcy. 
    There are a lot of other provisions in the Bankruptcy Code the judge can use, such as the good-faith provisions, the liquidation analysis, et cetera, that are going to make sure that these are good bankruptcies, that they're not bad deals, they're not bad outcomes. 
    They don't really harm creditors unnecessarily. 
    506 is one component. 
    If you get a scenario that says, well, I really don't like the way this spins down, in terms of what the bankruptcy looks like... I mean remember that you've got a common sense judge watching that and saying, well, that still doesn't mean you're going to get your bankruptcy.

    Mr. John J. Durkay 
    The simple formula I used here is I just don't think you can say that when Mr. Rash told the Associates he wanted to keep the truck, poof, it was suddenly now more valuable.

    It's the same truck. 
    You know, the comment that was made in en banc was, well, what about the going-concern value? 
    Trucks don't have going-concern value. 
    The... trucks have a ready market. 
    You know what they're worth. 
    You can find the market. 
    It's very easy to determine what that truck is worth, what it can be bought and sold for. 
    You know, if you look, for example, at the Petitioner's reply brief, in discussing BFP and this issue, they toggle back and forth... here... what I'm talking about is... is page 14, 15 and 16. 
    They say that the value should be based on what the debtor would have to pay... quoting BFP... which is if offered for sale. 
    Then they say at the top of 15 that it has to be sold within the time and manner. 
    Then they go on down and say, to determine the price it's paid for. 
    In other words, they're toggling back and forth between paid and... and bought. 
    Get on... get in the boat or get on the shore. 
    I mean you can't flip back and forth between what the buy price is and what the sale price is in the retail context.

    Mr. Carter G. Phillips 
    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 
    I'll try to be short or briefer than that. 
    I think, ultimately, the case could be disposed of based on, essentially, Justice Scalia's question, which is, you have language that says "proposed disposition or proposed use". 
    And we... every example he gave talked about auctions, talked about sales. 
    He's got lots of use for the language 506(a). 
    And... and, in fact, if you look in his brief, he doesn't offer up an explanation of what that language is designed to mean. 
    And the only brief on their side is the one amicus brief says that 12 proceeding. 
    And it's reasonably clear to me that, to have to stretch that far to find some meaning in this particular language, tells you that their interpretation really eliminates the "proposed use" term.

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Of course, "proposed use" doesn't really lead you to "retail value" necessarily.

    Mr. Carter G. Phillips 
    Well, what... what it leads you to, ultimately... and the value we're looking for and the rule we ask for is what it would cost the debtor to purchase the same property in the open market. 
    And that's the fair market value.

    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    But why isn't that the same as the fair market value of this truck, as appraised?
speaker="carter_g_phillips" startTime="3369.852" stopTime="3371.653">
    Mr. Carter G. Phillips 
    Because the--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="3371.653" stopTime="3372.985">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Or is it? 
    I'm not sure whether or not--
speaker="carter_g_phillips" startTime="3372.985" stopTime="3378.478">
    Mr. Carter G. Phillips 
    --Well, it... it is. 
    It's the... I mean if he had to go out and buy this truck today, it would have cost him either 41,000 or--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="3378.478" stopTime="3390.815">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    --But why is that different from what it can be sold for if you have fair opportunity to offer it in the market? 
    Why is there... I... I must confess, I should have asked this in the very beginning... but why is the fair market diff... value... different, depending on whether you're the buyer or the seller?
speaker="carter_g_phillips" startTime="3390.815" stopTime="3396.158">
    Mr. Carter G. Phillips 
    --Because of the differences of what you can get for it. 
    I mean I realize that's tautological, but I mean--
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="3396.158" stopTime="3397.798">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    But you're saying there are two different markets.
speaker="carter_g_phillips" startTime="3397.798" stopTime="3398.419">
    Mr. Carter G. Phillips 
    --Yes, exactly.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="3398.419" stopTime="3398.590">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Yeah.
speaker="carter_g_phillips" startTime="3398.590" stopTime="3400.653">
    Mr. Carter G. Phillips 
    It's the market that... that determines it.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="3400.653" stopTime="3418.833">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Well, I would have thought the difference might be what you have to pay somebody, by way of a commission, to sell it for you. 
    I mean if the debtor is going to keep it, it isn't going to be sold. 
    But if the creditor is going to take it back and sell it, they're going to have to pay something to somebody to do that, in effect--
speaker="carter_g_phillips" startTime="3418.833" stopTime="3419.784">
    Mr. Carter G. Phillips 
    That's true. 
    And--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="3419.784" stopTime="3422.195">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    --typically. 
    And I thought that was the real difference.
speaker="carter_g_phillips" startTime="3422.195" stopTime="3422.385">
    Mr. Carter G. Phillips 
    --Right.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="3422.385" stopTime="3423.046">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Maybe I'm wrong.
speaker="carter_g_phillips" startTime="3423.046" stopTime="3429.481">
    Mr. Carter G. Phillips 
    No, I think that's right. 
    And that... that plays out particularly in the hypothetical foreclosure cases, where you have a foreclosure on the house and you... and you--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="3429.481" stopTime="3433.622">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Yeah, but that... that assumption means if you keep the truck, you save the commission. 
    Yeah. 
    So that would be the cheaper value.
speaker="carter_g_phillips" startTime="3433.622" stopTime="3447.682">
    Mr. Carter G. Phillips 
    --Well, except if... if you keep the truck, he wouldn't save the commission, because he... they would ask you to deduct the hypothetical cost of the commission. 
    And that's... and that... and there are some decisions to that effect. 
    But I... as... for reasons I think I've made clear, I think those decisions are wrong. 
    If there are no other questions, I would urge the Court to--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="3447.682" stopTime="3450.576">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Thank you, Mr. Phillips. 
    The case is submitted.
