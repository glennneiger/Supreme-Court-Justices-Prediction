    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    This case comes to us on certiorari from the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. 
    Respondent, Yueh-Shaio Yang and his wife, Hai-Hsia Yang, were born and married in the People’s Republic of China and subsequently moved to Taiwan. 
    In order to gain entry to the United States, they executed the following scheme: After divorcing respondent in Taiwan, Hai-Hsia, traveled to the United States in 1978 and using $60,000.00 provided by respondent, obtained a fraudulent birth certificate and passport in the name of Mary Wang, a United States citizen. 
    Respondent then remarried Hai-Hsia in Taiwan under her false identity and fraudulently obtained an immigrant visa to enter the United States as the spouse of a United States citizen. 
    In 1982, four years after his fraudulent entry, respondent submitted an application for naturalization which fraudulently stated that his wife, Mary, was a United States citizen by birth and that respondent had been lawfully admitted for permanent residence. 
    In 1985, while the respondent’s naturalization application was still pending, respondent and his wife obtained another divorce in order to permit her to obtain a visa under her true name, as the relative of a daughter who had obtained United States citizenship by then. 
    The Immigration and Naturalization Service, INS, ultimately learned of the respondents unlawful entry and in 1992 issued an order to show cause why he should not be deported. 
    Respondent conceited deportability but requested a waiver of deportation under Section 1251(a)(1)(H) of the Immigration and Nationality Act which permits the Attorney General to grant discretionary waivers to relatives of the United States citizens and permanent resident aliens. 
    The Board of Immigration Appeals denied the discretionary waiver although the Board has a general policy of not taking an alien’s entry fraud into consideration in deciding whether to waive deportation. 
    It regarded the various fraudulent acts here as going beyond the mere entry fraud in 1978. 
    The Ninth Circuit granted the respondent’s petition for review and remanded to the Board for a reweighing of the equities without consideration of respondent’s participation in the fraudulent scheme, all of which it said were inexplicably intertwined with his 1978 entry and therefore under the Board’s own policy, could not be considered. 
    We granted certiorari and we now reverse. 
    The waiver of deportation statute imposes no limitations on the factors that the Attorney General or her delegates may consider in exercising her discretion to waive deportation. 
    Although the INS has a policy of refusing to consider entry fraud, that policy is of its own invention and maybe interpreted within reason as it chooses. 
    The INS has not acted arbitrarily here. 
    It has rationally chosen to distinguish aliens such as respondent who engage in a pattern of immigration fraud from alien’s who commit a single isolated act of misrepresentation at the time of entry. 
    Thus, the decision of the Board was lawful and the judgment of the Ninth Circuit must be reversed. 
    The opinion is unanimous.
