Young v. Harper
speaker="clarence_thomas" startTime="0.000" stopTime="153.522">
    Justice Clarence Thomas 
    This comes to us on a writ of certiorari to Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit. 
    The state of Oklahoma operated two programs by which prisoners were released before the expiration of their sentences. 
    One was parole, the other was called a preparole program, full name, Preparole Conditional Supervision Program. 
    With respect to the traditional parole program, an inmate could be paroled if one third of his sentence had expired and if the Governor on the Pardon and Parole’s recommendation granted parole. 
    With respect to preparole, the Board itself, could grant preparole when Oklahoma’s prisons were overcrowded and two, the prisoner had served 15% of his sentence or her sentence. 
    The conditions under which parolees and preparolees were released were essentially identical. 
    Respondent was released on a preparole program after serving 15 years of a life sentence. 
    After five, apparently, uneventful months on the program, the Governor of Oklahoma denied him parole and he was promptly reincarcerated. 
    He filed a state habeas corpus petition contending that his summary return to prison violated the procedural protection set forth in our decision in Morrissey versus Brewer. 
    The State Trial and Appellate Courts denied habeas relief as did the Federal District Court. 
    The Tenth Circuit reversed concluding that preparole was enough like parole that respondent was entitled to the procedures set out in Morrissey. 
    In an opinion filed with the Clerk today, we affirm. 
    Preparole as it existed when responded was released was equivalent to parole as understoodin Morrissey. 
    Indeed, it appears to have different in parole in name only. 
    While the respondent’s liberty went on preparole was not unconditional, its limitations were can, if not identical to the limitations on a parolee’s release. 
    In Morrissey we held that such limitations did not render a parolee's liberty beyond procedural protection. 
    The opinion of the Court is unanimous.
