McDaniel v. Paty
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="0.000" stopTime="52.590">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    I have the judgment to announce in McDaniel against Paty. 
    The Tennessee Supreme Court held that under the constitutional laws of Tennessee or Ministers of the Gospel are barred from certain public offices. 
    For reasons stated in an opinion filed with the clerk this morning, the judgment of the Tennessee Supreme Court is reversed and the case is remanded to that court for further proceedings, not inconsistent with the opinion filed this morning. 
    Mr. Justice Brennan with whom Mr. Justice Marshall joined, filed an opinion concurring in the judgment on different grounds. 
    Mr. Justice Stewart and Mr. Justice White also filed separate opinions concurring in the judgment on different grounds. 
    Mr. Justice Blackmun took no part in the consideration or decisions of this case.
