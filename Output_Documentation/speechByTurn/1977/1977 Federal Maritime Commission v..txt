    Justice Byron R. White 
    Section 15 of the Shipping Act requires that there be filed with the Federal Maritime Commission, all agreements between carriers that regulate, destroy or prevent competition. 
    The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit held here that no collective bargaining agreement, regardless of its impact between a multi-employer bargaining unit and a union need be filed under Section 15 and in any event (Inaudible) holds that a particular agreement in this case need not be filed. 
    We reverse the Court of Appeals and disagree on both the counts and we have filed an opinion explaining why. 
    Mr. Justice Powell has filed a dissenting opinion and he is joined by Justices Brennan and Marshall. 
    Mr. Justice Blackmun took no part in the consideration or decision of the case.
