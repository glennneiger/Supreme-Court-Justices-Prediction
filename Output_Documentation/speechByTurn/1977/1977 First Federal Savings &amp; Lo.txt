    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    These two cases will be of interest to a limited segment of the Bar that practices in tax law and more narrowly in taxation by the States of various business entities. 
    They both come here by appeal from the highest Court of a state. 
    One from the State of Massachusetts and the other from the State of Iowa. 
    At least one of these cases almost certainly would not have been heard by the Court. 
    If the Court had discretion to decide whether or not to hear it. 
    They are both here under our mandatory jurisdiction where the Court must decide on the merits, cases in which a State court has upheld a State statute against a federal constitutional challenge. 
    There are examples, at least one of them, if the e kind of cases in which the Court would hope that Congress would consider removing our mandatory jurisdiction. 
    The First Federal Savings and Loan Association case involves the validity of the Massachusetts excise tax on Federal Savings and Loan Association. 
    For reasons stated in the opinion filed with the clerk we affirm the judgment of the Massachusetts Supreme Court upholding the validity of the tax. 
    With respect to part of the analysis and the opinion, Mr. Justice Blackmun has filed a dissent.
