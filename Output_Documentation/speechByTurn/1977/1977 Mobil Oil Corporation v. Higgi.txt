    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    This is a wrongful death case arising out of a fatal accident on the high seas. 
    The question is whether damages may be recovered for loss of society as well as pecuniary loss. 
    Congress has enacted a statute which only authorizes the recovery of pecuniary damages when the death occurs more than three miles from shore. 
    Inside the three-mile limit, where the statue does not apply, this Court has held, the damages for loss of society can also be recovered. 
    In this case, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, held at the same rule should be applied on a high seas because we are persuaded that the courts must apply the standard selected by Congress. 
    We reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals. 
    Mr. Justice Marshall has filed a dissenting opinion in which Mr. Justice Blackmun has joined. 
    Mr. Justice Brennan took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.
