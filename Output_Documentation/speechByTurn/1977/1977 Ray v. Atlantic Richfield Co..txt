    This case concerns the Ports and Waterways Safety Act which was passed by Congress in 1972 and which regulates navigation on various inland waters of states including the waters of Puget Sound in the state of Washington. 
    It also controls the design and operating characteristics of oil tankers. 
    In 1975, the state of Washington adopted a statute which also regulates, in substantial respects, the operating characteristics of tankers. 
    For one thing, it requires that any tanker of 50,000 tonnes or more take on a state licensed pilot, for another it requires tankers of over 40,000 tonnes to have certain design characteristics or are to be accompanied by tugs, and lastly it forbids tankers of over 125,000 tonnes from entering Puget Sound under any conditions. 
    Tanker owners and operators soon challenged the law on constitutional grounds. 
    Their principal argument was that the Ports and Waterways Safety Act occupied this field and that the Washington statute was in conflict either with specific -- either specifically or in general with the scheme of the Federal Law. 
    A three-judge court agreed with the plaintiffs and held that the Washington statute was unconstitutional in its entirety. 
    We noted probable jurisdiction and we now reverse in part and affirm in part. 
    In brief, we hold as follows. 
    First, the requirement that the tankers take on a state licensed pilot is valid as to ships in the foreign trade but invalid with respect to coast wise vessels. 
    Second, the state's design requirements cannot be enforced in face of the Federal Act. 
    Third, tankers may nevertheless be required to be accompanied by tugs. 
    Fourth, the exclusion of large tankers from the Sound is inconsistent with the federal scheme and cannot be enforced. 
    I have filed an opinion with the clerk, an opinion for the Court. 
    The opinion is joined in its entirety by the Chief Justice and Justices Stewart and Blackmun. 
    Justices Brennan, Marshall and Rehnquist join on the Parts IV and VI of the opinion and Justices Stevens and Powell join on the Parts V and VII. 
    Justice Marshall with Justices Brennan and Rehnquist agree with him, dissents in part and concurs in part in accordance with an opinion he has filed. 
    Justice Stevens has filed an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part and he's joined by Mr. Justice Powell.
