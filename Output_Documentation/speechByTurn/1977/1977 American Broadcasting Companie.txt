    Justice Byron R. White 
    This case involves a strike by Writers in the television industry. 
    Some of the union members involved in the strike were supervisors and while on their job they also did collective-bargaining work. 
    These supervisors crossed the Union picket line at the request of their employer, and while on the Job, did only their supervisory duties not any rank and file work. 
    The Union fined these union member supervisors and the Union in turn was found guilty of unfair labor practice by the National Relationship Board for interfering with the right of the employer to select his own collective-bargaining representatives contrary to Section 8 (b) (1) (b). 
    As the Board construes this Section, when the Union finds a supervisor member for crossing a picket line to do only the supervisory work, including his collective-bargaining duties, the Union commits an unfair practice. 
    This is perhaps not the only possible reading of the Act nor even perhaps the only reasonable one. 
    But the Board is charged in the first instance with construing and applying the Act, and it is not for us to interfere, unless the Board has clearly gotten off the reservation so to speak. 
    Five of us don't think it has here and so we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, which mistakingly in our view, thought that one of our prior cases, Florida Power precluded the Board from reaching the result that it did. 
    So we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals. 
    Mr. Justice Stewart has filed a dissenting opinion, and justices Brennan, Marshall, and Stevens have joined that dissent.
