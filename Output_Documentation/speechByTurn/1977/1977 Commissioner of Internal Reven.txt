    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    In this case, the Tax Court and the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit disagreed on the question whether cash meal allowances paid to New Jersey's State Police Troopers are income with in the Section 61 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code, and whether even if they are income within that Section, are nonetheless excludable under Section 119 of the Code as meals furnished for the convenience of the employer. 
    The Tax Court held that the cash payments were income within Section 61 (a) and were not excludable under Section 119. 
    The Court of Appeals took the contrary view in reversed holding that even if the payments were income under 61 (a), they were excludable under Section 119. 
    We agree with the Tax Court and disagree with the Court of Appeals. 
    We therefore reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals. 
    Mr. Justice Blackmun, joined by the Chief Justice, dissents and has filed a dissenting opinion.
