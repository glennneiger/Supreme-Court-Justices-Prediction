    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    The other case 76-5935 Durst V. United States. 
    In this case the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, in conflict with decisions of other Courts of Appeals held that a sentencing judge replaces a youth offender on probation under section 5010 A of the Youth Corrections Act. 
    They impose a fine and order restitution, as conditions of probation. 
    Here again, we granted certiorari to resolve the conflict and we agree with the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit and affirm it's judgment. 
    Mr. Justice Blackmun took no part in consideration or decision of the case.
