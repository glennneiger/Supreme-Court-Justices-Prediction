    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    The third of the cases are consolidated number 7725, 37 and 42 Flagg Brothers Incorporate versus Brooks. 
    And these come to us from the Second Circuit, the Court of Appeals New York law grants a warehouseman, a lien for storage charges, upon goods in his possession and permits him to enforce the lien under specified circumstances by selling the stored goods. 
    In this case petitioner Flagg Brothers were a warehouseman threatened to sell respondent's belongings when they fail to pay charges claimed to be due. 
    The respondents who had stored the furniture there upon sought damages and injunctive relief in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on the ground that the sale would deprive them of their property without due process of law in violation for Fourteenth Amendment. 
    The District Court dismissed the action but the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed the District Court holding that the statute delegated to Flagg Brothers, the warehouseman in this case, an exclusive functions of the state, and therefore Flagg Brothers action was -- could be challenged under the Fourteenth Amendment. 
    We granted certiorari to consider the constitutionality of this provision of the uniform commercial code and we now reverse the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. 
    Respondents who where the people that stored the furniture contended the binding consensual resolution of disputes or I should say non-consensual resolution of disputes. 
    Since Flagg Brothers here went ahead and exercised an authority to sell after failure to pay, is a power that has been traditionally exclusively reserved to the state. 
    They ask us to expand the public function doctrine under which we have previously found state action for Fourteenth Amendment purposes when private parties have conducted elections or performed all the essential functions of municipality. 
    However in the area of commercial relations between debtors and creditors. 
    The state has not traditionally monopolized the mechanisms of dispute resolution but has recognized the availability of wide assortment of self help remedies. 
    This statute doesn't depart significantly from these traditional remedies and we decline to apply the public function doctrine here. 
    The active involvement of state official which has been shown in each of our previous decisions, which have imposed procedural limitations on creditors remedies is not present here. 
    The prohibitions of the Fourteenth Amendment therefore do not apply to the essentially private action of warehouseman such as Flagg Brothers. 
    We reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. 
    Mr. Justice Marshall has filed a dissenting opinion. 
    Mr. Justice Stevens has filed a dissenting opinion joined by Mr. Justice Marshall and Mr. Justice White. 
    Mr. Justice Brennan took no part in the consideration or decision of the case.
