    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    The other case 77-324 Hicklin V. Orbeck is here from the Supreme Court of Alaska. 
    The Supreme Court of Alaska sustained the constitutionality of an Alaska statute of popularly known as the Alaska Hire Act. 
    Hire is spelled h-i-r-e and that law requires all Alaskan oil and gas leases, easements or right away permits for oil and gas pipelines in the certain specified oil agreements. 
    To contain a requirement that qualifying Alaska residents must be hired in preference to non-residents, and that employment preference is administered by providing persons meeting certain statutory requirement for Alaskan residency with what I call resident cards that can be presented to a covered employer as proof of the job applicants Alaska residency. 
    Well, appellants are not residents of Alaska and although wanting jobs are covered by the Act, can't get them because they can't qualify for the necessary resident cards. 
    So, they brought this suit challenging Alaska Hire as violative of both the Privileges and Immunities clause of Article 4 Section 2 and the Equal Protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and the Alaska Supreme Court held that neither provision was violated and we reverse, we hold for reasons slated in the opinion filed with the clerk that Alaska Hire is invalid under the Privileges and Immunities clause which provides that the citizens of each state shall be entitled to all privileges and immunities of citizens in the several states. 
    We, therefore, reverse and have no occasion to address the question whether the Alaska Hire also violates the Equal Protection Clause.
