    Justice Potter Stewart 
    This case is here by way of direct appeal from the Supreme Court of New Jersey, Mr. Justice Brennan's old court. 
    A New Jersey law prohibits the importation of solid or liquid waste which originated or was collected outside the territorial limits of the state. 
    The issue in this case is whether this statutory prohibition is valid under the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution. 
    For the reasons discussed in the written opinion of the court filed this morning with the clerk, we hold that this state law is impermissible under the Commerce Clause and accordingly we reverse the judgment of the New Jersey Supreme Court. 
    Mr Justice Rehnquist has filed a dissenting opinion which the Chief Justice has joined.
