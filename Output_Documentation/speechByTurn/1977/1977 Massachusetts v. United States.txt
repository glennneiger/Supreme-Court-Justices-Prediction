    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Massachusetts v. the United States is here on certiorari from the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. 
    The Airport and Airway Revenue Act of 1970, a federal statute imposes an annual flat fee registration tax on all civil aircraft, including such aircraft owned by the States and by the Federal Government, that fly in the navigable airspace of the United States. 
    That tax was imposed upon a helicopter owned by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and used by the state in the state police work. 
    The Commonwealth instituted this action contending that the United States may not constitutionally impose a tax that directly affects the central and traditional state function of uprating a police force. 
    The Court of Appeals held that the registration tax was a user fee and therefore did not implicate the constitutional doctrine of the implied immunity of state governments from federal taxation. 
    We affirm, the opinion I have filed for the court is joined in its entirety by Justices White, Marshall and Stevens, but Justices Stewart and Powell joined only parts 1, 2c and 3, They have filed an opinion concurring in part and concurring in the judgment. 
    Mr. Justice Rehnquist has filed a dissenting opinion and Mr. Chief Justice has joined, Mr. Justice Blackmun took no part in the decision or consideration of the case.
