    Justice Byron R. White 
    First of these cases is Marshall, Secretary of Labor against Barlow's Inc. 
    The Section 8 (a) of the Occupational Safety and Health Act purports to authorize the inspection of most of the covered, of all the covered business establishments without a warrant and without probable cause to believe that there is a violation of the Act. 
    A three-judge District Court for the district of Idaho concluded that in this respect the Act was unconstitutional under the Fourth Amendment and the Secretary brought the case here by appeal. 
    We agree with the District Court that for all intents and purposes the issue is controlled by two cases decided in this Court a few years ago, Camara against Municipal Court and See against Seattle and as construed and applied in those cases, the Fourth Amendment as we have concluded, forbids the kinds of searches of that this Act purports to authorize. 
    Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the District Court. 
    And Mr. Justice Stevens has filed a dissenting opinion, and he is joined by Justices Blackmun and Rehnquist. 
    Mr. Justice Brennan took no part in the decision or consideration of the case.
