    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    The first of this trio is number 76-1607, Securities and Exchange Commission against Sloan. 
    The Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 empowers the Commission to summarily suspend trading in any security for a period not exceeding 10 days if in it's opinion the public interest and the protection of investors so require. 
    Acting under this authority, the Commission twice issued a series of consecutive 10-day order, suspending trading in the common stock of a corporation for over a year each time. 
    Respondent, Sloan who owns stock in that corporation challenged in the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, the Commission's statutory authority to issue these consecutive summary suspension orders. 
    The Court of Appeals agreed with respondent Sloan and held that the Commission was not empowered by Congress to issue successive orders to curtail trading in the security for a period beyond the initial 10-day period. 
    We granted certiorari at the request of the Commission. 
    In an opinion filed today with the clerk of the Court, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals. 
    Under the Act, the Commission does not have the authority based upon a single set of circumstances to issue a series of summary orders that would suspend trading and the security beyond the initial 10-day period, even though the commission periodically redetermines that such action is required by the public interest and for protection of investors. 
    Mr. Justice Brennan joined by Mr. Justice Marshall has filed an opinion concurring in the judgment. 
    Mr. Justice Blackmun has also filed an opinion concurring in the judgment.
