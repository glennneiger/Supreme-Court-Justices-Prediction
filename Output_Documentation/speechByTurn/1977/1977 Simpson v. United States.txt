    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    The petitioners in this case were convicted of committing a bank robbery with firearms. 
    And in consequence they were given enhanced sentences under statute that provides for enhanced sentences for bank robberies I quote the statute "by the use of a dangerous weapon or device.” 
    But there is another statute that provides generally that it is a crime to use a firearms to commit any felony prosecutable in a court of the United States. 
    The petitioners at the same trial were also convicted and sentenced to consecutive sentences under that statute. 
    The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed the conviction, but we reverse. 
    We hold that in a prosecution going out of a single bank robbery with firearms and accused may not be sentenced under both the enhancement provision of the bank robbery statute and under the Firearm statute. 
    Mr. Justice Rehnquist dissents has filed a dissenting opinion.
