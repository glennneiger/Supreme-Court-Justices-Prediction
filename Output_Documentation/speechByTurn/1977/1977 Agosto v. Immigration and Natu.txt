    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    This case is here on writ of certiorari of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. 
    After a series of hearing before immigration judge, a petitioner was found to be an alien. 
    Unlawfully in this country he was already deported. 
    Petitioner sought review that the decision of the Court of Appeals pursuant to section 106 (A) (5) B of the Immigration and Nationality Act. 
    That section requires a Court of Appeals to transfer the case to the District Court for a de novo hearing on any non-frivolous claim of American citizenship if "a genuine issue of material fact as to the petitioner's nationality is presented." The Court of Appeals, with judge dissenting, affirmed the deportation order, and refused to transfer the case to the District Court, apparently because petitioner had not presented "substantial evidence" in support of his claim of citizenship. 
    In the opinion filed today with clerk, we hold that the Court of Appeals erred in finding that a District Court hearing is required only when "substantial evidence" is presented in support of a citizenship claim. 
    That construction is contrary to the plain language and legislative history of the statute. 
    Rather than incorporating language requiring "substantial evidence", Congress used the same language that governs for motion for summary judgment under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 56. 
    And applying summary judgment principles in this case that therefore follows that petitioner was entitled to hearing in a District Court. 
    While the government's evidence would suffice, if uncontradicted, to establish petitioner had been born in Italy that evidence was not uncontradicted. 
    Petitioner's several witnesses testified that he had been born in this country to an Italian mother and then was sent to Italy as a small child, thus there was a genuine issue of material fact for the District Court to resolve. 
   
   
   
   Opinion Announcement of Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr.

    Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. 
    This case involves only one person, a clever and resourceful ex-convict. 
    It is important because it illustrates and may set a precedent as to how a system can be exploited. 
    I repeat some of the facts. 
    For some 11 years the government has been trying to deport petitioner, supported by authenticated documentary evidence as to his birth and marriage, the Immigration Service says that petitioner was born in Italy and entered the United States in 1966 by fraud and deception. 
    He has criminal records both in Italy and in this country. 
    Petitioner claims without documentary evidence of any kind that he was born in Cleveland. 
    Since this proceeding was instituted in 1967, there have been three separate evidentiary hearings before immigration judges, three appeals to the Board of Immigrations Appeal, one appeal to the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit and this review by the Supreme Court of the United States. 
    During this total of eight administrative and judicial proceedings, and in certain other proceedings, petitioner has told five different stories with respect to his nationality. 
    He has invented new fabrications whenever they served his purposes. 
    Not until the third hearing, some four years after the first hearing, the petitioner present any, corroborating evidence of his claim to citizenship except the birth certificate. 
    He later admitted that, that birth certificate belonged to someone else. 
    At the third hearing, he produced three witnesses, all relatives who supported to some extent, his latest accounts of his birth. 
    The account they supported was quite different from the two previous accounts petitioner himself had sworn to. 
    Again no documents of any kind were presented. 
    The case is here because a Federal Statute provides that in a case involving a claim for citizenship and after exhausting administrative proceedings. 
    A claimer may start over again with a de novo trial in a Federal District Court. 
    Provided two conditions on that. 
    One, that the claim is not frivolous and two, that the genuine issue of material fact has been presented by claimants evidence. 
    The Court today holds that petitioner has met these conditions and orders a judicial trial de novo. 
    In my view the Court arrives at this remarkable result through a series of errors. 
    First it ignores entirely the statutory requirement that the claim not be frivolous. 
    It would be difficult to think of a more frivolous claim than this one. 
    Next, the Court concludes that there is a genuine issue of material fact because of the partial support of petitioner's current story by his three relatives. 
    The Court construes the genuine issue of material fact language in the immigration statute, in the same way that this language is construed on a motion for summary judgment. 
    The analogy to a summary judgment is totally inappropriate. 
    Unlike a party opposing a summary judgment of a civil trial, petitioner already has had three full evidentiary trials before immigration judges and appeals from each of these. 
    But even if the Court's standard were not erroneous, there can be a no genuine issue of fact, where the evidence is transparently and patently false. 
    Not one of the numerous judges who have heard petitioner's meandering stories to believe him. 
    The judge who heard the three relatives testify observed that they had been coached and that, that stories differed in many respects from any previous story told by petitioner. 
    The Board of Immigration appeals on petitioner's third and last appeal concluded on the basis of the entire record, but petitioner's claim to citizenship and here I quote “has been knowingly false since it's inception.” 
    Despite this record of persistent fabrication, the court today concludes that petitioner is entitled to a de novo trial in a District Court. 
    All that has occurred during the past eleven years is prologue. 
    Petitioner's case will start afresh in a District Court as if it were new civil litigation. 
    Petitioner, therefore is free to change his testimony again to round up new relatives who will swear it. 
    If he loses once more as is completely predictable, he will have an appeal as a matter of right to the Court of Appeals and from there, he may file another petition for certiorari. 
    This additional round of proceedings could take several years. 
    Meanwhile, petitioner will continue to enjoy the privilege of living in America, a privilege that he has consistently abused. 
    My consent and what prompts me to speak at this length in dissent, is not so much that this petitioner has made a mockery of the system of justice, rather is that this Court has construed a statute in a way that invites and rewards falsehood. 
    Until today's decision, no, under today's decision, every person who is subject to deportation has it within his power by presenting transparently false testimony to obtain both protracted, administrative, and judicial proceedings extending over years. 
    The Court today has opened a unique and inviting door. 
    Mr. Justice Rehnquist joins me in this dissent.
