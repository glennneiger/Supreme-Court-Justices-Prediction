Houchins v. KQED Inc.

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    I have also for announcements, the disposition of 76-1310, Houchins against KQED Inc.. 
    Since my brother Stewart who concurs in the judgment wishes to announce and explain his views, and my brother Stevens joined by Mr. Justice Powell who dissents, both of them dissenting wishes to view the same, it would unfair on my part to ask them to explain my opinion for plurality of the court. 
    I will therefore go beyond my usual practice of announcing, only the result. 
    On its face, this case involves a claim of TV and newspaper reporters to a special right of access to enter prison facilities, to take pictures, still pictures and motion pictures for publication and for broadcasting. 
    Naturally, their chief interest is not limited to the bars and the cells, but the people, people of course make news. 
    I should say at the outset too, that we have a short course in this case, since Mr. Justice Marshall and Mr. Justice Blackmun took no part in the consideration or decision. 
    In the opinion, which I have filed for plurality, I trying to make it clear that except for protecting the privacy of prisoners as much as is reasonably possible. 
    It is a good thing, a very good thing for the public to understand more than public does about prisons in jails and the conditions in them. 
    Yet there are some limits. 
    The inmates of these institutions lose many of their civil rights and their right of privacy is necessarily limited, but they retain some rights. 
    This court has spoken often on the right of access of the media to such institutions. 
    Back in 1964, Chief Justice Warren writing for the court said this, “There are few restrictions on action which could not be clothed by ingenious arguments in the garb of decreased data flow”. 
    For example, the prohibition of unauthorized entry into the White House diminishes the citizen's opportunities to gather information he might find relevant to his opinion on the way the country is being run, but that does not make entry into the White House a First Amendment right. 
    The right to speak and publish does not carry with it the unrestrained right to gather information." 
    More recently, in the court's opinion in Branzburg against Hayes, the court stated, the First Amendment does not guarantee the press, a constitutional right of special access to information not available to the public generally. 
    And at a later point in the opinion, the court stated, Newsmen and here we should watch our language more carefully, and we should say newspersons have no constitutional right of access to the scenes of a crime or a disaster when the general public is excluded. 
    In Pell against Procunier and Saxbe against Washington Post, the court declared explicitly and without reservation essentially that the media have no constitutional right of access to prisons or their inmates beyond that afforded for the general public. 
    But I would like to come back to emphasize what to me is the real issue, the basic issue in this case, and that it is neither the claim of the media to enter and take pictures for publication and broadcast or interviewing the inmates, nor is it the question of bringing prison conditions out in to the open. 
    Anyone can visit prisons and write or speak about what they see, anyone can interview former inmates, their families and their lawyers. 
    The basic and the real question in this case is who shall decide what the access is to be? 
    Who shall decide what rights the media should have? 
    And just as in the recent snail darter case, where I thought and there was majority of the court agreed that the real issue was not what was sensible and what was sound and what was good and what was desirable, but whether Congress or judges should make the decision? 
    So here, although I strongly favor maximum public information about prisons, I agree with the prior decisions of this court which hold clearly and beyond any doubt that the right of access is not a constitutional matter, but one policy for the legislative and the executive branches. 
    Congress, some years ago passed the Freedom of Information Act opening a great deal of governmental information to the public. 
    It can do much the same for prisons and state legislatures can do likewise. 
    I am intended to my brother Stewart for an article which he published in a law journal sometime ago on this subject. 
    There he said that “the First Amendment is neither a Freedom of Information Act, nor an Official Secrets Act.” 
    Even I don't want to say that the guarantees or freedom of the press and these were his words, end of speech “established the context for information, not its resolution, for the rest,” he continued, “We must rely as so often in our system on the tug and pull of the political forces in American society. 
    Grand juries, prosecutors, legislative committees can enter prisons and jails without limit to investigate conditions and if they do so and fail to report those conditions to the public, I suggest that the power of the media to compel disclosure in those circumstances is virtually -- would be virtually irresistible.” 
    In this case they seek to have the court, this court, to write a Freedom of Information Act, something that Justice Stewart wisely said should be left to repeat his words, to the tug and pull of the political forces, that is say to the legislative process.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    The judgment of the court this morning is to reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals that in turn affirmed the terms of the preliminary injunction issued by the District Court and I agree that the preliminary injunction issued against the petitioner, Sheriff of the County of Alameda, California was unwarranted and therefore I concur the judgment, but in my view KQED which is a television station was clearly entitled to injunctive relief of somewhat more limited scope than that granted by the District Court. 
    The First and Fourteenth Amendments do not guarantee the public a right of access to information generated or controlled by government, and they do not guarantee the press any basic right of access superior to that of the public generally. 
    The Constitution does no more than assure the public and the press equal access once government has opened its doors. 
    On that score, I agree substantially with what the Chief Justice has said in his written opinion, what he has announced early this morning. 
    But we part company in applying these abstractions to the facts of this case. 
    It seems to me that the concept of equal access must be accorded flexibility in order to accommodate the practical distinctions between the press and the general public. 
    A journalist does not tour a jail simply for his own edification. 
    He is there to gather information to be passed on to others, and his mission is protected by the Constitution for very specific reasons. 
    That the First Amendment speaks separately of freedom of speech and freedom of the press is no constitutional accident, but an acknowledgment of the critical role played by the press in American society under our constitution. 
    In my view, KQED was clearly entitled to some form of preliminary injunctive relief in this case. 
    At the time of the District Court's decision, members of the public were permitted to visit most parts of the Santa Rita jail, and the First and Fourteenth Amendments required the Sheriff to give members of the press effective access to the same areas. 
    The Sheriff evidently assumed that he could fulfill this obligation simply by allowing reporters to sign up for tours on the same terms as members of the public. 
    And that is I take it is the view of the plurality opinion this morning. 
    I think that is a mistaken view as a matter of constitutional law, not as a matter of policy. 
    Because however, the preliminary injunction exceeded the requirements of the constitution in some respects and as issued by the District Court, I agree that the judgment of the Court of Appeals affirming the District Court's order must be reversed. 
    But the possibility of further relief for KQED on remand is not foreclosed. 
    The availability and scope of future permanent injunctive relief must depend upon the extent of access then permitted to public, and the decree must be framed to accommodate equitably the constitutional role of the press and the institutional requirements of the jail. 
    And it is on that basis and only on that basis that I have joined the judgment of the court. 
   
   
   
   Opinion Announcement of Justice John Paul Stevens

    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    This court has never squarely answered the question, whether a state may pursue a policy of entirely excluding both the public and the press from any access to information about prison conditions. 
    I think that question must be answered in order to decide this case properly. 
    For reasons stated at length in an opinion which Mr. Justice Brennan, Mr. Justice Powell and I have joined, we would hold that such a policy of total exclusion is unconstitutional and we would affirm the judgment of the Ninth Circuit.
