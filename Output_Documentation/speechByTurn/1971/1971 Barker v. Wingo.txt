    Mr. James E. Milliman 
    Thank you, Your Honor. 
    The facts to this case are as follows. 
    The petitioner Willie Mae Barker was indicted in September of 1958 for the murder of Orlena Denton, a vicious heinous crime which he was accused of bursting into her bedroom and beat her to death with a tire iron with an accomplice one Silas Manning who becomes very relevant. 
    His case was originally set for trial in October of 1958. 
    However, there occurred a series of 16 continuances granted the prosecution in this case. 
    Willie Mae Barker was not brought to trial until October of 1963, a delay in excess of five years.

    When did he have counsel?
speaker="james_e_milliman" startTime="109.900" stopTime="120.694">
    Mr. James E. Milliman 
    Counsel was appointed right after indictment, Your Honor. 
    He was represented by counsel throughout this delay. 
    We have no complaint in this regard. 
    Petitioner --

    Mr. James E. Milliman 
    The record does not show whether he was present Your Honor for this continuances. 
    There was no objection made to these continuances until 1962. 
    At which point counsel started objecting to this continuances. 
    But Barker was released on bail.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="150.817" stopTime="154.517">
    Unknown Speaker 
    How many of continuances were granted over the objection of your client?
speaker="james_e_milliman" startTime="154.517" stopTime="173.571">
    Mr. James E. Milliman 
    I believe there were four or five, Your Honor. 
    They began -- the first motion to dismiss in this case was filed on February 12, 1962 and this is on page 9 of the appendix and thereafter the counsel for Willie Mae Barker at that time objected to further continuances.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="173.571" stopTime="176.698">
    Unknown Speaker 
    There is some confusion as to whether or not it was 62 or 63.
speaker="james_e_milliman" startTime="176.698" stopTime="195.861">
    Mr. James E. Milliman 
    Yes, Your Honor. 
    The Kentucky Court of Appeals and both in the Sixth Circuit held it was 1963 that this motion was made February 12, 1963 but the -- and where they found this date I have no knowledge, the record clearly shows it was made on February 12, 1962.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="195.861" stopTime="200.830">
    Unknown Speaker 
    And the Federal Government's amicus brief, it's in to a little bit to but --
speaker="james_e_milliman" startTime="200.830" stopTime="362.941">
    Mr. James E. Milliman 
    Yes Your Honor but the District Court, it's ironic to District Court on page 22 of the appendix pointed out that the motion was made in February 26, 1962 then talked about the resulting eight months delay but the delay was a resulting 19 months delay. 
    So there is confusion as to this date. 
    The petitioner was released on $5,000.00 bond in June of 1959 and remained free on $5,000.00 bond until he was finally convicted. 
    Petitioner then appealed to the Court of Appeals of Kentucky alleging he was denied as right to a speedy trial and other errors in the trial court. 
    The Kentucky Court of Appeals affirmed the conviction then later petitioner filed this habeas corpus proceeding in the District Court, the Western District of Kentucky which denied relief. 
    He appealed to this United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit which affirmed the District Court decision and this Court granted certiorari January 18th of this year. 
    The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit decided this case on two grounds. 
    They held that petitioner had waived his right to a speedy trial by failing to demand trial. 
    That the demand rule states that the right to a speedy trial is guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment is a personal right which may be weighed. 
    So the Sixth Circuit computed only the time after the first motion to dismiss was made in computing the length of the delay which had found to be nine months using the 1963 date. 
    It also held that petitioner had not shown that he was prejudice by the delay. 
    Petitioner's therefore raised two points on this appeal. 
    First that the demand rule is inconsistent with constitutional safeguards and should not be required and the second issue is where there is a five year delay, prejudice should be presumed as inherent in the delay and it's important to emphasize in this case the two amicus briefs have been filed. 
    We are concerned in this case with a five-year delay. 
    We are not concerned with a one year delay or two-year delay. 
    This case presents a five-year delay. 
    The demand rule is applied in this case, is subject to attack on two grounds. 
    This Court has consistently held that any waiver of a constitutional right must be voluntary and intelligent knowing and that it will not accept a passive waiver --
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="362.941" stopTime="370.698">
    Unknown Speaker 
    That assumes you answer, doesn't it? 
    That assumes that the right to a speedy trial exists without the demand.
speaker="james_e_milliman" startTime="370.698" stopTime="372.202">
    Mr. James E. Milliman 
    This is correct Your Honor. 
    And --
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="372.202" stopTime="379.712">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Well then, how about the demand? 
    Why should he let -- why shouldn't they have to demand that in order to trigger the right --
speaker="james_e_milliman" startTime="379.712" stopTime="418.103">
    Mr. James E. Milliman 
    Your Honor in the present case, it is contended that the demand rule as such chills his right to a speedy trial. 
    We had a man here who was indicted for willful murder. 
    Now his accomplice had twice received the death penalty. 
    This put him in the position of -- if he has to demand trial to protect his right to a speedy trial, he has possibly asking himself, asking the prosecution to give him the electric chair. 
    The result if he is successful is death, this is a grisly choice which this Court condemned in Faye versus Noia, where --
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="418.103" stopTime="434.612">
    Unknown Speaker 
    You're saying that he can't be required to come in and ask for what he will later contend, he should have been given automatically. 
    I don't see that there's any chilling or burden there when you're dealing exactly with the thing that you're requesting.
speaker="james_e_milliman" startTime="434.612" stopTime="456.987">
    Mr. James E. Milliman 
    Your Honor, your question if I understand it, supposed you said the right is a personal right which can be waived. 
    Now, we are contending that to ask him to demand trial on the face of the death sentence is putting him in the same position that the defendant was in, in Faye versus Noia.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="456.987" stopTime="464.218">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Are you saying in effect that a trial is the last thing he wants and therefore he shouldn't be compelled to ask for what he doesn't want?
speaker="james_e_milliman" startTime="464.218" stopTime="467.493">
    Mr. James E. Milliman 
    It may well be that trial is the last thing he wants Your Honor.

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Is that what you're arguing?

    Mr. James E. Milliman 
    No we are not arguing this.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="469.826" stopTime="475.537">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    That he should not be compelled to ask for it because he really doesn't want it. 
    He wants to postpone that evil day.
speaker="james_e_milliman" startTime="475.537" stopTime="479.580">
    Mr. James E. Milliman 
    Well, this is correct and I think this would be desired by any defendant.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="479.580" stopTime="486.442">
    Unknown Speaker 
    But nonetheless, he can come in and if he has been tried in a particular time even though he hasn't request and say now you got to dismiss the whole proceeding?
speaker="james_e_milliman" startTime="486.442" stopTime="489.031">
    Mr. James E. Milliman 
    This is what we're contending, Your Honor.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="489.031" stopTime="492.129">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    What if he had asked -- what if he had asked for all the continuances?
speaker="james_e_milliman" startTime="492.129" stopTime="494.820">
    Mr. James E. Milliman 
    Then we would have an entirely different situation.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="494.820" stopTime="496.081">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Why is it different now --
speaker="james_e_milliman" startTime="496.081" stopTime="504.606">
    Mr. James E. Milliman 
    In this case, the defendant did not in any way contribute to the delay. 
    He had made no continuance himself, he made no dilatory motions. 
    He merely --
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="504.606" stopTime="534.611">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Oh!But going back to your proposition that the predicate of your whole argument here is that because death may await him down the end of the road, he therefore doesn't want to trial. 
    That seems to be your predicate for now. 
    That same urge might make him to come in every time that the case was set for trial and ask for a continuance. 
    What you say, if he ask for it and got it that would be different from getting it without asking for it.
speaker="james_e_milliman" startTime="534.611" stopTime="556.070">
    Mr. James E. Milliman 
    In that event Your Honor, he would have affirmatively contributed to the delay. 
    He would have brought it about by his own affirmative actions by merely sitting back and doing nothing. 
    He did nothing to contribute to the delay. 
    Now he did file a motion to dismiss on February 12, 1962.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="556.070" stopTime="579.386">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Well do you say that have it be unconstitutional at the state had a rule, a court rule that says that continuances by the state and delay must be on notice to the defendant and that unless and that ---the defendant wants a trial, he isn't going to be responsible for the delay he must object.
speaker="james_e_milliman" startTime="579.386" stopTime="588.299">
    Mr. James E. Milliman 
    Your Honor, in that event I would think there would be less, far less of a constitutional objection, in that case we would still have this grisly choice.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="588.299" stopTime="598.415">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Well, so you still claim it would be unconstitutional if the state said, look, we are going to give you an early trial or a late trial, now which one do you want? 
    And he said I want the late trial.
speaker="james_e_milliman" startTime="598.415" stopTime="626.060">
    Mr. James E. Milliman 
    I would contend in that event that it would still be unconstitutional but for less sufficient reason because there is another impelling reason in this case. 
    When must the demand be made? 
    The demand or rule or set of standard, it says a petitioner, a defendant must demand trial. 
    But when must he make that demand, there are no guidelines, there are no standards. 
    Florida has past a statute that says after three successive demands --
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="626.060" stopTime="631.924">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Well, here at least for three or four years the continuances were unnoticed to him and he never objected to this.
speaker="james_e_milliman" startTime="631.924" stopTime="633.731">
    Mr. James E. Milliman 
    This is correct Your Honor.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="633.731" stopTime="640.643">
    Unknown Speaker 
    And you say that you are -- you say the state nevertheless should be charged with that delay?
speaker="james_e_milliman" startTime="640.643" stopTime="719.355">
    Mr. James E. Milliman 
    Your Honor, there are system of jurisprudence and burden of prosecution is on the state. 
    To require this man, Willie Mae Barker to demand trial is imposing the burden upon him to bring about trial to prove his innocence. 
    This is contrary to establish principles in this country. 
    He should not have the burden of bringing to that trial. 
    This is the burden of the prosecution. 
    It is there duty, the American Bar Association has disapproved that the "demand rule" for this reason that the burden is on the prosecution to bring trial not on the defendant. 
    But when does the defendant demand trial? 
    Must he demand trial at the indictment after a year at every term of Court? 
    Any waiver of a constitutional right must be made intelligently. 
    Now, petitioner was represented by counsel. 
    But I submit that even though he is represented by counsel, his counsel couldn't determine when the demand must be made. 
    What if it would have been made at the indictment and no other demand had been made. 
    What if it's done in many cases? 
    In other words, what the demand rule is, it's treating the constitutional right as a procedural nicety which can be waive like they knew if you fail to demand it.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="719.355" stopTime="733.555">
    Unknown Speaker 
    We are treating it as something basically like a statute of limitations and it runs without regard to the defendants and a civil case giving notice to hear that said that he is invoking the statute limitations. 
    It simply comes in after its run and said --
speaker="james_e_milliman" startTime="733.555" stopTime="735.416">
    Mr. James E. Milliman 
    That's correct Your Honor.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="735.416" stopTime="750.745">
    Unknown Speaker 
    The problem as I see it with your position is that there isn't any fix time that you're talking about. 
    The way there is with a statute of limitations at least the state has noticed that if they don't for constitutional purposes try with uncertain person and period and then they're through.
speaker="james_e_milliman" startTime="750.745" stopTime="782.148">
    Mr. James E. Milliman 
    Well, Your Honor we submit that the burden -- since the burden is on the state to bring about trial but notice to the state is not merely as essential as notice to the defendant as to when the demand must be made. 
    In this case, petitioner Willie Mae Barker had no idea as to when the demand must be made. 
    He made a motion to dismiss on February 12, 1962. 
    He filed another motion to dismiss prior to trial. 
    Because it was denial of a right to a speedy trial but both cases --
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="782.148" stopTime="788.057">
    Unknown Speaker 
    But he never did -- he never did ask for a speedy trial. 
    He asked that the indictment be dismissed. 
    Right?
speaker="james_e_milliman" startTime="788.057" stopTime="808.881">
    Mr. James E. Milliman 
    This is correct Your Honor and this raises another problem, the Sixth Circuit held that the motion to dismiss was equated with the demand. 
    The Solicitor General's brief on other course have held that a motion to dismiss is not a demand. 
    What is a demand? 
    There are no standards, there no guidelines. 
    There are in Florida now three times. 
    And you either try --
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="808.881" stopTime="810.808">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Ant there are in the Circuit Court of Appeals I think?
speaker="james_e_milliman" startTime="810.808" stopTime="812.126">
    Mr. James E. Milliman 
    Please.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="812.126" stopTime="815.278">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Aren't there are also in New York State and in the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, at least respectively?
speaker="james_e_milliman" startTime="815.278" stopTime="839.266">
    Mr. James E. Milliman 
    This is correct. 
    But petitioner had none of these guidelines to guide him in this choice. 
    Petitioner responded to the Commonwealth of Kentucky. 
    He submitted in their brief that any demand would have been superfluous that it wouldn't have been granted. 
    That was a useless act to require him to demand trial and that requiring asking him to bring about his own prosecution to prove his innocence.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="839.266" stopTime="840.353">
    Unknown Speaker 
    You mean in this particular case?
speaker="james_e_milliman" startTime="840.353" stopTime="841.459">
    Mr. James E. Milliman 
    In this particular case --
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="841.459" stopTime="846.080">

    That the key witness would have pleaded his compulsory self incrimination [Voice Overlap].
speaker="james_e_milliman" startTime="846.080" stopTime="871.556">
    Mr. James E. Milliman 
    This is correct, Your Honor. 
    Now this brings us to second issue, the issue of prejudice. 
    Looking at the bare record in this case, there is no specific example of prejudice except for the testimony of one witness Martha Barber, sister-in-law of the accomplice, Silas Manning who could not recall certain specific events but otherwise testified with certainty.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="871.556" stopTime="875.718">
    Unknown Speaker 
    What kind of prejudice are you talking about? 
    Is it at the trial?
speaker="james_e_milliman" startTime="875.718" stopTime="876.963">
    Mr. James E. Milliman 
    Actual prejudice informed.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="876.963" stopTime="878.046">
    Unknown Speaker 
    At the trial, at the trial?
speaker="james_e_milliman" startTime="878.046" stopTime="880.150">
    Mr. James E. Milliman 
    Yes Your Honor, in the form of lost witnesses, faded memories.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="880.150" stopTime="890.784">
    Unknown Speaker 
    But what about the -- What about other prejudice of the speedy trial provision as oppose to in fact the end?
speaker="james_e_milliman" startTime="890.784" stopTime="912.490">
    Mr. James E. Milliman 
    The speedy trial provision as this Court has held in each speedy trial case brought before it pretrial anxiety, hostility in the community, lost of jobs, curtailment of associations, there's even more be specific pretrial prejudice here.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="912.490" stopTime="924.400">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    How do you square with that with your earlier argument that he really doesn't want a trial and therefore should not be put to the burden of asking for what he doesn't want?
speaker="james_e_milliman" startTime="924.400" stopTime="970.874">
    Mr. James E. Milliman 
    Simply because that he has the right under the Sixth Amendment to be brought quickly to trial whether he ask for it or not. 
    Now, it may be that if he affirmatively does not want trial, he will make the motion for continuances. 
    As everyone knows a defense lawyer can continue a trial indefinitely and if he had actually wanted or was afraid of being brought to trial, he would have moved for continuances. 
    Now it's true that the reason for this delay was the Commonwealth of Kentucky desired to secure the testimony of the accomplice, Silas Manning. 
    And it's true that if Silas Manning were never convicted, Willie Mae Barker would have never been convicted, we conceive this. 
    Commonwealth admits it.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="970.874" stopTime="974.006">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Or if you had gone on trial before he did, you would defend it?
speaker="james_e_milliman" startTime="974.006" stopTime="983.147">
    Mr. James E. Milliman 
    This is correct Your Honor, so what the Commonwealth is doing was postponing Willie Mae Barker's trial until they convicted Silas Manning. 
    There is only one problem.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="983.147" stopTime="985.499">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Until they got the evidence to convict?
speaker="james_e_milliman" startTime="985.499" stopTime="1038.207">
    Mr. James E. Milliman 
    This is correct Your Honor. 
    It only tipped them six trials to convict Silas Manning. 
    And so there is prejudice even there that if he had been brought speedily to trial, of course the testimony of Silas Manning would not have been available to convict him but this does not appear in the black and white record. 
    More fundamentally, petitioner is now released on parole. 
    He was paroled in August of 1971 after serving eight years of a life sentence. 
    Now, had he been brought to trial in 1959 in Kentucky the normal sentence is seven or eight years for a life imprisonment. 
    Had he been brought to trial in 1959, it is very reasonable to assume that he would have been released four or five years ago to resume his right for place in society.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="1038.207" stopTime="1041.835">
    Unknown Speaker 
    I say that it's even more reasonable unless he might have been acquitted --
speaker="james_e_milliman" startTime="1041.835" stopTime="1064.216">
    Mr. James E. Milliman 
    It is. 
    Well, had he been brought to trial without the testimony of Silas Manning Your Honor, the Commonwealth of Kentucky has admitted specifically in its response to the motion to dismiss on October 9, 1963 that they cannot convict Willie Mae Barker without the testimony of Silas Manning. 
    They admitted this.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1064.216" stopTime="1082.428">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Suppose the witness that was needed for this conviction had been a fugitive from justice living in Algeria or Canada or some place where he couldn't be reached and brought back. 
    Would you think that would alter the Gover -- the State's posture on the delay?
speaker="james_e_milliman" startTime="1082.428" stopTime="1108.433">
    Mr. James E. Milliman 
    If Silas Manning had been a fugitive. 
    It would have given some more sufficient reason for the delay. 
    Whether it would have justified it for five years is highly debatable. 
    There would be a burden on the prosecution to make every effort to bring this man back. 
    But is certainly would be more sufficient reason than in the present case.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1108.433" stopTime="1119.418">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Well is his test -- was his testimony in the circumstances of this case, any more or less available in realistic terms than if he'd been in Algeria?
speaker="james_e_milliman" startTime="1119.418" stopTime="1178.603">
    Mr. James E. Milliman 
    Yes, Your Honor. 
    It was available at all times. 
    All the Commonwealth of Kentucky had to do was to convict him. 
    With all due respects to the Commonwealth of Kentucky, the only reason for the delay here was their incompetence and their inability to convict this man. 
    The errors they committed, one conviction was reversed because of the admission of illegally seized evidence and the admission of an involuntary confession. 
    Another conviction was reversed because they insist about in trying the crime and the venue where the crime was committed at mid pretrial hostility. 
    They made these motions, they tried Silas Manning. 
    They committed these constitutional errors and procedural errors and an attempt to convict him for a procedural advantage, for strategically advantage but cannot succeed because the Court of Appeals would not affirm the convictions obtained under these grounds. 
    So he was there, all they have to do is convict him legitimately.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="1178.603" stopTime="1199.578">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Mr. Milliman, you say in your brief that they cannot be a passive waiver of a right to a speedy trial. 
    Do you consider that the failure of counsel to object to these 16 continuances was a passive waiver?

    Mr. James E. Milliman 
    No, Your Honor. 
    I do not. 
    I think his failure to object was more than the grounds of perhaps a procedural error in the sense of an attorney fails to object to a hearsay statement or a leading question and as precluded from raising that --

    We concede that this was sufficient for the delay from March 1963 to October but it does not explain the delay prior to that.

    Mr. Manning was tried six times, Your Honor. 
    The first trial resulted in the hang jury. 
    The second trial, he received the death penalty. 
    The Court of Appeals of Kentucky reversed it because of the admission of illegally seized evidence and the admission with involuntary confession. 
    I believe.

    Mr. James E. Milliman 
    It is possible that the memory of the witness is indeed kept alive and it is possible that the hostile attitude of the community was indeed kept alive also. 
    This was a vicious crime of two prompted people in a rural community and it is very possible that Manning's trials kept alive the hostility of the community to the petitioner in this case.

    Mr. James E. Milliman 
    Yes, Your Honor I am. 
    For the simple reason here we have one indicted murderer tried six times. 
    The Commonwealth Attorney of Kentucky is going to have a very difficult time explaining to the electorate why he can't convict this man and the fact that this man is not being convicted is going to stir the animosity of the community. 
    In fact, petitioners first two trials were committed -- were tried at the scene of the crime at the county of the crime. 
    His third trial, he requested the change of venue because of hostility which the Court refused.

    Mr. James E. Milliman 
    No, I'm talking about Manning now. 
    So this leads me to believe that the hostilities increased as the time went by because nothing had been done to bring this two people to trial or nothing had been done to convict them and we have to understand the attitude of the circumstances at the time.

speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1607.425" stopTime="1611.678">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Thank you Mr. Milliman. 
    Mr. Willmott.

    Mr. Robert W. Willmott, Jr. 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    The facts in this case are not in dispute. 
    The Commonwealth did delay the trial of the petitioner for five years and I think a little more thorough explanation of why it delayed it as an order, the Commonwealth shows to prosecute Silas Manning first. 
    Now this decision I don't know why it was made but the Commonwealth Attorney did make it and they had not by my brother he -- they did have a difficulty in obtaining a valid conviction. 
    I don't think it can be blamed on any incompetence on the part of the Commonwealth Attorney. 
    And after in December of 1962 when Manning's final trial was held, trial was set for the next term to Court to February term of the 1963 Christian County Circuit. 
    The chief collaborating witness was the sheriff of Christian County, Sheriff McKinney. 
    He became seriously ill with a stomach disorder, he was later admitted to the hospital and portions of his stomach were removed and he later underwent a gallbladder operation.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1694.674" stopTime="1698.178">

speaker="robert_w_willmott_jr" startTime="1704.763" stopTime="1714.361">
    Mr. Robert W. Willmott, Jr. 
    No. 
    It's just an explanation of the last ten months or so of the delay. 
    The first four years of the delay were due to Manning being unavailable for testimony.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1714.361" stopTime="1719.031">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    If we had a ten months delay, we probably wouldn't be here on this case. 
    Would we, probably?
speaker="robert_w_willmott_jr" startTime="1719.031" stopTime="1789.296">
    Mr. Robert W. Willmott, Jr. 
    Right. 
    And the Commonwealth submits that the real issue in this case is not when the demand should be made or if a demand should be made but narrowest down to the fact made the Commonwealth delay a trial for any reason for this period of time. 
    Now, there are several statutes from different states which call for a dismissal of the indictment similar to Federal Rule 48 (b) if a trial was not held within so many days or so many months or so many terms at Court. 
    But every -- every rule or every statute also states in the final line unless good cause be shown and our contention is that the Commonwealth had good cause in this case. 
    The -- it's a simple fact without Manning, we would not be here today because petitioner would not have been convicted and without the sheriff, the collaborating evidence would have been insufficient to support the testimony of an accomplice.

speaker="robert_w_willmott_jr" startTime="1888.318" stopTime="1942.387">
    Mr. Robert W. Willmott, Jr. 
    This -- there was an admission made by Barker along reliance of -- when the sheriff came to arrest him, he boarded out before being asked or told anything. 
    If you're wondering what happened to those old folks, Manning did it. 
    And that was -- excuse me, the major portion of the sheriff's testimony was his admission. 
    Now, as stated the reason for the delay in this case is legitimate and at my opinion, the interests of society have to be balanced against the interest of the accused and if there is a valid reason. 
    If there can be any valid reason for postponement of a trial for five years, this case presents the same.

    Mr. Robert W. Willmott, Jr. 
    Right, Your Honor. 
    I think initially, there's very little guidance on what constitutes good cause for the Government delaying the trial. 
    There are ample evidences to the defendant filing dilatory pleadings or shuffling to street and avoiding trial, being a fugitive, being incompetent. 
    These do not violate the right to a speedy trial. 
    However, there is fair little guidance as to why the Government may delay a trial. 
    The most decisions have followed the Gleichman (ph) case and which necessitates a demand and if a demand does not made, waiver his presumed.

    Mr. Robert W. Willmott, Jr. 
    Yes, sir that is meant. 
    There -- the only prejudice that could be assumed and my brother points out in his brief that possible prejudice may be presumed and that he suffered the scorn or the stigma of being under an indictment for five years for hearing his crime such as murder. 
    There is no actual physical tangible prejudice shown. 
    All the witnesses testified, they were also witnesses at Manning's trial and by the petitioner's trial they were thoroughly burst in their testimony.

    Mr. Robert W. Willmott, Jr. 
    Yes sir, February of 1962 that is according to the record. 
    I don't know how the Court, the District Court and the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals got confused but they have cited and in it is the first demand being made in 1963.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="2344.441" stopTime="2365.859">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Mr. Willmott, the Court rendered in opinion in United States against Marion last December. 
    This does not say that in your brief or in the other brief or in the main amicus brief. 
    It is cited in the government's amicus brief. 
    Is this -- are you familiar with this case?
speaker="robert_w_willmott_jr" startTime="2365.859" stopTime="2377.934">
    Mr. Robert W. Willmott, Jr. 
    Your Honor, I picked up a slip this morning, when I became aware of it, we did not have the advance sheet in our office before I came in to Washington.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="2377.934" stopTime="2393.537">
    Unknown Speaker 
    What I want to ask you of course perhaps you can't comment on it is whether you feel that has any pertinency in this case. 
    I'll ask the same question on your opponent when he is up in rebuttal.
speaker="robert_w_willmott_jr" startTime="2393.537" stopTime="2409.522">
    Mr. Robert W. Willmott, Jr. 
    Well, as I understand Marion it was a pre-indictment delay and this Court held that the Sixth Amendment speedy trial clause was not applicable to pre-indictment delays. 
    Now that the concurring opinion --
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="2409.522" stopTime="2414.294">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Under all circumstances?
speaker="robert_w_willmott_jr" startTime="2414.294" stopTime="2538.041">
    Mr. Robert W. Willmott, Jr. 
    That was my opinion that it did not - it was not applicable to the pre-indictment stage because a person had not become an accused. 
    Back in the prejudice argument, we stated that there were no lost witnesses that the witnesses memory was -- there was no mnemonic loss and no lack of testimony to align this case with a case such as Dickey which states that if a persons defenses is impaired or just lost to some witnesses dying and disappearing or being unavailable and I think this would distinguish this case from Dickey. 
    Though in the main, I think the Commonwealth contentions can be divided into three categories. 
    The first is that if there is such a thing as a valid Government delay that this case must meet the standards and we base this on the fact that in applying the demand rule, the demand was made after almost four years, three and a half years had passed. 
    That the reasons for the delay were valid, there would have been no conviction in this case if the Commonwealth had been forced to trial earlier than it was. 
    There was no lack of diligence on the part of the Commonwealth in this case. 
    I'm certain that the Commonwealth Attorney in Hopkins County, Christian County, excuse me, got very tired of this case, he was in Court with every open term of Court or else Manning had an appeal pending. 
    He wanted to conclude this more than anyone I would assume.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="2538.041" stopTime="2552.029">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Mr. Willmott is the Kentucky State Court set up such that a Court is continuously sitting except for vacation time in Christian County or does it just sit on Circuit there at certain times of the year.
speaker="robert_w_willmott_jr" startTime="2552.029" stopTime="2555.498">
    Mr. Robert W. Willmott, Jr. 
    In Christian County and it is not a continuous session.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="2555.498" stopTime="2557.943">
    Unknown Speaker 
    How many sessions of Court do they have each year in Christian County?
speaker="robert_w_willmott_jr" startTime="2557.943" stopTime="2559.655">
    Mr. Robert W. Willmott, Jr. 
    Three sessions, I believe.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="2559.655" stopTime="2565.861">
    Unknown Speaker 
    And how long does an average session lasts? 
    Approximately?
speaker="robert_w_willmott_jr" startTime="2565.861" stopTime="2568.911">
    Mr. Robert W. Willmott, Jr. 
    I would say a month and a half or two months.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="2568.911" stopTime="2573.965">
    Unknown Speaker 
    So a Court would be sitting in Christian in maybe six months out of the 12 of each year?
speaker="robert_w_willmott_jr" startTime="2573.965" stopTime="2636.873">
    Mr. Robert W. Willmott, Jr. 
    Unless, I think if there is provision for a prolong calendar if the docket load is heavy, unusually heavy. 
    I don't think they are bound by a specific termination date on each call. 
    So, the prejudice resulting from this delay has been argued was not great. 
    Petitioner was not the object of prolonged delay in order to gain an advantage. 
    The Government prosecuted this case with diligence, they -- it went to trial the first open term of Court that all the witnesses were available and it is very -- the petitioner was -- came very close to not being tried when Sheriff McKinney went in the hospital.

    When the -- how soon after the event was Manning tried the first time?

    Mr. Robert W. Willmott, Jr. 
    He was tried at the first term of Court in October.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="2646.257" stopTime="2648.478">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    For then, six months after the murders?
speaker="robert_w_willmott_jr" startTime="2648.478" stopTime="2649.262">
    Mr. Robert W. Willmott, Jr. 
    Two months.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="2649.262" stopTime="2650.363">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Two months after the murder.
speaker="robert_w_willmott_jr" startTime="2650.363" stopTime="2720.758">
    Mr. Robert W. Willmott, Jr. 
    I think the murder were on July the 20 and he was tried October 9, I believe is the date of his first trial and he was prosecuted every succeeding term of Court or had an appeal pending in the Kentucky Court of Appeals at every subsequent term of Court. 
    So this couple with a fact that the petitioners defense was in no way impaired that the demand was not made until very late in the time period and the no lost of prejudice and the good cause for which the continuances were granted. 
    The Commonwealth submits at these grounds are sufficient and adequate to affirm the Sixth Circuit opinion. 
    Thank you. 
   
   
   
   Rebuttal of James E. Milliman
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="2720.758" stopTime="2726.961">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Thank you Mr. Willmott. 
    Mr. Milliman, you have few minutes left, do you have anything further?
speaker="james_e_milliman" startTime="2726.961" stopTime="2854.628">
    Mr. James E. Milliman 
    Yes Your Honor, I would like to express my opinion on the reason for delay. 
    The Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals do not specifically decide this question. 
    They decided simply that from the period of the time of the demand which they found to be February 12, 1963 to the time of trial but there was a sufficient reason. 
    We do not specifically urge this point on our petition for certiorari for the simple reasons of the Court of Appeals do not really decide it. 
    And that this Court could conceivably, if they wish remand to the Sixth Circuit of Appeals for further findings on that issue if they would strike that down the demand rule and hold the petitioner has shown or is not required to show prejudice. 
    It could remand to the Sixth Circuit for further findings as to the reason for delay. 
    As his Honor, I believe, Justice Blackmun referred to the U.S. versus Marion case. 
    We would like to accept the good and reject the bad. 
    The Marion case is not applicable to this case for the simple reason that in that case this Court held that the defendants were not an accused. 
    Because they were talking about a pre-indictment delay and that the Sixth Amendment applies only to an accused and one does not become accused until he is indicted and there is still no question in this case that Willie Mae Barker fit the definition of an accused. 
    The Marion case would be applicable and that it explained that the statute of limitations for example are designed to guarantee against stale claims and of course in Kentucky and most states, there is no statute limitations for murder. 
    So there is no statute of limitations to apply in this case and it did point out again that reaffirmed the -- this Court's position of the prejudice resulting from the pretrial delays, the anxiety, the hostility and so forth. 
    So in that respect, it is most applicable to this case.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="2854.628" stopTime="2872.116">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    But after February 12, 1962, your anxiety and hostility arguments really don't square with your argument that you didn't want to have this confrontation to society and that is why you didn't ask for it.
speaker="james_e_milliman" startTime="2872.116" stopTime="2883.959">
    Mr. James E. Milliman 
    Again Your Honor, I would refer to the American Bar Association project for minimum standards that this is no reason for delay that his acquiescence for the fact that he may desire --
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="2883.959" stopTime="2893.420">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Quite right. 
    That doesn't justify delay. 
    I am simply was addressing that observation to the weight of your argument on that point.
speaker="james_e_milliman" startTime="2893.420" stopTime="2919.814">
    Mr. James E. Milliman 
    Your Honor I would concede that Willie Mae Barker probably -- I don't know this for a fact, probably, did not want to be tried. 
    I don't think any man wants to be tried and I don't consider this a liability on his behalf. 
    I don't blame him. 
    What he was trying to do is once he found Manning had been convicted then of course he wanted the case dismissed. 
    There is no question about this.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="2919.814" stopTime="2926.360">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    But you are not arguing that every accused person is in the posture of not wanting a trial, are you?
speaker="james_e_milliman" startTime="2926.360" stopTime="2941.303">
    Mr. James E. Milliman 
    No, Your Honor. 
    I'm sure that some accused people do but even to someone who is innocent, there is always a specter that he may be convicted, even though innocent and the fact that he is going to come to trial is going to cause him great apprehension, question --
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="2941.303" stopTime="2947.252">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    I expect there might be more accused if he knows he is guilty, wouldn't it be so that you can't really generalize on that.
speaker="james_e_milliman" startTime="2947.252" stopTime="2953.261">
    Mr. James E. Milliman 
    I don't know if it would be more accused or not Your Honor. 
    Guilty man made well be resigned to his faith.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="2953.261" stopTime="2958.182">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Well, you are making any claim that the -- that counsel was inadequate in this case?
speaker="james_e_milliman" startTime="2958.182" stopTime="2959.666">
    Mr. James E. Milliman 
    No, Your Honor. 
    I am not. 
    I believe --
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="2959.666" stopTime="2974.762">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Well , he was the counsel -- he was the counsel and if the states evidence were so weak, you would think there might have been interest in an early trial.
speaker="james_e_milliman" startTime="2974.762" stopTime="2977.131">
    Mr. James E. Milliman 
    This is quite possible.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="2977.131" stopTime="2988.610">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Well have -- if counsel makes a decision, it's better to wait than to try now, that might be a gross error but it might not be a gross error.
speaker="james_e_milliman" startTime="2988.610" stopTime="2996.873">
    Mr. James E. Milliman 
    Again Your Honor, to answer this question any affirmative would be to require the speculation from the record that he did take a -- make it strategical --
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="2996.873" stopTime="3000.851">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Mr. Counsel turned to have the choice of either objecting or not objecting --
speaker="james_e_milliman" startTime="3000.851" stopTime="3002.842">
    Mr. James E. Milliman 
    This is true, this is true.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="3002.842" stopTime="3005.900">
    Unknown Speaker 
    And he exercised that choice of not objecting?
speaker="james_e_milliman" startTime="3005.900" stopTime="3012.145">
    Mr. James E. Milliman 
    We don't know whether he did that, he exercised that choice but we don't know if he did that for a strategical purpose or not.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="3012.145" stopTime="3022.942">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    But isn't that reasonably assumed that he knew the problem of the unavailability of Manning until Manning's conviction was definite?
speaker="james_e_milliman" startTime="3022.942" stopTime="3048.444">
    Mr. James E. Milliman 
    Well, Your Honor, it's possible that he thought that they had other grounds to convict based upon the testimony of the sheriff. 
    Now, looking at the scene of the trial, it's quite possible that he thought, hostility prevailing at the time if there was such that the man would have been convicted based upon the testimony of the sheriff. 
    We don't know his reasons for not demanding a speedy trial but we do know that it would have been superfluous.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="3048.444" stopTime="3060.127">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Well, is it reasonable to assume that when the prosecution asked for continuances, the -- they were required to give a reason and the reason was, that Manning was not available? 
    That was known to everybody?
speaker="james_e_milliman" startTime="3060.127" stopTime="3062.146">
    Mr. James E. Milliman 
    This is reasonable Your Honor.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="3062.146" stopTime="3080.470">
    Unknown Speaker 
    To the extent that the defense counsels consent to the continuances may have been based on the possibility of the future absence of a witness to the extent that the sheriff was important to the prosecution of this case. 
    It almost paid off, I take.
speaker="james_e_milliman" startTime="3080.470" stopTime="3103.676">
    Mr. James E. Milliman 
    It almost did Your Honor except for one thing if I may state this. 
    It's important to note that Manning was convicted to the first murder in March of 1962 but they still didn't bring Barker to trial. 
    They tried Manning again in December of 1962. 
    There is no reason in the world they couldn't have brought Barker to trial after the first conviction of Manning but they refused.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="3103.676" stopTime="3107.700">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Well, do you mean that Manning would have been a willing witness just because he had a conviction with --
speaker="james_e_milliman" startTime="3107.700" stopTime="3125.772">
    Mr. James E. Milliman 
    Your Honor, the record shows that Willie Mae Barker was keeping company with Mr. Manning's wife at the time and whether that would have made him a willing witness or not I think it would have made him more willing than otherwise.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="3125.772" stopTime="3128.530">
