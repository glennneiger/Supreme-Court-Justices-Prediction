Victory Carriers, Inc. v. Law

    Mr. Reeves, you have 13 minutes.

    Mr. W. Boyd Reeves 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    If I can continue with my argument of yesterday, we submit that there must be a beginning and an ending to the loading and discharging process insofar as the obligation of a vessel's warranty of seaworthiness is concerned. 
    This is necessary for the guidance of litigants as well as for the law of course. 
    What started principally as the humanitarian policy by this Court in Sieracki to include those shore-based workers on a vessel, who were performing work, traditionally performed by seamen within the strict and rigid warranty of seaworthiness has now been taken onto the pier and extended to the shore-based worker who is operating exclusive shore-based equipment and as I stated yesterday, in recent case of McNeil has even been carried into the warehouse.

    Yes, in supplemental brief which we filed.

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    A Federal District Court or Court of Appeals opinion?
speaker="w_boyd_reeves" startTime="73.953" stopTime="393.848">
    Mr. W. Boyd Reeves 
    It was a District Court opinion sir. 
    There must be a limit to the extent of the vessel's warranty. 
    We submit that the limits imposed by the District Court in this case are both realistic and reasonable, that is that loading of cargo insofar as the vessel's warranty is concerned, commences when the vessels tackle becomes a tax to the cargo and that unloading terminates when the cargo is landed on to dock or into a vehicle into which it is being discharged. 
    This has long been the test of liability as between a ship and shipper, often referred to tackle to tackle. 
    Such a limitation does no offense to Sieracki or to Peterson or to the Gutierrez's case, because the dockside worker who is actually injured by the ship's own gear, equipment, cargo containers, arch crew, would still remain within the warranty. 
    The Circuit Court below in this case held that the District Court's limitation of the warranty represented a minority view which defined the loading in an exceedingly narrow and mechanical fashion and chose to align itself with other cases, which define loading and unloading code in a realistic sense rather than hypothetical terms of art. 
    In so holding, the Court of Appeals below has in effect completely disregarded the basis upon which the seaworthiness doctrine is premised, that is to afford protection to those individuals who are subjected to the rigorous discipline of the sea, going back to Mehnich v. Southern Steamship Company. 
    Further, the Court below as we are argued yesterday, disregarded the extension of Admiralty Jurisdiction Act. 
    We would invite the Court's attention to the opinion of Judge Watkins in a recent case from the District Court of Maryland which is Greene (ph) versus Pope &amp; Talbot, we have also cited in our supplemental brief, where after he gives a historical discussion of the seaworthiness doctrine, commence on this Bill Law case in Chagois versus Lykes Brothers and the Ninth Circuit case of Gilbert versus The Hawaiian Legislature and after saying what those cases hold, if I may quote, “this liability without theory ignores the situs of the injury, ignores causation, ignores whether realistically the ship is being loaded or unloaded and ignores the true status of the injured party. 
    Now, last term in the case of Usner v. Luckenbach Overseas Corporation, this Court held that it would be erroneous when no condition of unseaworthiness existed to hold the ship on a liable for third party single and wholly unforeseeable act of negligence. 
    We submit that similar logic and reasoning suggest to conclusion that a shipowner and his vessel should not be held liable for an accident which occurs solely on the dock as a result of exclusively shore-based defective equipment, which is being used for the purpose of moving or shifting cargo on the dock and over which the vessel has no control. 
    The justification for the imposition of the unseaworthiness doctrine with its rigid standard is absent under the facts of this case. 
    As I stated yesterday, unless the law under the facts of this case was not subject to the perils and hazards of a sea nor was his lift machine that he was operating in appurtenance of this vessel, we are not suggesting a reversal of Gutierrez case because there there was actual vessel involvement in that dockside injury. 
    We do urge that a limitation be placed on the extension of the seaworthiness warranty by limiting the principles which are set forth in Gutierrez to those instances where the vessel itself, its own gears, own equipment, has caused the shore-side injury, rather than shore-based equipment over which the vessel has absolutely no control. 
    Before I sit down I would like to say I understand that probably it was Friday, the American Trial Lawyers Association has filed the motion for an amicus curiae brief in this case, I have not seen it, I am not in a position to make any response to it. 
    I do not know what the Court's action would be on it, but we would respectfully submit that the Fifth Circuit has gone beyond the holdings of this Court in extending the warranty of seaworthiness out on to the dock to this shore based equipment that if limitations and guidelines are not placed, we believe that the hypothetical situations which the Court expressed in Gutierrez which the court below says, we do not reach this particular type of situation, however, it does leave the door open by saying we will reach that case when it comes before us. 
    I respectfully submit that for the reasons it was stated the First Circuit has erred and suggest and request that be reversed.

   Argument of Ross Diamond, Jr.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="430.865" stopTime="435.038">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Thank you Mr. Reeves, Mr. Diamond.
speaker="ross_diamond_jr" startTime="435.038" stopTime="506.752">
    Mr. Ross Diamond, Jr. 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    I would like to talk about the facts in just a minute. 
    Bill Law was a member of the ILA, International Longshoreman's Association, local 1410. 
    He was a member of the gang of Willy Kaiser and he was selected in the Makeup Gang early that morning in front of Union Hall on Davis Avenue in Mobile to load this particular hatch of this particular vessel, the S.S. Sagamore Hill. 
    When he got to the dock, he was assigned by his foreman Willy Kaiser to operate the forklift machine on the dock, taking the landing mats from its storage pile from the open pier, some 50 feet from the cargo hook and delivering it to the cargo hook from where it was taken onto the vessel. 
    They were subsequently loaded to the vessel by other longshoreman has been used and I think it could be misleading, it was a continuous operation, the landing mats were sent out on targets and it was thus taken on to ship.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="506.752" stopTime="520.371">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    It was the directing authority of -- who was the person who had the control over this man’s activities in this work?
speaker="ross_diamond_jr" startTime="520.371" stopTime="529.438">
    Mr. Ross Diamond, Jr. 
    There was the foreman, a working boss and a walking boss, in stevedore they call him in Mobile a gang foreman. 
    He would have two.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="529.438" stopTime="531.026">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    And they both worked for the stevedoring company?
speaker="ross_diamond_jr" startTime="531.026" stopTime="561.706">
    Mr. Ross Diamond, Jr. 
    Yes and the mates of the ship would be in control of the loading and unloading operation generally. 
    The ship's officers always maintain supervision and control of the vessel in the loading and unloading operation. 
    Customarily, it is my understanding that they do not interfere with the stevedoring contractor's control unless they see something that is wrong in the manner of storage or something wrong, it is in the manner of the loading or discharging.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="561.706" stopTime="570.178">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Is the -- practice is the stevedoring company and independent contractors?
speaker="ross_diamond_jr" startTime="570.178" stopTime="627.454">
    Mr. Ross Diamond, Jr. 
    Yes. 
    I would like to mention one fact that maybe considered pertinent, but is not in the record, if I may. 
    This case was heard on a motion for summary judgment, only the deposition of Bill Law was taken. 
    The fact that I would like to mention is that the Bill Law’s fellow workers had worked this vessel the day before, had loaded landing mats into the hold of this particular hatch, in the wings of this hold, and had worked to the hatch square. 
    The forklift that was used in the hold of the ship, the day before for taking the landing mats into the wings of the ship, was not necessary when they were landing in the square of the hatch and that morning it was taken out of the hatch onto the dock and it is the machine that Bill Law was using.

    Unknown Speaker 
    That is not in the record.
speaker="ross_diamond_jr" startTime="628.481" stopTime="656.697">
    Mr. Ross Diamond, Jr. 
    That is not in the record Mr. Justice. 
    I think that that it is commonly accepted in the industry and everybody recognizes that most of the cargo that requires a lift machine to get it to the hook, requires a lift machine in the hatch to get it to its place of storage in the hatch unless it can be landed directly into the square of the hatch.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="656.697" stopTime="661.478">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Well that would be, not the usual situation or would it be?
speaker="ross_diamond_jr" startTime="661.478" stopTime="664.806">
    Mr. Ross Diamond, Jr. 
    Yes. 
    I do not understand your question.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="664.806" stopTime="687.120">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Well, the first stage after it reaches the vessel, when it comes down in the sling, does it normally get to its final resting place in the hatch at that point from as to be moved and loaded by people who are on the ship’s crew, must be put in place?
speaker="ross_diamond_jr" startTime="687.120" stopTime="704.104">
    Mr. Ross Diamond, Jr. 
    It must be put in place unless that can swing to its place by the pendulum of the cargo fall. 
    If it is going into the wing it must get into its place in some fashion either by men carrying it, they are rolling it, they are pushing it, they are by forklift machine and taking it into the wings.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="704.104" stopTime="714.687">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    It would be hard to say that most of the cargo has to be moved after it is removed from the sling on most --

    Mr. Ross Diamond, Jr.

    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Where do you think it is?
speaker="ross_diamond_jr" startTime="777.913" stopTime="810.027">
    Mr. Ross Diamond, Jr. 
    I think that the beginning and end can be approached from several concepts of test. 
    I think that the beginning and end could be considered from a loading or unloading concept from a work traditionally done by a seaman concept, from a remoteness and time and place concepts, in the service of the ship concept. 
    I think that probably --
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="810.027" stopTime="814.442">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    If they go to truck and unload it on the pier?

    No, sir.

    Why not?
speaker="ross_diamond_jr" startTime="817.131" stopTime="827.176">
    Mr. Ross Diamond, Jr. 
    I think that just what Your Honor is indicating that it must have a beginning and end. 
    I think that the delivery man delivering it onto the pier is just that a delivery man delivering it.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="827.176" stopTime="834.317">

    Mr. Ross Diamond, Jr. 
    I do not think that -- I think we would have to -- we are talking about unseaworthiness, we would have to have some unseaworthiness involved if Law to have a cause of action. 
    I think the unseaworthiness would have to be related to the cargo on the --
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="850.474" stopTime="852.836">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Then it has to be related to the ship?

    Yes sir.

speaker="ross_diamond_jr" startTime="857.890" stopTime="864.842">
    Mr. Ross Diamond, Jr. 
    I think that the remoteness in time and place, I think, that the vessel should be at the pier.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="864.842" stopTime="871.448">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Would that be tied up?
speaker="ross_diamond_jr" startTime="871.448" stopTime="906.050">
    Mr. Ross Diamond, Jr. 
    I think the loading and unloading operation should be in actual progress and for it to be an actual progress, I suppose it would have to be tied up sir. 
    I think this vessel should be at the pier. 
    The loading or discharging operation should be in actual progress. 
    I think the day before, the day after is too remote in time and the place, I think, that it must be within the area of the dock. 
    We get into some hypotheticals there that would depend upon the various customs in the ports and the locations of the port.

    Alright.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="909.765" stopTime="935.795">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    The stuff is cleared out of the storage area and has been loaded and a truck backs up with forklift all the way on the pads to be forklifted off the truck and Law is running the forklift up to the truck, on the truck and picks up the material. 
    Would that apply while he was on the truck?

    Mr. Reeves mentions the perils and risk of a seaman. 
    In 1954, the National Academy of Sciences conducted a study of the various dangerous occupations in the United States and in that study the Longshoreman’s industry was by far the most dangerous occupation, far exceeding the logging industry, the sawmill industry and steel erection occupation.

    Mr. Ross Diamond, Jr. 
    I do not think that the doctrine of seaworthiness should be extended to the beans in the oven (ph) from the bag in the warehouse in Denver. 
    I do not think that it should extend to the Longshoreman who has taken the truck of the Stevedoring Company to go downtown and get some rope. 
    I think if we come to a logical conclusion and apply these concepts or tests, remoteness in time and place, loading and unloading work traditionally done a by seaman in the service of the ship, we can come to some realistic guidelines, if we may call them that by which to apply the rule. 
    I was stating a minute ago that I felt the ship should be working cargo, either loading or discharging, it should be at the dock. 
    I think that the area would be within area of the confines of the loading operation. 
    We all know that these vessels carry huge amounts of freight. 
    It would be impossible to place all of the freight that they carry underneath the hook and have it ready there to be lowered onto the ship when it docks. 
    There has got to be a storage place on the dock or any adjacent warehouse and that is customarily what is done in the industry. 
    The cargo that is going to be loaded to this vessel that is coming in, it is at a storage pile on the dock or in the warehouse adjacent to the place that the vessel is going to dock. 
    It has to be brought from that point to the cargo hook. 
    And again it carries great quantities of cargo and on discharge it would be physically impossible to leave it all under the hook. 
    It must be taken from the hook to a storage place on the dock or in the adjacent warehouse in close proximity to where the vessel is docked. 
    Customarily, that is what is done in the loading and unloading operation. 
    The vessel contracts to do just this. 
    This is part of the cost of carrying the goods. 
    It is customarily in the trade. 
    You can have a special discharging or loading agreement. 
    But by great preponderance when the vessel contracts to carry goods, they agree to bear the cost of bringing it from its storage point on the dock or the adjacent warehouse, and agree to pay the cost of taking it from the hook to its storage pile on the dock or at a warehouse immediately adjacent to the dock. 
    Until each functions are completed, the vessel does not earn any freight at all. 
    The seaman in the olden days did this work. 
    They had to do just the same thing that Bill Law did. 
    They have to take it from the storage pile onto dock to the hook and they would have to take it from the hook to the storage pile onto dock.

    The reading I had that seems to bear that the Stevedoring -- longshoring specialization had it that meant in late in the 19th Century. 
    I imagine there was an overlap where there was some specialization and some seamen did it. 
    I am sure that if the seamen did that, that they would have to do it in this fashion, that they will have to take it from the storage.

    Whoever did it would have to do it in that fashion at that point?
speaker="ross_diamond_jr" startTime="2079.867" stopTime="2113.476">
    Mr. Ross Diamond, Jr. 
    Yes. 
    I think, any interpretation of loading and unloading, that does not recognize that these functions are part of the ship's work and does not recognize that it has to be taken from this pile to the hook and from the hook to this pile, it defies the English language. 
    I do not see -- it is unrealistic to me, cut off that it is loaded or unloaded at the hook.

    Your point is simply that the loading was necessarily at least a two-stage process.

    Mr. Diamond now that we have passed the middle of the 20th Century, should not we look at what has been an almost uniform practice during this entire century with respect to loading and unloading ships and the seaman's part in it?

    Mr. Ross Diamond, Jr. 
    We cannot ignore the present Your Honor. 
    I think we should recognize it. 
    I say this that the reasons for the rule are still there. 
    Any of as who have visited a freighter, general cargo freighter, and one of that doctrine in a port, that is loading at two or more hatches, several hatches, recognize the danger that exists. 
    Their pallets of the cargo swinging overhead coming here and there, their forklift machines running here and on, there seems to be an appealing of urgency in the air. 
    It is perhaps contributed to by fact that the stevedoring companies work on a tonnage basis in most ports rather than hourly basis and that the vessels themselves are on a strict schedule. 
    There is a feeling of urgency in the air and there is a danger that exists.

    That is correct but we have also got to recognize that the whole industry pays the cost and not just a stevedore, because the stevedore has got to look at the actual inexperience and what it cost them in charge, make a charge distinction.

    According to State law the relationship between the stevedore and its employer is governed by the Workers' Compensation?

    I do not think that the doctrine of seaworthiness that is extended to the longshoreman loading and unloading the vessel would preempt the State law on the compensation.

    Mr. Ross Diamond, Jr. 
    As to State law it is got a provision and subrogation just as The Longshoremen Harbor Workers' Act has, the impact of State law as the Longshoreman and Harbor Workers' Act provides for those situations where the injured worker has a cause of action against a third party. 
    Thank you. 
   
   
   
   Rebuttal of W. Boyd Reeves
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="2338.804" stopTime="2342.671">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Mr. Diamond, Mr. Reeves you have about seven minutes.
speaker="w_boyd_reeves" startTime="2342.671" stopTime="2410.115">
    Mr. W. Boyd Reeves 
    I would take a couple of minutes, if I may Your Honor. 
    I am going to take up on the last question of who must bear the cost. 
    The Court would recall that the Longshoremen Harbor Workers' Act was passed so that the injured longshoreman would have his remedy for the vessel side or the water side of the dock. 
    Now, the Court has held that this is the longshoreman's exclusive remedy against his employer, is under the Longshoremen and Harbor Workers' Act. 
    I think the Court has in its questions touched on the problem that we have here. 
    As a practical matter, Mr. Law got his employer where if he prevails here would pay whatever he receives that is sometimes in the industry known as two bites from the apple. 
    He had one bite for his compensation, he then brings his action against the vessel for this shore-side injury.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="2410.115" stopTime="2416.521">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Incidentally I gather there has never been a claim that this entry was compensable under the Longshoreman's Act, has it not?
speaker="w_boyd_reeves" startTime="2416.521" stopTime="2422.927">
    Mr. W. Boyd Reeves 
    No sir, there has not been a claim for that. 
    It was voluntarily paid under the Alabama State Compensation Act.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2422.927" stopTime="2425.450">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    The Longshoreman's Act does not cover the State law?
speaker="w_boyd_reeves" startTime="2425.450" stopTime="2528.563">
    Mr. W. Boyd Reeves 
    The Longshoremen Harbor Workers' Act under Nacirema would not apply to this type of thing, as it happened on the dock. 
    Mr. Diamond spoke of the survey of the dangerous type of work that longshoremen do. 
    As I recall reading the Yale Law Journal article, says with the possible exception of logging and other industries to discuss all type of construction, heavy labor, any type of work where man is exposed to walking the beams of constructing buildings, on the dock, whatever he maybe doing is dangerous work. 
    Nowhere under any as the law as any workmen given the shield of protection as a longshoreman has been given specially in this case here as exclusively on the docket. 
    The court would recall the Pope &amp; Talbot versus Hawn, teaches us this is not the label that we put on the man where these longshoreman with the type of work that he is doing. 
    The one other point that you said was not in the record, the record does state that in response to questions on page 91 that where he got those forklift machines, he said he picked it up at the garage, at Gus garage that morning and drove it down to the vessel to start his work. 
    I do not know where it was the day before. 
    Again I would respectfully submit the court below has extended the doctrine too far and request this Court to place limitations by reversing the court below. 
    Thank you very much.
