Combs v. United States
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="0.000" stopTime="43.531">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    We’ll hear arguments next in 71-517, Combs against the United States. 
    Mr. Perry, you may proceed.
speaker="james_n_perry" startTime="43.531" stopTime="169.126">
    Mr. James N. Perry 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    We’d like to acknowledge and recognize that Mr. William F. Hopkins would have been here today, but on advice of counsel, he was unable to travel to Washington. 
    The petitioner was charged with an indictment having to do with receiving, possessing, and concealing goods that were stolen in interstate commerce. 
    When the matter came on for trial, there was a pretrial motion to suppress. 
    The argument was basically that the affidavit in the search warrant was defective. 
    Without the issue of standing having been challenged, the Court overruled the pretrial motion to suppress, the matter went to trial, petitioner was found guilty. 
    When the matter was appealed to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals for the first time, the United States Government raised the issue of standing. 
    The Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals determined that we did not have standing and they affirmed the trial court. 
    Now, the argument of the petitioner is relatively straight forward. 
    We feel there’s a tension between the Fourth and the Fifth Amendment. 
    We’re relying upon Jones and we’re relying upon Simmons, and we’re saying that if an indictment has as one of its element’s possession, the Government cannot deny to a standing to attack a search warrant. 
    Now the Government has argued that actually they have two positions. 
    They’ve argued that Simmons gives the petitioner protection because whatever he says at the pretrial hearing cannot be used against him but the trial in chief. 
    And they also, have urged the Court to adopt the theory that a thief can have no expectation of privacy with regard to the goods that he stolen, and cannot therefore bring himself within the Fourth Amendment.

    Justice Byron R. White 
    Let’s assume that the thief hides his goods in a checkroom, he just hides it there. 
    The police said here that he did it and they simply go the checkroom operator and say, we would like to look around here for some goods we think that were stolen. 
    The checkroom operator says, come on in. 
    The police go in and they find the good. 
    Now at that point, is it your position that the police may not seize those goods without a warrant?
speaker="james_n_perry" startTime="197.260" stopTime="200.505">
    Mr. James N. Perry 
    No, Your Honor. 
    I’d say they had permission to enter the checkroom by the checkroom girl.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="200.505" stopTime="208.095">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, I know but they didn’t have permission from anybody to take the good and the Fourth Amendment protects those effects.

    Mr. James N. Perry 
    Yes sir.

    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well now, couldn’t it -- the Court could say, well we -- surely you have standing to object in the sense that they’re your goods but they’re has just been no violation of your Fourth Amendment rights because the police may seize stolen goods without violating anybody’s Fourth Amendment right?
speaker="james_n_perry" startTime="228.683" stopTime="233.352">
    Mr. James N. Perry 
    Yes, sir.

    Oh! 
    Yes, they saw it in the -- and they’ve search for it and found it, and assuming that there were no violations of the defendant’s Fourth Amendment rights until they seize the liquor.

    Mr. James N. Perry 
    Your Honor, we feel that in this particular instance, the search warrant was and I think it’s conceded, it was not an adequate warrant, and we want to attack that.

    Yes, sir.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="352.570" stopTime="364.967">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    But all you’re claiming is a basis for attacking the warrant is the claim of possession in the goods, isn’t it? 
    Not any expectation of privacy in the property owned by the defendant’s father?
speaker="james_n_perry" startTime="364.967" stopTime="370.997">
    Mr. James N. Perry 
    We had an expectation of privacy and that’s why we concealed on this farm. 
    The goods were hot, were trying to hide it.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="370.997" stopTime="386.390">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    In this case, were you denied the right to show that you had such an interest in the real property, that the entry onto the property violated your client’s rights.
speaker="james_n_perry" startTime="386.390" stopTime="404.050">
    Mr. James N. Perry 
    Your Honor, the issue of standing was not discussed at the trial court level. 
    When we had the pretrial motion to suppress, it was never raised. 
    In other words, the issue was never discussed. 
    The only thing that was discussed was the sufficiency of the affidavit.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="404.050" stopTime="418.403">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, so it’s never been tried out as to whether or not if the warrant was no good that your client’s Fourth Amendment rights were violated by entering the property.

    Mr. James N. Perry 
    I believe that’s right. 
    Yes, Your Honor. 
    In other words, I’m saying that we feel that if they did not have a valid warrant, they did not have a right to go on this farm and find the liquor.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="431.212" stopTime="432.476">
    Justice Byron R. White

    Mr. James N. Perry 
    No, Your Honor. 
    Our point of view would be that we are entitled to suppress that evidence even though the liquor that we had stolen was secreted on the farm of a stranger.

    Well, in the -- from the concept of property and ownership, the Court is correct. 
    But the man did have possession of them and he’s charged with possession as an element of the crime.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="518.445" stopTime="534.286">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    But I thought you’re arguing a minute ago that your principle contention was violation of the expectation of privacy on the farm. 
    Now, are you also saying that you’re claiming of right in the liquor itself, which was violated by a seizure without an appropriate warrant?
speaker="james_n_perry" startTime="534.286" stopTime="549.400">
    Mr. James N. Perry 
    Yes, Your Honor, based on the idea that we were charged with possession. 
    The mere fact that we’re charged with possession forces us to give up something in order to protect ourselves so that we can have this evidence suppressed.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="549.400" stopTime="557.534">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist

    Your Honor, that question is a difficult imposed question. 
    I would say that they had an access to the courtroom but with regard to the goods that they took, if they’re charging us with possession of them as an element of our crime, then I think that gives us standing.

    Mr. James N. Perry 
    Yes, sir. 
    Now, we have this problem that when we had a motion to suppress, and we are asked to explain how we acquire our rights to suppress these items.

    Mr. James N. Perry 
    Yes sir, that’s correct. 
    Now, we’re tying to determine if it can be used indirectly from the standpoint of impeachment as Harris would suggest or could it be used in this way. 
    Let’s suppose that we were successful on the motion to suppress and the tangible evidence could not be used. 
    Now, could the United States Government use other facts that were tainted or with – they were -- their origin was the basis of our testimony on suppression and would we then have in our owned type of question, what was the origin of these facts that they’ve presented? 
    Was it truly independent or was it from our testimony at the pretrial? 
    Now, the Government makes the point that if the man is a thief, with regard to the stolen goods, he shouldn’t have standing. 
    But in order to determine that issue, do we first have to determine that he is a thief, which is really what is supposed to be determined at the trial in chief. 
    We would say that he is entitled to assert standing without having any determination on a pretrial basis whether he’s a thief or not.

    Mr. James N. Perry 
    Well, except to that at the pretrial hearing, he might come on and say, no, I’m not a thief.

    Your Honor, I think there was a question of whether it was stolen and who stole it. 
    As I understand the facts, it was transported in interstate commerce from Ohio to Kentucky. 
    It was properly taxed at the time it was taken. 
    I guess basically, what we’re saying, the Court has shown familiarity with our position certainly. 
    We’re saying the United States Government should not be allowed to benefit from lawlessness that is if they can go out and breakdown a door or with an inadequate warrant, go out and search and find something. 
    They should not through the limitation of Simmons or through the suggestion of the U.S. Attorney be permitted to use that evidence against us.

    Your Honor as a matter of fact, a little bit more on that point, if the affidavit in the search warrant had been adequate under Aguilar and Spinelli.

   Argument of William Bradford Reynolds
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="939.729" stopTime="941.573">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Mr. Reynolds.
speaker="william_bradford_reynolds" startTime="941.573" stopTime="1177.079">
    Mr. William Bradford Reynolds 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    This case presents the single issue whether one charged with possession of stolen property should by virtue of that charged alone be accorded automatic standing to challenge a search for or seizure of that property, and in order to put that issue in proper context, let me amplify on the facts provided by Mr. Perry just briefly. 
    Prior to trial in this case, petitioner moved to suppress the 26 cases of whiskey involved here that were seized by the Kentucky State Police, claming that the underlying affidavit for the search warrant was legally deficient. 
    The motion was heard by the District Court and denied and at that time the question of standing was not raised or argued by the parties. 
    The case then proceeded to trial where the government’s evidence reveals the following. 
    On July 28, 1969, petitioner telephoned one Janet Ballard and asked whether she knew of anyone who wanted to buy some whiskey. 
    She said, yes. 
    And later that day, petitioner delivered approximately 40 cases of whiskey to her home in Newport, Kentucky. 
    The following evening, Mrs. Ballard called petitioner, told him that she had heard the whiskey was stolen and asked the he removed it. 
    He did so with the help of one James Martin, Mrs. Ballard’s brother, and they stored the whiskey in a basement of the home of petitioner’s estranged wife, which at that time also contained some 30 or 40 additional cases of whiskey. 
    Later that same week, Martin received the -- a telephone call from petitioner. 
    He was told that “the heat was on” and that the whiskey had to be moved. 
    The two men then went to the house, loaded all the cases of whiskey onto a pick-up truck and transported the whiskey some 200 miles to Hazard, Kentucky. 
    The cases were stored in an old shed on the farm of petitioner’s father. 
    Thereafter, Martin went to the FBI agents assigned to the area and told him of the stolen whiskey. 
    The agent gave the information to the Kentucky State Police and they obtained and executed a warrant to search the father’s farm. 
    Pursuant thereto, the police seized in the shed the 26 cases of whiskey involved here. 
    Petitioner who is now present at the time was later arrested in his home in Newport, Kentucky. 
    His defense at trial was based on testimony given by petitioner and members of his family to the effect that the shed had earlier been rented by James Martin and one Charles Chapman. 
    That it was Martin and Chapman who had stored the whiskey in the shed and the petitioner had not been on or near his father’s farm during the relevant period and had never anything to do with the whiskey in question. 
    Following his conviction, petitioner appealed to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals on the ground that the whiskey had been seized under an invalid search warrant and that the evidence had therefore been improperly admitted. 
    The Government, recognizing for the first on appeal that the underlying affidavit for the search warrant was legally deficient under Aguilar v. Texas argued only in the Court of Appeals the petitioner lacks standing to raise the Fourth Amendment claim.

    Unknown Speaker 
    Alright.
speaker="william_bradford_reynolds" startTime="1663.045" stopTime="2023.865">
    Mr. William Bradford Reynolds 
    Now, the problem that the -- the reason we have such a problem with respect to standing is because of the decision of this Court in Jones v. United States where it was held that one who is charged with a possessory crime, in this case possession of stolen property automatically has standing to contest or challenge the search and seizure. 
    And we believe that the dual rational of the Jones decision has been undermined significantly by the subsequent decision in this Court in Simmons. 
    And that it should be reexamined by this Court and to the extent that it would confer automatic standing in one charged with a possessory crime of stolen property it should be abandoned. 
    The reason given, one of the reasons given by the Court to sustain the automatic standing rule, it’s -- was essentially that the defendant in order to establish standing to suppress evidence might well have virtually to admit his guilt of the possessory offense charged. 
    And his virtual admission could then at that time, be used against him at the trial. 
    In this prospect or dilemma as it were referred to in Jones was viewed by the Court as a deterrent on some defendants who would otherwise have come forward to vindicate their Fourth Amendment claims. 
    And was thus considered, the Court said to weaken the efficacy of the exclusionary rule as a sanction from unlawful police behavior. 
    No longer, however does there seem to be a real prospect of later direct use at trial of testimony given earlier in support of a suppression motion. 
    In Simmons v. United States at 390 U.S. decided several years after Jones, this Court held the testimony given by a defendant in support of his motion to suppress under the Fourth Amendment may not thereafter be admitted against him at trial on the issue of guilt unless he makes no objection and this use restriction rule of Simmons essentially removes the dilemma that was confronting defendants at the time that Jones was deciding and then thereby eliminates one of the two reasons given by the Court in Jones for fashioning an automatic standing rule. 
    As to the other reason which was that the Government would have the benefit of the -- the rule of the automatic standing rule was fashioned so the Government would not have the benefit of contradictory positions as a basis for conviction. 
    That’s also undermined by Simmons cause that rational was based on the argument that if a defendant was sufficiently deterred from asserting his Fourth Amendment right, so that he remain silent, choosing not to acknowledge any interest in the premises search to the property seized. 
    But the Government would then have the advantage of a position on a question of the admissibility of evidence that was seemingly inconsistent with its proof of lawful possession at trial. 
    However, now that the fact that it was deterred, defendants from moving to suppress has been removed by Simmons, the used restriction rule of Simmons. 
    It seems unlikely that defendants will choose to forego pressing their Fourth Amendment claims. 
    Perhaps even more to the point, if one is charged -- who is charged with possession moves to suppress on grounds of illegal search or seizure, we do not believe that the Government is required as we understand the fundamental inquiry for purposes of standing under the Fourth Amendment to maintain a position inconsistent with or contradictory to its position at trial. 
    In this case, petitioner’s conviction flows from proof of his knowing possession of the stolen whiskey before and at the time of the search. 
    If the admissibility into evidence of the fruits of that search, on the ground the petitioner lacks standing is perfectly consistent we think, but the theory that petitioner have constructed possession of the whiskey at all relevant times. 
    His standing depends upon some showing of an intrusion of privacy of his own person, his own house, his own papers or his own effects, or an intrusion on premises in which he personally had a legitimate expectation of privacy. 
    In the absence of such a showing, the evidence is admissible without regard to whether petitioner might claim which he never has done in this case that he possessed the stolen whiskey. 
    It would thus be no need for the Government to dispute such a claim on a motion to suppress. 
    In sum, we do not believe that he had the fundamental purpose of the Fourth Amendment to protect individual privacy, or the dual rational of Jones v. United States when read in light of this Court’s subsequent decision in Simmons. 
    Warrants and application of auto -- of the automatic standing rule to one charge with lawless possession on the sole basis for its Fourth Amendment claim is the seizure of stolen property in which he has no legitimate proprietary interest and with respect to which he can have no reasonable expectation of privacy.

    Mr. William Bradford Reynolds 
    Your Honor, I don’t believe I have an answer as to why they did not raise a standing point. 
    The government failed to raise it. 
    It raised it for the first time in the Court of Appeals.

    Mr. William Bradford Reynolds 
    It was argued in the briefs and it was argued on petition for rehearing. 
    The Court of Appeals decided the question on the standing issue alone and at no time in the Court of Appeals was an objection made to the fact that the standing issue had not been raised in the District Court. 
    When the court came here -- when the case came here on petition for certiorari, there was no objection to that -- to the fact that it had not been raised below. 
    The petition was addressed itself solely to the point that we’re discussing here going to the standing. 
    In the merits brief, there was also no objection raised on that point, on petitioner’s merits brief. 
    Again, addressing himself solely to the standing question. 
    Now in Jones, v. United States, the same one we’ve been discussing at 362, this Court had a similar situation before it and said that the question was properly before it in the circumstances and if they could decide the issue.

    When you asked for a reversal.

    Mr. William Bradford Reynolds

    Unknown Speaker 
    Mr. Reynolds, may I come back to a point you’ve touched on that I’m not entirely clear about. Would it be necessary in this case for the Government to allege possession? 
    Would not -- there have been a crime committed if the Government had alleged that the whiskey was stolen and transported in interstate commerce?
speaker="william_bradford_reynolds" startTime="2350.991" stopTime="2364.900">
    Mr. William Bradford Reynolds 
    Well he is -- in this case the defendant was charged with receiving, possessing and concealing tax paid whiskey that have been stolen from an interstate shipment knowing it to be stolen.
speaker="lewis_f_powell_jr" startTime="2364.900" stopTime="2387.728">
    Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. 
    Suppose you had a case where a man who was charged with stealing it and transporting it in interstate commerce. 
    He had no reason to be sure that he had it in his possession at the time. 
    Does that make any difference? 
    I take it your position is the possession itself even constructive, that it makes no difference?
speaker="william_bradford_reynolds" startTime="2387.728" stopTime="2396.267">
    Mr. William Bradford Reynolds 
    That’s correct Your Honor. 
    We don’t believe that the element of possession should have a bearing on the question of the Fourth Amendment question.
speaker="lewis_f_powell_jr" startTime="2396.267" stopTime="2397.907">
    Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr.

    Unknown Speaker 
    But you do state as I understand it and I wondered, I have the same question in my mind as that expressed by Mr. Justice Powell apparently. 
    You do state that possession is an element of the offense to be proved.

    Yes it is, it is an element of the offense --

    Let’s assume that all that comes of this case, neither -- I have no idea what will come out of this but the -- isn’t the -- that judgment below is either reserved to vacated and it is ordered that there would be a new hearing, would you have any right to object to this evidence on the ground that you have interest in the real property, if you did?

    Pending that hearing, what would be your thought that the judgment of conviction be temporarily set aside and then reinstated if you lose in the hearing, or would you prefer that the hearing go forward without vacating the conviction and if you win, however, at the hearing, the conviction would be vacated that you have in the trial.
