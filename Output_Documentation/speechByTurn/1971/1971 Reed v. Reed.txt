    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    We will hear arguments next in Number 04, Reed against Reed. 
    Mr. Derr, oh, excuse me, your friend is not quite here yet. 
    You may proceed. 
    Let me put a question to you at the outset. 
    This is -- the statute under which this case comes here has now been superseded, is that correct, by a new statute?
speaker="allen_r_derr" startTime="48.408" stopTime="70.716">
    Mr. Allen R. Derr 
    It has not yet been superseded. 
    Earlier this year Mr. Chief Justice, the Idaho Supreme Court enacted a uniform probate act. 
    Now this act does not contain this preference statute that we are talking about in this case. 
    That act does not come into effect until July of next year.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="70.716" stopTime="80.510">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    But as of July next year, 1972, the new legislation would washout this problem, is that correct?

    Mr. Allen R. Derr

    Mr. Chief Justice, Your Honors, may it please the Court. 
    We are here today to ask you to do something that this Court has never done since the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted in 1868 and that is to declare a state statute that distinguishes between -- that classifies between males and females as unconstitutional. 
    We feel that the case could have us -- at least a significant, significant for women, somewhat it can to what ground as Board of Education had for the butter --

    I forgot the name of it.

    Mr. Allen R. Derr 
    That case was decided, Your Honor on a premise that we feel is no longer tenable. 
    It allowed the wife or daughter of an owner to tend bar that no other women to tend bar. 
    It seems that it had been felt by the Court that if the wife, the wife or daughter would be protected by the husband or father and that for other reason there was a rational relationship to a legitimate state purpose. 
    And as rational relationship test that has followed through our law had given some indication that wherever there has been a classification on the basis of sex, anything goes, it is alright. 
    And we admit they are different, but we do feel as a result of this rational relationship test is almost as they enter it is separate but equal test that (Inaudible) in holding that -- holding that women from being considered person and holding them back from their entitlement under the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution, the Equal Protection Clause.

    Mr. Allen R. Derr 
    There is a serious question on my mind because of the mandatory provisions and our Supreme Court in the case we are appealing from is that that provision is mandatory.

    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    Well, what is the practical aspect in the day to day routine of the Idaho Probate Courts, do they do this?

    Mr. Allen R. Derr 
    I have known them personally and in fact this has been so except by ascent and never in this type of equal relationship. 
    I have had a brother and sister agree with each other. 
    But it seems to me that any kind, a male contender appears under the statute, the language of the statute is clear. 
    Males must be preferred to be, there is no discretion.
speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="394.957" stopTime="401.694">
    Justice Harry A. Blackmun

    Mr. Allen R. Derr

speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="427.627" stopTime="451.207">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Because it does equally entitle then you might say that before the statute makes the choice there would have to be a hearing as to what the respective qualifications are for these two people and it would only be when they are found to be absolutely equally qualified to act that the statute would make the choice, but I gather that is not the way it was?

    Mr. Allen R. Derr

    Privilege as an immunity?
speaker="allen_r_derr" startTime="1037.160" stopTime="1108.346">
    Mr. Allen R. Derr 
    Right, and I think that was, if I am not mistaken through of – was that Brad Robert denied women even right to practice law before the turn of the century. 
    Since the turn of the century, the cases that have come before this Court have ended up in decisions that I have felt have been either supposedly beneficial or protective as far as the women are concerned. 
    Obviously I can see nothing beneficial in the Idaho law nor can I see anything protective in the Idaho law. 
    It is just a law based discrimination against women and once that comes up, the door is locked on the women. 
    She might as well go home, if that law is allowed to stand. 
    Now, Idaho tried to justify this law on two points, one; biological and the other practical and I do not think either of those points would bear the strict scrutiny and justify the action that the State has taken here.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="1108.346" stopTime="1111.030">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Well, what was the basis of the biological justification point?
speaker="allen_r_derr" startTime="1111.030" stopTime="1151.747">
    Mr. Allen R. Derr 
    That men are generally better qualified than women and that is basically what the Idaho Supreme Court said. 
    Going back to the early cases, going back to Muller or even Goesaert and I think we have cited a great number of statistics to show that women comprised 40% of the labor market now, roughly equivalently educated in the labor market and in spite of all this and because of the sex-based discriminations we say their income is way below the income of a man.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1151.747" stopTime="1154.328">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Well that does not get into this case, does it?
speaker="allen_r_derr" startTime="1154.328" stopTime="1232.396">
    Mr. Allen R. Derr 
    It really does not, this is not an economic case except this does, Chief Justice bring up another point. 
    The administrator does get paid and very little less than the attorney of an estate. 
    Our briefs have extensively exhausted the relationship between sex-based distinctions and race-based distinctions. 
    And as you know in alienage, in minority groups with respect to indigency in some cases and at least in Levee in respect to illegitimacy, the strict test has been applied and these classifications have been held not valid and with such a large segment of our population as women are, I certainly do not think it is valid to them. 
    In other words, what I am saying is I think women are every bit as entitled to protection of the Fourteenth Amendment, they are persons. 
    The action here is state action as aliens, minority groups, indigency, racial authorities.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="1232.396" stopTime="1235.645">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Would you say that the second justification --
speaker="allen_r_derr" startTime="1235.645" stopTime="1337.893">
    Mr. Allen R. Derr 
    The second justification is the practical one in which the Court said by doing this we will avoid hearings. 
    Again I do not think that is efficient to state interest to even the rational relationship, let alone the strict approach that would be taken under a suspect classification and number two, I do not think it is necessarily true. 
    For instance the hypothetical, you have two or more men, you have two or more women. 
    They all want to administer the estate. 
    The men after a hearing cannot qualify because of these other disqualifications, so then the Court would have to turn around and hold another hearing as far as the women contenders are concerned. 
    So that -- altogether I do not think it is number one, I do not think it is true, and number two, I do not think it is sufficient justification to deny Sally Reed the equal protection of the Fourteenth Amendment. 
    California examined Goesaert very carefully not long ago and in that case they exhausted most of the authorities, it is a very recent case, a 1971 case.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1337.893" stopTime="1343.232">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    But Goesaert could be explained in terms of the Twenty-first Amendment, could it not?
speaker="allen_r_derr" startTime="1343.232" stopTime="1343.842">
    Mr. Allen R. Derr 
    I presume that is possible.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1343.842" stopTime="1356.569">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    The amendment that repealed prohibition and it gave the States, certainly as construed by subsequent decisions of this Court, a great deal of autonomy in the area of dispensing of alcohol?
speaker="allen_r_derr" startTime="1356.569" stopTime="1505.272">
    Mr. Allen R. Derr 
    And that is why it goes -- it probably is not supportive of the respondent's position in this case. 
    There has been a great deal of progress too we might point out, I am sure the Court is well aware of the progress in Congress with the Civil Rights Act, the Equal Pay Acts and some other acts that have come up and it is a fang truth and a lot of cases are set forth in all briefs here that Lower Courts are disregarding the so called preachings of Muller, Goesaert and Hoyt and of course there is a great factual movement towards bringing women into our society as a person. 
    I think the only satisfactory solution now is to treat any classification of women is suspect unless the classification involves physical characteristics you need to that sex. 
    Anything else can get us off into a lot of other fields. 
    I think that could solve the situation, could give guidelines to other -- to legislatures or the Courts in order to allow a woman to take her full place in our society, take advantage of the opportunities that are available and also take the responsibilities that always go with opportunity. 
    And I do not think a suspect classification is a bad classification in a sense and it could be applied in this case, I am sure, that if the State wishes to disadvantage anyone, should not the State then -- should not the burden be on the oppressor instead of the oppressed? 
    Is this not a fundamental principle of fairness?

    Mr. Allen R. Derr 
    Our statute also prefers in the line of the fact to administer estates brothers or sisters. 
    We think this is just bad as -- it is a male over female classification. 
    I want to summarize I think coming into the eighth decade of the 20th Century that we do have to reexamine the situation as far as sexual classifications are concerned. 
    We have to discard those canards or canards, how we pronounce it, that are not based upon fact. 
    In Digg, for instance they were trying to rely on -- way back in the early 1800’s, the ideas that Holmes set back at ease and I think what he said is pretty interesting. 
    It is revolting to have no better reason for a rule of law than it was --

    Then that -- it was laid down at the time of Henry Ford, but it is still more revolting if the grounds upon which it was laid down, a vanished long sense and the rule simply persists from blind imitation of the facts. 
    We think if the Idaho rule in this case is about to persist that it will be from blind imitations of past and not based upon our current understanding of the Fourteenth Amendment or the facts of today’s society.

    The Probate Court obeyed culminated, took it from her custody and put it in a children’s home for a time and then gave it to the father and the child was in custody of the father at the time of his death. 
    Those were the facts. 
    I might say here that the Probate Court in Idaho at the time this was decided was a Constitutional Court. 
    It has held in the Court of Record by the Supreme Court. 
    However, no report or transcript is ordinarily made unless the attorneys get a reporter up there and make it at their own expense, the practice is not to make one. 
    At the beginning of this year as the jurisdiction was transferred to the District Court under a new judicial code we have there of which is the Court of General Jurisdiction which is merely background and had really nothing to do with the case except that is the history of the matter. 
    In our brief we have raised two questions, one of which is to whether or not there is a substantial federal question involved in this case. 
    The second one assuming that the Court hold that there is, it is our position that this particular statute is not unconstitutional as violating the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the constitution.

    Mr. Charles S. Stout 
    I do not feel that would make a protection problem. 
    In our brief, however, we considered that first question first and we say if this new Idaho statute which was adopted in 1971, in the last session of the legislature, it is at Chapter 111 of the Idaho Section Laws of 1971, it has got a lengthy title. 
    It is lengthy law. 
    I have studied it thoroughly in respect to the issues in this case. 
    It is an act relating to the appearance of decedents including non-probate transfers at death of missing persons, protected persons, minors, incapacitated persons in constituting the Uniformed Probate Code. 
    Now, that statute enacts an entirely new probate law for Idaho. 
    The controversy was not over the statutes that we are arguing about here. 
    It was over the time and expense involved at probate proceedings and the design of the statute is to avoid the proceedings as much as possible. 
    The statute does enact a new probate law and thus repeal effective next at July 1. 
    The statutes in controversy here. 
    Now, we do not claim that that makes this case quickly moot, but it just show the apparent present intent and add it to the Idaho legislature.

    Mr. Charles S. Stout 
    Those under the Idaho statutes are only appointed where the -- where there is some reason for it like property that is liable to depreciate, or some purpose. 
    No, I do not think there would have been. 
    There was really no reason for up here. 
    There was nothing that would depreciate this alleged bank account that is referred to in Sally Reed’s petition and also personal clothings and small amount of personal properties that a minor boy of that age would have. 
    The second point that we raised under that is the -- is the holdings of this Court -- holding of the matter of probate procedure. 
    It is a matter for the States to determine and the Federal Courts have never as such probated the States and do not probate States. 
    We have also pointed out in our brief that this particular statute was enacted in 1864, by the first territorial legislature in Idaho that has been in effect ever since that time. 
    During that time the women for the past 75 years has had the right to vote and could have changed it. 
    It would have been changed no doubt if there has been enough interest in it. 
    We had a similar statute in Idaho that disqualified married women. 
    It was enacted in the same law -- statute as this, 1964. 
    It was deleted 50 years ago. 
    In our briefs we have cited cases upholding the statute. 
    These preference statutes have been upheld by the Courts every time they have come before the Courts back as far as 1845 in New York. 
    There is a number New York cases. 
    There is a California case. 
    There is two Montana cases. 
    The recent Idaho case and the constitutionality has never been questioned before this particular matter here. 
    So far as women of being qualified to act as administrator in Idaho, they are qualified. 
    There is no disqualification there except this one statute that and the one before that makes these classifications and that were -- when other things are equal whether there is this preference.

    That would be right.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="2794.219" stopTime="2847.481">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Does that not make the men more equal?
speaker="charles_s_stout" startTime="2847.481" stopTime="3167.280">
    Mr. Charles S. Stout 
    As the Court -- the Court inquired about the basis on which the Supreme Court decision was made and I will quote from some of the provisions there. 
    This Court had before said that the priorities established by the Code 15-312 are mandatory, leaving no room for discretion by the Court in the appointment of administrators, citing an Idaho case. 
    Similarly the preference given to male by the Code 15-314 is also mandatory. 
    The statute itself says that males must be preferred to females. 
    Other Courts construing similar provisions have also held that the preference is mandatory. 
    The respondent however contends that Idaho Code 15-314 violates the Fourteenth Amendment, the equal protection clause. 
    It is well settled that the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment does not preclude the legislature from making classification and drawing distinction between classes. 
    It merely prohibits classifications which are arbitrary and capricious. 
    It is for the Court to determine in each instance whether a particular classification rests upon rational ground for as in effect without justification and arbitrary. 
    It is equally well settled that legislative enactments are entitled to a presumption of validity and that a classification will not be held unconstitutional absent a clear showing that is arbitrary and without justification. 
    By Idaho Code 15-314 the legislature eliminated two areas or controversy. 
    If both a man and woman of the same class seek administration, the male would be entitled over the female. 
    The same as relative of the whole blood is entitled over relative of the same class but of only the half blood. 
    The provision of the statute is neither illogical nor arbitrary method devised by the legislature to resolve an issue that would otherwise require a hearing as to the realty of merits as to which of the two or more petitioning relatives should be appointed. 
    Philosophically, it can be argued with some degree of logic that the provisions of Idaho Code 15-314 discriminates against women on the basis of sex. 
    However, nature itself has established distinction and this statute is not designed to discriminate, but it is only designed to alleviate the problem of holding hearings by the Courts to determine eligibility to administer. 
    This is one of those areas where a trust must be made in a legislature about enacting Idaho Code 15-314, make a determination. 
    Legislature when enacted this statute evidently concluded that in general men are better qualified to act as an administrator than are women. 
    A classification having some reasonable basis does not offend against that clause of equal protection, merely because it is not made with mathematical necessity or because in practice it results in some inequality. 
    On even scale of the classification, such a law must carry the burden of showing that it does not rest upon an unreasonable basis but it is essentially arbitrary. 
    And they go on to say that while a classification may not be entirely accurate and there are doubtless instances in which it is incorrect. 
    They are not prepared to say it is so completely out of basis of fact as to be irrational or arbitrary. 
    Then they go on to show what other classifications on the basis of sex have been made. 
    It is our opinion, the State has a legitimate interest in promoting the prompt administration of the estates and that the statute in question promotes this interest by curtailing litigation over the appointment of administrators in addition to the support by the presumption of constitutionality. 
    Appellant in its brief has criticized the decision of the Supreme Court and in his words, misquotes to say declaring that nature itself has established the distinction, the Idaho Supreme Court seemly justified the discrimination challenged here by finding it rationally -- rational to assume the mental inferiority of women to men. 
    Well, they rolled in the mental. 
    There is no statement in the Supreme Court decision like that and a Court does not think that.

    Statutory disposal?
speaker="charles_s_stout" startTime="3213.570" stopTime="3275.497">
    Mr. Charles S. Stout 
    We urge that this statute has been in effect for over 125 years. 
    It has been in effect over a hundred years in Idaho. 
    It has been applied by the Courts. 
    The attorneys have followed it and applied it. 
    I am a general practitioner. 
    My business is to advice clients as to what the law is, what to expect. 
    And by reason of the decisions heretofore made on this law, it was reasonable to me to assume that I was justified in going ahead on the basis I did. 
    Now, the legislature show that same intention to comply and to enact a statute here that more adequately, possibly reflects modern thought. 
    Now, that will give the attorney some basis to go ahead on and the people some basis to proceed on.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3275.497" stopTime="3291.410">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    But under the old statute which is now been superseded, the man would receive the appointment even if the woman were better qualified to have it?
speaker="charles_s_stout" startTime="3291.410" stopTime="3293.364">
    Mr. Charles S. Stout 
    I think there is a presumption there that --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3293.364" stopTime="3298.807">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Because she would not ever have the chance to show she was better qualified?
speaker="charles_s_stout" startTime="3298.807" stopTime="3421.936">
    Mr. Charles S. Stout 
    No, I think that is correct, yes. 
    I think there is presumption there based on the general experience which existed more at the time the statute was enacted in 1964 than it does now, that men as a rule are better qualified than women and on that basis the Court did not held a hearing on that particular phase of it. 
    As I say the length of the time the statutes had been in effect and had been followed, it seems to me, it should take a very strong case under this uncertain and elusive provision of the Fourteenth Amendment to declare it unconstitutional. 
    It has been acted on. 
    The attorneys have acted on it. 
    It has been useful. 
    I do not say that it is any better classification than there is in this new law, maybe it is not as good if attorneys will follow the new law. 
    In this case, I just want to point out one more thing and that is that the respondent had been quite disadvantaged in this case by lack of funds and not anything involved in the estate and he will receive -- received the bill for pending the appendix, almost three hundred dollars which was up three times of what it cost Cecil. 
    And extensive briefs have been filed in our position to respondent. 
    We do not urge that as a matter of law here, but we do point out and as a matter of law we do think that the Court should dismiss this case or affirm the decision of the Idaho Supreme Court.

    Just a few things in response to Mr. Stout’s argument. 
    Probate court order that was entered in here and we find the grounds recited in 2 (a) of the jurisdictional statement, recited only that the statute violated 15-314 of the preference statute in support, in over the facts in support of it. 
    Another thing that should be pointing out to the Court that under Idaho law each of the parents in this case, the child died without a will, are entitled to 1/2 of the estate.

    I do not think that it has any merit. 
    We do not deny that probate is a state matter that when it -- when portions of it or law in connection therewith contravenes the constitution of the United States, it then becomes a substantial federal question that must be resolved.
