    Mr. Henry F. Field 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    This case raises once again the issue first raised and decided by this Court 15 years ago in Griffin versus Illinois of whether the Fourteenth Amendment requires that a State which provides appeals of right and reporters who transcribe trials provide a poor person who is unable to pay for that transcript and who needs that transcript to demonstrate crucial trial errors so that he may have an adequate and effective review and may adequately exercise his right of appeal. 
    This case today arises under Illinois Supreme Court rule 607 which at the time of trial and until very recently provided that only defendants in felony cases had, indigent defendants, had a right to apply for free transcript from the State of Illinois. 
    As of July 1st of this year that rule has been amended so that it now provides that any defendant who at the time of trial faced a penalty greater than six months in jail could apply to Illinois for a transcript.

    Here the possible penalty at the time of trial was $1000.00 fine and no jail term at least initially.

    Yes.

    And how much?
speaker="henry_f_field" startTime="135.085" stopTime="162.431">
    Mr. Henry F. Field 
    Illinois provides that a defendant has to pay off, work off the fine of $5.00 a day and that is the contingency in a case which leaves a possible jail sanction, but after this Court's decision in Tate versus Short of last year, this question is perhaps removed from the case although still, there are still some uncertainty I believe in the construction of that case.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="162.431" stopTime="172.626">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Or would it be removed from case automatically or with just the $5.00 a day, the under question?
speaker="henry_f_field" startTime="172.626" stopTime="188.695">
    Mr. Henry F. Field 
    Well, the effect of Tate versus Short, were it applied to this case, would be as I understand the case that the defendant here could not be put in jail at the rate of $5.00 a day, if he did not pay the fine, was not able to pay the fine that he was sentenced to.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="188.695" stopTime="192.652">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    That your new rule does not reach anything measured by the amount of the fine?

    No.

speaker="henry_f_field" startTime="220.961" stopTime="233.431">
    Mr. Henry F. Field 
    I do not believe that even at the $5.00 rate this defendant would be in jail for more that six months. 
    So that the point would not be raised, Yes.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="233.431" stopTime="238.058">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    So that the $5 rate could it be 200 days, would it not, if my arithmetic is correct?
speaker="henry_f_field" startTime="238.058" stopTime="290.779">
    Mr. Henry F. Field 
    He was sentenced at trial for $500.00 fine. 
    He faced a thousand and sentenced to 500 and I believe that he could not be put be in jail then in Illinois in rate of more than a 100 days. 
    I would not belabor the Court with any kind of discussion of, lengthy discussion of the rule law in this case as you all are familiar with Griffin that established the principle that the destitute defendant must be afforded as adequate appellate review as persons who can afford transcripts. 
    Just last year in Williams versus Oklahoma City this Court decided a drunk driving case where the defendant faced 90 days in jail and in unanimous per curiam opinion had no trouble applying Griffin to the facts.

    Yes. 
    After the trial the petitioner filed an affidavit and there was full hearing on this question of his indigency where the City was represented and attacked it and the acting Chief Judge of the Circuit Court of Cook County found that he was indeed indigent and unable to pay for the $300.00 transcript.

speaker="henry_f_field" startTime="388.630" stopTime="495.140">
    Mr. Henry F. Field 
    Yes. 
    The Rule 607 of Illinois Supreme Court wholly denies a transcript to this appellant who faced a $1000.00 fine and regardless of his need for it and he needs that transcript as I will demonstrate in order to raise the really central point of this trial and Rule 607 also wholly denies an opportunity to the all indigent persons to show and demonstrate to Illinois that they need a transcript in order to raise points at evidence and the kind and possibly unconstitutional conduct of their trials and it completely insulates trials of indigents from the review in cases involving less than six months in jail. 
    It's appellant’s contention that this blanket prohibition of all indigent now under six months and under appeals violates the Fourteenth Amendment in several respects. 
    First Illinois has chosen to draw an invidious line between rich and poor in violation of this Court's clear mandate in Griffin and Williams and many cases elaborating those principles. 
    Secondly, it hides and insulates from any appellate correction unconstitutional errors, in this case the denial of fair trial. 
    The facts of the case necessarily skimpy, can be briefly stated.

    Mr. Field before you go on, I am not sure how important it is, but I am a little surprised that you seem the think that the present status of the petitioner, his financial status, it is not relevant, that it must stand on his status at the time the case arose.

    Well, I think this case of-course is important and his ability to pay now might indeed change the Court's whole posture on the situation. 
    However, this Court has a record before it which I believe is complete and Illinois by hesitating can frustrate this Court's enforcement of Fourteenth Amendment by -- as it has in this case, forcing defendants to appeal and because time is always money, raise in any indigent case a question as to it his ability to pay for a transcript.

    Right.
speaker="henry_f_field" startTime="819.118" stopTime="969.253">
    Mr. Henry F. Field 
    After the trial he filed a post trial motion which raised several substantial contentions, attacking the legitimacy of the verdict and a judgment of a case. 
    His basic point was that he has convicted on insufficient evidence compounded of grossly prejudicial prosecutorial misconduct, he was denied in the fair trial and the cumulative effect was to override, wholly override the evidence in the case. 
    As stated in affidavit of counsel at the -- in the post trial motion and before the -- and the motion in Illinois Supreme Court, it was our feeling that the defendant was convicted not for what he did, but for sins of STS and for unreal -- wholly unrelated, but contemporaneous injury to one Richard Elroy (ph) who vaulted, who was them an obscure city lawyer in a prosecutor's office and vaulted in the front page of Chicago papers all during the preliminary portion this trial and the time between his arrest and trial and proceeded from the front pages of Chicago papers to elective officers, now Sheriff of Cook County. 
    After this motion was denied and we learned the cost of a transcript is well beyond his means, we moved in the Circuit Court of Cook County for three things, appointment of counsel, production of a transcript and a waiver filing fees. 
    After lengthy hearing this, the Court found that he was indigent and unable to pay, but refused to grant him access to the transcript on ground that Rule 607 applies only to felony cases. 
    The order is -- order that the motion of a defendant for relief proceed as poor person. 
    He and it's hereby denied on the grounds that defendant was found guilty of ordinance violations and that Rule 607 of the Supreme Court applies to felony cases. 
    We renewed the motion in the Illinois Supreme Court and urged the unconstitutionality, the approach taken by Illinois Rule 607. 
    The motion, after due consideration, for counsel and transcript was denied and filing fees were waived.

    Neither method was pursued in this case and the reason goes to the heart of the contention here. 
    It is the position of the defendant and appellant here that very clearly on the face of his contentions, neither alternatives are adequate, neither alternatives adequate. 
    The two contentions; one of insufficiency in the evidence and one of grossly prejudicial misconduct, both require the kind of detailed survey of the facts of the case.

    There is no doubt that I can recall a great deal that went on, but there is no way that I can recall the kind detailed questioning and the words used that precise words used that go to show the nature of the prejudicial attack of the prosecutor as intensive systematic effort to hang this defendant, not for the facts of what happened with his interaction with the police, but for -- on wholly related matters and sins of others and injury to Mr. Richard Elroy which was the really prime focus of the persecution.

    Mr. Henry F. Field 
    At the time of incident here, out of which this case arises, he was an obscure city lawyer in the Corporation Counsel’s office, a prosecutor for the City of Chicago. 
    That he was -- this appears from the affidavit, these facts appear on affidavit of counsel in brief at 12. 
    He vaulted from obscurity into the front pages and into elective office on the basis of his injury which occurred during this same anti war demonstration. 
    Two rules of Illinois law also combine to make overwhelming the impossibility of this defendant reconstructing the nature, the words used, inadequate, a minimally adequate factual predicate for presenting these two contentions. 
    First of all under Illinois law the defendant, if there is any disagreement as to the facts, must prove desperation of the facts. 
    At a hearing on effect under rule, Illinois Supreme Court Rule 323, I believe which is a settled statement rule and in this situation there is no way that I could or anyone could prove the detailed and intensive prejudicial conduct of the prosecutor. 
    The words used, how could I prove, how could anyone prove something they cannot recall? 
    The second rule of law creating a hurdle to an adequate review, inadequate alternative is that the appellate Courts of Illinois presumed the facts against the defendant, if inadequate record is not provided for at least to support the contentions on appeal and there is no way that this defendant can create minimally adequate factual predicate for these two contentions. 
    He could create to settled and agreed statement on many other facts in the case but there is now way he can proceed.

    I believe so Your Honor, that the course of trial as to the prejudicial conduct of prosecution was denied in fair trial. 
    The course of trial was, has to be examined. 
    Illinois requires that in order to judge the impact of a prejudicial conduct or large, you must survey the whole record. 
    There is now way that I could or anyone could reconstruct the record, although they could as you point out reconstruct many things in the record. 
    There is no way that he can reconstruct this point and the point of insufficiency of evidence inherent from credibility of certain police testimony which would permit him to be acquitted on appeal.

   Argument of Richard L. Curry

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Mr. Curry.
speaker="richard_l_curry" startTime="1922.859" stopTime="2044.902">
    Mr. Richard L. Curry 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    The issues as the City of Chicago sees them in this case are two. 
    First, should rule of Griffin versus Illinois and Williams versus Oklahoma City be extended to afford free transcripts to indigent for appealing cases involving convictions of what are generally recognized as merely of petty offenses and secondly, does the classification between serious and petty violate the Fourteenth Amendment in a fashion which this Court has considered in the past in another cases to be invidious. 
    We believe that both these questions ought to be answer in the negative. 
    This Court in Boddie versus Connecticut has recently noted that Griffin rule has had a sturdy growth and I submit that the growth was noticed greatly by the fact that each subsequent application of the rule in Griffin has been based upon a fact situation which found; one, personal liberty of the petitioner in jeopardy and or upon two; the invidious exclusionary consequences of the particular appellate practice as it was applied to an indigent. 
    Neither of these threshold conditions exists in this case. 
    Appellant here is not faced with the prospect of incarceration because he was charged with an ordinance violation for which the only sanction was a fine. 
    And secondly the appellant himself has cavalierly ignored alternate available avenues to perfect his appeal. 
    Mayer's Illinois Supreme Court appeal of the lower Court jury conviction has been docketed and is awaiting to disposition of this question in this Court. 
    He is not therefore in the posture of Williams versus Oklahoma City and your decision in that case ought not to be considered as controlling.

    When this question was brought to the attention of the Illinois Supreme Court, the Illinois Supreme Court Your Honor found that for the purposes of fees and filing fees they would waive because the expenses of the administrator of the Court clerks, they are for the state to incur, but the State Supreme Court in my interpretation of what they have done has said we ought not in this case provide at the expense of the State of Illinois a transcript when the petitioner has not shown any attempt to avail himself of the other alternatives available.

    Mr. Richard L. Curry 
    We say that the petitioner in this case is not in the posture of Williams versus Oklahoma City and your decision in that case ought not to be controlling because Williams was locked out of his Supreme Court by reason of the unavailability of a verbatim transcript and had faced a 90-day jail sentence. 
    In that case the trial Court made specific findings that Williams argument had merits, that his appeal could not be properly prepared without a transcript, that neither Williams nor his Attorney could make up an inadequate record from memory, that the transcript was in fact in existence and available. 
    None of these condition exists in the present case, although a complete verbatim transcript has been denied, Mayer makes no attempt whatsoever to avail himself of the alternate methods available to present a record to the Illinois Supreme Court. 
    The Illinois Supreme Court Rule 323 (c) and (d) is in clear and unmistakable harmony with this Court’s observations in Draper versus Washington.

speaker="richard_l_curry" startTime="2596.940" stopTime="2784.804">
    Mr. Richard L. Curry 
    Exactly. 
    The rule is not an absolute and to the extent that the Supreme Court then would be in an impossible position that it would recognize that a meaningful appeal could not be brought, but its hands would then be effectively tied to allow such an appeal to come forward. 
    I do not believe that's a tenable situation. 
    I don't think Illinois Supreme Court would so interpret their own rule. 
    Petitioner here, I submit, rejects out of hand what Draper suggests and it is not a hand to help the Court understand why the alternative courses are found wanting? 
    Instead he asks this Court to expand Griffin beyond the clear and meaningful limit to that rule and its successors beyond the bounds of logic and beyond what I submit to be the capabilities of the appellate processes as in Illinois and perhaps throughout the nation. 
    The troubled journey which Griffin and its successors seek to alleviate for the indigent criminal defendant as he struggles to maintain his liberty cannot abide, I submit, his purpose for meandering off the path. 
    The record must clearly disclose the inadequacies or unavailability of multiple remedies. 
    Appellate makes no attempt in this regard and I submit that counsel errs in his brief at page 37 when he suggests that California requires no such showing. 
    The California Rule as to a free transcript in misdemeanor cases is set forth in the 1970 case of Joe Z. versus Superior Court reported at 3 California 3rd, page 54. 
    When the Court in that case held that before an indigent misdemeanor is entitled to a free transcript on appeal, he must first attempt to reach an agreement upon a settled statement. 
    The transcript would be provided only of the parties cannot agree or for settle statement would be inadequate. 
    The misdemeanor then Court quotes, “Must show in a reasonably particularized presentation the reason why he cannot inform the reviewing court by a settled statement of the claimed inadequacies and error.” 
    I submit to you it is impossible to determine whether the parties cannot agree or whether a settled statement would be inadequate unless there has first been a real attempt at an agreement. 
    It is the burden of indigency that the cases seek to relieve. 
    Mayer in this case would champion that cause into a calculated disregard for alternate methods of presenting an appeal which this Court has previously approved of them both Griffin and Draper and which the Illinois Supreme Court has by rule subsequently adopted. 
    If a full stenographer's transcript must be produced as matter of right or as a matter of simple preference unrelated to cost, unrelated to convenience or necessity or even unrelated to rule of Court then the alternatives to the extravagance suggested in Draper must be overruled.

    I did not understand that the claim in these cases unrelated to a particular arise need in this case. 
    As I understood the petitioner, his claim is that because of the two claimed endeavors in this case, sufficiently of the evidence, insufficiency of the evidence in prosecutorial misconduct. 
    This happens to be one of those rare cases if you will where a settled statement of the facts would be inadequate.

    Mr. Richard L. Curry 
    -- on motion not on brief Your Honor and the extensive fashion in which they were discussed in brief in this Court was not, I submit, brought to the attention to the Court to that extent. 
    The alleged prosecutorial error and prejudicial treatment in the manner that charges to the Jury were given in the broadest terms, in the same terms at least raise them in this Court.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2847.212" stopTime="2856.354">

    I did not realize there were claims about the instructions to the Jury. I thought the questions were sufficiency of the evidence in prosecutorial misconduct.

    Right and they are sufficiency of the evidence.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    And that I further understood appellate's basic claim to be that while in perhaps ninety-nine-and-half percent of the cases of this type an adequate and fair view could be had on a agreed statement of facts or a settled statement. 
    There do exist some rare cases where that is insufficient and therefore the rule of the Illinois Supreme Court which just is a blanket rule thing that in no case can there be a transcript that that violates the Fourteenth Amendment. 
    It's a little bit analogous to a case we have that term Groppi against Wisconsin, involving a rule of Wisconsin law that it said, that in no misdemeanor case, in no misdemeanor case could there ever be a change of venue and the claim was made that in 999 out of a 1000 or perhaps more misdemeanor cases there would not need to be a change of venue in order to a Court for fair trial. 
    But there could the rare case where only a change of venue could satisfy the Fourteenth Amendment and provide a fair trial and that as I understood, it was the appellant, the petitioner’s claim here. 
    He is attacking the blanket rule of the Supreme Court of Illinois.

    But neither --

    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Now, if he put these statements down and submits them and they are not agreed upon, is he bound by those statements?
speaker="richard_l_curry" startTime="3451.082" stopTime="3465.365">
    Mr. Richard L. Curry 
    Is he bound by them, I believe that it would be very similar, the negotiation that would go on during a agreed statement or a settled statement would be very similar to the kind of negotiations that goes on when lawyers and the Judges get together over instructions to the Jury.

    What happens to Judge -- haven't you already told us counsel that on all unresolved matters of a settled statement, the Judge resolves?

    Mr. Richard L. Curry 
    The Judge will resolve.

    So that the parties put down on paper what is agreed on and the Judge supplies the vacant spots, where they are not going to --
speaker="richard_l_curry" startTime="3482.683" stopTime="3497.819">
    Mr. Richard L. Curry 
    That's my understanding. 
    He would have available to him, the note, the minutes note that he made as you said there. 
    He would also have I submit available to him the participation of the un-transcribed notes from the Court reporter if he sought them and thought they were necessary.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="3497.819" stopTime="3509.520">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Was any request ever made by the then defendant for having a reporter read any parts of the transcript?
speaker="richard_l_curry" startTime="3509.520" stopTime="3511.725">
    Mr. Richard L. Curry 
    I know of none.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="3511.725" stopTime="3515.992">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    And is any claim within in the record on behalf of the petitioner if you know?
speaker="richard_l_curry" startTime="3515.992" stopTime="3599.976">
    Mr. Richard L. Curry 
    There is none. 
    There is no showing throughout the record that any attempt has been made to secure an agreed statement. 
    I take issue with Mr. Field's statement that despite two days of trial he would find it impossible to prepare such a statement. 
    I would brought your attention to the extensive post trial notice which appears in your abstract at page 11 through 22, 14 pages I might add of in depth analysis of what did transpire at that hearing. 
    I submit that this almost in itself would be tantamount to a record made under either one of these proposals by the Illinois Supreme Court. 
    The cases since Griffin give the support of the kind of balance that judicial propriety found in Duncan. 
    That is the consequences to the defendant from the conviction of a petty offense are insufficient to what were the benefits to efficient law enforcement as simplified judicial administration. 
    In applying Fourteenth Amendment, Rinaldi versus Yeager says, these avenues of appeal must be kept free of unreasoned distinctions. 
    I believe that there is reason distinction in the Illinois Supreme Court rule. 
    The distinction being between petty and serious and I believe that is very important distinction that ought to be respected in future decision by the Court.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3599.976" stopTime="3608.175">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    And under the distinction in Illinois between petty and serious is offenses for which you can go to prison and those for which you cannot?
speaker="richard_l_curry" startTime="3608.175" stopTime="3611.632">
    Mr. Richard L. Curry 
    Six months is the distinction made by the Illinois Supreme Court rule, yes sir.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3611.632" stopTime="3613.319">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Up to six months?
speaker="richard_l_curry" startTime="3613.319" stopTime="3613.455">
    Mr. Richard L. Curry 
    Yes sir.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3613.455" stopTime="3614.588">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Same as the Federal rule?
speaker="richard_l_curry" startTime="3614.588" stopTime="3680.132">
    Mr. Richard L. Curry 
    Right same as the federal rule. 
    The classification would fail we're told in Shapiro versus Thompson unless shown to be necessary to promote a compelling governmental interest. 
    I submit to you that a compelling elemental interest is very real here in the viability of the Court systems at the lower level, but most apparently at the appellate level, if appeals on full transcripts to indigence are the outgrowth of the rule of this case and finally in Boddie versus Connecticut the Court mentioning the absence of countervailing state interest of overriding significance and classification must fail. 
    I say to you that a classification such as we have here between serious and petty is a countervailing state interest of overriding significance. 
    I would respectfully ask this Court to reject what's urged by the appellant and not expand the rule in Griffin into the petty offense area. 
    Thank you very much.

    I am looking at your rule 323 (c) that is on the alternative, at page 4 (a) and I think it is the petitioner's brief.

    Well, that seems -- it seems broader -- the rule the rule itself be not available if no verbatim transcript to the evidence of proceedings is obtainable. 
    Now, are they synonymous available and obtainable, but on face of it your other rule says it is not obtainable unless a felony case?
