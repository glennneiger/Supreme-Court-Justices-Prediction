    Mr. Courtney Wilder Stanton 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    This matter is before this Court on an appeal from the decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit declaring to be unconstitutional upon its face, a Georgia Statute prescribing the unprovoked use to or of another and in his presence opprobrious words or abuse language, tending to a breach of the peace. 
    Unless the Court has some other direction it would like to give me, I would like to cover basically what I consider to be the points of drawing issue of the briefs submitted by the two sides. 
    First of all, the question of whether or not this case is controlled adversely to acquisition by the decision of this Court in Edwards against South Carolina. 
    I would seek permission from the Court to add one additional citation to what I consider to be controlling state authority only on substation of an element of this particular offense which I inadvertently omitted from my brief. 
    That case is the decision of Garvin against the Mayor.

    Incidentally are the facts acknowledged to be correctly stated in the Georgia Supreme Court opinion?
speaker="courtney_wilder_stanton" startTime="185.155" stopTime="429.733">
    Mr. Courtney Wilder Stanton 
    Well, I am not really all that familiar with the facts in this case because of the facial question that was presented. 
    We did not go into a great detail on the record in the case. 
    I feel that we can take the issues that were raised before the Supreme Court of Georgia as being issues that were raised before the Supreme Court. 
    In other words, these were the enumerations of the questions that were laid before the State Court for determination. 
    The District Court found for instance that there had not been exhaustion as to the bulk of the material that was encompassed within the application for a writ of habeas corpus and refuse to consider the bulk of the contentions that were brought forth by the applicant, the appellee here at that point. 
    It turned only on the facial constitutionality and proceeded from there. 
    The holding in the case that I have just called the Court’s attention here deals with the question of the broadness of the concept to breach of the peace and I think it is very important because I think, Georgia at this point departs from its neighboring state of South Carolina to a very significant extent. 
    The Court held that one who commits a breach of the peace is of course guilty of disorderly conduct, but they went on to say, but not all disorderly conduct is necessarily a breach of the peace. 
    That is where its merely calculated to disturb are annoyed and I would submit that this is a pretty sound analysis, long before we ever gotten to this area of severe constitutional questions of what concerns the breaking of the peace. 
    Now we tend, I think in our decisions to take disruptions of the peace and actual breaches of the peace and mix them all together and of course that is the bias I find in many of the ordinances and statutes and common-law offenses as we find in state courts that this court has had to deal with. 
    In Edwards against South Carolina, we have a case where the offense was tainted in my mind by the circumstances of the state approved application. 
    And the court there noted the state could not make criminal, a peaceful expression of unpopular views and that was the width to which the breach of peace definition of the common-law crime adopted by the Supreme Court of South Carolina took the situation. 
    The Court went on to note and I think rather significantly that the record which it looked at in the South Carolina case was barren of fighting words as that term is used and South Carolina had extended the concept of the breach of peace to encompass all forms of disorderly conduct, including conduct which was merely calculated to disturb or annoy and therein was a vice of this particular common-law offense. 
    I think we really get into a very similar situation in Cox and in Terminiello against Chicago where we have an application by state courts approved, and therefore, becoming an authoritative interpretation of the ordinance or statute involved which reaches out beyond the idea of breaching the peace and goes to the disruption of the peace in disturbing or annoying antics, conditions of words. 
    And the Court has held that that cannot necessarily be consistent with the First Amendment made unlawful. 
    The decision of the Court below in affecting corporates on this issue, the decision of the District Court and I was really somewhat surprised about this because of the first portion of the opinion, the Court of Appeals was not even arguing it. 
    The first question was just submitted. 
    We spent the entire time arguing this question. 
    They ruled on the first issue on the theory that the Supreme Court of the United States should have the benefit of the Court of Appeals determination and then on the one issue that was really controlling the case did not give us any real benefit of their determination. 
    They --

    Unknown Speaker 
    And he still has some time to serve if he prevails?
speaker="courtney_wilder_stanton" startTime="529.185" stopTime="701.537">
    Mr. Courtney Wilder Stanton 
    I think it is about a month-and-a-half. 
    I have not computed it out, but he has time left on the sentence at the time of writ was granted and he was committed to bail. 
    The Court below, the District Court seem to feel there was regular confusion in the Georgia cases in this area. 
    Those cases are authoritatively construed under the provision under attack. 
    I think there was a rather obvious mistake in relying upon what was really bare bunk style of disposals of questions and procedures and evidentiary sufficiency in certain cases. 
    This resulted in fact with prior to 1902 and most of the authority in this case came out, we had a one tier appellate court system in Georgia. 
    Of course, there was a tendency to take a decision and decided on exactly what was brought to the court and just really in what was in effect an order on the case. 
    Many of the decisions dealt with questions of provocation and for reason or other there was a period of time when apparently the Trial Courts, when instructing the jury that this was or was not provocation. 
    Well of course provocation is not a defense under this defense and lack of it. 
    It is an element which a state must prove and therefore of course it was wrong to withdraw this question from the jury and in fact shift the burden to the defendant of coming in and showing that a certain set of facts was provocation. 
    He had no such burden in any evidence he brought into that case would simply go against the state to prove up law the provocation which is an element it must prove under this offense. 
    So I think when we view the offense in that area, actually review the decision as opposed to the language, only hang up on the language of some disordered propositions, we see that they are all quite consistent. 
    In Fisk against State which is one of the cases that they indicate they feel there is a conflict between the Wilson decision some 63 years later, we have the language used and charges soar to a line and the trial judge instructed the jury that this was opprobrious words and abuse of language and the court said no you cannot do that. 
    You cannot instruct the jury as to an element of the offense which I think seems pretty obvious that you cannot tell the jury that this person has violated the statute, not least under our Georgia law where you cannot even make a trial judge a comment on it, much less withdraw in a criminal case have fortunately charge or the offense from consideration of the jury. 
    Now if we must view it against some backdrop of what is really involved in the case, the decision is quite clear and I think that the real difference in the quality of the language that we used in the Wilson case and that which was used in the Fisk case. 
    There are certain words quite obviously are going to be opprobrious or abusive if used to another person as what the Supreme Court said without a smile upon your face so to speak (Inaudible).

speaker="courtney_wilder_stanton" startTime="755.856" stopTime="773.086">
    Mr. Courtney Wilder Stanton 
    It carries out a much heavier connotation I think or higher degree of opprobrium. 
    One may simply be offensive or not desirable. 
    It is something you would rather not have said to you. 
    The other one of course carries with it a degree of infamy opprobriousness or whatever fails.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="773.086" stopTime="785.359">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Would you make use perfectly innocent word or name that by innuendo would create it? 
    Suppose you call the man a Benedict Arnold, would you say that would be covered by the statute and the court could be under some certain –-
speaker="courtney_wilder_stanton" startTime="785.359" stopTime="833.575">
    Mr. Courtney Wilder Stanton 
    I would certainly think that. 
    A crime of treason is an infamies crime and of course the clearest thing I could say if I have to come in and try to equate synonyms and I do not think you can ever take one word in English language and say there is an equal for it. 
    I mean, if we did we would not need all the words that we have, but a program probably comes closet to me in scarless. 
    It probably comes closet to be infamies and of course treason is an infamies crime, at least in my mind it is, and I think the common knowledge and understanding of people, treason would be an infamies crime. 
    So in effect what you are saying to a person you accuse of Benedict Arnold is you are a traitor and if that was used under such circumstances to a person that the backdrop of the circumstances were such that is ordinary conditions it would lead to a breach of the peace, a resentment by physical violence of the person to whom is directed and I think he would definitely --

    Mr. Courtney Wilder Stanton 
    No, I do not think the real case on this of course, the Georgia Court of Appeals case in Elmore which was in 1915 and is set forth in our brief. 
    This is really one of the few cases that really discusses this thing at the kind of length normally an Appellate Court discusses it. 
    Dillard which the Court rejected before it does too. 
    I think it is perfectly applicable. 
    There are really only two what you might call extensive discussions of the principles in this case. 
    In an Elmore they really emphasize what they term and I think may be a real good terminology for this thing the Court talks about I think violent reaction, but in the case out in California, in Cohen versus California about words lack and reduce a violent reaction. 
    They are talking about physical resentment and I think in context of the statute that is probably the best terminology, you could use to describe what you are talking about.

    Yes.
speaker="courtney_wilder_stanton" startTime="939.928" stopTime="1071.982">
    Mr. Courtney Wilder Stanton 
    They talk about the language addressed to a prisoner, in other words, here is a person in a cell. 
    Now obviously, this person which going back to a reasonable ordinary circumstance, this person does not physically at that moment have the capability to resent this by physical violence, but he is protected from this kind of language. 
    He is protected by the bail of his offense and then subjected to abuse of opprobrious language under these circumstances and he has not rendered outside the pail of his protection simply because of that moment, he cannot as they use the term physically resent. 
    Well, this says two things. 
    One it says a necessity. 
    You look towards physical resentment. 
    The potential or likely good are they as determining whether or not there has been a violation of the statute. 
    Obviously, the man could -- you by yelling back at you. 
    People in -- he could do many things that might be disturbing, but he cannot do one thing and that is get at you, but he is still protected by it. 
    And they went all to talk about the personally opposite bank of an impassible torrent. 
    They talked about one who is without power to respond immediately to such vernal insults by physical retaliation and then they liken it perhaps dramatically to a paralytic who is utterly unable to break the peace by any act if physical violence which says two things. 
    One that they are looking towards the physical violence idea of breaching the peace and secondly that you are looking toward an ordinary circumstance situation that you do not take in color the offense by the nature of the person against whom this particular offense is rendered. 
    In other words, it is not a question of person being highly susceptible to this or another person not being susceptible or a person being physically overpowering and that is bully your pipes, I mean, you just do not go on that basis. 
    It is an ordinary circumstances viewed from the reasonable man hypothesis and therefore a paralytic who could not under any circumstances resent this by physical violence is still protected by this particular statute. 
    This is not a victimless crime, more order type statute is protecting a particular individual that is a person who is a victim of the offense to whom this language is addressed under these circumstances.

speaker="courtney_wilder_stanton" startTime="1087.176" stopTime="1107.134">
    Mr. Courtney Wilder Stanton 
    But and of course that is incorporated by statute whereas even in the battery situation in Georgia, the words could come in for the purpose of perhaps a little different in light of connotation for the purpose of perhaps being a justification if the other person does resent by physical violence as to rather unusual Court in Georgia law, but is in there nevertheless.

    Mr. Courtney Wilder Stanton 
    No, I do not see any way we could. 
    If we describe and made unlawful binding words, somebody be up here continuing if that was not applicable to bind. 
    There may be 200 ways you could sit down and describe fighting words. 
    The Court I think in one of the last cases said that they were personally abusive epitaphs which one addressed to the ordinary citizen or as a matter of common knowledge inherently likely to provoke violent reaction. 
    The Georgia legislature back during the reconstruction really contemporaneously with the enactment of the Fourteenth Amendment by which this particular statute is now tried to find in terms of abusive language opprobrious words and went on to couple together the elements. 
    There is no history that would indicate that this has ever been applied to anything except to what would appear from common knowledge and understanding to be fighting words.

    Now this was what the judge means, Judge Smith or this Court?
speaker="courtney_wilder_stanton" startTime="1338.869" stopTime="1487.339">
    Mr. Courtney Wilder Stanton 
    Well, I would suggest very strongly that Judge Smith was not on target in construing the Georgia law in this particular case. 
    For instance he got out on the Fisk case and we brought in Dillard in the matter and said, oh no but that deals with another Section yet two Sections are linked by the terminology and who is level in like manner, meaning a certain operable elements discussed in Dillard would obviously bear upon this particular decision. 
    Dillard of course was the very first decision indicate that this was confined not to areas that annoyed and not the areas that were disturbing, but to actual words that were likely to invoke a breach of the peace. 
    Now just to show the way in which the District Court went of, it said that for instance they can see no reason constitutionally for protecting the kind of conduct Wilson engaged in. 
    But it went on to say it is construed by the Georgia Courts especially in the instant case that Georgia provision has to breach the peace as even broader than Louisiana statute. 
    But the Louisiana statute was so construed that it applied to conduct on the application itself that ought to be protected. 
    Now, he cannot cite an instance in which this is going to apply the conduct that ought to be protected, but it follows the circular pattern of reasoning down to conclude that this case is broader than Cox against Louisiana which I simply cannot follow the reason. 
    In other words, he says the conduct is not protected, ought not to be protected, cannot be made unlawful, in contrary we have a situation that was certainly protective type conduct involved and the statute was construed to cover it. 
    And I certainly can say how the statute as construed could be even reached the conduct involving the Cox against Louisiana. 
    We have a whole pattern of the application. 
    We have the same civil disobedient situations in Georgia that occurred in Louisiana and to my knowledge this is the only time that a statute has ever been involved in a case that arose initially out of the civil disobedience. 
    This was as I understand, the facts was a demonstration addressed to an Induction Center of the United States Army. 
    There were a number of demonstrators and of all the demonstrators, only Wilson fell afoul of this particular statute. 
    Surely, the demonstration, and knowing the army, certainly was substantive disruption I am sure. 
    It was certain sufficient to bring the Police Department out to see what was appearing in the area. 
    But only to the best of knowledge, Wilson has been involved in this particular type of offense.

    In other words, there is no authority in Georgia that would apply this to anything other than this particular thing that I would call as a matter of common knowledge fighting words. 
    If you note in the Chaplinsky statute, you have this question raised and they said they have supplied judicially to their statute one of the very same things that is in the statute. 
    It was written into it.

    Mr. Courtney Wilder Stanton 
    That is unfortunate Your Honor. 
    We are not consulted on that matter. 
    So I just feel it and of course the Court is going to have to take the authoritative determinations made by the Georgia Court and read into them the issues that, I think, brought in outside by misinterpreting what the decisions rely. 
    I do not know how you can wipe out the Elmore case on physical resentment. 
    And if you cannot constitutionally prohibit this kind of conduct I think perhaps that Smith’s real view was that we were prohibiting conduct that it fallen not so much if he was misunderstanding Georgia law, but he was misunderstanding the effect which this decision would have or the other decisions of this court. 
    Personally I do not believe this statute could ever reach the Cantwell's conduct. 
    I doubt very seriously if it could ever reach say Feiner's conduct, in Feiner against New York. 
    It might very well have reached the conduct of a man mentioned in Mr. Justice Douglas’ concurring opinion who was calling up epitaphs to Feiner while he was speaking. 
    It might under the circumstances. 
    That would be a question we would have to look at. 
    This is intentional conduct. 
    It is directed conduct. 
    It directs to a specific victim. 
    It is intended to take effect upon that victim and it is intended or likely to produce a physical resentment from him. 
    This is in fighting words and I do not believe any legislature under the country can find fighting words other than fighting words and there again, we have a problem of what is the standard. 
    The final point I would make Your Honor is I feel that the decisions of this Court approve exactly what the Georgia Court has done, Georgia decisions have construed in this case and I can only submit it to your review that the decision of the Court of Appeals should be reversed. 
    Thank you.

    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    I would like to open my remarks by adding a footnote as to the posture of this case. 
    We have already discussed the fact that the appellee here has a approximately two months left to serve in his sentence. 
    In addition to that factor is a three-judge court which has passed on the appropriateness of the statute as well. 
    This would bear on what we were just discussing as to how many Georgia Judges have ruled on the constitutionality of the statute. 
    In fact, Judge Morgan sat along with Circuit Judge Griffin Bell and District Judge Alexander Lawrence. 
    When the statute was again attacked in a separate action they accepted the opinion of the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals and agreed with it and again held --

speaker="elizabeth_r_rindskopf" startTime="1835.021" stopTime="1915.206">
    Ms. Elizabeth R. Rindskopf 
    I did not handle this below. 
    I believe the reason is because he was going through the Georgia Court. 
    The record reflects that he appealed that through the Court of Appeals and also applied for certiorari in this Court and I expect that would probably take him about a year’s time. 
    I believe he did properly his habeas in Federal Court. 
    To return to my opening point, the point I would like to make is that not only do we have a three-judge court ruling, we have the Fifth Circuit Ruling, we also have a new statute in this area, Georgia Code annotated 26-2610. 
    The main statute is really for all intents and purposes, the same line that we are considering here, yet it continues to be applied. 
    Now, I think that may go to the question of what happens if this Court should overrule the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. 
    What effect will that decision have and it would appear that the Georgia Court seem to feel that the new statute is something different in that a separate room is going to be required on that statute. 
    Naturally, we are arguing that this Court should have affirm the Fifth Circuit decision and I think this may support our argument simply by the point that any decision that we get on this particular case is probably going to have little effect both to our appellee and to others in like situation. 
    There will be no others in like situation.

    I think that the answer to that question and I would say to begin with but I do not believe I am competent to make an answer.

    These are words that have been quite controversial and I think particularly, in the racial context, the meaning may be different than what ordinarily we would assume the words to any.

speaker="elizabeth_r_rindskopf" startTime="2206.989" stopTime="2310.240">
    Ms. Elizabeth R. Rindskopf 
    I believe they are correct. 
    Now once again I have to ask your indulgence. 
    I did not handle this at the Trial Court level. 
    So, I am not certain of that, but I believe the facts stated are correct. 
    I have a few very brief things to point out about this statute as well. 
    One is that the statute would appear to have no intent or willfulness requirement. 
    It is simply opprobrious words which tend to breach the peace. 
    Our position would be that without any kind of willfulness and with the only standard that of what tends to cause a breach of the peace, it is an ascertainable standard and one which a person cannot be expected to understand or comprehend in order to gauge his action accordingly. 
    I think it is also worthy of note, the Court has heard a number of arguments today about the victimless crimes. 
    I think we have such a situation here. 
    The appellee has already been punished for his assault. 
    What is left are few profanities that he uttered in anger and I wonder that a statute can in this day and age be held by the highest Court in the state to per se outlaw words that he uttered in such a situation. 
    We would feel in conclusion that this Court’s opinion in Cohen against California bears very heavily on the situation presented here. 
    My reading of that opinion would be that it is improper for a state court to outlaw individual words and that is precisely --

    No, but as I read that opinion, it refers to at any time these words are said within the hearing of others, that is per se a violation of the statute.

    Yes, we do. 
    In conclusion, I would simply stress the fact that to reverse the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals decision is in all probability going to affect no one. 
    We feel that a statute as presently drawn is overbroad that it presents a standard that our appellee could not have hope to understood or to have foreseen at the time he began his picketing in this situation and that consequently, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals opinion should be upheld in this instance.

    I do not think there is any question. 
    I have great questions as to whether he can be punished twice for what was in effect one offense, but that is presently the law in Georgia and we do not raise that here. 
    It seems to me that what they are saying is that the fact of his utterance of these words by that fact then also rendered him subject to the statute that we attack here, the opprobrious words statute.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Mrs. Rindskopf, did you say that in early in your argument, it was the time that (Voice Overlap) that there is a new statute --
speaker="elizabeth_r_rindskopf" startTime="2510.092" stopTime="2530.643">
    Ms. Elizabeth R. Rindskopf 
    There is a new statute and cite to that is 26 Georgia Code annotated 2610. 
    Now the point I make is that that statute reads almost identically to the one that we consider here. 
    I think what is relevant about the presence of that new statute is that the Georgia Courts have continued to apply the new statute. 
    It would --

    I believe there is, yes. 
    It appears I believe in the statement of facts and I think the three-judge court opinion is also cited there. 
    I point that out simply to stress the fact that I believe at any decision overruling the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in this case is going to be of little effect because I believe that the position will be in the Georgia Court that they have a new statute. 
    Apparently, that is how they are operating now.

    Ms. Elizabeth R. Rindskopf 
    That is correct.

speaker="elizabeth_r_rindskopf" startTime="2604.104" stopTime="2655.560">
    Ms. Elizabeth R. Rindskopf 
    Your Honor, just to clarify one point. 
    The reason why we are continuing to utilize convictions under the statute is because in light of the nature of this case and the way it which it came to this Court, we do not feel the decision of the Fifth Circuit precludes prosecutions under the statute that this Court has spoken one way or the other. 
    I may be wrong but people called me and asking about it and I have given my opinion to that effect. 
    This was not an injunctive type of procedure. 
    It was directed only to this particular habeas corpus applicant and it is only a law of that case until we have a broad overview. 
    The new statute we will find in the white pamphlet. 
    This is a result of the recodification of the Georgia Law and it bears the same numbers as the old area, but the new 26-2610 which Mr. Rindskopf referred will be found in the white pamphlet.
