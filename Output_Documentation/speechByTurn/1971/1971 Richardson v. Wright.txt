Richardson v. Wright

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    We will hear arguments next in 70-161, Richardson against Wright and 5211, Wright against Richardson. 
    Mr. Gray I think you may proceed now.
speaker="gray" startTime="56.817" stopTime="269.397">
    Mr. Gray 
    Good afternoon Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    These two cases are here before the Court on cross appeals and have been consolidated for purposes of argument. 
    These cases arise from a final judgment, a statutory Three-Judge Court for the United States District Court of the District of Columbia. 
    The court below held that Section 225 of the Social Security Act was unconstitutional and that under that Act the recipient of the Social Security Disability Insurance was not afforded the opportunity for an oral hearing prior to suspension. 
    The court below relied on the decision of this Court in a recent case, Goldberg v. Kelly, which has since become rather well-known in this particular field of the law. 
    Section 225 of the Social Security Act permits the Secretary of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare on information obtained by him or submitted to him to suspend the benefits, the payments to a Social Security Disability Insurance recipient pending further investigation. 
    This particular section of the Social Security Act has no provision whatsoever for a hearing. 
    It should be noted also Your Honors that this particular section of the Social Security Act has been commented on in the floor debates of the Congress and in the reports of the various committees of the Congress and its purpose has been explicitly stated to permit the Secretary to protect the Social Security Trust Funds to administer the Social Security Disability Insurance Program in a practical, efficient and helpful manner so as to assist the maximum number of beneficiaries within the resources available. 
    This case first arose when the appellee, cross appellant, one Radie Wright, applied in the Washington D.C. District Office for Social Security benefits. 
    Mr. Wright had worked since the age of 14 and had been recently hospitalized in October of 1965 to be exact in his application, for Social Security Disability Insurance benefits which was filed June 1, 1966.

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Well, excuse me Mr. Gray, may I ask, do I understand that the Secretary has now adopted the procedures and required States to adopt procedures which rather provide most of the requirements of Goldberg?

    Mr. Gray 
    No sir, Mr. Justice Brennan, that is not quite the case.

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    No, but how do I compare with the requirements in Goldberg on termination of welfare?
speaker="gray" startTime="317.764" stopTime="320.299">
    Mr. Gray 
    They would not go as far I do Your Honor.

    Where would it -- in what respect would they go for?
speaker="gray" startTime="322.466" stopTime="365.939">
    Mr. Gray 
    They would go -- let me tell you perhaps Your Honor right at this point in time what they would do. 
    The District Court below, as a part of its holding, stated that the recipient should receive timely notice and an opportunity to respond and the Secretary has gone that far in his new regulations going out through the Social Security Disability Insurance System to state that State agencies shall not recommend suspension until they contact that recipient. 
    Give him timely notice, offer him the opportunity to present his case which I might --

speaker="gray" startTime="370.342" stopTime="393.962">
    Mr. Gray 
    Yes. 
    There would be no suspension or recommendation initiated sir. 
    I might point out, Mr. Justice Brennan, as you well know, Your Honor that at this point in time a recipient or an applicant can come right into that District Office now at the very first step of intake with counsel in tow and can have that counsel assisting at every step of the proceeding right along, right up to the point that --

    Mr. Gray 
    Yes sir.
speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="396.849" stopTime="410.597">
    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    Mr. Gray, let me follow through at this point if I may. 
    Somewhere along the line would you tell us what you think the District Court ordered here that is not covered by the new regulation? 
    This ties in to Mr. Justice Brennan --
speaker="gray" startTime="410.597" stopTime="474.485">
    Mr. Gray 
    Yes sir, I was about to tell you that right now Mr. Justice Blackmun. 
    The District Court below thought that as an additional step there might be an occasion on which an informal hearing could be held before an impartial official or hearing examiner and they also went one step further and said that when the evidence is found to contradict that evidence held by the Social Security Administration there might very well be a formal hearing and the next step they took was to say that we are not going to prejudge this matter. 
    We are going to permit the Social Security Administration to develop pre-suspension procedures at which time they would then take a look and see if those procedures meet all the requirements that we are laying out here and the government’s position in the Court here today Your Honors is that we go along with the first part of the court’s order below and we agree that --

    They are considered right up the line. 
    They would become a part of that claimant’s file folder and they would become a part right there at the State Agency and would carry right on at the line all the way into the Federal District Court for review.

    Yeah.

    Mr. Gray

    On a basis of what he submits in writing Your Honor and in addition what the State Agency has compiled in the way of evidence from the hospitals, the physicians, the laboratory, the vocational rehabilitation people that treated him.

speaker="gray" startTime="579.833" stopTime="638.970">
    Mr. Gray 
    Let me say that he gets no opportunity but I think Your Honor, he gets no opportunity in a legal sense as we lawyers understand it. 
    But let me say Your Honor that the Social Security Administration, as you well know and this Court knows, leans over backwards to be of help and assistance to individuals and I have not, despite this doubt in my mind, and I think if Secretary Richardson was standing before this Court he would say the same thing. 
    If that recipient came in to that State Agency down there in Virginia which involves one of these cases, the cross appellant Atkins, with his attorney and told that that State Agency would permit that recipient and his attorney to make all the points they wanted to make right there and they would build that record and that record would move right on up the line just as they desire to build it. 
    But if you are speaking Your Honor in terms of a hearing as we understand it under the due process clause, with all of the protections that Your Honors specified in the opinion of the Court which you have delivered in Goldberg, no, we do not have seen it all -- (Voice Overlap).

    Mr. Gray 
    Perales, -- I find that, I find comfort in both cases. 
    In Perales because of the opinion and the extent to which that opinion went and in the Court’s holding there in Java. 
    The Court, as you know Mr. Justice Blackmun, did not reach the constitutional question raised in that unemployment compensation case on the West Coast. 
    I feel, of course, that that Lower Court was in error and I think there is a case now in New York (Inaudible) and the New York State Labor Department where contrary result was reached in the Java case.
speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="900.712" stopTime="913.790">
    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    Well, actually, the Secretary’s position is not very different than it was in Perales. 
    The same arguments have been made, the volume of claims and practical necessities and the like, are they not?
speaker="gray" startTime="913.790" stopTime="990.486">
    Mr. Gray 
    Well, I think that is certainly is true. 
    Then we might go even a little further than we went in Perales in trying to explain in a little greater detail the procedures that are involved here because we feel that these procedures are the matrix in which the government case rests. 
    These are the things that this Court must look at first to see whether the constitutional rights of these individuals who are to benefit from this system enacted by the Congress are being infringed upon and we rather vigorously convene in our brief that they are not. 
    That the governmental function must prevail. 
    We do not argue that the public purse necessarily is so sacred. 
    We say more than the conservation is involved here. 
    It is rather the allocation of these resources. 
    Shall these resources be allocated to assist others who are in need to maximum and it to extent or shall they be tied up in a vast hearing bureaucracy for which there is no real constitutional need in these types of cases. 
    This case, these facts are not a Goldberg context at all. 
    I do not see that context here.

    Unknown Speaker 
    (Inaudible) Mr. Chief Justice with Mr. Wright –-
speaker="gray" startTime="995.537" stopTime="1238.660">
    Mr. Gray 
    Mr. Wright went in and made this application and at the time he made the application, he completed item 21 of the application and he also received the standard information which every applicant receives that if he goes back to work, he should report that. 
    If his physical condition improves, he should report that. 
    If he applies for workman’s compensation, he should report that. 
    His application was completed. 
    The District Office referred it to the State Agency, which is the Department of Vocational Rehabilitation here in the District of Columbia. 
    All the papers, including his records from Freedman’s Hospital and from the Veteran’s Administration, all were examined and a decision was made that Mr. Wright was indeed disabled within the meaning of the of the terms of the Act. 
    His illness, in point of fact, was rather severe at the time following his hospitalization for hemorrhaging and it stemmed all around cirrhosis to the liver, hypertension, chronic gastritis and in fact, the Social Security Administration, their BDI, Bureau of Disability Insurance deemed his physical condition to be so severe that he was not routinely programmed ahead for a review as they do regularly, in order once again, to keep track of all these applicants. 
    Time passed, this was in 1966 and he began receiving payments from May 1, time passed and Mr. Wright apparently began to feel better because in 1970, earnings began to show up in the Bureau of Disability Insurance for Mr. Wright. 
    Now, how did they show up? 
    The employers, in reporting these earnings, report them to, of course the Internal Revenue Service which in turn reports them over to the Social Security Administration for posting in the Social Security Account and those folks know who is receiving Social Security Disability Insurance and there is a transfer, a cross-indexing so that a recipient of Social Security Disability Insurance working and receiving earnings will have wage postings on his account and this occurs within the Social Security Administration. 
    When BDI learned of earnings for Mr. Wright, earnings for the June quarter of 1968 for the December quarter of 1968 and for the first quarter of 1969, they immediately cause the field investigation to be instituted and that referral was made to the Social Security District Office in the District of Columbia. 
    An interviewer went to call upon Mr. Wright. 
    The interview was less than satisfactory. 
    Mr. Wright was a little difficult to communicate with, but he did indicate that he had worked. 
    The young lady who interviewed him stated to him that indeed, it looked as though his Social Security Disability Insurance benefits might be in jeopardy because of his having worked. 
    That of course is one of the provisions of the Social Security Act, one of the definitions of disability, if an individual is able to engage in substantial gain from activity he cannot be disabled under the Act. 
    Well, the investigation proceeded and as it turned out, Mr. Wright had indeed, apparently felt better because he worked, he not only worked in the June 1968 quarter to December 1968 quarter, that he worked in every quarter of the calendar year 1969 and he earned approximately six hundred dollars and some cents in 1968 and Four Thousand and Fort-one dollars and some cents in 1969.

    Mr. Gray 
    It was a little longer in this case because BDI instituted their field investigation in February 2, 1970, but in any event that when that was compiled, BDI sent the report back to the District of Columbia, Department of Vocational Rehabilitation for a further look at this case, even though here it was obvious, that the man had worked, was in violation, no longer disabled, no longer entitled under the law, but the case folder went back. 
    An additional look-see was taken and the District Office concluded that Mr. Wright had indeed engaged in substantial gainful activity and was no longer therefore entitled to Social Security Disability Benefits. 
    He was so notified and the letter of notification indicated that his trial work period had completed. 
    There is another distinguishing feature from the welfare recipient. 
    The Social Security disability recipient may work for a period of nine months, none of which need be consecutive, but the law, that Congress has seen fit and the Secretary in his implementing regulations has seemed fit to permit this recipient to go back and try to rehabilitate himself. 
    Try to get back into the mainstream, the society so to speak. 
    Mr. Wright had indeed, utilized more than his nine months trial work period. 
    And he was determined to have ceased to be disabled as of August of 1969, and his benefits, he was advised that his benefits were going to be suspended and they were indeed suspended for a short period of time.

    Mr. Gray 
    No sir. 
    In any event, Mr. Wright brought the suit and he was without benefits for a short period of time. 
    He brought suit on May 13, 1970. 
    On May 14, 1970, Judge Gasch issued a temporary restraining order restraining the Secretary from suspending Mr. Wright’s benefits and that action was taken and Mr. Wright has been paid the benefits since then. 
    And then Mr. John D. Atkins, plaintiff intervener, enters this case. 
    He does not come into the case until about August, but he comes in as a plaintiff intervener on the basis that he had been hospitalized by reason of mental illness. 
    And he was hospitalized over in the Veterans Administration Hospital at Perry Point, Maryland. 
    And he was hospitalized in December of 1966 and began receiving benefits some six months thereafter and remained in that hospital over there until January 7 of 1969. 
    The Social Security Administration, for some reason or another, did not find out that Mr. Atkins was no longer in Perry Point until about September of 1969 when his check was returned from Perry Point VA Hospital to the Social Security Administration to BDI. 
    Apparently, Perry Point had been forwarding his checks to Mr. Atkins because Mr. Atkins had left the VA Hospital at Perry Point, Maryland and had gone over to Virginia to another hospital, mental hospital, Western Hospital at Salem, Virginia, stayed there, a short period of time then went down to the Veteran’s Administration Hospital at Roanoke. 
    But when Social Security received the notice, received the check back that immediately triggered off in accordance with its procedures a continuing disability investigation and they had to find out what Mr. Atkins was up to. 
    So, the claim folder went first to Towson, Maryland and then it went down to Virginia, but suffice to say the case finally became one before the State Agency there in Virginia. 
    The State Agency went through the same routine. 
    They contacted Mr. Atkins, talked with his clinical psychologist, looked very, very carefully at the medical evidence then available to them and made a decision that Mr. Atkins condition had physically improved sufficiently so that he was no longer disabled. 
    Mr. Atkins, this occurred on February 3, 1970, on February 4, 1970, Mr. Atkins wrote to Social Security Administration and protested, submitted his own evidence. 
    His wife called BDI three or four times. 
    His Congressman got in touched with Social Security Administration and to compress the facts in view the fact time is rapidly running out on me, Your Honors, he was reinstated. 
    His case was sent back rather quickly. 
    Another hard look was taken at additional evidence and he was reinstated and I think if I may Mr. Chief Justice, I would like to reserve the balance of my time for any rebuttal. 
   
   
   
   Argument of Robert N. Sayler
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1660.782" stopTime="1669.448">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Very well, Mr. Gray. 
    Mr. Sayler?
speaker="robert_n_sayler" startTime="1669.448" stopTime="1826.183">
    Mr. Robert N. Sayler 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    I am here representing several named individuals in the class of disability recipients. 
    The government’s presentation has made clear that we are dealing here with a complicated statutory scheme. 
    That should not obscure the fact that the legal issues in this case are uncomplicated, had been considerably narrowed in this Court. 
    When this case begun nearly two years ago, the government was arguing that the provision in the statute authorizing summary suspension of disability payments was constitutional. 
    Now, Judges Gasch, Robb and Matthews disagreed. 
    The government has abandoned that contention and this Court it concedes that that statutory section is unconstitutional and it concedes that there is a right to an opportunity to a hearing before disability benefits are terminated. 
    Now, these are the propositions that we had been attempting to establish in this case. 
    We had assumed that once they were recognized that would obviate the necessity for action by this Court and that has not proved to be the case because in this Court, the government contends that the right to a hearing it would provide means a paper hearing and calls a hearing on paper. 
    By this, the government says it would provide notice if it found conflicting evidence. 
    It would provide a brief summary of evidence adverse to the recipient, providing opportunity to file his paper. 
    It would not under any circumstances, regardless, whether or not conflicting evidence of continuing disability existed. 
    It would not provide opportunity for an oral proceeding of any kind, would not assure decision by an impartial decision maker. 
    The government’s basic position is that these latter procedural protections are unnecessary because the decisions in this area, uniquely objective and reliable, as Mr. Gray just said, the government bends over backwards to assure that recipients may stay on the roles. 
    There is one overwhelming statistic which demonstrates the difficulty the government has in sustaining that position. 
    Present time, hearings are required as a matter of statutory right after termination, many months down the road. 
    In those cases, paper determinations that disability has ceased are reversed in 55% of the cases. 
    More times than not, when the recipient gets to the hearing has an opportunity to tell his the story, present affirmative evidence, cross-examine would prevail.

    Considerable period is consumed while the recipient is cut-off from payments. 
    Once he gets to that hearing, more times than not, he prevails.

   Rebuttal of Gray
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1961.286" stopTime="1994.246">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Mr. Sayler, I noticed in the government’s brief, they relied rather heavily on Cafeteria Workers versus McElroy and you and your reply to them treated that case in a footnote as if it were virtually limited to its fact, at least that is one impression one could get from your treatment of it. 
    Do you disagree with the general statements of the Court in McElroy that due process is a flexible concept and you have to analyze it precisely what it is that you are affecting before you decide what procedures will be accorded?
speaker="gray" startTime="1994.246" stopTime="2087.428">
    Mr. Gray 
    Not at all, Mr. Justice Rehnquist. 
    Our basic proposition is that Cafeteria established basic propositions which have been set forth in number of other cases that the Court is obliged to indulge in a balancing of the interest of the government on the one side, and persons affected by governmental interest on the other side. 
    We think this is the case where the balance must be struck very much on the side of the recipient in view of depressing the disability payments. 
    We have indicated the statistics in our brief on this point. 
    Facts are that disability recipients are over half dependent on disability benefits for their income. 
    Most of them are over 80% dependent. 
    As a category, the disability recipients have very low level of educational attainment which very much hampers their prospects to gain substantial income once they are terminated the disability role. 
    Their work experience, even those who are able to work, is not very bright and their labor experience is characterized by extremely high unemployment. 
    It is characterized by mostly part time work. 
    Our point is that the prospect of a man who is cut-off from the disability program, a man who must have qualified in the first instance under the most rigid definition of disability. 
    That is not a man who is in any sense a potential Olympic champion. 
    There is a man who needs those moneys and that is why Congress has provided them to him. 
    He needs them in the same sense that the welfare recipient needed those moneys in the Goldberg situation. 
   
   
   
   Rebuttal of Robert N. Sayler
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="2087.428" stopTime="2114.503">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    I suppose the balancing factor that would fit under what you just referred to in relation to Cafeteria Workers case, would be the amounts that are paid out in disability payments to people for periods after they have become ineligible. 
    Does the record show anything about the dollar amounts or either estimates or accurate figures on that?
speaker="robert_n_sayler" startTime="2114.503" stopTime="2204.751">
    Mr. Robert N. Sayler 
    Yes. 
    The average recipient receives according to the government’s figure something along the lines of $200.00 a month and the government has undertaken an estimate of what it would cost hear hearings, an opportunity for a hearing satisfying the Goldberg for its standards and it is determined that it was cost something in the neighborhood of $16 million. 
    Now, the problem with that estimate, Your Honor, is that it assumes that every person who is terminated in an effort to gain an unwarranted payments would demand a hearing and experience under Goldberg in the welfare context does not bear that out at all. 
    Less than 10% of the District of Columbia persons who are cut-off from welfare are now demanding hearing. 
    Government also assumes that the government would prevail with every one of these hearings. 
    Every one of them and that there would therefore be improper payments in every case. 
    In fact, again it is losing more of these cases than it is winning. 
    We have recomputed those figures on the basis of government statistics and the cost would be considerably less than one million dollars even assuming twice as many recipients sought a hearing as now seeking a post termination hearing. 
    Even assuming that the government had no power to collect any over-payments it might make and it has substantial statutory power to collect over-payments in the disability context unlike the welfare context where the government has no power to collect over-payments and even assuming that this hearing would require a full two months over and above the paper hearing that the government has now --
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="2204.751" stopTime="2211.267">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Is your estimate a million dollars for the whole United States, for the personnel necessary, the expense necessary that --
speaker="robert_n_sayler" startTime="2211.267" stopTime="2220.978">
    Mr. Robert N. Sayler 
    We have computed this on the basis Your Honor as the government had computed it on the basis of payments that would be made to recipients in the interim as distinguished from undertaking any computation --
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="2220.978" stopTime="2226.181">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    But I was thinking that geographical areas, is that for the District of Columbia or the whole United States?
speaker="robert_n_sayler" startTime="2226.181" stopTime="2242.105">
    Mr. Robert N. Sayler 
    No. 
    That figure I have just given you is for the entire country. 
    There are some 37,000 cessations a year in this area, something in the neighborhood of 4,000 recipients have been seeking hearings. 
    I computed that on the basis of the entire country. 
    What I have not undertaken --
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="2242.105" stopTime="2249.655">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Your suggestion is that you could have the machinery for the 4,000 cases could be handled for a million dollars?
speaker="robert_n_sayler" startTime="2249.655" stopTime="2263.836">
    Mr. Robert N. Sayler 
    It would be considerably less than million dollars. 
    What I want to make clear is that we have not undertaken to compute the cost to the government of operating this machinery. 
    We are trying to figure out how many, how much money would be expended in making payments which might be determined after the hearing --
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="2263.836" stopTime="2265.343">

    Mr. Robert N. Sayler 
    I am sorry, Mr. Chief Justice. 
    The point that illustrates is that the Welfare Program where prior hearings were held acquired towards the size of the disability program, both in the numbers of recipients and the numbers of cessation.

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    While I have you interrupted Mr. Sayler, I suppose you would agree that in some respect, this program is analogous to a private insurance contract for disability insurance, the standards I suspect are very much the same, total and permanent disability. 
    In general there is an analogy there, would you agree?
speaker="robert_n_sayler" startTime="2328.836" stopTime="2359.876">
    Mr. Robert N. Sayler 
    To some extent, Your Honor. 
    There is no half-way disability in this program. 
    It is all (Voice Overlap) that there is no partial disability. 
    And the insurance programs generally have attempted to use a more objective standard to determine disability. 
    They use schedules, person qualifies under schedule will actuall is or is not disabled. 
    The government in this program has undertaken a quite more elaborate scheme. 
    This program is to be based on the individual facts of each individual case as the regulations make clear.

    I am sure you do not have any welfare recipients doing that, but you -- this is the technique that an insurance company employee -- employees had been -- they sent him a letter and stop the payments, do they not?

    One is that the insurance disability program used, were used considerably more objective standard disability than the Federal Program. 
    The other is that one would assume that an insurance company would apply its standards fairly and if that standards requires, as Federal Regulations do in the disability area that a thorough inquiry into all the facts be made, the termination not be based on any easy litmus test, termination not be based solely on earnings as the regulation say, not be based solely on a doctor’s report, which the regulation say.

    Or he could have told him anything he wanted to?
speaker="robert_n_sayler" startTime="2599.229" stopTime="2719.029">
    Mr. Robert N. Sayler 
    That is right. 
    I am not disputing that, Mr. Justice White. 
    I am saying is that questions arise in this context to inherently complicate his objective. 
    That is what the legislative history says. 
    That is what the regulation say. 
    The 55% reversal rate which arises only on the basis of terminations on the basis of either medical evidence or employers report is eloquent testimony that these are tough fact questions. 
    Indeed, in some respects they are the identical fact questions that arise in the welfare context because this Court has required prior hearings under Welfare Disability Programs that raise precise same issues as it raised in these cases. 
    We say that Goldberg rules this case. 
    The same kind of tough complex fact issues, the same kind of pressing interest in receiving benefits. 
    No basis in the Social Security Act which governs both disability and welfare to distinguish Goldberg in this case. 
    In fact, the government has recognized the close connection between the two. 
    It argued in its brief in the Goldberg case to this Court that it would be inconsistent to provide hearings in a welfare context and not in the disability context. 
    They went on to say the disability case was the a fortiori case because the disability recipient has a mandatory condition of his entitlement, must have contributed substantial funds for a protracted period, precise funds from which he proposes to draw his benefits. 
    It is not true with the welfare context. 
    As this Court said in Flemming and Nestor, in that sense Social Security benefits are earned, a functioning member of the economy ought to be able to draw upon that economy when they are protected against the -- taken place. 
    We think it would be intolerable to distinguish the disability case and the welfare case. 
    That would create the anomalous result. 
    A man who has contributed his money over the years and worked would have fewer procedural protections than the welfare recipient who is not required to contribute to a fund.

    Do you think the Aetna Insurance Company, for example, must give notice before they terminate payments and a hearing as a matter of due process? 
    Now, I am not talking about what they do, what their practices are, what their contract provides, but would it be the constitutional obligation in a private insurance of disability -- for disability?
speaker="robert_n_sayler" startTime="2756.046" stopTime="2782.697">
    Mr. Robert N. Sayler 
    Well, I think the same as -- I would say the answer comes out the same way. 
    If one buys a permanent disability protection policy which I happen to have now. 
    I paid my money for five years. 
    If I become disabled tomorrow, I am entitled as a matter of contract law, the benefits, I paid my money, I have earned it. 
    I cannot turn around and say, Oh! No. 
    We do not think we should be paying those moneys.

    That the Government shall not deprive any --

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Am I right?
speaker="robert_n_sayler" startTime="2813.453" stopTime="3023.500">
    Mr. Robert N. Sayler 
    That is the point I was trying to make is that I would awfully important a distinction, but the analogy between insurance and a disability recipient’s right to claim benefits when the protected against when the claim transpires, these are very close one. 
    One other reason we think that it would be intolerable to distinguish Goldberg in this case is that the upshot would be that the States which administer the Welfare Program would be upheld to a higher procedural due process requirement under the Federal Constitution then with the Federal Government which administers the Social Security Program. 
    I want to say one final word about the relief we seek in this Court. 
    That the Court can either do two things. 
    It can remand to lower court to enjoin further terminations without affording the preliminary hearings, satisfying Goldberg and Kelly standards. 
    The character of the government’s argument has suggested an alternative approach. 
    The government now does concede the unconstitutionality of the exception in the Act which permits summary termination. 
    Now, admitting the unconstitutional, unconstitutionality of that provision leaves that stand in standing. 
    Only the general requirement in the Act that an oral hearing must precede final agency action, that is set forth in Sections 405 and 421, Section 1303 of the Act is the severability provision which says if one provision is declared unconstitutional the rest of the Act remains standing. 
    What this would mean would be that the general requirement would have take oral hearings which are now statutorily required as a matter of statutory construction would have to be held before disability benefits could be terminated. 
    This in effect gives the matter back to Congress and it says the summary suspension that you have undertaken will not satisfy the recent teachings of this Court. 
    We declare that Section unconstitutional. 
    Congress at that point either leaves the existing oral hearings as they are and order them to speed it up. 
    Congress on the other hand may decide that it does want to have some sort of a preliminary determination before the full scale APA hearing and it may decide that it wants to institute a Goldberg and Kelly type oral hearing which meets just the rudimentary requirements of due process. 
    This we think should more appropriate be -- appropriately be determined by the Congress rather than the government in their brief which has undertaken at 13th hour in this case to rewrite a summary suspension provision into the Act of Congress. 
    The essence of our case is that as the Court said in Perales, the Social Security System must be fair. 
    We do not think procedures which fall short of the Goldberg and Kelly standards can be said to be fair. 
    We would urge this Court to make it clear that those standards obtained in this area as well as in other areas. 
    Thank you. 
   
   
   
   Rebuttal of Gray

    Thank you, Mr. Sayler. 
    Mr. Gray you have three minutes left.
speaker="gray" startTime="3027.845" stopTime="3129.680">
    Mr. Gray 
    Thank you Mr. Chief Justice. 
    May it please the Court, I would like just to make a brief comment regarding Mr. Sayler’s statement concerning reversal rate. 
    The appendix D in the government’s brief contains the statistics for Fiscal Year 1971 and much can be done with figures as we all know and I think the only fair way to handle this particular matter of the reversal rate and the -- that play on numbers is to take the actual number of claims that are processed and then trace those through and find the reversals and that brings you to a 6.6% rate of reversal. 
    That speaks something for the system. 
    At least, there are sufficient number of individuals somewhere throughout this total number of claims who do not feel that the system has dealt with them unfairly and I would merely submit to the Court that this kind of a consideration be given to dealing with statistics. 
    I would like also to point out once again and reaffirm the fact that the government has not conceded anything. 
    This is not summary decapitation that we are engaged in here and we have never considered it to be and we have not conceded any point of constitutionality and we standby firmly the points made in our brief to this Honorable Court. 
    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.
