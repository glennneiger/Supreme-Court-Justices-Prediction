    Mrs. Marcus, we'll pause for a moment until Mr. Carpenter gets settled.

    Ms. Maria L. Marcus 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    This habeas corpus proceeding presents the question of whether New York is prohibited from using a 1964 Tennessee murder conviction as a predicate for increased punishment. 
    This Tennessee conviction resulted from a retrial where the prior recorded testimony of a witness was read into the record because the witness had since moved to Sweden. 
    To state briefly the history of the Tennessee and New York proceedings, the crime of which respondent Stubbs was convicted was a 1954 murder of Mrs. Alex Holm. 
    Stubbs met Mr. and Mrs. Holm, an elderly Swedish couple who were strangers to him at a road side picnic table. 
    He kidnapped them at gunpoint and ultimately murdered Mrs. Holm and seriously wounded her husband. 
    At Stubbs' 1954 trial, defendant was represented by three appointed counsel. 
    Alex Holm testified as did Stubbs himself and Stubbs was convicted of first degree murder, kidnapping and assault with intent to murder. 
    Nine years later, Stubbs moved for a writ of habeas corpus in the District Court in Tennessee asking that his conviction be vacated on the grounds that his attorneys were appointed three days before trial. 
    The District Court under a former Circuit Court rule, which required automatic reversal in cases of tardy appointment of counsel, vacated Stubbs' first trial and remanded him for possible retrial. 
    At the second trial in 1964, the prosecutor sent a subpoena to Alex Holm's former address, a farm in in Texas, which was returned unsigned and he also contacted Holm's son, who advised the court that his father was now a permanent resident of Sweden. 
    His son took the stand and so testified. 
    The prior testimony of Holm was then read into the record over objections by counsel. 
    Stubbs was among the witnesses who testified. 
    He was convicted of first degree murder. 
    The conviction was appealed to the Supreme Court of Tennessee and affirmed. 
    After his release from the Tennessee prison, he went to Monroe County, New York, where he was arrested and convicted for first degree assault and possession of a firearm. 
    Based upon the predicate of the Tennessee conviction, his sentence as second felony offender was 32-34 years.

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    How long did he serve in -- on the first sentence?
speaker="maria_l_marcus" startTime="180.438" stopTime="314.227">
    Ms. Maria L. Marcus 
    Well, when he appealed his conviction to the Tennessee Supreme Court, they gave him credit for the 10-year period between trials and apparently he served only about two more years and it's not explained exactly why he was paroled at that point but that's apparently what happened. 
    A petition for writ of habeas corpus challenging both convictions was filed in United States District Court for the western district of New York, which denied the petition. 
    The Second Circuit, which had granted a certificate of probable cause solely on the grounds of the validity of the Tennessee conviction reverse the District Court. 
    The Court below held that respondent had been deprived of his right of confrontation at the Tennessee retrial because due diligence had not been exercised to obtain the presence of the absent witness before the testimony of Alex Holm was read into the record and because counsel of the first trial had been tardily appointed and had not questioned Holm about whether after Stubbs had kidnapped the Holms at gunpoint, they had made him welcome as their Guest. 
    This absence of questioning on the Guest theory; the majority held it could not be harmless error. 
    The dissenting judge Leonard P. Moore called the majority decision an extraordinary example of justice dispensed by the federal courts. 
    We urge reversal of the decision below on three grounds. 
    First, that there was no lack of due diligence in obtaining presence of the witness. 
    Second, that even assuming that due diligence was not exercised, the error in this case would have been harmless. 
    And third, the tardy appointment of counsel at the first trial did not in fact, deprive respondent Stubbs of effective legal assistance. 
    Barber versus Page was not violated by the use of testimony of the witness permanently domiciled in a foreign continent. 
    This Court in Barber versus Page, ruled that a good faith effort must be made to have a witness present, prior to reading his testimony into the record at another trial.

    Ms. Maria L. Marcus 
    Nothing in the record to indicate that. 
    Of course, this was not only before this Court decided Barber, but even before this Court decided Pointer. 
    However, it should be pointed out that it would have been greatly to the prosecutor's advantage to have this witness at the trial, simply because he was a victim to a very, very tragic circumstance; his wife had been murdered, he himself, was shot twice in the face, and of course the sympathetic effect of such testimony in the jury, would have been much greater than simply --

    Apparently, the Court below felt that since Stubbs himself testified to the ownership of the gun and the fact that he kidnapped the Holms and compelled them to drive to the spot where the shooting occurred, but he said that --

    Ms. Maria L. Marcus 
    Alright, we are arguing at any event that as far as harmless error is concerned that the Guest theory has no relation, because in fact for two reasons. 
    First of all, in respect to the exercise of due diligence, 1964 counsel didn't indicate that if the witness had been there, they would have asked him any questions about the Guest theory at all. 
    Second, the Guest theory was completely refuted by the record because --

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    You said, he took the stand in the – in which the first or second trial?

    What Holm was asked on rebuttal by the prosecutor, did relations ever become friendly between you and your kidnapper and he replied, “No sir, there was no friendly relation” so that the Court erroneously assumed that there was --

speaker="maria_l_marcus" startTime="471.360" stopTime="491.266">
    Ms. Maria L. Marcus 
    The testimony that he offered was that Mrs. Holm, when he was pointing the pistol in her face, asked him to put the pistol down, and that she would give him no trouble and I think there was an attempt by 1954 counsel to say that this was an expression of friendship.

    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Mrs. Marcus --
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="491.923" stopTime="497.381">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    The subject of possible friendship was at least hinted at in the first trial?

    Ms. Maria L. Marcus 
    It was hinted at by virtue of his saying, they told me they would give me no trouble.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="502.622" stopTime="508.472">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Mrs. Marcus let me back up a minute. 
    The first conviction was offset because of ineffective counsel?
speaker="maria_l_marcus" startTime="508.472" stopTime="521.236">
    Ms. Maria L. Marcus 
    It was not any finding that on a record counsel was ineffective but because of a rule mandating automatic reversal in cases where counsel was tardily appointed. 
    Now --
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="521.236" stopTime="532.694">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Don't you think that's different from the average case, because I would assume that if counsel had more time, he might have been able to ask more questions on cross-examination.
speaker="maria_l_marcus" startTime="532.694" stopTime="545.339">
    Ms. Maria L. Marcus 
    In this case, in the first place the record shows that the cross-examination was capably handled as was the direct examination. 
    Also, as the Tennessee Supreme Court pointed out, it's very difficult to --
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="545.339" stopTime="548.919">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Did the Court of Appeals find that to be true?
speaker="maria_l_marcus" startTime="548.919" stopTime="574.447">
    Ms. Maria L. Marcus 
    The Court of Appeals, it made no reference whatsoever to lack of preparation time or the kind of questions that could have been asked except for the Guest theory. 
    That was the only basis on which harmless error was rejected, but not only does the record show, that Stubbs was effectively represented by three counsel by the way, not only one.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="574.447" stopTime="581.489">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    But if I remember correctly in Scottsboro (ph) trial, they had 27 counsels, and this Court offset that, so the number doesn't help?
speaker="maria_l_marcus" startTime="581.489" stopTime="588.380">
    Ms. Maria L. Marcus 
    I think the record helps a great deal though because in reading it's clear that -- in fact, I think what makes it clear again --
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="588.380" stopTime="610.490">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    You see I have great difficulty in looking at the record, and deciding as to what somebody would say on the second hearing? 
    I assume that the second trial, the lawyer looks at the record of the first trial, and finds gee I should have asked that question and he then has the opportunity to ask him, but he didn't in this case?
speaker="maria_l_marcus" startTime="610.490" stopTime="634.532">
    Ms. Maria L. Marcus 
    We were given a little assistance as to what would have happened because 1964 counsel read into the record the questions that they would have asked. 
    It's first notable that they made no mention of the Guest theory whatsoever, and second notable that there was a lot of time to research into Holms' past life, they didn't discover anything about his background, which could have formed the basis for cross examination.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="634.532" stopTime="637.421">

    Well, the Court below felt that it might have helped the defendant because if Stubbs' testimony, since he said on a stand that he kidnapped the Holms at gunpoint and compelled them to drive to the spot where the shooting occurred; this evidence was rather overwhelming, and the court below thought the Guest theory might show that if there was a felony which come to an end, that there might be more to say about the circumstances of a shooting, I think that's why they brought in the Guest theory.

    Ms. Maria L. Marcus 
    In Barber, this Court discussed the reading of preliminary hearing testimony of a witness who was in a federal prison across the state border. 
    The Court pointed out that increased cooperation between the states and the federal government meant that state process could cross a state border, and that states could issue writs of habeas corpus ad testificandum that federal courts have the power to issue such writs at the request of state prosecutorial authorities. 
    This Court has in fact never ruled on the question of what good faith means in the context of witness who is not in the United States or in a territory of the United States, but is beyond the reach of compulsory process, by a state prosecutor. 
    However, a number of state court and lower court decisions, federal decisions, indicate that proof that a witness is living on a foreign continent at the time of trial is sufficient to establish unavailability and cases in which it has been found that due diligence was not exercised, have been those in which the witness might had been in the jurisdiction. 
    We ask this Court not to extend Barber versus Page to overseas witnesses beyond the stage reached by compulsory process, but instead to a adopt the rationale already set out by many courts that good faith in an oversees witness is shown by establishing that he is resident there. 
    Now respondent attempts two countervailing arguments here. 
    First, that the --

    Ms. Maria L. Marcus 
    There was a remark by 1964 defense counsel that the Court in referring to a newspaper interview where Holm's son was quoted to saying his father was not aware that the trial is taking place, but even if this process was excluded as hearsay by the judge, but it's interesting to note that 1964 defense counsel made no effort to cross-examine the son on a stand as to whether or not his father knew, so that there is nothing to record really, no proper evidence on that.

speaker="maria_l_marcus" startTime="1073.058" stopTime="1125.521">
    Ms. Maria L. Marcus 
    Right. 
    Now respondent argues here that the Walsh Act which is 28 U.S.C. 1783 could somehow have been employed to subpoena this witness. 
    That statute only empowered a federal court to bring a witness before itself, where the United States Attorney General or someone acting under his direction so desired. 
    It could not authorize a state prosecutor to bring a witness to a state trail. 
    Indeed our research and a call to the office of the Untied States Attorney for the southern district has never revealed any case and which has been used by state prosecutor to secure witness in a state trial. 
    Thus it would have been more than due diligence, it would have been a height of ingenuity for the prosecutor to have thought of that and it would have been unusable.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1125.521" stopTime="1133.655">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Mrs. Marcus I take it it's your position, the state of New York is not bound by Judge Miller's habeas corpus ruling?
speaker="maria_l_marcus" startTime="1133.655" stopTime="1244.169">
    Ms. Maria L. Marcus 
    Right, and this -- there was an attempt by respondent to argue that New York is in privity with Tennessee and therefore, this ruling would prevent us from looking at the record at all to determine whether counsel was effective or not. 
    Now this privity theory might have some interest if we are relying on the 1954 conviction as a predicate. 
    That was what was vacated, but in point of fact we're relying on a 1964 conviction, which was appeal to the Supreme Court of Tennessee, and which included a ruling that the cross-examination was effective. 
    Moreover, the District Court never even considered whether counsel in fact conducted a proper cross-examination because it was a operating on a per se rule that made that kind of inquiry unnecessary. 
    So they never dealt with the question at all of whether the 1954 counsel's cross-examination was effective or not. 
    It did it merely on a per se rule, which this Court in Chambers versus Maroney has since rejected. 
    This Court in Chambers held that the mere fact that the counsel is tardily appointed doesn't even call for a hearing necessarily much less automatic reversal. 
    It calls for inquiry into the record to find out whether in fact there was effective representation. 
    I would like to point out that even assuming that the state should have sent a request to the witness prior to reading his testimony in the record, there in this case would have been harmless because the outcome of the trial would have been the same, whether the state had communicated with Holm or not. 
    If the letter had been sent to Holm and he had refused to come to Tennessee, his prior testimony would have been read into the record at the second trial.

    The question would be how would the witness have reacted to this cross-examination and the testimony was uncomplicated. 
    Stubbs was a strong witness to a tragic situation with no motive to lie. 
    Stubbs --

    Ms. Maria L. Marcus 
    Holm, yes. 
    Stubbs' identity, the ownership of the gun and the fact of the kidnapping were corroborated by Stubbs himself and moreover Holm could have refreshed his recollection by reading his prior testimony from the earlier trial. 
    And 1964 counsel with plenty of time to research into Holm's background did not find anything upon which to base new questions.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1340.439" stopTime="1344.325">

    Ms. Maria L. Marcus 
    He testified at both trials and he reiterated that when he was released from the Texas prison, he tried for several days going toward Bristol, Tennessee, where he hoped to meet a truck route going to New York. 
    He encountered Mr. and Mrs. Alex Holm, he had a gun, which he had been given by a friend, he had no money, no job prospects. 
    He said that he kidnapped the Holms' at gunpoint.

    This is his testimony at both trials.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Right.
speaker="maria_l_marcus" startTime="1375.061" stopTime="1417.578">
    Ms. Maria L. Marcus 
    Kidnapped the Holms' at gunpoint and with his left-hand holding the gun at intervals pointing into Mrs. Holm's face. 
    They drove on until near Bristol, Tennessee, he testified that he saw a tree in a reddish haze. 
    He heard a loud bang, he felt a pain, he thought that Holm must have gotten the gun away from him and then Stubbs fled from the car. 
    Now Stubbs testimony about his subsequent flight, the blood on his clothes, the roadblock at which he was arrested and a hospital room identification in which Holm pointed to him in the presence of a number of police officers and said this is the man that killed my wife and shot me. 
    That's subsequent --

    Didn't Stubbs also offer the explanation when he is first apprehended that he had fallen off a cliff while he was fishing and that was how that happened?

    Ms. Maria L. Marcus 
    Yes, he told that -- it was the first story that he told the police officers that the blood was there only because he had an accident while fishing and he had slipped on a cliff. 
    The disputed testimony of Alex Holm of course parallel that of Stubbs himself as to the fact that Stubbs had kidnapped them and compelled them to drive to the spot where the shooting occurred. 
    Now the hospital room identification was not objected to and the police officers testified in court at both trials as to that identification. 
    I have pointed --

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Mrs. Marcus, I gather -- in this instance, the only issue before us is whether the state did what it should have done to bring Mr. Holm back for the second trial?
speaker="maria_l_marcus" startTime="1490.120" stopTime="1496.028">
    Ms. Maria L. Marcus 
    Well, even if not, it would have been harmless error in the context of the overwhelming evidence in this case.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="1496.028" stopTime="1517.520">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    But apart from that, on the basic issue, I just want to be clear. 
    Your position is that as far as a state need go is, that is, satisfy itself that the witness permanently resides overseas and that satisfies any constitutional obligation it has?
speaker="maria_l_marcus" startTime="1517.520" stopTime="1521.341">
    Ms. Maria L. Marcus 
    Insofar as a witness is resident beyond the reach of compulsory process.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="1521.341" stopTime="1533.502">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Yes because he was living in some foreign country. 
    Now we don't agree with you, I gather from Judge Friendly's opinion, he thought that it was not the proper test. 
    He thought that the --
speaker="maria_l_marcus" startTime="1533.502" stopTime="1535.079">
    Ms. Maria L. Marcus 
    Judge Adams' opinion, Your Honor?
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="1535.079" stopTime="1569.018">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Adams, I am sorry, yes. 
    The majority opinion. 
    It's page 27, is where there is no showing that the witness beyond the effect of reach of court's subpoena will refuse to return voluntarily to testify if requested. 
    So under that test there would have to be an inquiry made if the witness resident abroad -- and get from him a refusal to appear. 
    Now there is nothing in that test I gather which suggests that there should also be an offer by the state to pay the expenses of the witness if you will.
speaker="maria_l_marcus" startTime="1569.018" stopTime="1578.658">
    Ms. Maria L. Marcus 
    No, he made no mention of that and then he ultimately on our second point, which was that the evidence here is so overwhelming with the hospital identification.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="1578.658" stopTime="1580.139">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Yes, but if I may, I would like to conclude.

    Ms. Maria L. Marcus 
    Sure.

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Now if we don't agree with your test, but think that the test suggested by Judge Adams is the more appropriate one and then I gather there can be a reversal only if we agree with your second point namely on harmless error?
speaker="maria_l_marcus" startTime="1598.850" stopTime="1605.304">

   Argument of Bruce K. Carpenter
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1605.304" stopTime="1608.272">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Very well Mrs. Marcus. 
    Mr. Carpenter.
speaker="bruce_k_carpenter" startTime="1608.272" stopTime="1708.201">
    Mr. Bruce K. Carpenter 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    Perhaps in order to clarify the questions that are raised, I should address myself first to what happened, the facts of the case at the Tennessee trial a little bit. 
    The un-controverted testimony was that some 55 miles away from the homicide, the place where the homicide took place, in another part of Tennessee, Stubbs approached Mr. and Mrs. Holm. 
    Now Stubbs was hungry, he had been without food. 
    His, this is Stubbs' testimony, for some time he was desperate. 
    He wanted a ride to get up to New York where he had relations. 
    As he approached the Holms, asked them for a ride, was refused, went away and then he said, he remembered he had the gun, he came back, forced his way in their car. 
    He drove, they were in the back seat and away they went. 
    Now, at this point, of course, we have a serious misconduct. 
    Now the testimony of Stubbs was that very shortly, after this trip began friendly relations began to exist between him and the Holms. 
    They began to express sympathy for his condition and said, if you had only asked us properly for a ride, we would have given you one, or food. 
    So that this is Stubbs said happened about four miles after the trip began.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1708.201" stopTime="1712.031">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    You say Stubbs said as that he -- so testified at both trials?
speaker="bruce_k_carpenter" startTime="1712.031" stopTime="1712.624">

    Yes, he did.

    Yes. 
    Now, the trip continues. 
    They pass through towns. 
    Stubbs says that pass a police officer. 
    They continue on their way and all of a sudden --
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1725.164" stopTime="1729.347">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Didn't he also say right at that point that he put the gun down on the seat of the car?
speaker="bruce_k_carpenter" startTime="1729.347" stopTime="1729.861">
    Mr. Bruce K. Carpenter 
    Yes.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1729.861" stopTime="1734.871">

    And that was -- so that the police officers and others wouldn't see the gun?
speaker="bruce_k_carpenter" startTime="1734.871" stopTime="1745.148">
    Mr. Bruce K. Carpenter 
    Yes. 
    At the request of Mrs. Holm, put the gun down, he had had it, he said in his lap; then the testimony was he put it on the seat beside him.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1745.148" stopTime="1749.831">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    He didn't throw the gun away though anytime or offered to give it to the Holms?
speaker="bruce_k_carpenter" startTime="1749.831" stopTime="1789.536">
    Mr. Bruce K. Carpenter 
    No. 
    No, he did not. 
    But at any rate, according to the defense point of view, the gun was on the side of his seat, beside Mr. Stubbs. 
    He feels that friendly relations have been developed. 
    He feels at ease and then when they come across a place where there are some people nearby. 
    According to Holm, Stubbs took the gun and turned around and started shooting while the car was still moving, and he shot the wife and shot Mr. Holm twice.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="1789.536" stopTime="1790.602">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    They were both in the back seat?

    They were both in the back seat.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="1792.284" stopTime="1796.184">

    Did they both agree on that; Stubbs and Holm agreed that the two were in the back seat?

    Mr. Bruce K. Carpenter 
    Oh yes! 
    Yes, there is no question. 
    Mrs. Holm was sitting whereas in the middle there was some luggage off to the left and Mr. Holm was on the far right. 
    Now Stubbs testified that he did not shoot anyone. 
    That as he was driving he was suddenly hit on the head presumably by the gun and the car crashed and he struggled out and got away and escaped. 
    Now the trial judge in Tennessee --
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="1829.594" stopTime="1833.894">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    What about this?

    Mr. Bruce K. Carpenter 
    He doesn't know how they were shot.

speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="1842.025" stopTime="1843.228">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    And who had to struggle to get it away?

    And did he get it away from Mr. Holm?
speaker="bruce_k_carpenter" startTime="1845.816" stopTime="1857.923">
    Mr. Bruce K. Carpenter 
    No, because the gun was found in the car, the backseat of the car, backseat when the police officer (Inaudible) -- Now the trial judge--
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="1857.923" stopTime="1859.841">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    And did the car crash in fact?
speaker="bruce_k_carpenter" startTime="1859.841" stopTime="1904.630">
    Mr. Bruce K. Carpenter 
    The car didn't crash. 
    It went off the road and wound up in a ditch, pointing in the same direction that it had traveled. 
    The trial judge charged and I quoted this portion in the Appendix to the brief, it’s not finally printed in the record, that if this theory were accepted by the jury, they should acquit. 
    I think then that as to the question of whether or not, Mr. Holm’s testimony was crucial or devastating, there should be no questions in the case as to that. 
    Certainly, there was no other witness.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1904.630" stopTime="1905.803">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    He was the only eye witness?

    Mr. Bruce K. Carpenter 
    He was the only eye witness – yes, Your Honor and he was the only witness if you include Stubbs’ testimony and Stubbs being present in the car, who was -- and he said that Stubbs had done the shooting. 
    Well, certainly this is different from those cases where confrontation is considered in the context of a peripheral statement that may or may not have affected the outcome.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1933.460" stopTime="1943.049">

    Mr. Bruce K. Carpenter

    Mr. Bruce K. Carpenter 
    Yes. 
    The transcript of the first trial, I just had occasion to read it last week. 
    It is not part of the record to this Court, I will leave the copy, the certified copy that I obtained from Tennessee, with the clerk, but Holm testified first, at the first Tennessee trial. 
    He was the first witness, and my impression in reading that transcript is that the counsel, who cross-examined him om this part as we produced in the Appendix, were not aware of the defense that was to be offered. 
    I mean, My feeling is that they didn't learn of this until Stubbs testified and told his story. 
    I think there is clear indication, but of the fact that counsel were unprepared at this first trial.

    Mr. Bruce K. Carpenter 
    Well they might have, but this case involved the people who were from out of state, people that were not local people, both the Holms and Stubbs.

    Mr. Bruce K. Carpenter 
    Yeah, I should think here they might have done so. 
    I don't know the problems of a lawyer who is preparing a defense, that’s difficult. 
    You really need to have time to mull over things. 
    What’s apparent here, at the site when we had plenty of chance to consider the record and explore them often, these matters which seem so clear now, are not so clear when you first get a case.

    Mr. Bruce K. Carpenter 
    Yes, but no questions were asked. 
    Well there -- three questions were asked as to story that an attempt was made to impeach Mr. Holm at this point, an abortive attempt, three questions were asked as to what whether he had told a conflicting story to an undertaker and it never really reached the point of impeaching.

    Mr. Bruce K. Carpenter 
    Yes, Judge Miller said and his decision is appended as an Appendix to our brief. 
    The Court is of the opinion that the evidence in the record show that the constitutional rights of petitioner Stubbs were violated at the time of his trial in the criminal court of Sullivan County, that’s the 1954 trial, in that his Court appointed counsel did not have adequate and sufficient time within which to prepare the necessary defense prior to going to the trial and as a result the petitioner was denied the effective representation by counsel. 
    Now early on in his decision, he recites that he considered the testimony of Stubbs and the entire record, and to reach this determination. 
    This determination was not apparently questioned by the Tennessee authorities. 
    They acquiesced in this decision in promptly awarding a retrial in 1964.

    Mr. Bruce K. Carpenter 
    Well I --

    Let's assume for the moment that there was no question whatsoever as to the effectiveness of counsel at the first trial?

    Mr. Bruce K. Carpenter 
    Then as in Barber against Page, assume that there was effective cross-examination, there still was a denial of confrontation. 
    There was a denial of confrontation because the prosecution needed to make a good faith effort to obtain the presence of this witness Holm at the second trial.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2254.675" stopTime="2264.282">

    Mr. Bruce K. Carpenter 
    Yes. 
    In fact, there is an indication in the record as my sister pointed out, that Mr. Holm was not even apprised of the fact that there was a trial pending. 
    He didn't even know about it, let alone be asked whether he wanted to come to the trial, let alone be asked whether he would be willing to come --

    Mr. Bruce K. Carpenter 
    There is a further indication in the Tennessee record that counsel had been informed by the Tennessee prosecutor, that Mr. Holm would be produced. 
    At least they -- one lawyer made a remark and it's cited in the page reference, it's cited in the brief that --

    Mr. Bruce K. Carpenter 
    Yes, It was a remark of counsel addressed I believe when the jury was not present.

    Mr. Bruce K. Carpenter 
    No, but I think that they indicated most strenuously their desire to have the witness present in order to be questioned.

    Mr. Bruce K. Carpenter 
    I think, they might have asked, but this remark that I have mentioned, which is an evidence may have been an explanation as to why they didn't. 
    They expected Holm to be there. 
    When in the middle of the trial --

    We don't know from this record whether they did or did not know. 
    For all we know, they may have been very carefully making it a point not to make a demand. 
    It's just as good speculation as yours that they avoided making a demand because they never wanted to see Mr. Holm in the courtroom?

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    The only solution would have been a mistrial, if they were going to -- probably a mistrial, if they were going to wait for this man to be subpoenaed, and determine whether he would honor extraterritorial subpoena all the way to Sweden. 
    And then, if a mistrial occurred, I suppose it would be open to the defense to claim that the mistrial was the fault of the prosecution and that he could therefore raise the double jeopardy defense.
speaker="bruce_k_carpenter" startTime="2533.973" stopTime="2550.616">
    Mr. Bruce K. Carpenter 
    Yes, but I would say then, the passage -- the only passage that addresses in the record, that addresses itself to this point, is a statement by Mr. Mitchell, one of Stubbs' counsel at the second trial. 
    And he says --
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="2550.616" stopTime="2551.685">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    At what page is that?

    Mr. Bruce K. Carpenter 
    Page 16a of the respondent's brief at the bottom. 
    It's at page 162 of the transcript of the 1964 trial. 
    Your Honor, please I think it is the law and it is the law until the Court speaks otherwise. 
    Now as Your Honor recalls Mr. Wilton (ph) who was the prosecuting attorney, stated that he would have Mr. Holms, and a Holm and Holms are interchangeable spellings of the same were present and then there is a three dots to show a suspension, that's the only passage in the record that speaks of it. 
    I think it explains, perhaps why counsel did not move for an adjournment or move or apply to have the witness brought over at the counsel's expense or since Stubbs was indigent at Court expense. 
    They were, I think, if there is any question, the only indication in the record is that the counsel were surprised.

    Mr. Bruce K. Carpenter 
    Well they would have, following a conviction by the fact finding. 
    The prosecutor lays an information, and it is possible to have a jury trial on the question whether the defendant is the same person that was convicted and it's also permissible under the effective New York statute to raise the question as to whether the previous conviction was constitutionally obtained.

    I think that you don't, this Court does not need to enter into the question, as to whether or not there was effective cross-examination or whether there was harmless error in the representation by the counsel at the Tennessee trials. 
    If the Court determines that the prosecution in Tennessee had to make an effort, some kind of an effort to obtain the presence of the witness Holm.

    Mr. Bruce K. Carpenter 
    Well, I don't know. 
    I think if you are representing an indigent, counsel probably would be more prudent than I was and would go ahead and make the application before going over there and would apply for reimbursement. 
    But may be all that's necessary is, as was suggested from the bench, just ask the witness if he is willing to come back at his own expense.

    Mr. Bruce K. Carpenter 
    Question is -- I'm thinking of what is the -- a case arose in California, where exactly the same situation occurred. 
    The application was made to the Marine Court and the legal officer told the investigator -- the police officer investigating that he was unavailable and it was determined that this was a satisfactory determination that the witness was unavailable. 
    I think one of the California cases is cited in the brief.

    Mr. Bruce K. Carpenter 
    Well, I think there was an effort made to get the witness. 
    An answer came back that the witness was unavailable. 
    This is far cry from what was not done in this case.

    Mr. Bruce K. Carpenter 
    Yes, the case that I was mentioning or which is in the fact is the -- I think People against Benjamin, which is cited sited in 83 California Reporter 764, an intermediate Appellant Court decision.

    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Mr. Carpenter, I take it you are relying on Barber against Page for your main proposition and there is at least a factual distinction between this case and Barber, isn't there, in that in Barber nobody cross-examined on behalf of the particular defendant who later raised the objection?
speaker="bruce_k_carpenter" startTime="3062.001" stopTime="3062.874">
    Mr. Bruce K. Carpenter 
    Yes.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="3062.874" stopTime="3069.884">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Whereas here there was cross-examination on behalf of your client in the 1954 trial?
speaker="bruce_k_carpenter" startTime="3069.884" stopTime="3108.050">
    Mr. Bruce K. Carpenter 
    Yes, there was cross-examination. 
    Of course, the decision in Barber expressly made the effectiveness of the cross-examination not a factor in it, but so that the precise holding in Barber as I read the case is that assuming you have effective cross-examination or assuming cross-examination is not at issue, that is, whether or not the transcript that you are going to use of the absent witness' testimony is a good enough transcript to use.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="3108.050" stopTime="3114.439">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well, isn't the holding though kind of limited to the fact; when you are speaking about holding, you are talking about the facts of the particular case?
speaker="bruce_k_carpenter" startTime="3114.439" stopTime="3140.066">
    Mr. Bruce K. Carpenter 
    Yes, and another fact that distinguishes is Barber and Page distance was only 225 miles and it was just one straight line, but these facts, because I don't think that distance here, it's 4500 miles or so to Sweden make -- is a determining factor.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="3140.066" stopTime="3158.196">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Well, Mr. Carpenter there had been the most vigorous cross-examination to Mr. Holm when he took the stand in rebuttal as to Stubbs had told this good relation story and that had been the most vigorous cross-examination of Mr. Holm, you say that here there was not. 
    Had there been, would you be here?
speaker="bruce_k_carpenter" startTime="3158.196" stopTime="3160.503">
    Mr. Bruce K. Carpenter 
    Yes, I would think that Barber against --

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    You still think that an effort should have been made to have Mr. Holms appear at the second trial?
speaker="bruce_k_carpenter" startTime="3166.072" stopTime="3191.858">
    Mr. Bruce K. Carpenter 
    Yes Your Honor, because the right of confrontation involves not merely cross-examination, but also the right of a defendant to have his fact-finder, deal with the witness, face to face, consider that the demeanor of the witness as he is giving his testimony and determine, you might have waive it or give it up, because of the necessities of some case, but it's something that you shouldn't give up easily --

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Suppose it appeared hypothetically now, that's not this case, but suppose hypothetically it appeared that a defense counsel in that posture consulted with his client and said you will be much better off to have this testimony read from the transcript than to have this man sitting in the courtroom, flesh and blood on the stand with the scars of the bullet wounds on his face and suppose he made that decision, would you think anyone could reasonably say that was ineffective, that tactic was ineffective assistance of the counsel or was it a permissible choice?
speaker="bruce_k_carpenter" startTime="3233.660" stopTime="3245.292">
    Mr. Bruce K. Carpenter 
    I think it's perhaps possible for counsel to make that decision. 
    I don't think it would be dishonest for counsel to advice a client to better let the testimony be read. 
    In this case, there was no hope.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="3245.292" stopTime="3253.866">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Well, I didn't suggest he was dishonest. 
    I am simply suggesting that it might have been sounder defense tactics not to have Mr. Holm there?
speaker="bruce_k_carpenter" startTime="3253.866" stopTime="3272.986">
    Mr. Bruce K. Carpenter 
    The only defense tactics that would have worked in this case in my opinion is to show Mr. Holm to have been a liar; that's the only way and counsel failed to do anything effective in the 1954 trial, they had no chance to do it in the 1964 trial. 
    Thank you very much.

    Ms. Maria L. Marcus 
    He has been resentenced as a second felony offender under the Texas predicate and he is appealing that Texas predicate. 
    However, regardless of the outcome --
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="3292.532" stopTime="3295.058">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    An appeal where, in the state of New Jersey -- in New York State Courts?
speaker="maria_l_marcus" startTime="3295.058" stopTime="3307.725">
    Ms. Maria L. Marcus 
    In New York State Courts, yes, first. 
    Regardless of the outcome of that appeal, there still would be no mootness in this case because this Court held in Sibron --

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    No but isn't the condition satisfied here? 
    The condition was that he'd be resentenced?

    Ms. Maria L. Marcus 
    Yes, but --
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="3313.545" stopTime="3315.928">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Well that satisfy the condition of this judgment?
speaker="maria_l_marcus" startTime="3315.928" stopTime="3342.881">
    Ms. Maria L. Marcus 
    It does not for the considerations that this Court discussed in Sibron v. New York and the Morgan case. 
    The fact of collateral disabilities and more important under New York law, upon a subsequent conviction, the Judge has a right to consider the whole history of this defendant and the kind of crimes which he has committed before and has a discretion to resentence him to a life-sentence and of course, any --
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="3342.881" stopTime="3345.931">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Well, what could he sentence him to here? 
    Is there any different sentence that he got?
speaker="maria_l_marcus" startTime="3345.931" stopTime="3394.233">
    Ms. Maria L. Marcus 
    The sentence here is not different, but as this Court pointed out in both Sibron and Morgan, it must be considered what would happen on a subsequent conviction and what would happen is that the sentencing Court would undoubtedly regard as crucial in determining what kind of person this is, what sort of chances for rehabilitation and what sort of danger he poses to the public in being released. 
    A brutal murder of this kind committed seven days after release from the Texas penitentiary, he would undoubtedly be central to the sentencing Court and so under the considerations of this Court set out in Sibron and Morgan, the case cannot be moot.
