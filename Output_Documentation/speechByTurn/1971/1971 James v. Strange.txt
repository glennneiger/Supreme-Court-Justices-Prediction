    Mr. Collister, You may proceed whenever you are ready.
speaker="edward_g_collister_jr" startTime="42.573" stopTime="193.864">
    Mr. Edward G. Collister, Jr. 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    This is one of those cases that in attempting to characterize what you are doing to your colleagues back in the office, you have a little bit of difficulty identifying exactly what it is because I hate to refer to it as the Strange case. 
    What it is, is a direct appeal from the Three-Judge Court sitting in the District of Kansas which declared unconstitutional and enjoined the future enforcement of a statute passed by the 1979 Kansas legislature. 
    The statute involved, KSA 1971 sub 22-4513 is a part of the Aid to Indigent Defenders Act passed in that year by that legislature. 
    I think what happened to generate the passage of the entire Act was that the confusion that existed with regard to the manner and method of not only determination of indigency for the purposes of appointing counsel in criminal cases, but also the method of payment of counsel and some fashion caused the legislature to pass a rather comprehensive Act and that Act provides for the establishment of a Board of Supervisors to govern the administrative work of the system which is administered directly by the State's Judicial Administrator, Mr. James. 
    The Board of Supervisors is authorized to cause to be accumulated a panel of attorneys in the various districts and to formulate rules and regulations for the implementation of the Act. 
    Once the panel of attorneys is formulated, any district judge or magistrate may rely on any attorney on that panel for providing counsel to those who he finds indigent and requiring counsel. 
    The challenged portion of the Act provides that when any expense has been advanced or paid by the state on behalf of somebody who has been found to be indigent, the state is allowed an opportunity to cause repayment to -- at least be attempt a procedure that is used in 4513, a repayment statute, is that the judicial administrator causes a notice to be sent to the person upon whose behalf the expenditure was made.

    The expense can embrace any amount of money expended under the Act for the provision of counsel.

speaker="edward_g_collister_jr" startTime="207.480" stopTime="208.598">
    Mr. Edward G. Collister, Jr. 
    Is it set by the Act?
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="208.598" stopTime="213.347">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Or is there anything in counsel, are they awarded fees?
speaker="edward_g_collister_jr" startTime="213.347" stopTime="307.078">
    Mr. Edward G. Collister, Jr. 
    They are awarded fees. 
    Currently what -- no I should not say currently because this has been true through the history of the Act, each year the judicial administrator on behalf of the Supreme Court proposes a budget to the State Legislature which appropriates the money to fund the indigent program. 
    His estimate is really a guess, at least it was to start with, so in any event the money is appropriated, then the Board of Supervisors which includes the Judicial Administrator and a Justice of the State Supreme Court determine rates of compensation. 
    Currently the rates are figured at about $15 to $20 an hour. 
    $15 an hour for out of court time and $20 an hour for in court time with a maximum of $500 in any case not involving a sentence of a life imprisonment or death. 
    In another words for practical purposes everything, but a capital case. 
    Also the statute authorizes the expenditure of funds to provide defense services, let us say an investigator, I would assume the transcripts would be included although I have no state decision controlling it one way or another, perhaps experts, fax or anything that the state is authorized to initially provide on the indigent defendant's behalf under the act which covers the criminal trial, the post conviction, the collateral attack, the appeal stages of the proceedings.

    Mr. Edward G. Collister, Jr. 
    The statute appears to read that way, yes sir. 
    There is no state decision interpreting any aspect of the statute handed down by the State Supreme Court. 
    Whether they would read some exceptions to those defendants who are acquitted into the Act, I do not know. 
    The statute applies equally across the board.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="413.537" stopTime="431.650">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    I am familiar with the system of at least one state, at least the way it used to be where if the defendant was acquitted that was the end of it and the state absorbed the costs, but if he was convicted, he was supposed to pay off the cost over the period of his time.
speaker="edward_g_collister_jr" startTime="431.650" stopTime="434.386">
    Mr. Edward G. Collister, Jr.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    I suppose an equal protection, an attack could be made upon that kind of system?
speaker="edward_g_collister_jr" startTime="437.891" stopTime="572.479">
    Mr. Edward G. Collister, Jr. 
    I would expect. 
    I think the, regardless of what the statute in its current form provides, under the District Court's decision, the Three-Judge Court the state would be prohibited from taking any kind of action to allow reimbursement or recoupment because what the District Court, excuse me, what the Three-Judge Court decided. 
    If I may refer to the court's opinion as printed on the jurisdictional statement and the appendix to the jurisdictional statement, I would like to refer to pages seven and eight of the appendix, where the Three-Judge Court on page eighty-seven says, “Hence any construction of the Kansas' statute which leaves intact the state's right to recover legal expenses from indigents is a construction which inevitably impinges upon and determines the rights protected in Gideon and the same reasoning is employed in the next page, leading us to conclude that whatever form the state might have enacted or might choose to enact in the future, would under that philosophy be an unconstitutional burden on the right to counsel. 
    This action was filed in a Federal Court in behalf of a plaintiff, David Strange who had been charged with a felony crime in the District Court, ultimately in the District Court of Shawnee county in the state of Kansas. 
    He was, he received the letter of demand from the Judicial Administrator notifying him of the states claim as a result of a direct outlay of $500 to his court appointed attorney, it was Mr. Wilkinson. 
    At that time the Federal Court action filed and ever since then the state in that case has agreed to not proceed any further and when the District Court handed down its decision, a permanent injunction restraining any enforcement of that provision of the statute was also avoided.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="572.479" stopTime="577.987">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Now I gather in this case the only expense was the $500 paid to the attorney?
speaker="edward_g_collister_jr" startTime="577.987" stopTime="773.726">
    Mr. Edward G. Collister, Jr. 
    It's -- that is my understanding, yes sir. 
    The issue as we see it is one that is a little bit for me to vocalize. 
    The issue stated in the brief is as follows. 
    Whether the existence of a state statutory procedure providing for the collection from an indigent defendant of moneys expended by the state to furnish him counsel constitutes an unlawful burden upon an indigent defendant's Sixth Amendment right to the assistance of counsel and that is pretty wordy. 
    But it is difficult to approach the subject without having to do a little bit of defining what we are talking about. 
    The state has attempted to treat all those who are found to be indigent equally with regard to this particular statute. 
    They, the state has attempted to treat them the same as would any civil judgment debt ought be treated in the state courts with one possible exception and that relates to the exemptions. 
    The exemptions for civil judgment debtor in a state are a little bit broader than those under the Aid to Indigent Defenders Act and the statute specifically defines what exemptions are available and what are not, and primarily the exemption is the homestead exemption. 
    The statute is much broader, however, than simply allowing the state to take a judgment against the person found to be indigent because it authorizes in effect the setting aside of a fraudulent conveyance and an establishment of a lien against any property that might have been transferred by the indigent prior -- subsequent to the time the crime was committed. 
    In trying to define what the precise issue that, the Lower Court treated, the Three-Judge Court, we have to look to the Sixth Amendment, which provides that in all criminal prosecutions the accused shall enjoy the right to have the assistance of counsel and the precise question we ask is, what does it mean when it says the right to the assistance of counsel? 
    Does it mean that the state has to provide free counsel? 
    Because that is adding a word that is not in the constitution and in the decisions of this Court relating to the right to counsel, when this Court speaks in terms of protecting the Sixth Amendment right to counsel by providing counsel or seeing that the defendant at a criminal trial has the opportunity to be heard by a counsel, does that mean that the state has to bear the expense of providing that counsel under all circumstances? 
    It is a state's position that at the time the criminal defendant is tried in the State of Kansas under the Aid to Indigent Defenders Act, the constitutional right to counsel is protected.

    Well, that is in practice I think that is a lot more difficult to answer than it would appear. 
    My impression would be that he would not if he could afford to use that money for the services of an attorney. 
    Of course, he would claim that he could not use that money for the services of an attorney or that he was not sure that much money would be enough because the attorney who represented him on retainer basis might say I will charge on hourly basis. 
    Practically, whether or not that would in fact occur, I think it is maybe debatable, but as a matter of abstraction, I would think that would be the case.

    What I have in my mind was I do not know that your brother on the other side makes this argument that the court did decide this case, but normally when a defendant is not an indigent, at least there is or might be some negotiation with his own selected lawyer as to the amount of the fee and while he may not be in a very good bargaining position at least he may negotiate a fee and here the fee, the amount of the fee is entirely beyond his control. 
    He is not consulted about it at all and presumably again to take an outrageous hypothetical case, Kansas might decide to pay lawyers $10,000 for this job and I know in fact you say it is limited to $500 and if you accept a non capital cases, but, or might decide to pay $500 for ten minutes of time and then just automatically charge the defendant that amount and then he would not have any say in it.

    Mr. Collister, does the existence of this recoupment statute in Kansas tend to reduce in anyway the type of inquiry or the extent of inquiry initially made by the Trial Court when a defendant claims to be indigent? 
    Does the Trial Court feel free to conclude that he is indigent without any searching examination because of the existence of the recoupment statute?
speaker="edward_g_collister_jr" startTime="1159.502" stopTime="1229.301">
    Mr. Edward G. Collister, Jr. 
    Well again I do not have, that is not a -- my answer cannot be documented. 
    but my assessment of what is occurring would be that because of other reasons, our judges are getting much more careful about examining persons who allege they are indigent for the purposes of appointing an attorney and the primary reason is that the increase in the number of representations by attorneys in court appointed cases has increased so much in the last three to four years that the courts are becoming very, are much more seriously inquiring as to the indigency status than they ever did before and that approach is implemented even more by the statute, which the current statute which is in another, current Act, excuse me, which is another provision specifically authorizes the trial judge if he wishes in his discretion to require the indigent applicant to file an affidavit setting out certain information concerning his finances. 
    So my guess is that, there is more inquiry, more inquiry going on right now.

speaker="edward_g_collister_jr" startTime="1263.963" stopTime="1324.246">
    Mr. Edward G. Collister, Jr. 
    Not to my knowledge. 
    I have been in the Attorney General's Office for four years and I have not heard of anything that has caused the legislature to become, to react in that fashion and I suspect that what is happening in our state is happening to so many other places in the last three to five years is that every year we get into continual fight in the legislature about who is going to get what money is available and how we are going to get that money. 
    As a matter of fact, it was reflected in this very same Act, in 1971 when the legislature almost refused to extend any money to the judicial -- to appropriate any money to the judicial administrator to administer under the Act. 
    I suspect that what they were concerned about was trying to recover as much money as they could and there has been some recovery and I recognize that that recovery is not very much compared to the total expended.

    Mr. Edward G. Collister, Jr. 
    The period of time that the recoupment provision has been in effect from which approximately July 1 of 1969 through the first part of 1971 when the Three-Judge Court declared the statute unconstitutional, there has been no attempted collection since then, so it is about one year and eight or nine months. 
    I do not know how effective the provision would be to collecting a greater sum of money because we have not had that much expenditure to be quite honest about it.

    About a thousand dollars a month?
speaker="edward_g_collister_jr" startTime="1372.282" stopTime="1541.671">
    Mr. Edward G. Collister, Jr. 
    Roughly, whether or not the work that has to be done by the judicial administrator, the attorney general's office and the county attorneys in the state that justify that kind of recovery may be debatable, but that is the province of the legislature to decide what policy that it want to implement as long as of course it does not violate the constitution. 
    Our feeling about the subject matter of the District Court's opinion is that the right to counsel, the opportunity to be heard by counsel is granted and implemented by the Act. 
    We reviewed the decisions of various courts. 
    We find very few end points on this particular issue. 
    The California Supreme Court has held that you can't as a condition in a probation require reimbursement of moneys expended making much the same argument that is made in this case. 
    The Iowa Supreme Court in Dicta indicated that if the state legislature would adopt the statute, I am assuming that it would be similar in substance to ours that the state could recover money. 
    The Ohio Court of Appeals has allowed a similar procedure in Ohio, but other than -- the Supreme Court of New Hampshire has rendered an advisory opinion that when I read it at least indicates that under their state constitution which is different than the constitution of the State of Kansas, the state has to provide free counsel because of the wording of the New Hampshire constitution. 
    That is about the sum total of the precedent that we are able to present that either side is able to present for that matter. 
    The issues as seen by the Three-Judge Court were one, whether or not the right to counsel encompasses an absolute requirement that the state provide free counsel as opposed to allowing the opportunity to be heard by counsel. 
    Secondly whether or not the statute imposes an unconstitutional burden on the exercise of a constitutional right directing my attention to the later those whether or not the burden is needless or unreasonable. 
    In part those have to be in this kind of a case I think determinations of the legislature whether this kind of a policy is justified with the obvious time and trouble that state officials have to go through.

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    What do you currently have on the reasoning of the District Court that the statute deters indigents from exercising the right to the assistance of counsel, thus puts the accused in the position of deciding whether you can afford to consult even with court appointed counsel. 
    Of course the accused has not the means to hire an attorney in the first instance, so he will not to be in a position to accept court appointed counsel when it really means is he has at most 90 days grace in paying the cost of legal services rendered on his behalf.

    The judgment is the lien against -- let me approach that question by answering this way. 
    The judgment is treated almost exactly the same as would any judgment in the civil case. 
    It is to lien against all property that a civil judgment would operate against. 
    The homestead exemption exists, the lien exists for five years unless execution is issued. 
    If execution is not issued it becomes dormant and it's subject to reviver within a two-year period just as are all civil judgments which all are liens.

   Argument of John E. Wilkinson
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="2007.671" stopTime="2009.426">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Mr. Wilkinson.
speaker="john_e_wilkinson" startTime="2009.426" stopTime="2210.528">
    Mr. John E. Wilkinson 
    Mr. Chief Justice and members of the Court. 
    I suppose that I am the one who failed to tell David Strange that I was not free court appointed counsel and consequently, I felt morally obligated to carry his cause pretty much at my expense. 
    When I first confronted David Strange in the jail, I was under the impression that I was free court appointed counsel and had the statute had been called, had I known about the statute at that time, the statute became effective July 1, I think I was called on July 10, 1969, some nine days later, ten days later. 
    I perhaps would have done essentially the same thing I did after I plead David Strange guilty under Ex parte royal which I believe Mr. Justice Brennan decided in the favor of (Inaudible). 
    I would have attempted to stop the criminal proceedings at that time because contrary to what Mr. Chief Justice Burger has said he thought he would take judicial notice at, I think it is important for a young man to be advised and particularly in this young man's circumstances where he is guilty or committed his first offense to be given a chance again, and that is what he has been grappling with in his own situations from a family of 11 children. 
    He had a brother who was in the hospital for the criminally insane who set a bad example for him when he ran away from the (Inaudible) state hospital and got him into trouble in this case. 
    After I have plead him guilty to his offense David Strange got a job and he is working today. 
    He has a marginal existence. 
    He does not need this $500 judgment or any judgment against him, but he is gainfully occupied. 
    He is taking care of his wife, he is taking care of his baby. 
    This $500 judgment at the time that was to be levied against him on February fourth 1970 I believe would have put him in the ranks of the people who could not honestly apply for a job because he was judgment for material, he was legal fee material. 
    His work would have required -- his judgment against him would have caused his employer to expend legal fees on his behalf just to meet garnishment problems. 
    Now the state says and has said all along that there is only the five years involved but they can renew this judgment by a simple matter at the clerk of District Courts office. 
    So whether if he has five years or twenty years, it is a matter of levying execution, returning to execution unsatisfied.

    Well I would think so. 
    I think there would be some instances where the man was on probation that a judge might say you pay back a certain sum of money to your attorney, but you see this particular statute starts out prior to the time you really learn the circumstances of the indigent accused. 
    The accused stands charged and you do not know whether he is going to get probation or whether he wants to contest the actions of the police, or whether not he really wants to have a jury trial, whether or not he wants to confront his witnesses, whether or not he wants to cross examine the states witnesses. 
    This is all done ahead of time and as you pointed out earlier he has no opportunity to determine what the amount of his judgment might be unless someone advises him in advance.

    I would say that it stayed essentially the same. 
    The need for counsel in serious offense as set down by Gideon versus Wainwright was recognized by the courts and that as much as anything determined that there should be counsel appointed, but not the statute.

    Mr. John E. Wilkinson 
    I would say it is less than half of what I work for. 
    There is a quite a bit of movement among the lawyers in the legislature to do something about that and I would suspect that over the course of time as they pay out more money for peace or contract architects and consulting engineers and things of that nature, that we attorneys will finally get paid a reasonable fee also. 
    Gideon versus Wainwright, I do not want to lose sight of that because I feel like the finding of the Three-Judge District Court was correct. 
    That if the statute was not to deter the accused from exercising basic rights, that it is needless. 
    It is not necessary. 
    For our democracy to work. 
    We must have a point of emphasize here. 
    A real finding that for the poor in a free society we must provide free counsel. 
    I do no believe that is asking too much of our society.

    Mr. John E. Wilkinson 
    Well I do not think that you can separate the two. 
    I believe a recoupment to be a, in this particular instance to be somewhat of a deterrent of the exercise of basic fundamental rights. 
    I want to adhere to that policy. 
    I feel that the recoupment provision is a means of control supposedly of holding down an accused, an indigent accused in exercising basic rights. 
    I firmly believe that.

    Mr. Wilkinson help me out on another aspect of deterrence. 
    Suppose that your client here Mr. Strange were not an indigent, but he was just above the indigency level and he had a fairly large family to support. 
    Do you think the fact of incurring legal fees to defend him in a criminal case might deter him from pleading not guilty and rather pushing him into pleading guilty to get it over with?

    Mr. John E. Wilkinson 
    Well as far as squaring the person who has eleven or, just above the poverty line, I think probably the best way that that is provided for in the statute is through the judge's interrogation as to finding out what this man has in the way of the family. 
    What his needs are and then after he is, after the judge has made this judicial determination of indigence then he is afforded free counsel. 
    I think it is within the judge, I do not think I am begging your question.

    Mr. John E. Wilkinson 
    Well I know that Mr. Judge Temper, my ex boss and I have similar case in Federal Court gave free counsel to the man who was making $13,000 a year, making a determination that he had ten children that it was more important for him to have a counsel in this case, free counsel in the Federal District Court case. 
    In the normal circumstance you would not determine that this man making that kind of money would be poverty stricken, but still in need of counsel and indigent in the legal sense I suppose and that is up to the judge to determine. 
    After that determination has been made I feel like it is in society's best interest to make it free and make these rights variable.

    Mr. John E. Wilkinson 
    When I filed -- I would say to some extent that is true. 
    When I filed this case I thought it was going to be a simple little matter because I have not given this person notice that a judgment was about to be rendered against him and neither did the magistrate judge and neither did the District Judge. 
    I thought I was going to be proceeding on the basis of due process notice and it was admitted in the stipulations of facts that there was no notice given to the indigent accused. 
    I did not contemplate that the court would keep this matter under advisement over a year and make a decision that later on the basis of some chilling effect.

    There is nothing in another in the notice that he had to -- there is nothing in the record that he'd ever have notice either and I do not want to lose Mr. David’s Stranger’s case. 
    I did not cross appeal. 
    I did not feel that it is necessary to cross appeal in a situation where there is a judgment may have been based on some wrong reasons and I bring this up in my motion to dismiss after the jurisdictional statement was filed. 
    Sure we go along with the chilling effect and I can understand that from my own experience but I -- that is not on this record, but no notice to this indigent accused is in this record.

    Yes and I think justifiable.

    Justice Byron R. White 
    You mean it is overbroad?

    Mr. John E. Wilkinson 
    [Laughter] Well, I think they consider this sort of a class action, accused in other similarly situated and they took into consideration if they had another case --

    Mr. John E. Wilkinson 
    That is right. 
    I would like to make one statement about fraudulent conveyances if you want to get talking about --
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="3447.355" stopTime="3449.158">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Was there any such problem in this case?
speaker="john_e_wilkinson" startTime="3449.158" stopTime="3630.657">
    Mr. John E. Wilkinson 
    No sir. 
    It would seem to me that it would be unnecessary for the state to have such statute if someone makes a fraudulent conveyance in these circumstances. 
    The state would have fraud practiced upon him and could exercise its common law remedy. 
    This is another thing Mr. Justice why they went into 3113 (b) which dealt with fraudulent conveyance that they declare the whole statute unconstitutional. 
    I was reading dealing this 3113 (a). 
    I did include them in my petition. 
    I included them both in my petition that the facts of the case only relate to 3113 (a), recodified as 4513 (a). 
    Regardless of what you find the situation to be with the Three-Judge District Court in making an overbroad decision I want to reiterate that their decision, that the decision of Gideon versus Wainwright is sound. 
    This statute tends to impede and infringe upon that decision, when you take into consideration that we were bringing it for as the District Court did, we were bringing it for the indigent accused, this particular indigent accused and other similarly situated, that this Three-Judge District Court was justified in finding on the basis of Gideon versus Wainwright that he must have free counsel in order to provide him with a basic fundamental right to counsel. 
    A necessary fundamental right to counsel, it is not in my estimation a right that needs any subtleties attached to it as this statute does. 
    I urge the court to uphold the decision of the Three-Judge District Court and to reiterate again that in this society, we need to provide free counsel to the indigent accused. 
    I thank you very much.

    Thank you Mr. Wilkinson, thank you Mr. Collister. 
    The case is submitted.
