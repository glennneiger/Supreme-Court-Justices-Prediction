    Mr. John T. Cabaniss 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    This case involves the constitutional rights of a criminal defendant in circumstances where he has been affected by a collateral use of prior convictions, presumably void under Gideon. 
    In this case, the collateral use was impeachment of testimonial credibility. 
    Loper was convicted in November of 1947 in Harris County Texas of the offense of statutory rape of his eight year old stepdaughter. 
    At his State Court trial, the prosecution's witness, the only one to identify Loper as the violator was Betty Fay Dorothy and she indicated he was guilty, he did it. 
    Otis Loper took the stand to testify in his own defense. 
    He denied complicity, denied guilt of the offense and on cross-examination, the State was allowed by the Court to elicit from him details regarding prior convictions that he had suffered in the States of Mississippi and Tennessee. 
    There were four prior felony convictions in all and the State brought out the details as to the term of those offenses, where they occurred, that they were all for burglary. 
    In the District Court the hearing below, evidence was introduced regarding these prior convictions. 
    This evidence consisted both of the testimony of Loper as for circumstances surrounding those convictions and also consisted of certified records that have been obtained from the Courts in those proceedings which reflected in most instances that the defendant had appeared in the person or he appeared in his own proper person or otherwise silent regarding the presence or absence of counsel. 
    It is Loper’s contention that the evidence thus introduced, un-contradicted by the State renders those convictions presumably void under the mandate of this Court in Gideon.

    Mr. John T. Cabaniss 
    I am, Your Honor on this basis. 
    Other Courts have indicated in similar circumstances that it seems where the defendant, the one who is convicted introduces testimony to the fact that he did not have counsel, was not represented by a counsel and then he introduces evidence to corroborate that testimony, in this case, certified records of the State Court proceeding, we would contend that those records are sufficient to carry his presumption that he in fact was not represented by a counsel and he had not waived his right to counsel. 
    And that the Trial Court’s action in disregarding that, the fact that the burden then shifted to the State to prove that he had waived counsel, we believe that cannot be upheld, that is out contention.

    I see.
speaker="john_t_cabaniss" startTime="314.389" stopTime="435.350">
    Mr. John T. Cabaniss 
    I will proceed to the question of Burgett. 
    We have – we had utilized Burgett in the District Court and in the Fifth Circuit without success. 
    We had contended throughout that the Burgett rationale applies to Mr. Loper’s circumstances and that the use against him of the prior void convictions to impeach his testimonial credibility was a violation of that rationale. 
    Now, the State contends and the Fifth Circuit has held that we go too far, that impeachment, that Burgett itself involved enhancement of punishment and that impeachment of testimonial credibility is not -- it goes only to credibility. 
    It is not merely so serious as enhancement which may add years of imprisonment to the sentence of a defendant. 
    But there are number of factors we have relied upon in asserting that Burgett is not so limited. 
    Most importantly, although Burgett did involve convictions of alleged in recidivist counts, it involved four prior convictions alleged and a Texas indictment. 
    The fact of the matter is that Burgett itself involved no enhanced punishment. 
    The evidence introduced indicated that the Texas conviction was void on its face. 
    It was -- as our (Inaudible) was never introduced, the Tennessee conviction, it was introduced in evidence, was held to be presumptively void. 
    The Court withdrew all evidence of those and instructed the jury not to consider the prior convictions for any purpose. 
    The defendant Burgett was convicted and he was sentenced to ten years imprisonment, the maximum for the offense involved was 25 years. 
    So we submit that the constitutional precept that was established was on the facts of Burgett, not one that was limited to a situation where enhancement occurred as the State and the Fifth Circuit would have us believe.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="435.350" stopTime="444.585">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Well, in the Burgett case what was the purpose of the introduction of the prior convections, let us forget the consequence for the moment, what was the purpose of their introduction?

    Mr. John T. Cabaniss 
    The purpose Your Honor was under recidivist counts.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="447.419" stopTime="448.867">

    Yes, to enhance the punishment.
speaker="john_t_cabaniss" startTime="448.867" stopTime="449.681">
    Mr. John T. Cabaniss 
    That is correct.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="449.681" stopTime="458.411">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Now, whether the jury did or did not apply it that way is as you suggest is really not the issue, is it?
speaker="john_t_cabaniss" startTime="458.411" stopTime="507.697">
    Mr. John T. Cabaniss 
    The point, I would make Your Honor though is it seems to me that in the absence of enhancement, the result in Burgett was that the jury was aware in its deliberations upon the primary substantive issue of guilt of four prior void convictions. 
    Now, what difference does it make if that was done under enhancement counts or if it was done to impeach the credibility of a witness who took the stand to testify in his own defense. 
    If the convictions were void and the jury is made aware of those convictions then rationale applies to permit a conviction obtained in violation of Gideon against Wainwright to be used against a person either to support guilt or enhance punishment for another offense is to erode the principle of that case.

    Mr. John T. Cabaniss 
    I believe that is the minimum in Texas for that offense.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="577.184" stopTime="587.517">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    So it is your submission that both branches of Burgett are involved here and those -- the finding of guilt and the imposition of the sentence, the enhancements of --
speaker="john_t_cabaniss" startTime="587.517" stopTime="702.317">
    Mr. John T. Cabaniss 
    The fact that it was harmful, that's what Your Honor. 
    To proceed with the fact of impeachment, Mr. Chief Justice has raised the point that they were in an enhancement context, but we have tried to pull it out that we have a criminal defender who takes the stand in his own behalf. 
    His credibility is a material factor to his guilt or innocence. 
    If his credibility is attacked by evidence of prior convictions that are void under Gideon, such that the guilt was not there reliably determined, the argument must be made that any conclusion of untruthfulness by a jury of the impeached witness is equally unreliable. 
    So it seems to us to follow that the impeachment evidence of that nature tends directly or indirectly to support guilt by causing the jury to disbelieve the testimony of Loper and then proceed along the lines where the prior void conviction is used for that purpose then the defendant clearly under Burgett suffers anew from the deprivation of that Sixth Amendment right. 
    Now we are supported in our conclusion as to the meaning of Burgett by a number of cases. 
    They are cited in the brief and they are applicable to impeachment not just enhancement situations, I note in particular Gilday against Scafati which one of the first to the First Circuit, was one of the first to -- its opinion is particularly lucid. 
    Also the Ninth Circuit in Tucker against United States, I note that this Court on Monday of this week, disposed of that case by remanding in a situation where the sentence had been, I wouldn't say enhanced, it was the maximum sentence, they had reversed because of the possibility of prejudice resulting from prior convictions there involved. 
    We are not disparaged by that case at all.

speaker="john_t_cabaniss" startTime="738.944" stopTime="748.418">
    Mr. John T. Cabaniss 
    The Ninth Circuit specifically decided that Burgett included impeachment, but did on the facts presented by that record to go on to determine that it was there harmless error.

speaker="john_t_cabaniss" startTime="750.531" stopTime="817.854">
    Mr. John T. Cabaniss 
    That is correct. 
    The State in its brief cites two cases that I must mention. 
    These cases are Harris against Nelson and Walder against United States. 
    These were impeachment cases and the State asserts that these can be relied upon as limiting the application of Burgett. 
    It should be kept in mind that this is not a case where the defense counsel is part of its trial strategy, interviews the invalid prior or interviews the prior convictions to soften the blow so to speak, that is often done nor is this a case for the record will show that Loper, to boast for his credibility denied that he had never been convicted of crime on direct examination. 
    The first time these convictions were brought out was by the State in its cross-examination and it is then on this basis that neither Harris nor Walder would conclude that Burgett would not apply to the impeachment context situation -- Harris and Walder were both concerned with situation of perjury.

    Mr. John T. Cabaniss 
    Mr. Chief Justice, I did not mean to imply that the testimony of the defendant as to those facts is all that is needed, I do not believe that is the case. 
    I am saying that in this instance, that was not all that was introduced. 
    The testimony that Loper gave which Judge Connelly discredited was, we would like to -- collaborated by the certified records introduced at the trial reflecting --
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="898.951" stopTime="908.226">

    Mr. John T. Cabaniss 
    No, Your Honor, well it is -- I am saying that it is corroboration. 
    The aspect is that we are not -- we do not have a record like Burgett had, one in which there were two versions of a conviction in Tennessee which were cited in one of them that the defendant -- the candidate's prosecutor and the defendant in person and without counsel and the second version being simply the defendant in person. 
    We do not have two entries involved here, but all of the entries involved, none of them recite that he appeared with counsel and it can be fairly inferred from at least one and perhaps others that the wording used reflects that he did not have counsel. 
    For example in the 1940 conviction the entry that would appear was -- came the district attorney who prosecutes for the State and came also the defendant in his own proper person, both of whom announced ready for trial.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="965.995" stopTime="994.405">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Well, is it possible that if we agreed, if we decided to the single question presented here in your favor, namely that a prior conviction now void under Gideon may not be used for impeachment? 
    Suppose that rule was established, could we decide this case, resolve this case without sending it back to have a determination of the status of those convictions, four prior convictions
speaker="john_t_cabaniss" startTime="994.405" stopTime="1190.808">
    Mr. John T. Cabaniss 
    Your Honor, under the principle that I have put forth a little bit earlier, I would admonish the Court that perhaps it could. 
    What I am suggesting is, is that although Judge Connelly discredited his testimony the rights involved here were spoken about in Burgett in no uncertain terms. 
    The records in this case are similar to the record that was introduced in trial in Burgett insofar as the in person aspect. 
    The records do not state one way or the other whether there was or was not counsel. 
    The Court might determine that in circumstances where the defendant has suffered this conviction has suffered impeachment or enhancement contrary to the dictates of Burgett and where he introduces in addition to his testimony records that are silent concerning either the existence of counsel being there or any waiver of counsel, if that is sufficient under the circumstances to shift to burden. 
    I was speaking about Harris and Walder. 
    I only pointed out that it seems to me they are distinguishable clearly as Mr. Chief Justice said in Harris, it does not follow from Miranda that evidence inadmissible on the prosecutions’ straight case in chief for all purposes provided of course that the trustworthiness of the evidence satisfies legal standards. 
    We would suggest that the Miranda violations there involved in the illegal search and seizure in Walder are different from the Sixth Amendment rights here involved with respect to the prior convictions which are inherently unreliable. 
    They are not trustworthy. 
    In addition the other basis of course is the fact that both of those cases, this is not one where Loper sought to commit perjury or he testified to try to boast his credibility of never having been convicted prior to that time, so that does not furnish a basis that no perjury was involved. 
    The State at one point has pointed out that this case should not be reversed for the -- from the standpoint that there was no prosecutorial misconduct involved here. 
    I was simply note in passing that I believe this issue is disposed of by Chief Justice Warren in his concurrence in Burgett in which he noted that it is not simply errors based upon misconduct that can be reviewed by this Court. 
    It is the effect of those errors whether well intention or not on the constitutionally protected the rights of the criminal defendant which is all we are concerned with here. 
    I would like to speak to the issue of the harmless of the error that was involved. 
    As I previously pointed out there were two and this is for the prosecution in this case, but the only testimony relied upon to establish Loper as the violator of this offense was that of the 8-year old child, Betty Faye Dorothy. 
    Loper took the stand --

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Are we concerned that the factual issue on that score now under the question, limited question of this grant?
speaker="john_t_cabaniss" startTime="1198.479" stopTime="1266.221">
    Mr. John T. Cabaniss 
    It seems to me Your Honor that the last part of that question whether use might well have influenced the outcome of the case, it occurred to me that that might indicate that the Court would consider whether or not in the circumstances here presented, the prior convictions introduced did in fact influenced the jury in its determination. 
    I am suggesting most certainly that they did. 
    It was a -- in essence it was a case that was built upon a credibility determination. 
    If the jury had believed Loper’s verdict of the facts that occurred that morning, they would have been compelled to acquitting. 
    They did not believe that they would have convicted him and in that background, the prejudice, the influence that resulted from introduction of the invalid priors before the jury that refers to the details of the offenses in that posture on cross-examination at that time, it seems to me that there is no way to conclude that the error involved was harmless error, that it was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.

    That is correct.

    The State apparently in its brief as to this latter point, the harmfulness of the error would argue that the State was only obligated to establish a prima facie case and it did so and that therefore there was no harmful error. 
    But in doing so it would also place the burden upon Loper to show that the error was harmless error or that is that was -- where burden proof is issued upon Otis Loper. 
    That as I construe the cases it is certainly not the case. 
    The State benefited from the transgression and accordingly, it has to prove to show that the tainted evidence that was introduced to the jury did not effect or influence the jury’s verdict.

    Mr. Robert Darden 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    The petitioner has misrepresented the question and issue presented to the Court now for review. 
    In the 1947 trial for rape, the State on cross-examination had Otis Loper to testify about four prior convictions. 
    Three in the State of Mississippi, one in the State of Tennessee and this was for impeachment purposes. 
    Now all four of these convictions have become final and there has never been any effort to set any of these cases aside. 
    These convictions were valid for all purposes and will remain valid until set aside by the proper closed conviction of state or federal proceedings.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="1442.188" stopTime="1446.639">

    Mr. Robert Darden 
    Your Honor, the -- getting to this in the District Court in 1969, the writ of habeas corpus that was filed was just to get relief from the 1947 Texas conviction.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well it bears on the point you are now making, does it not? 
    Maybe the overall decision does not apply, but in Burgett there - he had done nothing independently until he initiated the Burgett litigation to assert that the priors were invalid, is that not true or am I mistaken?

    Mr. Robert Darden

    Mr. Robert Darden 
    In that particular case, what I understand, this was used for enhancement and in order for them to bring in the original indictment, they also alleged the two or three priors which was a part of this proceeding. 
    In our case this was for impeachment purposes alone and it was not necessary to show, although that these were valid convictions. 
    And in the State of Texas, at that time it was permissible to impeach any witness that took the stand on prior convictions or indictment, information or complaint. 
    So in this particular case if they had only brought in the prior indictments which he would not have had an attorney either, we could have been impeached him in Texas in 1947.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well, if you read the Court of Appeals decision that was affirmed here this week by this Court and that held that the -- that decision of the Court of Appeals affirmed here, required that the case go back for re-sentencing because the sentencing body in that case, the judge had -- he gave consideration to prior convictions that were invalid under Gideon against Wainwright.

    Mr. Robert Darden 
    Of the -- yes sir. 
    What we are saying that Loper is trying to accomplish both from the lower courts and in this Court, well in the lower court is that this Court being petitioned to set aside the Texas conviction and the three Mississippi convictions and the one Tennessee conviction. 
    Respondent submits that this Court in considering this question presented by the petitioner must assume or they must void the Mississippi convictions, the Tennessee convictions and in order to reach the question presented. 
    The question presented and that which the Court has been requested to consider is purely hypothetical, there is no case in controversy involving the prior void convictions for impeachment purposes, the prior convictions involved were valid and remain so until set aside the proper proceeding. 
    Under the argument of appointment of counsel prior to Gideon versus Wainwright which was decided in 1963, the State of Tennessee and the State of Mississippi required appointment of counsel for indigents upon request and the record is silent in this case as to whether or not Loper was indigent and that the Court had knowledge of this and the record is silent as to whether or not he had made a request and that this request had been denied. 
    On the point of impeachment, Otis Loper took the stand to deny the assault. 
    He also denied that anything was wrong with the complaining witness, when he left for town and that if anything had happened to the complaining witness, this was done by the Maggie boy (ph). 
    In this, we feel that Harris versus New York is applicable in that when a defendant takes the stand to testify, he is to stay with the truth and be accurate. 
    Not only did Loper deny the assault, but it also gave an alibi that nothing was wrong with the complaining witness which we found not to be true on the testimony of Dr. Weber and also that if anything had happened such as the assault, it was the Maggie boy.

    Of course the Court of Appeals did not -- it's a little ambiguous, the Court of Appeal’s opinion, but the Court of Appeals did proceed to decide the legal question, did it not? 
    It just said we are not -- and we did -- we hold that these prior convictions even if invalid can be used for impeachment purposes?

    We might add under the impeachment, any time a witness takes the stand, his character is an issue. 
    The federal rule as I have said permitted prior convictions for impeachment purposes in Texas in 1947, permitted much further.

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    But Mr. Cabaniss though is raising perhaps some alternatively a narrower question and that is that in a case such as in Texas in 1947 where the jury imposes the sentence rather than the judge has in most of the jurisdictions, but in Texas in those circumstances, then the evidence of impeachment falls within the reach of what the Courts have said is not permitted, that it goes to enhance the punishment or at least he argues that no one can say that it did not increase the punishment?
speaker="robert_darden" startTime="2337.897" stopTime="2438.764">
    Mr. Robert Darden 
    We take the position that it did not, Mr. Chief Justice, based on the facts. 
    In their brief, they point out that only the eight-year old is the only one that implicated Otis Loper, the defendant. 
    Unfortunately, in these type of sex crimes there is only two people around, but she also testified that this is the same thing that he had done the year before when she was living with her grand parents in Alabama and that he threatened her and she did not tell them what had happened and finally told them that she had fallen on stick to hurt herself. 
    This is the testimony came out and with this along with the fact that he was not be, the jury has now that a prior offense had happened which could justify the 50 years. 
    Only thing he did was “no I did not do it,” but if it happened, the Maggie boy did it. 
    There is nothing in the record that shows that the Maggie boy was even present at that house on August of 1947 or that the boy was present that Friday before. 
    It is our position that he has not attacked or removed these convictions in the proper court by going back to the convicting court. 
    Therefore, the ruling in the State, I mean, in the Federal District Court and the Fifth Circuit should be upheld. 
   
   
   
   Rebuttal of John T. Cabaniss

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Thank you, Mr. Darden. 
    Mr. Cabaniss do you have anything further?
speaker="john_t_cabaniss" startTime="2445.294" stopTime="2508.503">
    Mr. John T. Cabaniss 
    One thing, Mr. Chief Justice. 
    I want to correct what may have been a misimpression or maybe I am not reading the Court correctly. 
    You have spoken about sending the matter back for re-sentencing which appears to me to be an indication of limiting the concept to Burgett to one which in fact is restricted to the situation of enhanced or increased punishment. 
    As I have tried to indicate, I read Burgett more broadly than that and it appears to me that re-sentencing would not be satisfactory in a circumstance where the invalid tainted evidence introduced might have affect to not only the sentencing of Otis Loper, but also his conviction of guilt on the primary offense. 
    It seems to me in that posture that the required relief is not re-sentencing, but avoidance of the conviction and I simply wanted to bring that - -that point forward in case I have not made myself clear.
