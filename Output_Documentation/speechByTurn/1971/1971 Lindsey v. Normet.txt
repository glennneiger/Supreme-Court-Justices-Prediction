    Mr. John H. Clough 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    This is an appeal from a three-judge court’s denial of injunctive and declaratory relief, sought by Donald and Edna Lindsey on behalf of themselves and the class of appellants, including all tenants in the State of Oregon. 
    The Lindsey’s attack to constitutionality of Oregon’s Eviction Law, seeking to enjoin its enforcement of it is objectionable provisions by appellee judges. 
    The Lindseys had been having difficulties in getting there landlord, appellee Normet to repair the condition of their home which condition included lack of plaster, downstairs toilet out of order, missing rear steps, etcetera. 
    Since pictures are better than words, we specifically refer the Court to the color photographs in evidence marked as plaintiff’s exhibits number 25 to 37 in the record.

    Mr. John H. Clough 
    No, they are not. 
    They were unable to print them because they were color photographs, Your Honor. 
    On November 10, 1969, their home had been condemned by the Bureau of Building Inspections of the City of Portland because of the violation of Portland’s Housing and Building Codes. 
    Since Donald Lindsey was substantially confined to a wheelchair with crippling arthritis of both arms and legs and neither he nor his wife could drive a car, they did not have the mobility to search for another home. 
    Furthermore, their search would have been rendered more difficult by the factor that the overall vacancy rate for Portland was less than 2% and for low income families less than 1%.

    Low-income housing is that which has rents within the financial reach of a typical family of four whose income is from $0-4,000.00 a year. 
    In Portland, an estimated 75% of low income families rent, but Lindsey’s home was a low-income home. 
    Most housing available for low-income families is quite often substandard and the condition is generally very poor in Portland. 
    Low-income people pay a higher portion of their monthly income for rent and generally pay higher utility in heating bills because of deficiencies in plumbing, insulation and wiring.

    Mr. John H. Clough 
    Yes, it is Your Honor. 
    The last statement, Mr. Justice Blackmun was in the deposition of Josephine Brown, our expert which is admitted into evidence and as plaintiff's exhibit number 24 at page 26. 
    Low-income people generally have a difficult time finding a place because of the advance month’s rent for cleaning deposits often required. 
    After the request to the landlord to repair these conditions and no action was forthcoming, they decided to attempt to improve their lot where they lived and withheld their rent on December 1, 1969 to compel their landlord to repair the premises.

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    At anytime in the course of these proceedings was there a tender of the rent into the custody of the Court?
speaker="john_h_clough" startTime="295.247" stopTime="312.666">
    Mr. John H. Clough 
    The Court had the option and the Court preferred -- the tender was offered at the institution of the proceedings and the court preferred that we as their attorneys keep the money in our escrow account and specifically condition to temporary restraining order based upon that.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="312.666" stopTime="317.755">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Well, then it was really in the custody of the Court because you were holding it as an officer of the Court?
speaker="john_h_clough" startTime="317.755" stopTime="390.531">
    Mr. John H. Clough 
    That is correct. 
    On December 15, 1969, they were sent a letter from their landlord’s attorney demanding them to pay rent or vacate. 
    At this point, they were faced with the realities of having an eviction action filed against them, pursuant to the statute under attack in this appeal. 
    There was no question that an eviction would cause the Lindseys irreparable harm. 
    Evictions of low-income families often result in a continuing downward and tightening spar which they find an emotional block to overcome. 
    They do not have the cost of moving and they cannot find housing. 
    They are often forced into less adequate housing. 
    They lose standing in the community and in their children’s eyes and large families are often split up. 
    In this background, this action was filed in the Federal District Court prior to any eviction action being filed by the Lindsey’s landlord. 
    The best way to describe the operation of the eviction statute is by taking the Lindseys through their eviction, had one been filed by their landlord. 
    A complaint and summons would be filed and served upon the Lindseys, setting the time for trial within two to four days which may include weekends.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="390.531" stopTime="392.232">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    But this did not actually happen to the Lindseys?
speaker="john_h_clough" startTime="392.232" stopTime="392.748">
    Mr. John H. Clough 
    No.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="392.748" stopTime="398.379">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    They filed this action to the District Court before alleging that they were threatened with this, is that right?
speaker="john_h_clough" startTime="398.379" stopTime="519.217">
    Mr. John H. Clough 
    That is correct. 
    I am using the Lindseys as what would happen to describe the operation of the statute. 
    For example, they could be served on a Friday with a trial set on Monday or Tuesday. 
    However, two days is all the time for trial that the tenant has a matter of right. 
    Within this time, they would have to contact the lawyer, make an appointment and get him to take the case. 
    His first move would be to ask for continuance and all that he could get without posting cash security would be two days, the granting of which is only the discretionary under the statute. 
    Even though that defenses that Lindseys would like to raise would not be heard by the Oregon Courts because of the statute he is challenging. 
    He might still have conventional defenses based upon issues of fact, regarding what rent was agreed to or if it were truly paid. 
    Litigation of these issues may well require interviewing potential witnesses, subpoenaing them, legal research and trial preparation. 
    At trial, Lindsey would want to raise defenses based upon his landlord’s refusal to obey the housing codes, but these defenses will not be heard or adjudicated on their merits. 
    The reason for this is found on the face of the Oregon statutes. 
    They provide that the landlord’s complaint is sufficient as it states: (1) A description of the premises, (2) That the defendant is in possession, (3) That the defendant unlawfully holds by force which is deemed to include failure to pay rent within 10 days after it is due,and (4) that the landlord is entitled to possession. 
    The statute goes on to provide that if the Court or Jury finds the complaint to be true, the tenants shall be evicted. 
    Thus, these statutes on their face preclude the raising of affirmative legal defenses and they have been so construed by the Oregon Courts.

    Mr. John H. Clough 
    The last time that the FED, the eviction law was changed in any matter was in 1909, although the case of Friedenthal v. Thompson goes into a historical analysis where they were in effect back in the middle 1800s.
speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="540.032" stopTime="545.732">

    There has been an effort yes, Mr. Justice Blackmun.
speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="550.266" stopTime="579.201">
    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    I just wonder if one could say that possession of the premises during the controversy such as you envision here with the Lindsey’s is a matter at issue and that your legislature has come down on the side of the landlord rather than the side of the tenant in deciding a policy question? 
    I take it you do not agree with that?
speaker="john_h_clough" startTime="579.201" stopTime="581.681">
    Mr. John H. Clough 
    No, I do not, Mr. Justice Blackmun.
speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="581.681" stopTime="588.081">
    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    But do you for the first time in the century are raising question?
speaker="john_h_clough" startTime="588.081" stopTime="630.569">
    Mr. John H. Clough 
    The question has been raised, Mr. Justice Blackmun in several cases that have gone up to the Oregon Supreme Court on various aspects. 
    So that for example Friedenthal v. Thompson involved the constrictions on limitations of time. 
    There were several cases that sought to raise equitable types of offenses and these were interpreted by Oregon Supreme Court. 
    The double rent bond on appeal has been construed by the Oregon Supreme Court and been upheld as constitutional. 
    Legal defenses had been specifically disallowed by the Oregon Supreme Court.
speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="630.569" stopTime="636.386">
    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    Of course you could have resolved this dilemma by appropriate legislation, could you not?
speaker="john_h_clough" startTime="636.386" stopTime="722.526">
    Mr. John H. Clough 
    Of course, that would be a very welcome response, but the legislature of Oregon has not seen as to do so and our -- one of the main lines of attack that we have here on the statute is due process which -- that does not matter that the statute either procedural like constricts the courts and the litigants so that the it dives in due process or it does not. 
    Well, that is true of any statute. 
    Any statute could be changed at any given time by state legislature. 
    Under the Oregon statutes, the fact that the tenant may would have withheld rent because the landlord failed to make proper repairs or the fact that the landlord brought the action in retaliation for the tenant having recorded code violations to a city agency or complaint to the landlord or even the fact that the action is brought because of the tenant’s raise. 
    Those facts are not only considered irrelevant, they are not even heard. 
    These defenses are not judged on their merits. 
    They are not even heard and are stricken. 
    At the conclusion of the trial, if the tenant looses and desires to remain in the premises, pending the appeal to the Circuit Court, he must post an open-ended double rent bond to guarantee twice the amount of the rent to be paid from the inception of the action until final determination by the Appellate Court.

    Mr. John H. Clough 
    Yes, we would have no problems with that whatsoever. 
    The double rent bond on appeal is in addition to the usual cost bond. 
    This bond may be filed as a cash bond, personal bond or for maturity bond, in any event with two sureties. 
    It is open ended and may last for a month or a year. 
    Within five days after the posting of the bond, the landlord can require justification of the sureties by their presence in court. 
    At the conclusion of the appeal, if the tenant loses, the landlord simply executes on the bond or if the money has been paid into court, upon the filing of the order, it is simply dispersed. 
    The landlord collects the entire amount of the bond, not just to the damages or expenses if any. 
    If the tenant loses at the Circuit Court, he may appeal to the State Supreme Court and the same process is again repeated. 
    We are challenging the three-major restrictions on the low-income tenant’s ability to properly defend himself in Oregon. 
    These are; first, the short time to prepare for trial, (2) The refusal of the Court to hear his defenses and (3) the denial of his ability to appeal because of the double rent bond requirement. 
    We contend that these restrictions violate both the equal protection and Due Process Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment because they affect certain fundamental interests of the tenant. 
    The first of these fundamental interests is his right to retain peaceful possession of his home or the sanctity of the home. 
    Second, is his right to decent housing. 
    Third, his right to meaningful access to and equal treatment in the courts. 
    While all of these interests has been treated as fundamental by this Court in various decisions, the right to retain peaceful possession of once home has received the most attention, from the Court being protected under the Third, Fourth, Fifth, Ninth and Fourteenth Amendments. 
    For example in Silverman versus United States at 365 U.S., this Court rejected evidence obtained by the use of spiked mike which intruded several inches under the wall of the defendant’s home as it would have obtained by “actual intrusion” into a constitutionally protected area. 
    In Camara versus Municipal Court at 387 U.S., this Court held that a warrant must be obtained before homes can be inspected by City Agencies. 
    And in Rowan versus United States Post Office Department, this Court upheld in the face of the First Amendment attack, a statute protecting householders from junk mail intrusions. 
    If this Court has found the sanctity of the home to be worthy of constitutional protection against these sporadic intrusions, how much more worthy a protection is the right to be free from a total ousting of possession? 
    Total ousting by the County Sheriff is what faces the tenant who looses an eviction action in Oregon. 
    It is almost inevitable under the procedures we are challenging. 
    In addition, certain of the restrictions, we are dealing with involve a suspect classification, one based upon wealth, since indigent tenants do not have the resources to post either the continuance bond or the double rent appeal bond. 
    We do not feel that we are asking for anything unreasonable in this case. 
    We fully recognize that there are certain interests of the landlord that the State of Oregon may reasonably protect, if it wishes to do so. 
    The main interest meant to be protected by the restrictions we are challenging is the landlord's desire to see that he will not lose rent money, he may have come into it during the litigation, that he eventually might win. 
    Statutes designed to protect this interest should be constitutional if they are reasonable, but the restrictions involved here go too far. 
    They are unreasonable at the expense of the tenant’s interests in protecting his home. 
    We can understand, for example, shortening the time to prepare for trial on eviction action to something less than that available to other defendants. 
    But only two days as a matter of right is so short as to make the mockery of the judicial system.

   Argument of Theodore B. Jensen

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Very well. 
    Mr. Jensen.
speaker="theodore_b_jensen" startTime="1617.463" stopTime="1994.163">
    Mr. Theodore B. Jensen 
    Mr. Chief Justice and members of the Court. 
    I am appearing here for the defendant, Mrs. Normet. 
    The factual situation in the case actually as we see it was that Mrs. Normet was the record owner of the property, but had become so with an outstanding contract of sale on the property to a party who had in turn rented the property to the Lindseys. 
    When Mrs. Normet on default on this contract under which the property had been sold and more or less had been abandoned by the contract purchaser. 
    Mrs. Normet had begin to collect and she did receive the rent payments from the Lindseys up through November, applied them on the contract of sale and commenced a suit to foreclose the contract in order to clear up the title of the property. 
    Then in November, the City of Portland, under its Housing Code, notified both the Lindseys, they being the tenants and Mrs. Normet that the property was substandard in a good many respects and posted a notice that the property be vacated or the repairs made. 
    At that point Mrs. Normet through her attorney gave a notice to the Lindseys requesting them to vacate the property in accordance with order of the city of Portland. 
    She not wanting to go ahead and spend the money which would be required to make the repairs because of the existing cloud on the title of the property at that particular time. 
    Now, the Trial Court made a finding that there was a landlord-tenant relationship between Mrs. Normet and the Lindsey’s and treated it as though it were an ordinary landlord-tenant relationship. 
    In this case, we view the summary of the argument and briefs of the appellant that they are saying on two grounds that the Oregon Eviction Statutes are unconstitutional because they do not grant equal protection and due process at law and that it deprived tenants of rights and privileges afforded to them in the civil eviction actions in Oregon by denying basic rights needed to enable them to receive fundamentally fair hearings on their defenses. 
    Now, I would like first of all to direct my remarks to the Oregon Eviction Law briefly. 
    First of all, the Oregon Eviction Law is only available or is only used when there exist a landlord-tenant relationship. 
    It does not apply in any other situation. 
    It protects, our position is that it protects all tenants equally. 
    It does not make any distinction as to what their funds may be that they have available to them whether they are rich or poor. 
    It just applies and gives equal protection to all tenants. 
    If the tenants, first of all, we have no self-help procedure in Oregon that is where the landlord can go in and evict the tenant himself. 
    If he wants to evict a tenant from the property he has to go in to the Court and get a determination that he has the right to take possession from the tenant. 
    He can do this, if the tenant has failed to pay the rent within 10 days after due or if the tenant’s lease has expired and the tenant has refused to get out or if the tenant’s month-to-month or what tenancy or whatever the term is has been terminated upon either 30 days notice or if it is a longer tenancy where than on a notice equivalent to the term and then if a tenant refuses to vacate, the landlord must in order to have a determination then of his right to take possession, he must go in and file a complaint in court, setting forth, it is kind of a notice sort of a complaint, at least the equivalent of the Federal rules requirements, in which he in effect says that the tenant is withholding the premises unlawfully and with force and that the landlord is entitled to possession. 
    That is the only issue in the FED case at that point in the complaint.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1994.163" stopTime="2008.455">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    As I understand it, under Oregon Law the landlord is not permitted to join with FED complaint, any other claim eg a claim for the payment background or anything, is that correct?
speaker="theodore_b_jensen" startTime="2008.455" stopTime="2023.446">
    Mr. Theodore B. Jensen 
    Mr. Justice that is correct and if he does join, he can join an action for rent if he wishes to do so or for any other action that might be joinable under our statute.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2023.446" stopTime="2024.159">

    But then if he does?
speaker="theodore_b_jensen" startTime="2024.159" stopTime="2031.933">
    Mr. Theodore B. Jensen 
    But if he does then the FED procedure is not followed, the summary procedure is not followed --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2031.933" stopTime="2032.650">

    Yes.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    This summary procedure will no longer take place?
speaker="theodore_b_jensen" startTime="2082.657" stopTime="2288.649">
    Mr. Theodore B. Jensen 
    That is correct Mr. Justice. 
    As a matter of practice, in most FED cases the simple landlord-tenant relationship of rental of a residence on a month-to-month basis file just for possession without joining any rent or any other cause of action with it. 
    Now, I think the Court should realize that the FED Eviction Laws of Oregon apply not only to the rental of residences, but it applies and is available and used in connection with commercial properties where there is a lease for example and the tenant has refused to vacate at the end of the lease with most leasers providing that if they hold over at the end of the term, then they are month-to-month tenants, then you will have to give a 30-day notice and bring your FED action. 
    But you can see that in cases involving commercial property where the tenant may find a tremendous financial advantage to him to remain in a particular property for another year or so, it would be a unfair to permit him to stay in just by continuing to pay his rent if the landlord has given him the 30 days notice and his lease term is over. 
    Now, we have personal service in Oregon of the summons in complaint on the tenant and the summons provides that the matter will come before the Court and the return made from two to four days, the day of service is not counted. 
    So, it comes up then before the Court at that time. 
    There need not be any written answer filed. 
    We have procedure in the Oregon Law which grants to the defendant tenant two more days continuance for without any showing of any kind. 
    He can have an additional two days continuance and then if that is not a sufficient amount and he wishes to have a further continuance that can be obtained by posting security for the payment of his rent. 
    That may -- to cover the period of the time for the continuance that he wants, in other words, the practical aspect of that is that he does not have to go back and pay his delinquent rent, that is not an issue in the case. 
    It is possession and if he wants to remain in possession and get a continuance of the case for more time for preparation or for whatever the reason may be, he can do so from a practical aspect by paying the month’s rent and that would give him a 30-day extension of time.

    We have personal service but you can have substituted service by publishing, there could be a publishing which if the person is concealed within the state or is outside the state and his location is not known, but in support of that there would have to be an affidavit, prepared and filed which contained facts, sufficient to show that there had been a reasonable search made for the party before the publication of the summons.

    So we do not have what is called conspicuous service or so-called sewer service as I notice in the amicus curiae briefs, they have in New York and Florida. 
    We do not have that.

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Alright. 
    We resume after lunch now, Mr. Jensen.[Lunch break] 
    Mr. Jensen, you may proceed with your argument, you have about 13 minutes remaining.
speaker="theodore_b_jensen" startTime="2646.068" stopTime="3111.374">
    Mr. Theodore B. Jensen 
    Mr. Chief Justice and members of the Court. 
    The Oregon Eviction procedure does not deprive either the tenant or the landlord of the right to assert other claims they may have under the General Court Procedure which is available to all. 
    In other words, they have open to them the General Court procedure for litigating any other claims that they may have against each other arising out of the rent agreement or the rent contract. 
    Now, the appellants seem to argue here that all defendants should be treated equally and that it is wrong to have a separate eviction procedure to determine possession of rented property between the landlord and tenant. 
    In support of that, they compare a mortgage foreclosure case with an FED case under the Oregon Law and then say that since the procedure is different that the tenant defendants in a FED case do not receive equal protection or the same protection as an owner of real property whose mortgages being foreclosed and claim that therefore the eviction or FED procedure is unconstitutional. 
    Certainly there is a vast difference between the owner of real property who is delinquent in the payment of a mortgage and a tenant who does not pay his rent. 
    It seems to me, that we certainly would not require a landlord, first to obtain a judgment for the rent and then hold some sort of a judicial sale to evict the tenant, terminating his right to possession of the property perhaps even with some redemption rights following the order have some sort of a strict foreclosure proceeding which would grant the tenant some period of time to pay up his delinquency before the landlord could retake possession of his property from a defaulting tenant. 
    I submit that the summary eviction procedures justify because of the intending rights existing in a landlord-tenant relationship and the Oregon Eviction Law grants equal protection to all landlord and tenants. 
    The State of Oregon has the right to establish by legislative enactment a summary procedure to determine the issue of possession between landlords and tenants and that is what it has done with its statute and laws. 
    Now, I would like to make a comment or two with regard to the amicus curiae briefs that were filed in this case primarily to make the point that the Oregon Eviction Laws do provide due process to tenants in compliance with the United States Constitution. 
    First of all, we have no self-help provision in Oregon for the landlord as there are in Arkansas and Arizona under their unlawful detainer statutes which require some sort of a bond from the tenant to keep possession prior to trial. 
    Before the landlord in Oregon can take any steps towards recovering possession he has to file and commence a case in Court under the eviction statute, filing a complaint. 
    We do not have what is called conspicuous service or so-called sewer service in Oregon as they apparently have in New York and Florida. 
    Oregon requires personal service or the same service as in any other litigation in the Oregon Courts. 
    We do not permit an oral complaint as in Kentucky. 
    Oregon requires a written complaint filed in a summons issue and we permit continuances. 
    We do not refuse to grant a continuance as in New Hampshire. 
    Oregon grants a two-day continuance without any cause on request and an unlimited continuance if security posted for the rent which may be found due during the continuance period. 
    In other words, you can pay rent, pay your current rent and get a 30-day continuance. 
    In Kentucky, it permits, in amicus curiae brief, there is a statement that there is the trial as before the Court not presided over by judges. 
    Oregon Courts are all presided over by legally trained judges and jury trial on request. 
    Oregon does not allow in the FED eviction, the landlord to recover both possessions and judgment of money damages as in the California and New Hampshire States. 
    In Oregon, if you join the rent claim or any other claim that you have then you have to make the usual service as you would in other cases and it proceeds accordingly. 
    Oregon in some states in referring primarily to California observed from the amicus curiae brief that they allow the FED, the eviction procedure to be used by the purchaser at an execution mortgage foreclosure to recover possession, I suppose after the sale of the property at sheriff sale, if the former owner does not voluntarily surrender possession of the property. 
    And they also allow it to be used to recover possession under and after a trustee's sale under a trustee’s deed to evict the former owner. 
    Oregon has no such statute. 
    Our eviction statute is related and confined entirely to the landlord-tenant relationship. 
    Oregon does not deny defenses to be raised in eviction proceedings as in Arizona. 
    We permit in Oregon equitable defenses, relevant to the right of possession are allowed. 
    Oregon does not require a bond to appeal covering the past, present, and future rent as in Vermont and New York. 
    The bond in Oregon on appeal, the tenant wishes to remain in possession is for twice the rental value only for the period -- only for the period from commencement of action to final judgment. 
    Also, and --

    What is the purpose of double rent?
speaker="theodore_b_jensen" startTime="3116.428" stopTime="3149.553">
    Mr. Theodore B. Jensen 
    The purpose of that is stated in the case of Scales versus Spencer decided by the Oregon Supreme Court in 1967, in which it said that in as much as a final judgment for restitution could not include a judgment for rent, pending appeal, it appears obvious that the legislative purpose for requiring this particular bond on appeal was the guarantee that the rent pending on appeal would be paid.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="3149.553" stopTime="3151.302">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    It is double?
speaker="theodore_b_jensen" startTime="3151.302" stopTime="3183.625">
    Mr. Theodore B. Jensen 
    That the bond must provide for double the rental value was no doubt intended to prevent frivolous appeals for the purpose of delay. 
    If there were not some added cost or restriction, every ousted tenant would appeal regardless of the justification. 
    It can also be assumed that the additional payment would compensate for ways or is in lieu of damages or the unlawful holding over.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="3183.625" stopTime="3190.470">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Is there any other provision in Oregon Law that requires double the amount?

    Mr. Theodore B. Jensen 
    No, there is not Mr. Justice. 
    If the tenant wants to appeal and remain in possession then the Oregon Eviction Law provides for the double rent bond. 
    If he surrenders possession and wants to appeal which was done in the Priester-Thrall case which is cited in the briefs, then he does not have to put up the double rent bond. 
    He would put up the bond provided for in the usual undertaking section of the Oregon statute which would be for --

speaker="theodore_b_jensen" startTime="3292.925" stopTime="3367.612">
    Mr. Theodore B. Jensen 
    Yes, our position with regard to that is that to permit the tenant to remain in possession by just continuing to pay just the rent would mean that he could stay in for a year probably or longer depending on how long it took the case to progress through the courts and that would point out that he could do that, if the landlord, now this applies, the eviction procedure applies not just to delinquent rent cases, but it applies where the landlord might want to take the property will say off the market. 
    Maybe he has other use that he wishes to put to the property to. 
    Maybe he wants to have it occupied by some member of his own family. 
    In other words, our position is that there are rights in the landlord in his properties and he is entitled to that protection and if you do not preserve or protect the rights of a landlord then you would be depriving him of his property rights without some due process.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Mr. Jensen, Judge Goodwin in his opinion for this three-judge District Court referred to this appeal on provision as the to quote him “perhaps the most difficult question in this case” and the statute provides for the posting of the bond for double the amount of rent that will accrue pending the appeal. 
    How can you tell, how much that will be?

    But it is up to the Court and in many cases the Court the answering party questions, would question the sureties, if they are personal sureties, but that does not mean that he would have a right to discredit them if they qualified.

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Thank you Mr. Jensen.

    Mr. John H. Clough 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    I have just few comments. 
    Contrary to the apprehensions here that had been cast, we still need time to prepare for conventional defenses and we still maintain that the two-day time limit as a matter of right is too short to even prepare for those such as to find out the issues as to what rent is agreed to. 
    They may need witnesses to testify as to whether or not rent is in fact been paid or whether rent receipts are available and in connection with that, the attorney still has to ascertain whether or not there is in fact a valid defense and he needs more time in order to do that. 
    The third point is regarding the joining of the action for rent and FED under -- in our brief at page 48 footnote 13, we have cited two statutory provisions which provide that the action for rent can be joined with an FED, but at that point the case is severed and the action for rent proceeds as any other lawsuit with the FED proceeding close forward. 
    The fourth point is the -- I would refer the Court to plaintiff’s exhibit number 14 which is the letter sent to the Lindseys by the Normet’s attorney. 
    It speaks for itself regarding whether not it threatens eviction. 
    Essentially, all that appellants are asking for is a chance to be able to change the law in Oregon. 
    We do not ask this Court to change any substantive rule of law. 
    That is for the Courts of Oregon to do and that is for them to use the principles of the common law and develop, we will seek to have them adopt the consumer protection principles that have been analogize to landlord- tenant law in other jurisdictions which they are free to do absent the statute So we are essentially asking for chance.

    That the ability to raise defenses would still remain and the double-rent bond on appeal and the continuance bond.

    We have the Oregon cases that are listed in the brief, Scales v. Spencer and Priester v. Thrall specifically dealing with the double-rent bond on appeal and describe how it operates. 
    The other types of cases are appeals that have been taken, but quite effectively it does preclude almost any right to appeal and most of those cases involve commercial leases, not residential leases.

    Mr. John H. Clough 
    Scales v. Spencer, Priester v. Thrall involve the double-rent bond on appeal. 
    Friedenthal v. Thompson involves the time limitations and the ability to raise an equitable defense. 
    There the equitable defense plus of the nature of asserting oral modification of a subsequent modification of a written lease. 
    Topco v. Florida, Leathers v. Peterson, Sher v. Williams are similar types of cases, but that is it and Menefee Lumber Company versus Abrams those cases.

speaker="john_h_clough" startTime="3937.344" stopTime="4015.763">
    Mr. John H. Clough 
    Those cases reveal it and an analysis of the statute. 
    You see the case -- the cases involving raising an equitable, the so-called equitable matter do not operate as a stay per se of the eviction action. 
    They must then proceed to determine whether or not those, the issues raised would operate to stay. 
    In other words, the example of Leathers versus Peterson, the question was whether or not there was deed or a mortgage in conveyance of the land near the parties, we are dealing of less than arms length. 
    There is a question of fraud and the inducement. 
    Well, if did operate as a mortgage as opposed to a deed then there would not be any validity to using the FED action. There would be another action that would have to be available. 
    So it goes to item four on the allegations to complaint and that is whether or not the landlord has the right to possession and what we are dealing with is item three which explicitly says, if the rent has not been paid within 10 days after it comes due, that is it. 
    It is cut-off right there. 
    He says yes but and no more defenses in the Oregon Courts. 
    It just seeks if there are chances are.
