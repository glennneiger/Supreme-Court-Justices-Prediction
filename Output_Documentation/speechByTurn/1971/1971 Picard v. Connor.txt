Picard v. Connor

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    First in No. 96, Picard against Connor. 
    Mr. Irwin, you may proceed whenever you are ready.

    Mr. John J. Irwin, Jr. 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    I would respectfully ask that five minutes of the time allotted to me for argument be reserved for a rebuttal. 
    This case is here on the Commonwealth’s petition for certiorari. 
    The Court of law found that a Massachusetts charging procedure that permitted a grand jury to indict with a fictitious name and permitted a Court thereafter to substitute a true name was in fact violative of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="73.765" stopTime="76.934">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Is that the only issue in the case?
speaker="john_j_irwin_jr" startTime="76.934" stopTime="259.190">
    Mr. John J. Irwin, Jr. 
    That to me is the overriding issue, the Commonwealth takes the position that in addition to the Equal Protection argument, there is also an exhaustion argument, and there is also a question of whether or not a purely state procedural Statute should be the subject matter of the review by way of a petition for a writ of habeas corpus. 
    But in answer to your question Mr. Chief Justice, I would say that the overriding argument that we want to make and stress upon the Court is the Equal Protection argument. 
    The Suffolk County grand jury and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts on August 4th 1965, returned a first degree murder indictment charging two people. 
    They charged, one Donald Landry, which in fact was a true name, and it also charged that a John Doe was also accused, guilty of the murder of one Robert Davis. 
    The defendant or the respondent here, James J. Connor, was later on August 9th 1965 on a motion under General Laws Chapter 277, Section 19, filed by the prosecutor was named on the Court docket as the true named defendant and the John Doe indictment was changed to read, James J. Connor. 
    The defendant seasonably objected to that on the ground that he had an absolute constitutional right to be indicted in his own name. 
    That as far as the record indicates was his sole basis for objection at that particular time. 
    That motion was directed to Chief Justice Tauro of the Massachusetts Superior Court, who is presently the Chief Justice of the Supreme Judicial Court of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. 
    The Chief Justice was asked under the provisions of General Laws Chapter 277, Section 19 which reads as follows to make the substitution: "If the name of an accused person is unknown to the grand jury, he may be described by a fictitious name or by any other practicable description, with an allegation that his real name is unknown. 
    An indictment of the defendant by a fictitious or erroneous name shall not be ground for abatement; but if at any subsequent stage of the proceedings, his true name is discovered, it shall be entered on the record and may be used in the subsequent proceedings, with a reference to the fact that he was indicted by the name or description mentioned in the indictment."

speaker="john_j_irwin_jr" startTime="472.460" stopTime="653.865">
    Mr. John J. Irwin, Jr. 
    They appealed their conviction to the Supreme Judicial Court of the Commonwealth. 
    And the Supreme Judicial Court of the Commonwealth was again asked to confront itself or decide the issue raised by this particular Statute, 277, Section 19. 
    The Court there reaffirmed its prior decision in the Commonwealth v. Gedzium. 
    There the Court suggested that this alternative charging procedure was in fact a valid state interest, a valid state procedure and was in fact in conformity with all of the constitutional requirements placed upon procedural statutes and that the particular statute itself in no way violated Equal Protections of the law, because it required the Court to stand between the accused and the prosecutor before this particular change on the indictment could be made. 
    And it seems to me that the Court below makes a significant argument and puts significant stress on a fact that this type of statute would allow a prosecutor to arbitrarily or for some other unworthy reason substitute the name of a person not otherwise meant to be inserted. 
    The Court in the Gedzium case said, and I think this is significant with reference to the Equal Protection argument, the Court said that the trial justice before he allows a motion under this statute must make “the requisite findings” and also, must make an independent determination that no defendant is injured by such substitution. 
    We have to assume then that the Massachusetts Court itself through its construction of General Laws Chapter 277, Section 19 has imposed upon the Court a burden of finding cause or probable cause that the person, whose name is ought to be substituted for that of John Doe, must be in fact be the one that the grand jury intended. 
    And that no injustice is done to him by such substitution. 
    We respectfully suggest that their construction placed on that statute by the Massachusetts Court corrects any possible infirmity with reference to the Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution of the United States.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="653.865" stopTime="659.444">
    Unknown Speaker 
    On what does the Trial Judge act in making that determination? 
    Do they have a hearing or --
speaker="john_j_irwin_jr" startTime="659.444" stopTime="726.272">
    Mr. John J. Irwin, Jr. 
    What he has done in this instance and here again we have to -- the Commonwealth has to make an analogy between the grand jury function and the function of the Court. 
    The grand jury function in Massachusetts is conducted of course in secret. 
    It is Ex parte; the prosecutor does not of right have the ability to be present at their deliberations. 
    They can conduct their deliberations without him and traditionally the Massachusetts grand jury has the power to call upon the Court to assist it in the performance of his duty and to serve as its agent for advise to the grand jury and if need be for protection of the grand jury. 
    So, our argument is that this particular statute, as it has been construed, empowers the Court or the Trial Justice to whom this motion is presented to place himself in the capacity as an agent for the grand jury. 
    And then, to conduct this hearing Ex parte to hear whatever evidence he feels is required, under the Gedzium case, to make the requisite findings.

    Mr. John J. Irwin, Jr. 
    That we do not know Mr. Justice Brennan, because the preceding was un-transcribed and how the Chief Justice reached the decision with reference to this particular amendment has never been litigated. 
    And, there again getting back to argument of exhaustion as we make reference to it in our brief and I intend into my argument, it seems to me that that particular issue could have been litigated on the question of exhaustion in sending the case back to the State Court.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="758.437" stopTime="787.542">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Perhaps I misunderstood you about what you said, the ruling in Gedzium is that there must be this determination that in fact the person, whose name is now to be substituted, is the person that the grand jury intended to indict. 
    Is that right? 
    And you said that under Gedzium that determination must be made by the -- Trial Justice has to make the amendment.

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr.

    Mr. John J. Irwin, Jr. 
    Yes it is, Mr. Justice Brennan. 
    We recognized of course, that if a state confers a benefit, such as Massachusetts does with reference to indictment procedure to the extent that generally speaking everybody is indicted in their true name, we recognized that once we do confer that benefit, that we must do it with an even hand and we must do it equally. 
    However, we do insist that Equal Protection does not prevent differences in treatment provided that the differences are not applied arbitrarily and provided that they do in fact serve a valid state purpose. 
    In this particular situation, we respectfully suggest to the Court that the Massachusetts system of criminal justice has a very decided valid interest in empowering grand juries to return indictments even in no situations where they do not know the true name of the person whom they are accusing. 
    It seems to me that it is a valid state interest that a grand jury serve that function, that it bring to the attention of the public that in fact there was a person maybe among others or maybe alone who they know committed a crime and that even though they do not have that evidence, they want the public to be aware that this person in fact did commit this crime even though he is only identified as John Doe. 
    So, that those people who are responsible for the investigation and the prosecution of crime will not be in a position to discontinue their efforts to locate and eventually prosecute that particular individual.

    Mr. Irwin I suppose that the issue is whether this particular individual is the one whom the grand jury intended to indict, would not the grand jury had to have some kind of evidence that the perpetrator or the murderer was a man 5’7”, black hair or something of that effect, so that you could say that yes obviously they did not have his name, but this is the individual that satisfies that description?
speaker="john_j_irwin_jr" startTime="1122.459" stopTime="1167.123">
    Mr. John J. Irwin, Jr. 
    Yes, Mr. Justice Brennan. 
    I think that your point is well taken. 
    I think that it obviously it troubles me, but it seems that the evidence that has been presented to the grand jury is something that we just cannot necessarily look behind all of these times. 
    I think that the Court below put great stress on the fact that had there been a more adequate description of the defendant, such as you just suggested that it would have been easier to the Court to find that this was not violative of the Equal Protection Clause and that the Court below would not necessarily have had the misgivings that they did have about this particular case.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="1167.123" stopTime="1186.861">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    What I have in mind was that, how could Chief Justice Tauro conclude that this is the man that the grand jury intended to indict? 
    Unless he at least, had some idea of what the person looked like that the grand jury had in mind. 
    How could he?
speaker="john_j_irwin_jr" startTime="1186.861" stopTime="1197.387">
    Mr. John J. Irwin, Jr. 
    Well, again and this is probably not a very satisfactory answer, I would suggest that the record is bound with reference to what evidence was before Chief Justice Tauro thought --
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="1197.387" stopTime="1198.737">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    That was before the grand jury.

    Mr. John J. Irwin, Jr. 
    Yes it is. 
    And again as I suggest, this is probably not a very satisfactory answer, but I would represent that the law has been explicit that where the grand jury speaks, we assume that what the grand jury has done is sufficient. 
    We do not look to the sufficiency of it. 
    And therefore --

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    No, we do. 
    I thought the issue here was whether Chief Justice Tauro complied with what you tell us as the requirement of the Supreme Judicial Court decisions that he must be satisfied that the person whose name is now to be put on the indictment is the person whom the grand jury intended to indict. 
    Is that what --

    Well, this is again the reason why we suggest that the “exhaustion of remedy” would have been more appropriate. 
    It seems to me that the very point that you make required the Court below on the comity theory and on the exhaustion of remedies doctrine to remand this case to the State Court for the appropriate procedures, to determine exactly what you have said. 
    It seems to me that we have to take the position in advancing an argument before this Court that the Judge in making this determination is in fact an agent of the grand jury. 
    And once he sets down on paper that he is satisfied that the true name is that of James J. Connor, the respondent, where in an analogous situation where we would be trying to examine why a grand jury indicted him. 
    And it would seem to me that the suggestion that you made points out the argument that we make in our brief with reference to the exhaustion situation.

    As I read the opinion of the First Circuit, it was an attitude that it did not make any difference, but the proceedings and procedures were in the Massachusetts Courts it was constitutionally permissible. 
    That is why at least I read, that is why you did not send it back the Massachusetts State Courts to let them say what they had done.

    Exactly. 
    And Mr. Chief Justice I would suggest to the Court that we of course, do not agree at all with that particular conclusion by that Court. 
    As a matter of fact, it is interesting to note in the decision below that the Court does not in anyway discuss the fact that the Court, the Massachusetts Trial Court, stands between the prosecutor and the accused with reference to making this substitution. 
    And I think had the Court had recognized that, it would in fact recognize that at least part of its Equal Protections objection would be dissipated and that if there was a further problem with reference to it, the situation that Justice Brennan suggests would be appropriate to exhaust the matter in a State Court.

    Mr. James J. Twohig 
    Mr. Chief Justice may it please the Court. 
    In this case involving a homicide that occurred in the early morning hours of May 1st 1965. 
    The indictment was handed down by a Grand Jury but that was in session during the entire summer of 1965, and I believe was even in session during May 1965 and throughout August 1965. 
    On August 4th of Wednesday, I believe, this particular indictment was handed down and the indictment besides naming a man named Donald Landry, also stated that another man was involved, John Doe and that they had no description of this man and no other man. 
    And, that is the way the indictment read and I believe it is stated in full on page 74 of the appendix. 
    This information was attested under oath by the Grand Jury and signed by the foreman. 
    On August 6th, two days after this so called indictment of John Doe, which is not a fictitious name in my belief under the Massachusetts Statute, in my belief that statute is intended to indicate a man who was known to the police only by a nickname, a part of the name or a fictitious or assumed name.

    Mr. James J. Twohig 
    Yes and in this case, Connor was five feet seven, had black hair and was a very slight built, but there was no description of any kind in this indictment. 
    All the Grand Jury did was to indicate that it did not know any way of identifying the second man involved in the homicide. 
    Now, on August 6th, Landry’s wife was moving from her apartment in Boston and some friends had gone there to help her. 
    Connor and his girlfriend were at that apartment. 
    Connor was arrested when the police visited the apartment with another man of about the same description. 
    This other man had been in jail on May 1st, so Connor was held and this was in fact stated to Connor by one of the policeman. 
    I have made this statement in Open Court and there has never been any denial. 
    Connor was then taken to police head quarters in Boston and thereafter on the 9th of August, the following Monday I, in response to a telephone call on behalf of Connor, went to Suffolk Superior Court for the purpose of representing Connor. 
    It was not known at that time when the case was called that I was in the Courtroom, but it was called and I presented myself to the Court. 
    I have supplied the Court with a copy of that session. 
    Shortly after the Court recognized me, the Assistant District Attorney in-charge of the case and Mr. Irwin was not there. 
    The Attorney General’s Offices had nothing to do with this case until it was in the federal Courts, but the Assistant District Attorney presented a motion for an amendment to the indictment. 
    The only information of evidence or anything of any kind that the Court ever had was a bold statement by the prosecutor. 
    Since the indictment has been returned, we and he did not identify who he meant by we, we have ascertained the name of the defendant, we did not know it at the time of indictment. 
    Those statements were made as to any other means of identification. 
    I objected to this, although I was taken by surprise and accepted to the allowance of the amendment and went to it in detail stating that there was no indication that Connor was the man intended, to be indicted by the Grand Jury or indeed that they ever intended to indict any specific person. 
    And the consequently the indictment had no application to Connor what so ever.

    Mr. James J. Twohig 
    I have supplied one to the Court you Honor. 
    It is not in the appendix, no Your Honor. 
    It is with -- the voluminous record of the free trial proceedings and the evidence in the case. 
    The amendment was allowed, now the amendment was not sanctioned by the Gedzium case. 
    The procedure in the Gedzium case was in accordance with what the Gedzium case said the statute intended. 
    The procedure in the Gedzium case was that the amendment was not to apply, there was not to be any amendment that the indictment was in effect secret and could not be touched, and this is in accordance with the decision in Commonwealth versus Maher (ph) in Massachusetts which I believe has never been overruled and which states that no amendment can be made to an indictment in an capitol case. 
    The Gedzium case said that when the true name of the man accused in the indictment under the name of John Doe is discovered, it can be entered in the record and there after the defendant will be referred to by that name and that is what the statute says, which Mr. Irwin has just read. 
    But, that presupposes that John Doe is actually a fictitious name and that no other practicable description is necessary and I submit that the statute does not mean that, but even if it did it would be unconstitutional, because it would deprive the defendant, not only of Equal Protection, but also of Due Process.

speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="2578.569" stopTime="2586.218">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Well, whether this Betty Moore (ph) that was her name changed her story. 
    She told one story, first to the Grand Jury and then she changed it.
speaker="james_j_twohig" startTime="2586.218" stopTime="2599.928">
    Mr. James J. Twohig 
    Yes, she had testified twice Your Honor before the Grand Jury and this is my impression that she said, she gave different stories this time, but at no occasion had she identified Connor although she had known Connor for several years.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="2599.928" stopTime="2601.995">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Well, because of the hold of (Inaudible) employment.
speaker="james_j_twohig" startTime="2601.995" stopTime="2842.941">
    Mr. James J. Twohig 
    No, before that. 
    No of that, because of the hold-up, Connor was not involved in the hold-up. 
    Connor was -- I believe in jail at the time of the holdup and release the day of the hold up. 
    But, two days later he became eligible to be charged in the murder by virtue of being at large. 
    The two witnesses did not identify Connor before the Grand Jury and that was their testimony at the trial and since one of them admitted at the trial in order to testify the trial that she committed perjury on the occasions when she testified before the Grand Jury, although this Grand Jury was the same one, still in session. 
    At the time when Connor was brought before the Court it was impractical for the prosecutor to go back to the Grand Jury with the same two identifying witnesses for some reason and that is a reason. 
    And it was on that ground that I asked repeatedly for the Grand Jury minutes, because if there were any evidence in that transcript that was favorable to Connor, I felt that I was entitled to have it as stated in Brady (ph) and Maryland (ph). 
    The identification must have been favorable to Connor if any there were, and I do not believe there was any before the grand jury, but there might have been other evidence that they gave relating to the events of the robbery, two days before the murder. 
    And, relating to the events that night before the murder or the homicide or whatever it was. 
    There might have been something there which was favorable to Connor and I believe that I was entitled to have that and I was denied that of course, repeatedly right up to time and during trial. 
    The Court then, having adopted the amendment on the Thirteenth, there was another action taken by the Court, this time without any information whatsoever. 
    It was just brought to the attention of the clerk. 
    I suppose the statute had been read more carefully in the meantime by the prosecutor. 
    That an entry should be made in the record in accordance with the statute to the effect, that the true name of the man indicted was James J. Connor and in fact, the copy of the amendment which was served upon Connor, when he was in jail after appearing in the Court on the Thirteenth contained his name. 
    Now, the indictment of course handed down by the Grand Jury did not contain his name. 
    That was not the indictment, which was served upon in the jail. 
    So, in my view not only the Constitution of Massachusetts and the Constitution of United States were violated by this procedure, but the law itself, statutory law of Massachusetts was violated and he was denied Due Process. 
    On the grounds, I suppose stated in Gedzium that when a miscreant conceals his identity during the commission of a crime, he has no right to complain if he is arrested on the general warrant. 
    This is of course, contrary to all the previous traditions of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and to the history, the judicial history that preceded establishment of the Commonwealth.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="2842.941" stopTime="2868.507">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Of course, we are not concerned here with whether or not the statutory or common law of Massachusetts is violated in this case. 
    It was determined by the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts that it was not and this was in conformity with the law Massachusetts and we accept that. 
    We are concerned with here is only a federal constitution question that alone.

    Mr. James J. Twohig 
    My brief, yes. 
    In the second paragraph, I said the constitutional and legal issues arising out of the indictment and arrest were also fully argued in Connor’s brief and in the Supreme Judicial Court, pages 10 to 14 as to probably cause. 
    The absolute limitation on material indictments, two indictments in serious cases, the nullity of the indictment as an the indictment in blank and the warrant as a general warrant. 
    All involving the violation of Connor’s rights under -- I will skip the Massachusetts laws, under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution of the United States. 
    I might also say at this time that I believe that the Sixth Amendment was involved. 
    These issues were of course, also stated and argued in the United States District Court at length and I have the citation there.

speaker="james_j_twohig" startTime="3031.505" stopTime="3182.420">
    Mr. James J. Twohig 
    No, I do not believe there was, but I believe that the Constitution of the United States was nevertheless violated Your Honor. 
    The Second Court pointed out clearly to me, what I had failed to emphasize, although I had mentioned it and that and that was that Equal Protection was also involved. 
    But, I do believe, nevertheless that Due Process also was involved here. 
    The procedure then, that was authorized in Gedzium was thus expanded and elaborated upon. 
    In this particular case, to include something that had never been applied to any other defendant in Massachusetts and clearly in violations, his federal constitutional rights. 
    The case then proceeded and I continued to protest from time to time about the indictment. 
    I asked for the Grand Jury minutes and in order that I would get some information, which would enable me to ask for an evidentiary hearing, as to whether or not the Grand Jury had been intending to indict Conner as some other person. 
    I asked for the Grand Jury minutes also on several other grounds to prepare my case for inconsistent statements, to prepare for cross examination, but I was principally concerned with the question that whether or not Conner should ever have been brought to trial, forced to respond to a charge of murder in first degree. 
    That was my objective in asking for the Grand Jury minutes primarily. 
    I was denied the Grand Jury minutes. 
    I think I must have asked for them formally at least a dozen times. 
    They were kept from me on pretext after pretext. 
    I have stated these pretext in the brief on page 25. 
    No -- and it continues for several pages there after.

    Mr. James J. Twohig 
    Alright. 
    The Grand Jury minutes who withheld from me, me at any rate, although they were -- I think several constitutional grounds in which I was entitled to them. 
    And, this policy of secrecy and the withholding of evidence material to the defense was applied to the matter of interviewing the two identifying witnesses. 
    I have never even seen the identifying witnesses up to the time of trial, except on one occasion when I visited the Court House back in -- I believe the end of August, 1965 when I saw a girl in conference, the door opened and inadvertently I saw this girl in conference with several police officers and the Assistant District Attorney in charge of the case, whom at the trial, six or seven months later I recognized, as a material witness. 
    They had her there at that time.

    Unknown Speaker 
    So, she was made available to you?

    Mr. James J. Twohig 
    No Your Honor.

    Before the Trial. 
    And, the Judge instructed her that she did not have to say anything if she did not want to, that she was entitled to counsel and so on and he asked her if she wanted to say anything other the name and address and she gave the name and that was all she would say, we were never allowed to question her. 
    The attorney, I recall now -- the attorney for one of the other defendants was given an opportunity to see her in the District Attorney’s Office before that and when he started to ask her questions, the Prosecutor intervened with the statements that she did not have to answer any questions if she did not want to and that he was not to ask her anything about what she said before the Grand Jury. 
    And, the conference exploded in an argument and nothing was elicited from her there. 
    We have maintained all of us, four counsels that we never had an opportunity to talk to these witnesses. 
    We did not consider that incident in Court an opportunity to discuss the case with the witness. 
    I believe that she was advised not to talk to us. 
    The case was replete with irregularities. 
    There were answers to specifications of two of the other defendants. 
    My own specifications, I had no quarrel with other than that they were not responsive and that I got no answers to anything that I tried to get about the information I considered material in the Grand Jury minutes.

    Mr. James J. Twohig 
    Yes, I do Your Honor, the full and fair trial. 
    It has been the contention; one of the minor contentions I believe of the prosecution offices, that we had a jury trial and I think that has been intimated in the decisions that you always have the jury trial as final protection. 
    But, we did not have a full and fair trial, Your Honor. 
    And, I believe that, that is fundamental thing, which involves the Constitution of the United States and the protection that provides to every defendant. 
    So, I regard it as being involved in the constitutional issue, Your Honor. 
    I do not think that in any way the rights of the defendant Connor were respected under the Constitution of the United States, under the Fifth, the Sixth or the Fourteenth Amendments. 
    That he was denied Equal Protection and that he was denied Due Process. 
   
   
   
   Rebuttal of John J. Irwin, Jr.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="3509.988" stopTime="3517.731">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Thank you Mr. Twohig. 
    Mr. Irwin, I will give you three more minutes.
speaker="john_j_irwin_jr" startTime="3517.731" stopTime="3628.500">
    Mr. John J. Irwin, Jr. 
    Mr. Chief Justice and members of the Court. 
    By way of a rebuttal I would only reiterate that it is the Commonwealth’s position that the constitutional matter before this Court on this hearing is whether or not that the respondent, James J. Connor, was deprived of any constitutional guarantee, especially the Equal Protection of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution. 
    With respect to the argument that was made by the respondent, through his counsel, I respectfully suggest that a reading of the Commonwealth v. Doherty case that is cited in the brief, with the dissents will indicate that the Massachusetts Supreme Court was not presented with the constitutional argument. 
    And, that the Justices in deciding that case were concerned solely with determining whether or not Hurtado v. California was still strong enough to support the doctrine of Jones v. Robbins in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and no other issue. 
    And, getting back to the position that the Commonwealth takes in its brief, in its argument, I would respectfully suggest to the Court that this particular vehicle, General Laws Chapter 277, Section 19 is strictly a procedural vehicle, by which a Grand Jury which has a valid interest in seeing to it that they are on occasion, John Doe indictment retained has the power to indict somebody and then, later require a substitution on the “showing of cause.” 
    It seems to me that in that situation, that if the Court wanted to determine whether or not there had been an Equal Protection violation, that the proper thing to do would be to remand the case to the State of Court -- the appropriate State Court for hearings consistent with those particular claims. 
    Thank you Mr. Chief Justice.
