    Mr. Norton J. Come 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    This case is here on writs of certiorari to the Second Circuit, presents two questions concerning the extent to which the duty to bargain under the National Labor Relations Act survives a change in employers. 
    The first question is whether Burns International Protective Agency which took over Wackenhut’s job of furnishing guard services, Lockheed is a successor to Wackenhut for purposes of the National Labor Relations Board and second, if Burns is a successor employer, is it obliged not only to recognize and bargain with the union represented by Wackenhut’s employees or also obliged to honor the collective bargaining agreement which Wackenhut had entered into with the union covering these employees.

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Mr. Come if –- perhaps this question is a little bit too early, but if you will bear in mind now certainly when you want, if Burns have not employed any of the Wackenhut people, they employed 27, I think some such figures, they have not employed any, would you contend they were a successor employer because they moved in and performed the same function?
speaker="norton_j_come" startTime="140.785" stopTime="237.983">
    Mr. Norton J. Come 
    I would say the fact that they -- well, as I will develop further to continuity of the employing enterprise is the test and among the factors that are very crucial there is the complement of the workforce and had they not employed for nondiscriminatory reasons, the Wackenhut employees, that would be a big factor for holding that they were not a successor. 
    Whether it would be conclusive or not, I will develop as I get to it. 
    The basic facts here are these. 
    From July 1, 1962 to July 1, 1967, Wackenhut, a nationwide guard service provided plant protection services for Lockheed Aircraft Service Corporation, a subsidiary of the Lockheed Aircraft Corporation at its facility at the Ontario Airport in California. 
    What Lockheed was doing there was serving, was maintaining and repairing planes and Wackenhut was supplying guard service for the Lockheed operation. 
    On March 8, 1967, the Board certified the United Plant Guard Workers as the exclusive bargaining representative of the Wackenhut employees working at the Lockheed Airport facility.

    Unknown Speaker 
    How about the unit in place?
speaker="norton_j_come" startTime="239.388" stopTime="501.141">
    Mr. Norton J. Come 
    It was a unit of about 42 employees. 
    On April 29, 1967, about a month after the certification, Wackenhut and the Union entered into a three-year collective bargaining agreement covering these employees and the collective bargaining agreement among other things contained a clause making the agreement binding on successors and assigns. 
    Lockheed's then current service contract with Wackenhut was due to expire on June 10, 1967 unless extended by Lockheed. 
    In May of 1967, Lockheed invited various guard services, including Wackenhut to bid or rebid the job. 
    On May 15, Lockheed advised the prospective bidders including Burns, that Wackenhut’s guards were represented by the United Plant Guard Workers who had been certified by the Board and that there was an outstanding collective bargaining agreement between Wackenhut and the Union covering those employees. 
    Although, Wackenhut submitted a bid, the successful bidder was Burns. 
    In the next moth, June of 1967, Wackenhut or Burns sought to employ when it took over on July 1 as many of the Wackenhut guards as possible for the reason that they had, they cleared security and top security clearance that was needed for this type of work. 
    The Wackenhut guards applied for jobs with Burns. 
    As they did so, Burns’ officials in turn assisted the American Federation of Guards, another union with whom Wackenhut had a contract covering its employees in Los Angeles County. 
    That contract did not cover these employees because this was in San Bernardino County, but nonetheless, Burns assisted the American Federation of Guards in obtaining membership applications from the Wackenhut guards as they came to apply for jobs with Burns. 
    Representatives of Burns told the guards that they could not get uniforms without signing American Federation of Guards membership cards and that they had to join the American Federation of Guards in order to work for Burns. 
    On June 29, Burns’s Branch Manager concluding that a majority of the employees to be used that the Lockheed Airport job had signed American Federation of Guards membership applications or were already members of that union recognized the American Federation of Guards as their bargaining representative. 
    Wackenhut had terminated its guard service at midnight on June 30 and Burns began to furnish such service on July 1. 
    On that date, Burns' Lockheed force like Wackenhut’s consisted of 42 guards. 
    Of the 42, 27 or more than a majority had formally been employed by Wackenhut and 15 guards were transferred from other Burns’ jobs. 
    The Burns guards performed essentially the same tasks at the same stations that the Wackenhut guards had performed. 
    Moreover, although Burns used its own supervisors, their functions and responsibilities were similar to those of their Wackenhut predecessors, both utilize area supervisors who perform similar functions and both had full time supervisors on the Lockheed job with similar functions.

    And of course the 15 brought over by Burns were already members of the (Voice Overlap)
speaker="norton_j_come" startTime="513.611" stopTime="803.740">
    Mr. Norton J. Come 
    They were already members. 
    They were apparently transferred from the Los Angeles County and thus were under the Burns’ contract with the American Federation of Guards which I believe had a Union Security Clause as did the United Plant Guards contract with Wackenhut. 
    On July 12, the United Plant Guard Workers requested that Burns recognize it as the bargaining representative of the Burns employees at Lockheed and honor the collective bargaining agreement that it had with Wackenhut. 
    Burns refused and the union filed unfair labor practice charges with the Board. 
    The Board found that the -- that Burns violated Section 8 (a) (2) and (1) of the Act which prohibits illegal assistance by an employer to a labor organization by assisting the American Federation of Guards in organizing and by recognizing American Federation of Guards when it did not represent an un-coerced majority of Burns’ employees. 
    This finding was sustained by the Court of Appeals and it is not an issue here. 
    The Board also found that a bargaining unit limited that the guards working at the Lockheed Airport facility was appropriate, that Burns continued essentially the same operation at that plant that Wackenhut had, and therefore, it was a successor employer to Wackenhut and accordingly the Board held that Burns violated Section 8 (a) (5) and (1) of the Act by refusing to recognize and bargain with the United Plant Guards. 
    Finally, the Board drawing support from this Court’s decision in Wiley against Livingston which I will get to later, the Board held that as a successor to Wackenhut, Burns was obliged to honor the collective bargaining agreement between Wackenhut and the United Plant Guard Workers and that by refusing to do that that was an additional violation of the bargaining obligation. 
    The Court of Appeals in an opinion by Judge Hayes sustained the Board’s finding as I indicated, the bear legal assistance, sustained the Board’s finding of -- that Burns was a successor, sustained the finding that there was a refusal to bargain and Burns refusing to recognize United Plant Guard Workers as a representative of the employees, but held that the Board had exceeded its powers under the statute in finding that there was also a further refusal to bargain in failing to honor the collective bargaining agreement. 
    Both the successor issue and the propriety of the Board’s finding requiring a contract to be honored before this Court on a cross petition for certiorari. 
    Now, as this Court knows in enacting the National Labor Relations Act, Congress made the policy declaration, Section 1 of the Act that protection by law of the right of employees are organized and bargained collectively, safeguards commerce from interruption by removing a frequent source of industrial strike. 
    The way the Board -- the Act implements that policy is to provide a procedure whereby the Board can conduct a secret ballot election and get the employees' wishes concerning a bargaining representative. 
    If a majority vote for them, it certifies them as the exclusive bargaining representative under Section 8 (a) (5) of the Act, it is a refusal to bargain, to refuse to honor the certification. 
    Furthermore, since the Act also rests on the premise that industrial pieces promoted by maintaining stability into bargaining relationship, a board certification is normally not subject to challenge for one year. 
    This Court endorsed the Board’s rule to that effect in the Brooks case or longer, if there is a collective bargaining agreement of reasonable duration and under Court principles that had been approved by the Courts collective bargaining agreement of up to three years is normally regarded as reasonable duration.

speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="858.158" stopTime="859.952">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    And are those the only two questions we have?
speaker="norton_j_come" startTime="859.952" stopTime="1086.777">
    Mr. Norton J. Come 
    Yes, Your Honor those are the only two questions as I understand it. 
    Now, in line with the general principles that I have just outlined, had Burns remained the employer here, it would have been obliged to recognize the United Plant Guard Workers, during life of the three-year collective bargaining agreement, notwithstanding any changes in the complement of the employees that occurred during the life of that agreement and if Wackenhut had repudiated that agreement or it unilaterally modified its wage provisions or any other provision relating to the employees terms and conditions of employment, it would not only have been subject to a suit for breach of the agreement under Section 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act, but it would have violated Section 8 (d) and therefore 8 (a) (5) of the National Labor Relations Act as well because Section 8 (d) provides in relevant part that where there is in effect a collective bargaining contract, the duty to bargain collective shall mean that no party to such contract shall terminate or modify such contract without giving prescribed notice and waiting until the expiration date of such contract. 
    And as I understand it, nothing in this Court’s recent decision in Pittsburgh Plate Glass affects this general principle because this contract almost exclusively, if not exclusively dealt with mandatory subjects of bargain. 
    Now, I do not understand that Burns disagrees with what I have just been setting forth as the obligation that would have been imposed on Wackenhut nor do I understand that there is any disagreement with the next point that I am going to make. 
    Namely that early in the administration of the Act, the Board evolved the doctrine and it has been uniformly approved by the Court of Appeals, although this Court has never had occasion specifically to pass on it, that the mere transfer of operations from employer to another does not distinguish -- extinguish the obligation of bargain under the National Labor Relations Act and such claims for a leave substantially in fact the identity of the employing enterprise then the duty of the original employer to recognize and bargain with an incumbent union evolves upon the new employer as a successor employer. 
    The rationale for the doctrine is simply this. 
    That if the employing enterprise remains intact, continuation of a bargaining obligation serves the policy of averting industrial strike in that enterprise no less than that -- by imposing that obligation upon the successor employer then did imposing it on the original employer. 
    Moreover, where you have maintained the employing enterprise, there is little reason to believe that the employees’ original choice of a bargaining representative would have been altered by the mere change in employers. 
    The point at which the difference between us develops is what are the criteria for determining whether you have a successor employer for purposes of the National Labor Relations Act and that also gets back to the Chief Justice’s question.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1086.777" stopTime="1148.966">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Well, before you go on to that Mr. Come, what you have said sounds as though, you are talking about a case in which Burns came in and took over and along with the takeover of the activity, took over employees. 
    Now, my reading of this record is that Burns was one of the competing bidders, great many people bid for this contract and this company has awarded it to Burns as the low bidder, so there were competitors of the man you -- of the company you now suggest is this company to which they are successor, these employees were then, the 27 employees ultimately taken within on the open labor market, were they not?
speaker="norton_j_come" startTime="1148.966" stopTime="1150.301">
    Mr. Norton J. Come 
    That is correct Your Honor.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1150.301" stopTime="1153.957">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Then they were hired one by one. 
    I just want to be sure I have got those facts clear.
speaker="norton_j_come" startTime="1153.957" stopTime="1408.949">
    Mr. Norton J. Come 
    Yes you have Your Honor and it is Burns’ point that that does make a difference as that distinguishes -- that distinction should be drawn between this kind of a situation in one where you have a more conventional transfer of assets or of facilities. 
    We submit and we believe that the cases in the Court of Appeals support our submission that so long as the new employer ends up with substantially the same bargaining unit or industrial community as it sometimes called, he is a successor employer for purposes of the National Labor Relations Act whether he does that as a result of direct dealing with the prior employer or he does it through dealing with a third party as was done in this case because the important thing as I tried to indicate the important rationale for writing this -- the loss of the successor employer on the bargaining obligation is that the change in employer has not made a significant change in the bargaining unit which had originally selected the union as the employees’ representative. 
    And that is what we had here because irrespective of how Burns ended up with the contract and the findings of the Board as sustained by the Court of Appeals you had a situation where, I am quoting from the Court of Appeals appendix 189, “Both Burns and Wackenhut are a nationwide organizations. 
    Both perform the identical services at the same facility, namely providing plant protection service for Lockheed. 
    Although Burns used its own supervisors, their functions and responsibilities were similar to those performed by their predecessors and finally and perhaps most significantly, Burns commenced performance of the contract with 27 former Wackenhut employees out of its total complement of 42. 
    Moreover, as shown by Burns’ assistance to the American Federation of Plant Guards, it too recognized this Lockheed operation as a separate operation, as a separate bargaining unit.” 
    So that, we submit that since the change in from Wackenhut to Burns that is substantially intact, the employment conditions at the enterprise that is involved there, namely the supplying of the guard services to Lockheed which was a separate unit, the Board properly found that Burns is a successor employer to Wackenhut and which brings me to the second question as to whether Burns was not only obligated to recognize and bargain with United Plant Guard Workers’ Union and prohibited from making any unilateral changes in existing working conditions without first bargaining with the union and whether it was also obliged to honor the contract.

    Mr. Gregory.
speaker="gordon_a_gregory" startTime="1577.011" stopTime="1718.322">
    Mr. Gordon A. Gregory 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    The United States Chamber of Commerce in its amicus brief stated and I quote, “In a service industry such as the providing the plant protection service, generally the only variable in which productivity of efficiency gains can be made is labor.” 
    I submit Your Honors that in this case the labor gains that have been made, have been made at the sacrifice of rights that are federally protected and rights which this Court sought to stabilize and its Wiley decision. 
    In my view, there are classic facts here of Wackenhut Corporation having had a contract for guard services for a number of years on an unorganized basis. 
    The guards that my client represents organized those people. 
    They were certified by the National Labor Relations Board. 
    They entered into negotiations for their first contract which did contain the successors and assigns clause and without at least the control or participation of the parties, Lockheed elected to let its contract with Wackenhut up for bids. 
    Following the premise that the only commodity this guard agencies have is labor, Burns then was in the position to ignore the stability created by the bargaining agreement and effectively then to bid on the basis of labor only. 
    The result was that the employees lost the benefits of the gains they had made through the collective bargaining process. 
    I suggest that a doctrine, that a successor employer and assuming for the moment Burns was a successor, albeit a non-consenting party to what has clearly been held to be a non-consensual agreement and rather a public obligation does not do violence to clear concepts of Federal Labor Law Policy as they were established prior to the time of the Burns’ decision because prior that time in a successor situation it was held that the successor was bound to recognize and bargain with the incumbent union. 
    It was held that the successor was bound to recognize existent terms and conditions of employment whether or not those terms and conditions of employment were established by a bargaining agreement or otherwise.

    This I would say would be one of the numerous factors to determine whether or not initially there was a successorship involved and whether the collective bargaining agreement of the predecessor bore a reasonable relation to that predecessor. 
    I do not believe that that is not the case before the Court because here you had a completely separate facility and if I might add on that point, first Wackenhut and the Plant Guards negotiated the collective bargaining agreement of which I think we can assume was tailored to the needs of plant protection services at that facility.

    Perhaps not, Your Honor, but a companion case with Burns was the (Inaudible) Division wherein the union desired not to be bound by a collective bargaining agreement where there had been a change in ownership and the Board has indicated that the rule set forth in Burns would apply equally to unions as well as employers and I submit that is correct Your Honor.

    Indeed we had two sophisticated well established giant guard agency and I would make the point that Burns not only had advance knowledge but with the sophistication on experience was in a position to adapt to the situation of the collective bargaining agreement that was present.

    Mr. Gordon A. Gregory 
    Mr. Chief Justice in my opinion it is standard. 
    It has been a form of boiler plate. 
    I think we have placed in bargaining agreements although until Wiley at least, until Burns, there may have been valid whether as a matter of law it would bind a non-consenting successor or assign. 
    More ideally in our bargaining agreements we attempted to make it a condition of sale or assignment that the predecessor would see that the successor adopt it, but realistically and in terms of placing this Court’s Wiley decision on the rationale thereof promoting industrial stability through arbitration and of giving employee some modicum of protection against changes in ownership, I submit Burns is in harmony with that doctrine because under Wiley if there has to be arbitration for the successor it is implicit there cannot be that arbitration unless the bargaining agreement survives.

    There was previously an appropriate unit certified by the National Labor Relations Board.

    Mr. Gordon A. Gregory 
    Well, I believe that was the situation in Monroe-Sander for example decided by the Second Circuit where the possible, either refusal to employ or transfer to the -- a new location or to the successor in turn might be either an unfair labor practice or as I understand Wiley, a breach of the collective bargaining agreement or a matter of subject to arbitration. 
    So I would not state that a headcount is absolutely essential to the operation of the successorship concept. 
    And may I conclude by indicating that in a situation such as presented here, it would appear to me a certain stability is created not only for the employees on whose behalf I argue but for those employers who operate in the service industry area which is highly competitive but typified generally by competition based on labor rates, rates of people who generally speaking are barely above the minimums to begin with. 
    So I would submit there could be stability for the employer. 
    Moreover sophisticated parties anymore in labor relations do enter into voluntary adjustments to adopt to such proper changes as it may take place with a change in ownership and finally this Court has made it clear in Wiley that the arbitration machinery is to be fostered and is of course available or binding upon a successor to correct these situations. 
    I submit that Burns has finally placed an entire National Labor Relations Act in harmony with the Federal Labor Policy generally which is to promote and foster bargaining through agreements and informal arbitration on disputes. 
   
   
   
   Argument of Charles G. Bakaly, Jr.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="2368.862" stopTime="2372.338">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Thank you Mr. Gregory. 
    Mr. Bakaly.
speaker="charles_g_bakaly_jr" startTime="2372.338" stopTime="2629.447">
    Mr. Charles G. Bakaly, Jr. 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    The Court has zeroed in on the narrowness of this case with respect to the successorship issue, it does involve service industry type businesses and our position before this Court at this time which has not been answered by the Court below or by counsel is that this facility operation of either Burns or Wackenhut was not an employing industry under either Burns or Wackenhut and therefore there could not be any continuity of the employing industry. 
    We are not contesting the general law that a successorship will be found where there is no change in the employing industry. 
    We are dealing with a particular service industry and what this facility was which everybody has assumed this facility operation was just a small portion of Wackenhut business in California and it was a very, very small portion of Burns’ business in California. 
    And the cases unfortunately have not dealt with this question of what is an employing industry in the service industry context and we say that an employing industry is -- must be a large enough portion to where there is managerial authority and skill which is necessary to run the business and to make decision on matters that are critical to employees and that the employing industry is used with a purpose therefore in determining the employees desires about having a union. 
    Now, as to the regards to the facts in this case, as been pointed out that there was an annual renewal contract between Lockheed and Wackenhut. 
    There was not a term agreement between Wackenhut and Lockheed and that the contract between Wackenhut and the Plant Guards was the first contract so that the successors and assigns clause had not been in any previous agreement. 
    Now, why did not this facility have the indicia of an employing industry? 
    As we have said it was a very, very small portion of the business of each. 
    There is only one supervisor there, part time when Wackenhut had it. 
    When Burns took it over there was one supervisor with limited authority, limited authority. 
    The wages, the benefits, the working conditions, all other decisions were established at the corporate headquarters not at the facility. 
    With respect to Burns it was established on the anterior basis. 
    There were separate office staffs. 
    There was no office staff at the facility of Burns. 
    There was no payroll and accounting staff. 
    All that was handled at the sub-office where Burns is in it, the California office for Wackenhut. 
    And there were separate manuals and procedures of these two competing companies of which this facility was merely a very small portion. 
    In any event, there was a substantial change primarily because of the quickness within which this operation, facility was integrated in the Burns as regular operation because of Burns’ practice of interchanging guards regularly to have the flexibility, to have the particular guard work at more than one location where his services could be best utilized. 
    They had this practice and within six months, less than the majority of the former Wackenhut employees were employed at the facility, so that immediately upon Burns taking this over, integrated it into its other unit. 
    From a policy standpoint as the Chief Justice, I think pointed out, there would be serious problems if this rule of successorship applied in the service industries to the companies like Burns and that would cause a lack of stability in labor relations and this kept --

    It is going to cause jurisdiction strike and it is going to put the employer in the middle between two competing unions.

    Mr. Charles G. Bakaly, Jr. 
    Well, Mr. Come did not say that exactly. 
    He said that that would be a factor that he has taken to consider (Voice Overlap) in a different case. 
    Mr. Gregory said that he would not find it a different case if we are drawing all of our employees and in fact where you have this policy of integration within six months, Mr. Justice White, there was a majority of non-Wackenhut employees there. 
    That is a really short period of time and because of this Burns policy that I am talking about, that happened. 
    Now, just because it did not happen on day one, to tell you exactly the client did not have it on day one because of the required peculiar requirements for security clearances at Lockheed. 
    Burns did not have in its other operations enough employees that had the top secret security clearance availed and that kind of a circumstance is the only reason why they did not transfer the majority of their guards from other locations which is their normal practice when they take over.

    Mr. Charles G. Bakaly, Jr. 
    Yes. 
    I would like to go assuming which obviously we do not, but for the purposes of argument, go to the second point on the contract issue and call of the Board’s attention that the long line of authority that says that the purpose of the National Labor Relations Act was not to allow governmental regulations of the terms and conditions of employment. 
    This Court in H. K. Porter in 1970 held that in Chicago Northwestern Transportation Union, the same principle, the statute, the legislative history all say that the Labor Board distinguished perhaps from a Court, does not have the power to order somebody to make a concession or to a particular proposal or to the entire agreement, we submit. 
    And that it is this Section of 8 (d) which controls the Board here and prohibits what the Board has done in this case. 
    The language of 8 (d) is “but such obligation does not compel either party to agree to a proposal or require the making of a concession.”

    Mr. Charles G. Bakaly, Jr. 
    That is correct and that we feel is with -- in the interest of following the policy of promoting arbitration and using arbitration as the manner in the means of resolving these disputes, but let the arbitrator who has as Mr. Justice Douglas has said that the person who has most competence in this area, who has the knowledge of the law to shop, let him be the one who decide that. 
    And of course you know arbitrator in the Wiley case after deciding that the contract was bound -- binding for a couple of months was then not binding thereafter.

    They say we agree with the Second Circuit’s resolution of this issue in Burns.

speaker="charles_g_bakaly_jr" startTime="3910.020" stopTime="4043.143">
    Mr. Charles G. Bakaly, Jr. 
    That is correct and they left it to the arbitrator and his expertise to so hold. 
    Now, the Board really is overreaching when they say that the result called for here is to promote industrial peace and to -- and that there is a policy of maintaining collective bargaining agreements. 
    The policy of Section 1 of the Act is to promote collective bargaining, not the imposition brought on consenting parties of collective bargaining agreements and that is what they have done here and the Courts, the strife argument was made in H.K. Porter. 
    It was there a flagrant case of the employer of bargaining in bad faith and refusing to adduce, check off provision or it had in other plants, it had adduced check off provision and just did not want to have one here in that plant, and no other legitimate economic reasons whatsoever. 
    And it would have saved economic strife. 
    It would not had so much economic strife possibly if this Court had ordered the employer to be bound, to adduce to check of provisions, but it did not. 
    There would be industrial peace if there was compulsory arbitration in this country maybe. 
    Although in some European countries where they have had co-determination and government intervention they have had national strifes if anything but industrial peace but maybe it would but that is not what Congress has intended here. 
    Plant closures cause industrial strife but in Darlington this Court held that you could close a plant for union activity because you did not like -- you did not want your plant organized and that kind of industrial strife is great. 
    So under free collective bargaining which is what we have at this time, strife and strikes are sometimes necessary and of course the fact that you have a collective bargaining agreement does not mean that you are necessarily going to be free from strikes. 
    All of us know the situations where employees and unions have struck in violation of collective bargaining agreements and refused to go back in the face of Court Order.

    Mr. Charles G. Bakaly, Jr. 
    Modify, that is 8 (d) and that is the provision that the Board relies on to find a violation of 8 (a) (5) for a unilateral modification. 
    This Court as you point out has never so ruled on that point. 
    In Strong Roofing there is some dicta that would indicate in that direction but this Court and not all Courts ruled on that question and the Board in its most recent prior case as while not exceeding that it does not have a power, it now says that it is going to defer questions of modification to arbitration, a position that many of those had been urging the Board for sometime, this most recent prior case and the case indicates that that is the direction the Board's going to go at this time. 
    Now, the purposes of the Act will be effectuated by assuming a successorship by requiring good faith bargaining and the arbitration that Wiley permits. 
    We are not asking the Court to back away at all on the Wiley case. 
    Arbitrator, the arbitrator is more qualified and desirable and quicker to interpret these matters than the Labor Board and we submit that the Board’s rule of imposing collective bargaining agreements will cause serious inequities upon the parties as Judge Hayes pointed out, counsel alluded to the Duro rule as Judge Hayes pointed out, it would be very unfair to a labor union that made a collective bargaining agreement with failing company, let us say for three years on very favorable terms to then have that company acquired by certain -- some large company that is not at all failing and be obligated to that agreement for two-and-a-half to three years.

speaker="charles_g_bakaly_jr" startTime="4492.138" stopTime="4604.365">
    Mr. Charles G. Bakaly, Jr. 
    Yes. 
    They could have deferred arbitration and that is what they have now done in (Inaudible), that is what they have done. 
    The Board’s rule really also from a policy standpoint in our view would really unduly restrain competition in this area. 
    The Board points this out in Emerald Maintenance and they point out that there it is under a Service Contract Act, but there is a policy permitting a government contractor to bid Lockheed as a 99% government contractor. 
    While it is true that this contract with Burns was not out of the Service Contract Act yet the same policy applies with saving the government money which is really what the Air Force argued in Emerald Maintenance that a policy of contract honoring would cause the government because of its inability to have lower bids that same principle would apply here. 
    Also often times the alternative for a company that is in the place of being acquired is to go out of business, if it cannot be acquired. 
    Now, we submit that this rule of contract honoring, requiring, imposing a collective bargaining agreement is going to be a deterrent to acquisitions because an employer that comes in and wants to buy a company is a successor. 
    He has no -- he does not mind about bargaining with the union but he wants to try that to get some changes in that collective bargaining agreement. 
    It may well be that collective bargaining agreement that has caused the company to be in the position it is in. 
    Now, if this is prevented, we are going to have a lot more industrial strike --

    Mr. Norton J. Come 
    In which the Board says, we find therefore that Burns is bound to that contract as if it were a signatory thereto. 
    It's failure to maintain the contract in effect is violative of Sections 8 (d) and 8 (a) (5).

    Mr. Norton J. Come

    Mr. Norton J. Come 
    Which says that it is an unfair labor practice to fail the bargain collectively. 
    Now 8 (d) defines large part what constitutes a failure --

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    I do not suppose it is said in the Court but I gather technically the violations is 8 (a) (5)?
speaker="norton_j_come" startTime="4739.525" stopTime="4880.444">
    Mr. Norton J. Come 
    Yes Your Honor. 
    Now, to be sure Wiley only compelled arbitration, however the considerations upon which the Court compelled a non-consenting employer to the contract to go to arbitration under that contract we submit are precisely the same considerations that justified the Board in applying the same principle to its interpretation of 8 (d). 
    The Court relied upon the fact that a collective bargaining agreement is not in any real sense, the simple product of a consensual relationship; it is a cold governing, an industrial community that is negotiated under the principles and requirements of the National Labor Relations Act. 
    It binds employees who did not even consent to the contract or weren't even employed at the time it was negotiating and may not even be a member of the union which negotiated it, but albeit a member of the bargaining unit if the union has to represent. 
    More importantly the Court relied upon the fact that the objective of National Labor Policy requires that the rightful prerogatives of owners independently to rearrange their businesses and even eliminate themselves as employers, be balanced by some protection to employees from a sudden change in the employment relationship because the employee and the union usually does not have a say in these transfer negotiations and we submit that that is a fortiori in an industry like the service industry which is subject to its rapid turn on. 
    Finally the Court relied upon the fact that industrial strife could be avoided by submitting employees’ claims to arbitration leave it -- rather than leaving them to a test of economic powers.

    As to -- if the contract is applicable, the extent to which he has to abide by the contract, the extent to which he can make changes to meet his situation are all matters that he is free to bargain with the union about and failing an agreement to take to the arbitration. 
    The Board’s decision here far from being in derogation of arbitration, permits arbitration to work. 
    All the Board is saying here is that if you are a successor under the National Labor Relations Act as we have defined it, you have taken over willingly this employing enterprise, you just cannot say that you are not going to pay any attention to the (Voice Overlap)

    Mr. Norton J. Come 
    It did not bind them to the contract because in Burns as Mr. Justice Stewart indicated earlier the Board had a caveat in there for unusual circumstances and the Board found that the peculiarities of government procurement practice coupled with wage determinations under the Service Contract Act created a situation where at least with respect to certain types of government contracts, there was not the flexibility for negotiation that was present in the typical civilian type of contract which is what we have here. 
    We do not have here Lockheed’s government contracts involved in this case. 
    Now, I -- if I may be permitted to just make one other point. 
    Wiley also, we submit, disposes of the contention that what the Board is doing here is writing a contract for the parties because the Court in Wiley specifically pointed out at this case, where they had found the kind of continuity that you had in Wiley, the continuity here is much stronger than you had in Wiley. 
    The Court said this case cannot readily be assimilated to the category of those in which there is no contract whatever or none which is reasonably related to the parties sought to be obligated. 
    It was a contract and Interscience, Wiley’s predecessor was party to it. 
    We submit that is precisely the situation here a fortiori in view of the substantial identity with the original workforce.

    Well, then what did you have in mind when you suggested that -- in the response to Mr. Justice White that perhaps the other 15 that they did not take might have a grievance for not being taken over by Burns?
speaker="norton_j_come" startTime="5277.582" stopTime="5282.777">
    Mr. Norton J. Come 
    But the the grievance does not mean that they will prevail. 
    I mean, if there were (Voice Overlap) --

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Well, I assume you meant a colorable claim?

    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, it means there is still employees though, Mr. Come until they are fired in the accordance of the contract, that must be what you meant?
speaker="norton_j_come" startTime="5297.080" stopTime="5302.638">
    Mr. Norton J. Come 
    I think that this is a question that the arbitrator would have to determine as to whether or not --

    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, they are employees until they are discharged in accordance of the contract?

    Mr. Norton J. Come 
    But, query whether it would not be cause under the contract for --

    Justice Byron R. White 
    I agree, I agree.

    Mr. Norton J. Come 
    -- for Wackenhut to say that since I am closing down my operation, I am terminating you as of 5 o’clock tomorrow.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="5326.770" stopTime="5354.625">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Whose employees are they? 
    Is that not the question? 
    They are the employees of the first, the one in the posture of Wackenhut here, but I took your position before us expressed to say that for all practical purposes they are employees of whoever takes over that function, whether it is on winning by a lower bid or whether cancellation or termination of a prior contract?
speaker="norton_j_come" startTime="5354.625" stopTime="5370.815">
    Mr. Norton J. Come 
    Well, they certainly were here because Burns voluntarily took over a majority of the Wackenhut employees for reasons that were of advantage to its own operation (Voice Overlap).
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="5370.815" stopTime="5380.430">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Your friend when he argued said that even if they had not taken over any, even if they have not taken over a single employee, the legal situation would be the same?

    Mr. Norton J. Come 
    We do not go that far. 
    We do not think that you have to go that far --
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="5383.869" stopTime="5386.556">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Do you think that is to be a majority?
speaker="norton_j_come" startTime="5386.556" stopTime="5397.080">
    Mr. Norton J. Come 
    I would not say that it has to be a majority. 
    I think it has a substantial number as to be enough to give you a continuity of employment conditions in the bargaining unit.

    Unknown Speaker 
    Mr. Come I suggest that your position means that they have to take over all of them? 
    They cannot come in with this part. 
    They have to take them over all of them until and unless they are discharged in accordance of the contract?
speaker="norton_j_come" startTime="5409.547" stopTime="5440.067">
    Mr. Norton J. Come 
    Well, I am not prepared to go that far, Your Honor. 
    I think that there may be a difference for purposes of compelling arbitration under 301 and what would be the rule for purposes of establishing a bargaining obligation or representation status under the National Labor Relations Act. 
    The Court in Wiley was very careful to indicate that it was not passing on the question as to whether you had enough there to impose representation status on the union.

    Mr. Come, I have kept you overtime.

    It has been a pleasure.

    Thank you gentlemen. 
    The case is submitted.
