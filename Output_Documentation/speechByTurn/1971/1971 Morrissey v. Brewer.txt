    Before you proceed, counsel, let me mention one other factor that Mr. Justice Marshall is unavoidably absent this morning but he will participate in the cases to be heard today on the basis of the files, records, briefs and the recording of the oral argument.
speaker="w_don_brittin_jr" startTime="51.236" stopTime="252.636">
    Mr. W. Don Brittin, Jr. 
    Thank you, Your Honor. 
    I was appointed by this Court to represent petitioners in this case which is a -- which are habeas corpus cases. 
    I was likewise appointed by the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit to represent petitioners in the -- in the cases below. 
    The opinion of the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit which is under review in this case affirmed the orders of Judge Stephenson, at that time, United States District Judge for -- for the Southern District of Iowa, denying both the petitions involved in these cases. 
    Petitioners had both been prisoners in the Iowa State Penitentiary and had both been and -- had both received paroles from the Iowa Board of Parole. 
    Subsequently, each of their respective paroles were revoked by the Iowa Board of Parole such revocations having been accomplished without either of the petitioners having been afforded any type of evidentiary hearing to establish the fact of parole violation. 
    Both petitioners alleged in their petitions for habeas corpus filed in the District Court that their constitutional rights to due process of law had been violated by the action of the Iowa Board of Parole in revoking their paroles without a hearing, and that such state action constitute -- constituted a deprivation of liberty without due process of law. 
    Judge Stephenson in separate orders denied their respective petitions holding that the applicable -- Iowa statutory law did not require such a hearing and that the procedures followed by the Iowa Board of Parole had been held sufficient for federal constitutional purposes. 
    After granting the certificates of probable cause, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit heard the cases en banc and by a vote of 4-to-3 affirmed the order -- orders of Judge Stephenson. 
    This Court granted a certiorari on December of last year. 
    The question then presented for review in this case is whether or not the action of the Iowa Board of Parole in revoking petitioners' respective paroles without providing either of said petitioners a prior evidentiary hearing to establish the fact of parole violation, denied petitioners' liberty without due process of law in violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. 
    At this point, I believe, a brief factual review of the circumstances is appropriate.With respect to petitioner Morrissey first, he entered a plea of guilty to a county -- county attorney's information charging him with false uttering of a check and was sentenced by an Iowa State District Court to the Iowa State Penitentiary for a term of seven years. 
    After serving approximately one and a half years of his sentence, Morrissey was granted a parole by the Iowa Board of Parole. 
    After being on parole approximately seven months, he was arrested for a parole violation, confined in the county jail and shortly thereafter, his parole agent filed a written report of violation with the Iowa Board of Parole recommending that his parole be revoked. 
    Three days later, an order was entered by the Iowa Board of Parole revoking his parole and ordering that he be returned to the penitentiary. 
    This order was entered by the Iowa Board of Parole solely on the basis of the parole officer's written report without granting the petitioner a hearing of any kind to determine the fact of parole violation.

    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Mr. Brittin, I -- as I understand the record, the parole officer had talked to Morrissey, he -- had he not?
speaker="w_don_brittin_jr" startTime="259.571" stopTime="270.207">
    Mr. W. Don Brittin, Jr. 
    I believe you are correct, Your Honor, that he had talked to Morrissey in jail at the time he had been arrested after the -- the parole agent got the warrant for his arrest for parole violation.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="270.207" stopTime="277.397">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    And as I understand respondent's contention, Morrissey pretty well admitted the charges against him.
speaker="w_don_brittin_jr" startTime="277.397" stopTime="313.708">
    Mr. W. Don Brittin, Jr. 
    You are correct in saying that it is respondent's contention, if I understand his contention -- actually I don't wish to speak for him but I do believe that he contends that Morrissey admitted at that time that he violated the conditions of this parole. 
    However, it is our position that he did not unequivocably admit the alleged violations. 
    He admitted certain acts which may have constituted violations if there were -- were no explanations for them. 
    He did offer explanation for certain of his acts which, I believe, were in mitigation and may tend to establish that he did not in fact violate his parole.

    How about the automobile?

    Mr. W. Don Brittin, Jr. 
    Excuse me, Your Honor?

    Justice Byron R. White 
    How about the automobile?
speaker="w_don_brittin_jr" startTime="317.482" stopTime="322.681">
    Mr. W. Don Brittin, Jr. 
    The automobile? 
    He admitted that he had purchased an automobile under an assumed name. 
    I might point out here --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="322.681" stopTime="326.264">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Was that -- was that in violation or not?
speaker="w_don_brittin_jr" startTime="326.264" stopTime="335.271">
    Mr. W. Don Brittin, Jr. 
    I don't think that the parole agreement specifically required or prohibited him from doing that but I think that -- that act was probably in violation of his parole.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="335.271" stopTime="336.881">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    So he admitted that one act anyway.
speaker="w_don_brittin_jr" startTime="336.881" stopTime="344.092">
    Mr. W. Don Brittin, Jr. 
    He admitted the act, that's right, Your Honor. 
    He did not admit that he had violated his parole but he did -- you are correct to say and he did admit and (Voice Overlap) --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="344.092" stopTime="347.700">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    So there's no dispute about the facts on that particular --
speaker="w_don_brittin_jr" startTime="347.700" stopTime="350.289">
    Mr. W. Don Brittin, Jr. 
    About the automobile? 
    I think you're correct, Your Honor.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="350.289" stopTime="356.093">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    And it was just a question of -- of whether or not that should amount to a violation of the parole.
speaker="w_don_brittin_jr" startTime="356.093" stopTime="357.207">
    Mr. W. Don Brittin, Jr. 
    That's right and whether or not that --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="357.207" stopTime="360.960">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    But even if -- that even if there was a violation of whether the parole should be revoked.
speaker="w_don_brittin_jr" startTime="360.960" stopTime="435.908">
    Mr. W. Don Brittin, Jr. 
    That's right. 
    And I might point at this time that both with respect to petitioners, Morrissey and Booher, and this situation was similar with Booher. 
    He was sentenced and served two and a half years, paroled. 
    He was out about nine months. 
    And then he -- he was arrested for a parole violation. 
    The parole agent filed a written report to the board of parole, revoked his parole on the basis of that written report. 
    The violations with respect to Booher were quite similar to the ones in Morrissey. 
    He had -- he was alleged to have been driving an automobile without the permission of his parole officer and while his license was under suspension. 
    He was accused of leaving the territorial limits of O'Brien County, Iowa without the parole officer's permission. 
    And he was accused of not being able to keep a job. 
    These things -- and I think that he admitted operating the motor vehicle. 
    It was his -- apparently it was his wife's vehicle, but he did admit operating the motor vehicle without the permission of his chief parole officer. 
    I might point that these violations, what we're talking about are -- were may be called technical violations. 
    They are vital X which constitute the -- the charge X if proven would constitute technical violations of the parole agreement.

    Mr. W. Don Brittin, Jr. 
    I -- I think I indicated to him that -- that if proven, that fact would constitute an act which might form the basis of a revocation of parole. 
    However, it's a technical --
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="475.036" stopTime="488.104">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    If it's admitted, if it's admitted then why do you need proof? 
    Is -- is it -- would you say that it would be unreasonable to analogize that to a plea of guilty to a charge?
speaker="w_don_brittin_jr" startTime="488.104" stopTime="564.635">
    Mr. W. Don Brittin, Jr. 
    I think there's a great difference, Your Honor, because the only evidence in this record and I think the only evidence that there is at all whether inside or outside of the record is with respect to what the statements that the -- that the parolee made to his parole agent while he was in custody, and I don't believe that -- that the board of parole or anyone else should rely solely upon those statements when submitted to the board of parole in written form to -- as a basis for a parole revocation. 
    I believe that the parolee should be given a chance to tell the board of parole to admit or deny to the board of parole whether or not he is violating his parole. 
    And I think he should have an opportunity to appear before the Board and to confront and cross-examine the persons who are making allegations against him be it the parole officer or other persons. 
    What we're talking about is a situation in which a parole which is a -- we don't want to call it a right or a privilege, I don't think it's correct to call it either. 
    It's a status enjoyed by the -- the parolee, and we're talking about the revocation of that based upon a written statement by a parole agent. 
    I think that the Constitution --

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    That statement at least with respect to Morrissey appears on page 65 of the appendix, does it not?
speaker="w_don_brittin_jr" startTime="572.784" stopTime="573.286">
    Mr. W. Don Brittin, Jr. 
    I think that is correct, Your Honor.

    Right.
speaker="w_don_brittin_jr" startTime="591.970" stopTime="614.375">

    -- that was submitted to the District Court. 
    Is not -- it was not ever established, and I do -- do not know if this is the exact form that was signed by either one of the petitioners herein is that those forms have never been produced in this case.

    From respondent's brief, I -- I know that it was not more than two months after the revocation. 
    Now, the arrest for violation was another approximately week or two weeks depending on whether we're talking about Morrissey or Booher prior to the revocation. 
    I think, Your Honor, that any hearing -- the kind of hearing I'm talking about is a hearing prior to the order of revocation. 
    Once the order of revocation, once the parole is revoked, the prisoner is back in prison, and I don't think a hearing at that time is sufficient for constitutional purposes.

    I think transporting a prisoner back and forth may not be necessary and -- and holding him in the county jail for a period of week or so particularly so he can talk to counsel if he has some -- so he can make preparations for the hearing would be appropriate to the case, and I don't think that it would be necessary to return him to prison.

    Justice William H. Rehnquist

speaker="w_don_brittin_jr" startTime="1037.115" stopTime="1150.808">
    Mr. W. Don Brittin, Jr. 
    The issues in this case are -- are, by the record, limited to the right to hearing and do not include the question of the right to counsel. 
    However, I do believe that if this Court feels that the Constitution does require a hearing prior to revocation of parole that due to the serious nature of the consequences to a parolee should his parole be revoked without a hearing and in that, in compliance with the Constitution that there is sufficient authority for this Court to also hold that he should be entitled to appoint a counsel should he not? 
    She -- he should be entitled at least to have retained counsel present. 
    That's -- that, however, goes to the kind of hearing that's required. 
    And I think it's first and most important for the Court to determine whether or not a hearing is required. 
    And of course, it's our contention that it is. 
    And -- and in contending that a hearing is required, we rely principally upon that line of cases of -- of this Court which have held due process of law requires a hearing and an opportunity to be heard whenever important rights are substantially affected by state action. 
    And these cases I'm talking about are cases like Goldberg versus Kelly, Bell versus Burson, Groppi versus Leslie and Greene versus McElroy. 
    These cases all held that a hearing and an opportunity to be heard are required prior to the termination by state action of various types of rights or privileges enjoyed by these individuals. 
    And the types of rights that were involved in those cases are not being disqualified for unemployment compensation, an individual's interest in continued welfare benefits, an individual's interest in not having his name arbitrarily posted on a pubic list of excessive drinkers, an individual's interest in not being held in contempt of the state legislature and an individual's interest in uninsured motorist's interest, in not having his driver's license suspended after an accident.

    Mr. W. Don Brittin, Jr. 
    It does -- I'm -- you're correct that it does affect his interest. 
    However, I think that what is most important in that situation is that the board of parole in sitting on determining whether or not to release a person on parole is guided only by considerations in its expertise in -- in examining the conduct of the prisoner to determine whether or not they feel that he is a good risk for parole and should be permitted to go outside of the walls of the prison and attempt to -- to continue his rehabilitation which they believe is -- to some extent at that point on the outside of the prison.

speaker="w_don_brittin_jr" startTime="1224.185" stopTime="1295.309">
    Mr. W. Don Brittin, Jr. 
    I suppose an argument can be made that if the board of parole denies a parole when considering whether or not to -- to give a parole, denies it on the basis of allegations of fact concerning his conduct an argument could be made that he should be entitled to appear before the board as a matter of fact -- as a matter of practise, most -- as I understand, most prisoners at the time they are being considered for parole do appear before a board. 
    I think an argument could be made that he should be entitled to some hearing at that time but I'm not making that argument and I don't -- I don't think it's critical to this case because what we're talking about is a parolee -- a person whom the board of parole has decided is worthy of this conditional liberty of parole and being permitted to go back out and deciding an attempt to make a full community and family life, to contribute to the society, talking about revocation of that status, which has previously been granted by the board of parole.

    Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. 
    Mr. Brittin, in your brief, you point out that a parole hearing has a two-fold function, the first to ascertain whether or not it was a violation and the second to determine what to be done.

    Mr. W. Don Brittin, Jr. 
    I believe that's correct that the hearing could be terminated once the board of parole has heard from the parolee. 
    He has either admitted or denied the violations. 
    If he has admitted he may offered some extenuating circumstances or other facts in mitigation. 
    At that point, I believe it would be proper for the board of parole to adjourn the hearing to consider and deliberate in private with respect to what action should be taken once the facts have been established.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1510.401" stopTime="1524.240">

    There is -- there is an overlap which you suggest, however, is it there, because the -- you could show that the -- well, for example, one of the conditions of the parole agreement was that these petitioners not leave the county.

    And if you can show in a factual hearing, yes, he did leave the county but do -- you could further show that he left because his mother was dying, and he tried to reach his parole officer and it was a weekend and he couldn't reach his parole officer so in that emergency he left and he returned promptly --
speaker="w_don_brittin_jr" startTime="1541.524" stopTime="1541.706">

    I believe that --

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    -- that would show a fact -- that would show a violation of the parole but the -- it would also show mitigating circumstances that would presumably affect the parole board's decision upon whether or not to revoke the parole, does it not?
speaker="w_don_brittin_jr" startTime="1553.383" stopTime="1639.359">
    Mr. W. Don Brittin, Jr. 
    That is correct, Your Honor. 
    And in fact in this case, the reported violation with respect to petitioner Booher shows that his parole agent was out of the State for -- on vacation during the period of time the alleged violations occurred. 
    So he did not know about them first hand anyway that he was accused of leaving the county to which he was assigned and that the violation shows that -- that there are two possible reasons for leaving the county. 
    One was his wife was -- went to Iowa City, Iowa in another county to have a baby. 
    The other reason was that he was -- he was having trouble keeping himself employed and he left the county to work. 
    Now, one of the conditions of parole is that he keep himself employed and another one is that he not leave the county. 
    His parole agent was out of the State and he left the county to work. 
    I believe that circumstances like these could be shown at a hearing. 
    The parole agent -- I -- I'm not -- I'm not saying here, Your Honor, that parole agents are dirty guys and we shouldn't believe them but I'm saying that there are circumstances that exist that were biased or prejudiced or even honest misinformation lead to the parole revocations without a hearing, and I believe that due process requires that before a parolee is -- has his condition of liberty terminated, he is sent back to the prison for five to seven additional years that he is entitled to a hearing to establish the fact that the parole violation before the board goes any further to determine whether or not his parole should be terminated.

    Mr. W. Don Brittin, Jr. 
    And to argue mitigating circumstances in the event that he does admit the fact. 
    Take the situation of Booher leaving the county to find -- to -- to work. 
    He is -- he's in the heart of this dilemma. 
    If he -- if he has a job offer outside of the county, he'll be violating his parole agreement. 
    If he doesn't take it, he'll be violating the parole agreement if he goes out of the county to work. 
    I think circumstances like these particularly when the -- when the revocation is based on what we may call technical violations that parolee is entitled to a hearing to establish the fact of violation. 
    If the parolee is charged with an act that constitutes a crime of an armed robbery, a burglary or something like that, the criminal process comes into play. 
    He can be arrested for a violation of that crime and once he is convicted of that crime, he's going to be in custody probably while that crime is being considered.

    The parole agreement says he has to obtain permission from the chief parole officer which is in -- they're more in the capital of the State. 
    I assume that when the parole agent is on gone from the county that then the chief parole officer in Des Moines is the person that has the immediate supervision of that parolee. 
    It's a matter of saying that there's no other agent in the county which will handle it at time.

speaker="lawrence_s_seuferer" startTime="1902.356" stopTime="1985.539">
    Mr. Lawrence S. Seuferer 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    I think I should begin in the light of some of the questions that have brought out a lot of the factual circumstances of this case by making a couple of points concerning the factual aspects of -- of the case with regard to the hearings. 
    We also did not realize that there were hearings in this case when -- when I came into it at any rate. 
    And had this -- the posture of the question which is presently before this Court been somewhat different at the District Court level, we undoubtably would have had an evidentiary hearing there where all of the stuff would have been brought out. 
    As it was, we did not. 
    There is an indication in the record in the appendix at page 56 that petitioner Morrissey in fact received a hearing before the state board of parole. 
    It's in the first paragraph on page 56. 
    He denies he received a revocation hearing. 
    In the context of the rest of the petition, I think the -- the inference is clear that that was before arrest or before revocation. 
    And then he suggests that he was denied counsel to represent him at said hearing that was conducted behind closed doors by the state board of parole. 
    It was this matter that --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1985.539" stopTime="1987.527">

    Used the word "said" at least.
speaker="lawrence_s_seuferer" startTime="1990.336" stopTime="2034.989">
    Mr. Lawrence S. Seuferer 
    Yes, I -- I believe that on its face, it does appear inconsistent. 
    It's only at the entire petition which was a petition for writ of habeas corpus filed in Lee County District Court. 
    If the entire petition is read, it appears that his -- he's saying, “I didn't receive a revocation hearing before my parole was revoked.

    Mr. Lawrence S. Seuferer 
    The practice is, as we've stated in our brief, is to provide a post-revocation hearing. 
    In other words, the parole is revoked, they're sent back to the institution from whence they came. 
    And within no longer than two months, the board of parole sits at the various institutions around the State and conducts these hearings.

    The parole officer hears of a violation as he did in this case through some method. 
    He investigates it to some extent. 
    He confronts the parolee with it as he did in this case and gets whatever he has to say about it. 
    He writes up his report, submits it along with his recommendations to the board of parole and on the basis of this, they revoke the parole or do not revoke the parole.

    Now, all of these you've learned, what? 
    Since certiorari was granted in this case?
speaker="lawrence_s_seuferer" startTime="2179.628" stopTime="2182.917">
    Mr. Lawrence S. Seuferer 
    In fact, Your Honor, since the appendix was prepared in this case. 
    I came up --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2182.917" stopTime="2185.008">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    In your conversations with Mr. Badel?
speaker="lawrence_s_seuferer" startTime="2185.008" stopTime="2301.733">
    Mr. Lawrence S. Seuferer 
    Yes, I -- I came into -- came into this case only at the time certiorari was granted. 
    I was not familiar with it. 
    And looking through the appendix, when I came across this aspect about Mr. Morrissey, that triggered my talking to this individuals and that's where this information came to light. 
    I think it's unfortunate that an evidentiary hearing was not held at the District Court level because that would undoubtedly have brought these matters out. 
    It is our -- our contention, however, that the question, the posture of the question in this case is that a hearing was not granted prior to revocation. 
    And in any event the hearing that was granted was most certainly after the initial act of revocation. 
    There is a reason, a reason that is not unfavorable to the parolee as a matter of fact as to why the initial revocation takes place at the time it does. 
    Section of the Iowa Code, 247.12, which is -- is set out early in petitioner's brief, indicates that a parolee is not credited with time served while he's on parole, this is against his original sentence, or while he is away from the institution if his parole his is revoked. 
    What this means is that if an individual, petitioners in this case, for instance, sat in the county jail or the local jail until such time as the parole board could make arrangements to get there with all the facilities it would be necessary for some sort of hearing, none of that time would count against their original sentence. 
    What the initial action of the parole board does is it provides that as soon as revocation takes place, they're returned to the institution and any time they serve subsequent to that but still prior to any hearing, they may be held that the institution is credited against their original sentence. 
    This is --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2301.733" stopTime="2316.282">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    But then it wouldn't make much difference to -- to your procedure if the formality of revocation didn't take place until he was returned to the institution.
speaker="lawrence_s_seuferer" startTime="2316.282" stopTime="2324.791">
    Mr. Lawrence S. Seuferer 
    Under the -- under -- the way the procedure actually operates it probably wouldn't Your Honor. 
    It makes a difference only in terms of -- well, let me -- let me back up a statement.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2324.791" stopTime="2340.532">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    It would be -- it would be merely a -- it's a question of a label, that instead of calling the -- the action the parole board takes when it now revokes a revocation, you could get -- it could serve a sort of a preliminary hearing.
speaker="lawrence_s_seuferer" startTime="2340.532" stopTime="2353.797">
    Mr. Lawrence S. Seuferer 
    That's not entirely correct, Your Honor. 
    And as far as our position goes, that would be true on the face of it. 
    However, if the parole was not revoked, the individual would not be sent back to the institution.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2353.797" stopTime="2355.550">
    Justice Byron R. White

    Mr. Lawrence S. Seuferer 
    Okay. 
    The -- the record that would indicate a hearing was held in this case would be a record held by the parole board. 
    At any rate in its central office in Des Moines may not -- may well not be a part of the -- of the total prison records. 
    Additionally, we feel that the -- the question in this case being a prior hearing that there are -- there are several reasons why a hearing prior to revocation are not -- is not -- not necessary and not advantageous. 
    One of the things is the aspect of detriment to the parolee we do not feel is there. 
    Obviously, if he's taken away from a job, if he's deprived of -- of living at home with his family and so forth, these deprivations are going to be there whether we have a prior hearing or not under the system as it works and almost all the cases because the -- the parole violations, even though they may only be allegations at one point, in most cases, are sufficient to justify the issuing of a warrant and picking him up and holding -- holding him in a county jail. 
    So whether he really sits in the county jail or the penitentiary seems relatively immaterial in terms of his interest in remaining on his conditional liberty.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2575.913" stopTime="2616.607">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    But isn't there -- isn't there a great deal of difference including a psychological difference and -- when alone and perhaps a burden of proof difference as to whether or not the hearing is held prior to the decision of the parole board to revoke parole as contrasted with the hearing after that fate, I call plea, after the board has decided to revoke parole, then there's a very great burden, is there not, on the parolee to -- to convince the board to undo what it's done? 
    I'm thinking of cases like Armstrong against Manzo. 
    You may be familiar with. 
    And there are many others that emphasize the importance of a prior hearing before the decision is made.
speaker="lawrence_s_seuferer" startTime="2616.607" stopTime="2628.917">
    Mr. Lawrence S. Seuferer 
    Your Honor, I think if the situation was one where the parolee steadfastly denied the allegations alleged that that psychological difference might come -- might come into practice.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2628.917" stopTime="2637.936">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    And how about burden of proof? 
    I suppose they had no formal principles that have been worked out in parole revocation as to burden of proof, has -- has there been?
speaker="lawrence_s_seuferer" startTime="2637.936" stopTime="2688.015">
    Mr. Lawrence S. Seuferer 
    No, Your Honor. 
    It's -- as a -- as a practical matter, I guess it has really proved necessary too because there are so few cases where -- where anything changes or so few cases where there is a denial of the offense. 
    And in fact, in these two cases here not only do the -- the reports of violation which admittedly the comments in there are the comments of the parole officer as taken from the individual parolee. 
    But in both of those instances, if they -- if they are carefully read, the -- the rules that he alleges were violated, the petitioners admit the violation of those rules. 
    And I think the significant thing about it is nowhere in all of the proceedings of this case including at this level have they ever denied commission of those offenses. 
    Have they ever said, “We didn't do what they said we did.” 
    Nowhere --

    Mr. Lawrence S. Seuferer 
    I think, Your Honor, that there's a point to be made in that respect. 
    However, I think there's a point that weighs against that too. 
    And that you'll notice I think in -- in both of these cases and in the majority of the cases a parole is not revoked on the basis of one alleged violation. 
    In other words, there are three in both of these instances. 
    And usually, I think also that the report of violations indicates there's some past problem. 
    Normally, the people we're talking here, the parole officers and the board of parole, are interested in a rehabilitative process. 
    It's -- it's an expensive proposition to -- to maintain a prisoner, and it's not as expensive to maintain a parolee. 
    They're interested in working with these people and --

    And I think that the -- I think there is something to be said for the mitigating circumstances but I believe this is a discretionary question that has to be weighed by the board along with this guy's entire past history, including the psychiatry reports they have from the institution when he was there, his performance there, everything else. 
    And I think in the -- in the sum total of things that this decision, the second decision, if you will, as to whether or not the parole should be revoked, once the fact of violation is established, is such a discretionary matter and such involves so many non-legal, non-technical type considerations that it would serve no useful purpose to have a factual proof on some of these things. 
    If they were brought to the attention of the board of parole at any rate, in other words, they knew about --

    Mr. Lawrence S. Seuferer

    In this kind of situation where you have three alleged violations all admitted, I would say almost always they're going to buy that recommendation.

    Mr. Seuferer, I'm looking at page 67 of the appendix now. 
    At the bottom of the page is -- under Roman numeral III, parolee's version of the offenses and that is followed by a summary of the effort on the part of the parole officer to get a response. 
    And --
speaker="lawrence_s_seuferer" startTime="3369.720" stopTime="3370.524">
    Mr. Lawrence S. Seuferer 
    That's correct, Your Honor.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="3370.524" stopTime="3389.571">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    -- that's followed in turn by a recital of previous violations and his parole history. 
    Is this report, if you know, typical of the types of reports which the parole agents make to the board in connection with the proposed revocation?
speaker="lawrence_s_seuferer" startTime="3389.571" stopTime="3434.332">
    Mr. Lawrence S. Seuferer 
    I think it's -- it's substantially typical in terms of -- of what they've covered. 
    It's not necessarily in terms of form, and in a lot of cases, we may not know of some of the previous violations and that sort of information. 
    But in terms of -- of setting out the rules violated, setting some sort of summary of -- of how they were -- they were violated, setting out something about the parolee's version of these offenses and our conclusion and recommendation. 
    That, I think, is substantially what the bulk of them cover. 
    As far as this information about previous violations and parole history if they know it, if they're aware of it, have been his parole officer all the time, they generally will include something about that if they don't which we may not, they don't.

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Now, you've said in response to some questions from the bench that before the warrant, the violation, parole violation warrant is served in the arrest made, there is some local magistrate or officer, a neutral officer who issues that magistrate, just who is that?
speaker="lawrence_s_seuferer" startTime="3456.182" stopTime="3456.303">
    Mr. Lawrence S. Seuferer 
    Your Honor that's --
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="3456.303" stopTime="3458.310">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    The municipal judge or what kind of an officer?
speaker="lawrence_s_seuferer" startTime="3458.310" stopTime="3466.382">
    Mr. Lawrence S. Seuferer 
    No, I -- I'm not -- Your Honor, I'm not really sure who issues that warrant. 
    It's a -- maybe -- I'm sure it's not, in most instances, a judge. 
    Some sort --
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="3466.382" stopTime="3470.128">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    But it's a local -- it's a person in the locality where the agent and the --

    I think --

    -- violator.
speaker="lawrence_s_seuferer" startTime="3470.383" stopTime="3488.008">
    Mr. Lawrence S. Seuferer 
    -- that is usually the situation. 
    But it's -- it's on the basis of -- I think I should make this clear, it's on the basis of the approval really by the state chief parole officer in Des Moines. 
    In other words, the -- the local judge or the local magistrate is not in nine times -- I'm not -- in nine times out a hundred are going to refuse to issue a warrant.

    This is just, in all practice --

    It's a procedure thing.

    -- for -- for all intents and purposes it's a case of a parole desk police officer determining that the facts of such, that there's probable cause to arrest and arresting.

    Mr. Lawrence S. Seuferer 
    In essence that's correct, Your Honor. 
    I thought it's --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3501.246" stopTime="3511.385">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    And I thought it's down under 247.9 of your code which makes a parolee subject to anytime to be taken into custody.

    Mr. Lawrence S. Seuferer

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Would it administratively be feasible if the process that's covered in this report of the parole officer be presented to that local magistrate or whatever other officer may be involved on the warrant and have him at least make a preliminary determination and give the parolee an opportunity to answer to the specific charges before the revocation -- before the arrest was made?
speaker="lawrence_s_seuferer" startTime="3548.051" stopTime="3550.691">
    Mr. Lawrence S. Seuferer 
    If your question is would that be administratively possible --

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Yes.

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Remember in Hyser against Reed that was what was ordered with respect to the federal system that within --

    Mr. Lawrence S. Seuferer 
    That's correct.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="3559.122" stopTime="3575.776">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    -- within a reasonable time, after the determination of a probable violation, the parolee must be given an opportunity to be heard to show why he should not be arrested and returned to the federal institution.
speaker="lawrence_s_seuferer" startTime="3575.776" stopTime="3658.711">
    Mr. Lawrence S. Seuferer 
    That's correct, Your Honor. 
    And I -- the only problem that comes to mind on that kind of process is the -- the local magistrate, if you will, is the -- is going to be considering certainly only the facts that he has before him. 
    This is -- all these would be seem in -- in the case of where there's no question or where the individual is admitted the violations, this would seem unnecessary, unless there's some question of voluntariness of that admission. 
    And at least insofar as the cases of petitioners, there's never been any allegation that they were in anyway coerced into -- in anything they did. 
    Administratively possible, I think, yes, Your Honor, that it would be. 
    We would then in -- in summary -- our contention is that petitioners Morrissey and Booher both admitted the fact to parole violation, have never in any manner denied that admission. 
    And in light of these facts, we would submit that regardless of what may be nice or better maybe in a -- in a general proposition, the two petitioners here got all the process they would do, and we respectfully request that this Court affirm the lower court decision. 
    Thank you.
