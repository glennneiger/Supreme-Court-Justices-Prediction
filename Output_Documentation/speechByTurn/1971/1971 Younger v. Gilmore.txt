    Mr. George R. Nock 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    Five years ago, last month the Director of Corrections in California adopted a new regulation regarding prison law library. 
    It was in response to a certain problem he faced. 
    In two of the three institutions under his control there were few or any law books at all. 
    In two of them, San Clinton and Folsom there had over the years accumulated a rather rugged collection of law books mostly case reports and mostly more than 10 years old. 
    Of course such obsolete law books were worst than to assist. 
    They were potentially dangerous because misleading. 
    Nonetheless, despite the poor condition of the law libraries, inmates and other institutions have a misimpression that they were first class library and with that, the director has request to transfers to San Clinton and Folsom in order to utilize the library facilities. 
    The new rules attempted to solve those problems by standardizing the libraries at all 14 institutions. 
    This was to be done by providing a carefully selective list of what they call basic codes and references.

    Well, the adoption of the regulation Your Honor came prior to the filing of this complaint. 
    The regulation was adopted on September 19, 1966 and complaint is filed in response to the adoption of regulation --

speaker="george_r_nock" startTime="138.568" stopTime="330.657">
    Mr. George R. Nock 
    Thank you, Your Honor. 
    This carefully selected list of law books contained the various Codes of the State of California designing team in census, the State and Federal Constitution, a Law Dictionary, Rules of this Court, the California Courts, and Court of Appeals of the Ninth Circuit, inadvertently omitted and regrettably so all the rules by Federal District Courts in California. 
    And also in the list where in The Standard Work on California Criminal procedure, Mr. Watkins(ph) worked on that title and the subscription to the weekly law digest, the California publication which summarizes the most recent decisions of this Court and the California Courts and all areas including criminal law. 
    The response were totaling this complaint on October 27, 1966 by the plaintiffs, a group of inmates. 
    They challenged the constitutionality of the regulation because it provided, as necessary part of the standardization plan that law books, existing law books at the two institutions, San Clinton and Folsom would have to be removed. 
    A counsel was ultimately appointed, the very able gentlemen on my right. 
    Thereafter, I think at all times through counsel, the inmates filed an amended complaint alleging new causes of action not related to the infinite deal and the filing motion to a three-judge court. 
    This motion was denied but then it was able to persuade the single judge to certify the question as of propriety of the three-judge court to the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit and an interlocutory appeal along that issue was taken. 
    The Court of Appeals held it was the case of a three-judge court and it reversed the order of the District Court. 
    We disagreed and filed a certiorari petition. 
    Now, during this premise as early as they could it was not a three-judge court case. 
    Our position is requested and filed and certiorari was unanimously denied. 
    The case went back to the District Court where a three-judge court was convened. 
    The Court met on August 6, 1969, requested that the party isolate the issue suitable for a three-judge court determination and certify them clearly and aid the court as much as possible in the existing issues to those of law. 
    We complied by filing lengthy speculation and several statement of issues which we listed five issues, and the first two of which we consider relevant to the appeal and that was the constitutionality under first the Due Process Clause and second to Equal Protection Clause of this regulation. 
    We stipulated and suggested relief which included, should the Court find the regulation unconstitutional or the declaration has been constitutionality and then the injunction against this enforcement.

    Under the present regulations, they would not be accepted at San Clinton Prison, Your Honor. 
    They would be accepted by the State Library of California to add to its prisoner collection which is circulated among the various inmates upon request, subject to the availability, if the request is done.

    The regulation did not contemplate anyone decreasing the extensive collection of law books to the state.

    For each prison. 
    It will vary from institution to institution depending on state. 
    The District Court held a second hearing, oral argument. 
    At no time had the Court given any indication that intended to or they are even considered granting relief farther than that asked for in the complaints or based upon stipulation, but it did. 
    It held that the list of law books is unconstitutional and at the state had an obligation to turn it either extensive and it seems very extensive collection of law books or alternatively to provide lawyers or law students to assist the inmates or to provide some unspecified and perhaps not even conceived of other method of assisting inmates in preparation of their petitions and complaints. 
    Upon that order, in enjoining the enforcement of the regulation and mandating new regulations we have appealed and we contend that this Court has Jurisdiction to hear this appeal, that the regulations in question do not bar access to the Courts during that, do not deny them equal protection of the law and that the mandatory injunction of the District Court violate the Eleventh Amendment. 
    The issue of jurisdiction is one of which the parties did not raise. 
    We are in agreement that this Court has jurisdiction. 
    The issue has been raised by the Court itself in its order requesting special memorandum on issue of the three-judge District Court’s Jurisdiction, that of course is coming shortly after the filing of the jurisdictional statement and in the postponement rather than notation of jurisdiction in February this year.

    Mr. George R. Nock 
    Well I urge of perusal and big perusal of it which show that all the significant cases with this Court in the Ninth Circuit with regards to substitute Constitutional rights if prisoners are there. 
    Our position on jurisdiction is simple one of reach to the color that the issue has been determined by a final judgment of the Court of Appeals. 
    We cannot take too much though. 
    I argued that it was not a three-judge court case. 
    We lost the argument before this Court. 
    The judgment became final and now I can only assert that it was the determinably inequitable. 
    That this might be the Court to all that there is no jurisdiction and send the matter back for a further appeal, other case is nearly five years old. 
    If we are still litigating in proper composition of the tribunal to determine it then the law has failed and we think that any discretion imposing it in this Court should be exercised in favor of assuming jurisdiction. 
    And that by viewing the case the judgment of the Court of Appeals is res judicata. 
    There is no discretion and jurisdiction is clear and must be accepted. 
    With regard to the question of access to the Courts we do not believe that law books are necessary for access to the Courts. 
    It is a cliché to say, but it would be equally true that all an inmate has to do is set-out in reasonably intelligible form the statement is after the same. 
    The statement might be very long to charge with case of complaint. 
    It might be short if he is claiming, he pleaded guilty because he was beaten or because they have found something that he did not get, but all he has to do is set them out. 
    The Court will apply the law, arguments, citations, and authority. 
    After this it may consider not only necessary, but that is even improper. 
    In habeas corpus petition themselves, notwithstanding that lawyers will attend the memorandum points and authorities in most cases. 
    Inmates are not well equipped to use law books, at least they are not relative to use the United States Reports, the California Reports, the Federal Reports, U.S. Law Week and the other publications alluded to by the District Court as not being present. 
    It is questionable what value those books would be to an inmate in helping him to file a Section 2254 petition as Mr. Justice Marshall asked because they do not give in any reasonably acceptable and understandable point of rules in jurisdiction and then you -- that an inmate might have a little trouble in getting. 
    He gets those from the forms, from Mr. Watkins book and from the Weekly Law Digest. 
    The --

    Mr. George R. Nock 
    That is one issue because the Court enjoined the enforcement of the regulation requiring removal of law books into institution to get an outright reversal of that order. 
    We have to contend that there is no constitutional right at all. 
    We would be happy of course finding that if any constitutional (Inaudible) that is made by this writ, and I might add there are omissions in the list which presumably would be rectified in the event of deferment. 
    Minor omissions such as the absence of the United States Code, the judicial code I should say, 28 U.S.C.

    District Court Rule?
speaker="george_r_nock" startTime="1058.881" stopTime="1181.633">
    Mr. George R. Nock 
    District Court Rules certainly should be in there. 
    That was a serious inadvertent there for three volumes, two of them paperback, one hardcover would provide we think all consumable omissions, namely the volume containing 28 U.S.C., Federal Appellate Procedure, Federal Civil Procedure, the volume containing the rules for all California and California Federal Courts and Mr. Selbrooks (ph) book on habeas corpus. 
    But with those possible deficiencies we submit that the list adequately provides what the inmates need. 
    Equal protection has overtly played in here as a sort of neglect. 
    The District Court relied on it, but the basic course of its position was that the restricted nature of the law book was denied inmates' access to the Courts. 
    We think that it is not declared totally speak equal protection in this context because if inmate or by their indigency disadvantaged so greatly that they are denied in fact of this access of the Court and of course equal protection would be denied in any other circumstances because the mere fact that they are not as well of as a rich man does not add much to the discussion that equal protection, including a major issue. 
    However, we give it some attention, more attention that might hear in our reply brief. 
    Finally, the Eleventh Amendment issue was of considerable importance. 
    That amendment is not been much discussed by this Court in recent years, but it has been given deal of attention in the Lower Courts and many Lower Courts have exceeded to the temptation to order the States to appropriate money. 
    Judge Virlyn Moore in his opinion in Westberry versus Fischer 309 F. Supp. 12 has effectively answered this contention. 
    At this time I would like to with the Court’s permission, reserve any time remaining after lunch for rebuttal. 
   
   
   
   Argument of John Eshleman Wahl
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1181.633" stopTime="1187.266">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Very well. 
    Mr. Wahl.
speaker="john_eshleman_wahl" startTime="1187.266" stopTime="1446.134">
    Mr. John Eshleman Wahl 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    This case is about tools which are necessary for access to the Courts. 
    In the English speaking world the common law entries for history of development of tools which are necessary for access to Courts has been a history wherein the executive has resisted the extension and the granting of these tools, starting with the great struggle to achieve the great writ of freedom, the writ of habeas corpus highlighted by the English statute in 1695 wherein treason defendants were allowed to have counsel at the trials. 
    Before 1695, neither treason nor felony defendants of course could have counsel. 
    Then highlighted by our own Sixth Amendment because at that time in England even felony defendants could not have counsel, they did not get the right to counsel until 1836. 
    Finally highlighted by our great line, your great line of equal protection cases rendering rights to transcripts and counsel beginning perhaps in 1956 with Griffin versus Illinois through Andrews versus California, so on and so forth. 
    As I have mentioned the executive has historically resisted the making available tools for access to the Courts and we believe that executive branch of the California government again does so here and does so strongly and does so quite ably through my brother Nock. 
    We concur with the Attorney General of California that this is a proper case to be heard by a three-judge court and the three-judge court was properly convened. 
    We think the strong interest of the California government even resisting the order of granting relief which came from that three-judge court shows that this is the kind of case that Congress had in mind in passing Section 2281 of Title 28. 
    This regulation which was promulgated pursuant to authority granted by the California Penal Code, by the California Director of Corrections, involves the legislative policy of California. 
    Section 5058 of the California Penal Code allows the Director of Corrections to provide regulations, to establish regulations for the government of the California Prisons and the change from at his pleasure and he has done so here as counsel pointed out. 
    In September of 1966, five years ago, he promulgated a regulation limiting law books in prison libraries to 12 named law books with which you are familiar from counsel’s argument. 
    He also incidentally in the same transmittal letter in which he promulgated that regulation, promulgated an additional regulation ordering all law books in inmates' personal possession removed and destroyed. 
    Since that time the California legislature has enacted California Penal Code, Section 2600 which allows inmates to receive and own law books in their own cells. 
    But the restriction and this is the whole aspect of this regulation which is really onerous, the restriction of prison libraries to 12 named law books we contend violates the rights of indigent inmates and only indigent inmates to access to the Courts, it is an integral aspect of due process of law and their rights to equal protection of the laws.

    Mr. John Eshleman Wahl 
    Yes, Your Honor, I do. 
    The best tool you can have, if you want to go in the Court is a lawyer, it is the best way you can get. 
    The second best tool if you cannot afford a lawyer is access to the law, access to the opinions, to the substance, to the procedural writing on the law. 
    I think the inmate that is very wealthy can retain counsel. 
    The inmate that has means, but not quite as much means can buy law books. 
    The inmate that has nothing can buy nothing.

    Yes, I believe though that when he admits in his opening brief on page 22, the three additional law books in the prison libraries giving knowledge of venue, jurisdiction, proper parties, respondent and exhaustion of remedies and perhaps hopefully does not say this even proper remedies. 
    For instance, whether it should be a petition for writ of coram nobis or a petition for writ of habeas corpus which in California are brought in different Courts. 
    Petition for habeas corpus is brought in the Courts which has jurisdiction over the county in which the prisoner is incarcerated. 
    Petition of writ of coram nobis is brought in the Court where the petitioner was convicted. 
    He admits in his brief that three more books would give the use procedural or this procedural law make it available to the prisoners.

    Mr. John Eshleman Wahl 
    I put very little value. 
    I think that counsel’s position is or rather the state's position is that this -- that all an inmate needs to do is allege facts on a blank, on his blank forms and hand them in so to speak and the Courts will do everything that is necessary to ensure that the inmate gets a fair hearing. 
    Well, this is impossible by the number of petitions that are filed. 
    The inmate who files a post conviction petition has a tremendous burden because he has already had a trial. 
    Perhaps he has had an appeal, but as you know from the brief of amicus, California does not at this point inform inmates or who have been convicted that they have a right to an appeal and a right to counsel on appeal immediately after their appeal. 
    So many times the inmates' first shot in essence an substitute for an appeal is a petition for writ of coram nobis or petition for habeas corpus.

    Mr. John Eshleman Wahl 
    There is legislation. 
    There is perspective legislation which will establish a state wide post conviction or perhaps not all post convictions, but appellant defense core. 
    There are public defenders now in California, but in a number of counties, but this public defenders only represent on appeal if they decide the appeal is worthwhile.

    Mr. John Eshleman Wahl

    Mr. John Eshleman Wahl 
    That is correct. 
    I think that it would be cheaper of course to provide law books in prison libraries than to establish a state wide system of appellate defendants, but of course varied considerations are not the important thing.

    Mr. John Eshleman Wahl 
    This is my understanding and I believe it has not passed even one house here. 
    I believe it is pending in the senate. 
    I am not sure. 
    Your Honor when you -- Your Honors, when you overruled Bates versus Brady in 1963 in deciding Gideon, a great number of the kinds of problems which we are touching on here were urged upon you by the State of Florida that if you do this you will encourage litigation because new tools, in that case counsel would be available, be made available to many, many defendants and inmates. 
    That there be an enormous burden on the taxpayers and that the matter would create myriad and complex new league of questions.

    I think that the effect of it has been practical --

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    From advantage point I would say that is longer --
speaker="john_eshleman_wahl" startTime="2904.275" stopTime="2997.283">
    Mr. John Eshleman Wahl 
    Well, the practical of that in this case I think would be therapeutic and educational. 
    It is much better to let inmates try to get out of prison using law books than in more socially unacceptable ways. 
    The psychological effect on a poor man who cannot have more than the 12 books which the executive says he can have them when somebody else in the next trial has 14 lawyers in a New York firm working on his case is rather profound. 
    Inmates know what laymen generally know, effective access to the courts has to include knowledge of the law through some kind of tool. 
    Otherwise there is no need for the bar. 
    There will just be a need for the bench. 
    If you put the duty on the judge of protecting the rights of the post conviction petitioners, you make the judge an advocate and I think that the inmate has to have knowledge of the law to allege facts, I will not touch on that more than briefly. 
    He does not know what facts to allege unless he has knowledge of the law. 
    He does not know how to allege the facts and which facts are not relevant or material at all. 
    Here you have a situation where California makes habeas corpus and coram nobis available, but denies their effective availability to propers and this would seem to violate all your line of equal protection cases. 
    Thank you, very much.

    I got the distinction impression from reading the opinion that it had more than one and I felt that the opinion is written on the premise, perhaps the matter should be investigated before the case can be held to stand to the authorities that or to stand for the proposition of three-judge Court is not required.

    Mr. George R. Nock 
    Oh! I missed that Your Honor. 
    I am not aware of any others except (Inaudible) which did not decide the particular point and the affirmance across the case which is cited in the area. 
    Certiorari petition and Mr. (Inaudible). 
    Mr. Justice Brennan asked about Section 2600 that is Section which is called the inmate bill of rights. 
    It does not mention law books. 
    It just gives inmates the right to purchase, receive and read written material of all description with certain specific exceptions. 
    Yet it has been interpreted and I think corrected by the director of correction as requiring the inmates to be allowed to purchase a law book at specified space limitation. 
    But it is rather ironic in that the full record will show that prior to enactment of the section, prison rules provides inmates to own personally on law books and to posses personally on law books and the reason for this and the basis on which we depended it was equal protection. 
    The director did not want to have the appellant inmate allowed to own more than the two law books that is not available to the indigent inmate and it was firstly then in the decision because of the concept of the statute. 
    It did not want to litigate in the state courts on unconstitutionality of statute upon that ground. 
    The appointment of counsel in the collateral proceedings is based on Mr. Justice White is detailed in People versus Shipman which is cited in our brief, that is 62 California 2nd, Shipman where the court in that case dealt with habeas corpus on officially moratorium petition is presented then counsel is appointed normally to handle the evidentiary hearing. 
    There is no appeal in habeas corpus --

    And in coram nobis, the counsel was appointed in the Trial Court and as a matter of fact this counsel is always appointed automatically in the Court reviewing the denial of coram nobis for the case in litigation. 
    Mr. Wahl handled in various cases. 
    Mr. Chief Justice as commonly said to this books were in each prison and the regulations provide that there will be sufficient copies to provide regular access on that list in a weekly basis that is Administrative Manual Section 230.042 which is set out in both needs in the appendix.

    Indeed an infinite number that is included. 
    They justified also that if there are any legal aid attorneys or public defenders. 
    They are not for the purpose of the habeas corpus although in one county, Solano County where the institution is located, the Judge automatically appoints counsel -- appoints the public defenders or counsel whenever an order to show cause is issued. 
    He does not however normally confer with prisons. 
    Some County public defenders will continue to represent their clients, appellant clients in post-conviction proceedings. 
    Whether they are allowed to do so as a matter of between them in a particular for the supervisors.

    We take no such position. 
    I have no idea whether it would encourage litigation or not. 
    Personally I think law books have make no difference in the volume of litigation or question of how many, the percentage I should think how frivolous petition. 
    But legal assistance before even lawsuit, it might cut down the volume of frivolous petitions somewhat although that is speculative the way it has to rely on experiences as the case is adopted uniform for his conviction. 
    Procedure doctrine and what I can tell by reading the law review articles locally on the subject of the verdict is not in yet.
