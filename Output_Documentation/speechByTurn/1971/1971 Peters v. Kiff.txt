    Mr. Edward T. M. Garland 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court. 
    The case before you comes on a simple record and that it comes simply predicated upon the filing of the federal habeas corpus petition and there was no hearing, and then it was dismissed by the Court. 
    An appeal was taken to the Fifth Circuit stating denial of equal protection of the law and due process of law as it related to the claims of the petitioner. 
    Those same claims where in the petition for habeas corpus and they related to the systematic exclusion of blacks from the grand jury and the petit jury. 
    All of which where taken from the same list of the grand jurors and the petit jurors. 
    That claim was urged in the Circuit Court and was urged both on the basis of equal protection and due process in violation of Fourteenth Amendment. 
    It is from the denial in Fifth Circuit Court.

    I would say yes if though, if there was identifiable segment of the community and those where excluded that the concept of the fundamental concept of the jury would require that.

    Unknown Speaker 
    (Inaudible)require jury trial in criminal cases?
speaker="edward_t_m_garland" startTime="544.550" stopTime="766.717">
    Mr. Edward T. M. Garland 
    It provides for jury trial in criminal cases Your Honor and of course the defendant may weight it in all criminal cases both misdemeanor and felony. 
    In considering this issue of course, I think the Court recognizes that the black man acknowledge that he can complain, and the State seems to rely on some concept of prejudice as needing to be shown. 
    It is the position of the petitioner that in fact there is prejudice to the petitioner, and that that prejudice comes from the essence of the requirement of the jury. 
    What the jury means. 
    I think this Court has talked about the value of the cross-section in Duncan versus Louisiana and has talked about it in Williams versus Florida, and I think there, the fact that there must be between the Government and the defendant, the voice of the people has been recognized. 
    I submit to you that one of the consideration should be that is the voice of all of the people. 
    Now, how there is prejudice is a more speculative matter? 
    It is speculative in that you have to analyze what a jury trial in fact amounts to and how the minds of respective jurors worked but I would suggest to the Court that in fact there is prejudice when the broad base of the jury is destroyed in this respect. 
    The jury stands as the barrier against the various vices that it can occur in the jury trial. 
    Now, those may be improper acts of conduct by a prosecutor, hopefully not but improper acts of by statute -- by a judge, or improper acts by a juror, a particular juror such as someone attempting to influence the jury. 
    In addition to those factors that the jury stands as a buffer between there’s the question of the nature of the crime and how that particular crime affects a particular jury. 
    All the standing of the defendant, his particular status in reference to the community that it is about to try, or the status of the victim, or the status of the witnesses. 
    The concept that I submit to you that the defendant in fact is prejudiced is that as to those possible violations and those possible acts that depart from what we say is the right to a fair jury that the broader the base, the more likely who there is that they will not be the influence of any of those things to such an extent is to deny the fairness of trial. 
    So, I think the very concept of what the provision for trial by jury means is that we try to strive toward the system that will get us the fairest possible result. 
    So, we say that --
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="766.717" stopTime="770.184">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Fairest possible result or the fairest possible jury?
speaker="edward_t_m_garland" startTime="770.184" stopTime="840.924">
    Mr. Edward T. M. Garland 
    Well, I would say fairest jury, and the result be in that you if you have a fair jury, that is the result you see. 
    That that is the closest you can come to justice. 
    Now, we are not talking about the standpoint of what one side of the other wants in the jury, Your Honor. 
    But as to those things, the broad base amount to insurance in reference to the ability of the jury to withstand any number of unfair prejudice issue. 
    So as to that very basis that I submit to you that the concept that seems to have been the basis of the opinion below that there was no prejudice to this man is it not or to a white person complaining the exclusion of blacks is an error that there in fact is a prejudice. 
    And of course, in speaking of the language that is been used by the Court’s, there is a narrowing of attitudes, some of these distinct flavor of the jury is lost, and you can also consider of course that the whole is different from the parts.

speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="941.262" stopTime="952.609">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Yes, but your basis for that is that you have this broad base you need, and you only complain because no Negro was considered?
speaker="edward_t_m_garland" startTime="952.609" stopTime="992.776">
    Mr. Edward T. M. Garland 
    That was the only one we knew in advance that in fact we could prove without difficulty because the jury list had been selected in the same method that it been declared to be invalid previously and we saw, we have never had a chance to present proof in this case. 
    In the record, it is twice been filed. 
    It has never been any evidentiary hearing. 
    So there’s no sense that -- from my standpoint, no sense going carrying a greater burden under the allegations and we need it. 
    It was rather clear that there was a disparity that previous jury list selected by the same process who was 14% black, 86% white and the percentages were substantially different.

    Mr. Edward T. M. Garland 
    That is correct. 
    And I submit that the practical effects of the trial of ordinary criminal cases, if analyze and if there were statistics will illustrate that the variety of circumstances where it would be logical for counsel on one side or the other to see the implication of a white man being damaged by the absence of blacks in rather clear terms rather than the terms that did I have expressed here as it relates to the fundamental protections. 
    But it is common that a white defendant may rely upon black witnesses, or it is common that he may have close identification by many means with a black, but that should not be the standard. 
    If it is, we get into an interminable question of when does prejudice exist. 
    Where do you find this prejudice and how do you determine?

    And yet, a defendant has been allowed to attack a system even in the light of those holdings and wouldn’t it then be possible to argue your case in a quite and different way from the way you have argued that date and that is on these lines that this is one of the very few cases perhaps, one of very few situation where this Court going way back Strauder against West Virginian back in 1879 in those early cases under the Fourteenth Amendment. 
    This is one of the few cases where a Court has allowed somebody who cannot actually show prejudice in his case to represent the rights of other people, i.e. Negroes in the community to serve on the jury. 
    And that right, this was established way back in the 19th Century and was reaffirmed as recently as year or two ago in the Carter Case in this Court and the companion case in which we allowed Negroes themselves to sue, to serve on a jury, not that your client was denied equal protection. 
    Not that your client was denied due process but you are representing -- your clients representing the rights of Negroes in the community for an opportunity for citizen service on grand and petit jury. 
    Couldn’t be possible to argue your case along those lines?
speaker="edward_t_m_garland" startTime="1225.313" stopTime="1251.566">
    Mr. Edward T. M. Garland 
    It is certainly would be possible for this Court to take that position and to add that to the argument which we make. 
    And that as that was pointed out by the amicus in this case, I think this Court can decide the decision in our favor without having to do that and declare that. 
    I think the Court should declare that.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="1251.566" stopTime="1259.853">

    Mr. Edward T. M. Garland 
    Certainly could Your Honor and I think the Court should do it on both basis and the basis point out the amicus certainly a good one to do at all. 
    However, I think the Court can also say that it would stand either way that we find in fact when you deny the cross-section, there is a prejudice. 
    However, you don’t have to find in the prejudice because he has the right to enforce a fair system.

    No, I did not, one individual client.

    In that case, there was a failure of proof on the allegations that were made by the petitioner. 
    That case also was decided before Duncan versus Louisiana and perhaps the Court would have viewed the problem a little differently at that stage, and the Court in Fay did not reach the issue of the requirement of identity in that case.

    I don’t believe my case depends -- the petitioner’s claim depends on retroactive application? 
    I do think that retroactive application is very much needed in reference to a matter of this nature to avoid the type of process that this particular petitioner has gone through in the Courts of raising the issuea going up, coming back, going back in.

    Mr. Edward T. M. Garland 
    So that we can have a simple decision that is workable in our state courts. 
    So we won’t go through the process of man waiting in jail while we go to our state courts to determine the question of retroactivity, and then go into Federal Court to again wait to find out what happened. 
    I think that it will do -- it will relieve some of the burden on the federal system if there is a clear pronunciation and it is dealt with and I would see nothing to prohibit this Court from dealing with that issue.

    Was it made retroactive?
speaker="edward_t_m_garland" startTime="1489.074" stopTime="1600.338">
    Mr. Edward T. M. Garland 
    It’s been applied retroactively in Georgia. 
    Now, I do not know the answer to the question, but it has been applied retroactively. 
    I ask the Court to consider in reference to this, the possibility that could occur if there are juries in the State of Georgia and other States that are invalidly composed and I would suggest to the Court that this type, discrimination does still in fact exist and does occur. 
    I wish to give illustration outside the record. 
    Shortly before coming here three weeks ago in a town some 60 miles south of Atlanta, the Superior Court Judge declared invalid the jury list upon an application by a black in a rape case. 
    In response to that, the three white jury commissioners resigned in protest. 
    Now, that issue had not been raised, have not been pursued in that Court until 1972. 
    What the reason for that is, is that in your rural areas where -- if there is type of discrimination that carries over into the system, the lawyers generally are few, are engaged in a more local practice. 
    They fight the evidentiary questions in the Court, but it is not as likely that the constitutional concepts are litigated or fought and it is brought out. 
    So, the fact there will be a beneficial effect of this type of decision is illustrated by the fact that these prejudices can in fact occur and continue eventhough the system that was used in this particular case has been rejected.

    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    Peters is in the extraordinary position of asking that his conviction and his sentence be set aside and his indictment voided because he was favored by the jury selection system. 
    And he does so as an act of thought after his second trial and appeal to Georgia Appellate Courts. 
    He didn’t raise the complaint at all in the state courts. 
    What happened actually is that the history of this whole case is a piggyback affair, if I may use that colloquialism. 
    He wants to avoid his conviction which was head in 1966 by claiming the rights of Negroes without alleging any harm to him. 
    As I said, he never complained of the jury composition in the state courts.

    Ms. Dorothy T. Beasley 
    Oh! 
    Not at all because I think the very basic, the fact that they moved down to the question and so did the District Court, District Court held an answer to our motion to dismiss which was on three bases. 
    The second one being that he had not exhausted and the third one being beyond that that he had no course of action, the District Court held in conformating with the position taken by the respondent that number one, he did not exhaust the state remedy but even if he had, there is not course of action. 
    Taking the view that even if he had gone to the state courts, the result would have been the same because the alleged no violation of a federal constitutional right. 
    So, it foreclosed the necessity of going back and forth to reach the same result when it could be reach straight in the District Court here without a hearing.

    Unknown Speaker 
    You are saying that’s wrong?
speaker="dorothy_t_beasley" startTime="1865.148" stopTime="2054.534">
    Ms. Dorothy T. Beasley 
    We are saying that’s wrong because of the reasons given that he was foreclosed from raising the issue in the Georgia courts, and that is incorrect as a matter of fact. 
    But, that is neither here nor there when you get down to the course of action and as a matter of fact that very fact the he relied so heavily on the exhaustion as giving you and that’s where the standing issue came and as a matter of fact, he said he had standing because he had, didn’t have to exhaust. 
    He had a justification for none exhausting so he had standing to come into court, and that is how that issue got in. 
    Although of course, we never have challenge the standing to raise question. 
    What we’re saying is that there is no constitution right in the first place not that you’re not the proper place to raise it. 
    But I think the fact, the exhaustion question is important because it illustrates that he did not pursue the due process claim in the courts below, and this is the answer to a question that Mr. Justice White asked appellant’s counsel and I think it is very important to recognize that because this whole thing arose us an equal protection claim. 
    The petitioner in his petition in the court -- in the District Court talked in terms of systematic exclusion and Fourteenth Amendment and equal protection and just briefly mentioned the words due process and we do not think that that raise as a due process argument. 
    And he says, I do not have to go to the Georgia Supreme Court because they’ve already ruled that I can’t raise the systematic exclusion issue, and systematic exclusion has always been regarded as an equal protection concept. 
    This Court said so and why this? 
    And in the case is preceding it. 
    It is in the terms of equal protection concept that we looked at the systematic exclusion allegation. 
    And by him, now coming at this point and say, well now, I want to pursue this idea of due process which I just mentioned the two words in the court below and in the District Court, I don't think he has raised that properly because he didn’t argue it in the court below and that’s exactly what he used as the basis for not going through the Georgia’s State Courts. 
    So, he indicates to me that he did not intent to raise a due process argument because he there states, he has a new right which is never been recognized before which is a right to a representative cross-section of the community period. 
    He eliminates the part that makes it a equal protection claim which is a right to a representative cross-section of the community from which members of his race where not excluded. 
    And that’s the concept -- that's the context in which that phrase has been used in all the cases that I have been able to find since Strauder. 
    As a matter of fact, I think that the concept arose in the Smith case in 1900 or rather 1940.

    And he argued straight Fourteenth Amendment Due Process and incorporation of the Sixth Amendment as binding on that States and he says the concept of the jury requires that no substantial group in the community be systematically excluded?

    Ms. Dorothy T. Beasley 
    I think that he would indeed be sustained for this reason.

speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="2361.804" stopTime="2387.188">
    Unknown Speaker 
    But he says I cannot really say, I cannot show any specific prejudice in my case, but I am entitled to be tried by jury that is fairly representative of the conscious that served it and he cites Witherspoon and a few other cases, and Ballard and he would sustain that point on strictly due process ground, fully aside from equal protection?
speaker="dorothy_t_beasley" startTime="2387.188" stopTime="2409.303">
    Ms. Dorothy T. Beasley 
    If what he was saying was that he was denied a fair trial, that he was denied an impartial jury, because Negroes where systematically excluded, people of his own race were systematically excluded, then yes, he would have to sustain it because it did not have an impartial jury. 
    We presumed the prejudice in those cases.

    Ms. Dorothy T. Beasley 
    Yes, either it has to be something that we have presumed which we have done and I do not want to belabor the point presumes but we presumed that in the case of exclusion of race.

    Our Courts’ decided five to four. 
    I dissented but the Court decided five to four that that was a properly selected jury. 
    And the argument against it was not that this man was then he spoke that if you take a group of the upper class and put them on the juries and deal with property offenses, you’re up to get a prejudice jury against the defendants.

    Ms. Dorothy T. Beasley 
    But there again, you’re talking about harm and you’re talking about prejudice which this man here does not claim. 
    As a matter of fact, if you go --

    Ms. Dorothy T. Beasley 
    We don’t know.

    Unknown Speaker 
    We don’t know, I mean, if whites, maybe some whites would like to have blacks on it, they’d be more sympathetic in light of the nature of the charge made against him. 
    We don’t know. 
    This is a highly speculative.
speaker="dorothy_t_beasley" startTime="2498.018" stopTime="2516.694">
    Ms. Dorothy T. Beasley 
    Oh, yes indeed. 
    But and if he claims some affinity or some identity with those who were excluded or for some reason, things that the exclusion of those are going to affect his case, then he would be in the position to claim it. 
    But to just take the concept out of the air and say that --
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="2516.694" stopTime="2531.916">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Stayed out the constitution? 
    It’s a definition of a jury trial. 
    What is a jury trial? 
    This was the issue that we face I think in Fay v. New York and we unfortunately, adopted your point of view I think.
speaker="dorothy_t_beasley" startTime="2531.916" stopTime="2671.077">
    Ms. Dorothy T. Beasley 
    But I would ask that that position of course being maintained again in this case and the Court I think you mentioned Mr. Justice Douglas, Ballard and of course those cases are in opposite because those are on the basis of the supervisory power of the Court and the Court does not look into whether there is prejudice or not because Congress has laid down the policy. 
    I think that’s one of the points that was made in Fay that when you are talking about a constitutional right, that is a distinction as to when you are claiming a statutory violation. 
    If it is a statutory violation, there’s no question as to whether there is harm or not that’s already been decided. 
    Whereas, if you are talking about a lack of due process or equal protection, then you must show some harm. 
    And I think one of the best analogies that I came across was the decision in Witherspoon and particularly since it was followed by the Bumper case of the same day. 
    There was also a procedure which it was found, a part of criminal proceedings which were found to be in violation of the constitution. 
    And that was the questioning that was used in death penalty cases or at least capital felony cases when the death penalty was a possibility, and it was found out question that made the jury prone towards giving a death penalty. 
    But the Court did go so far as to say, therefore, we are going to eliminate his whole conviction because there was no connection between the questioning which had to do with the sentence and the conviction, the concept of guilt or innocence. 
    So since he could not show any harm even though this was an unconstitutional questioning system that was being used, since it did not affect him, we’re not going to overturn his conviction, and that happens specifically in the Bumper case where although the questions where used, he had got a life imprisonment. 
    So it didn’t matter to him. 
    It didn’t affect him those improper unconstitutional, lack of due process kind of questions because it did not affect him since he wasn’t, it didn’t ultimately get it.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="2671.077" stopTime="2682.688">
    Unknown Speaker 
    But I supposed we thought it logically, if you decide that jury can mean anything that a local prosecutor in a local court decides it should mean?
speaker="dorothy_t_beasley" startTime="2682.688" stopTime="2686.593">
    Ms. Dorothy T. Beasley 
    Not at all. 
    I think, he is certainly is entitled to a fair trial.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="2686.593" stopTime="2707.234">
    Unknown Speaker 
    That now, then it comes out of prejudice in a particular case, but I thought we have definition of constitution term what the jury trial mean? 
    It is like a speech. 
    What is pressed, does that include the obscenity? 
    What is a criminal prosecution that Sixth Amendment, does it include arraignment? 
    That many things of that kind.
speaker="dorothy_t_beasley" startTime="2707.234" stopTime="2708.042">
    Ms. Dorothy T. Beasley 
    Yes, I think that is --
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="2708.042" stopTime="2716.605">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Where you don’t have a showing of prejudice in a particular case but the scope of the designing (Inaudible).
speaker="dorothy_t_beasley" startTime="2716.605" stopTime="2814.065">
    Ms. Dorothy T. Beasley 
    But what he is claiming here and it was indicated not only in the brief below, but also on oral argument and he is claiming that he was denied due process because of the Sixth Amendment right. 
    Sixth Amendment right talks about an impartial jury and he doesn’t say he had an impartial jury. 
    Moreover, if you follow the theory that there is presumed prejudice if Negroes are excluded, the prejudice going against a Negro, then there must be on a conversed favor towards the white man, if Negroes are excluded. 
    So, here he is in a position saying, I was denied due process, but I really wasn’t denied an impartial jury. 
    I was given a favored jury in my circumstances. 
    He doesn’t show anything that would affect the impartiality of his own jury. 
    And again, the question I would like to point out that was raised on the petition to certiorari, that only with the grand jury whereas the brief expand it to include the petit jury and I thought that the grant of the petition limited to the grand jury which request mostly even more. 
    I think it would because a grand jury may not have even been aware of his color whereas the trial jury might. 
    So the nature of what a grand jury’s duties are, really have nothing to do with what the nature duties on the trial jury and all they do is refer the charge. 
    And in this particular case, in fact in this case you know, he never complain --
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="2814.065" stopTime="2822.566">
    Unknown Speaker 
    On that basis, that all of the Court dealing with the grand jury?
speaker="dorothy_t_beasley" startTime="2822.566" stopTime="2853.849">
    Ms. Dorothy T. Beasley 
    No, I think not because again, we say that in order to reach or to have an impartial jury and to have a fair jury system in selection, we must not exclude Negroes in order so that Negroes themselves will not be discriminated against. 
    But I think he has gone too far in saying that we will presume a prejudice here. 
    He has not suggested where it arise from I would suggest that there is no harm in this case.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="2853.849" stopTime="2862.915">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Have you -- you probably have read Strauder against West Virginia very recently, don’t you?

    Yes.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    In Justice Strong’s opinion, wouldn’t you agree that at least the very first few pages of the opinion of Justice Strong in that case emphasize this was removal case as we both agree. 
    Emphasize the right of Negro citizens to serve on juries, not the right of Strauder to be tried by a representative jury, and that opinion implied doesn’t it that Strauder is in the position to assert the right of Negro citizens to serve on jury, a right that was denied then by the law West Virginia?
speaker="dorothy_t_beasley" startTime="2900.558" stopTime="2920.357">
    Ms. Dorothy T. Beasley 
    But that’s not the right that is being asserted here. 
    The right that’s being asserted here is his own personal right. 
    Peters’ own personal right as it affected him. 
    He is saying that he was denied due process, not to be brought in the community who weren’t represented on the jury. 
    So I do not think that it’s particularly --

    Don’t the Court’s decisions which explicitly hold that nobody has a right to have people of his own race on his trial jury?

    I mean if and I think you would agree, our cases have consistently held that no Negro person has any right to have any Negroes on his jury that tries him or the grand jury that indicts him, that’s correct, didn’t it?
speaker="dorothy_t_beasley" startTime="3054.416" stopTime="3055.259">

    Yes, indeed Mr. Justice Stewart.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Or doesn’t it follow up and then from that that he must be asserting some other right if he is allowed to attack a system as unfair eventhough he is not allowed to attack a particular jury, that is unfair, then mustn’t it follow that he is allowed to attack the system i.e. the system that prevents citizens from serving on a jury?
speaker="dorothy_t_beasley" startTime="3081.107" stopTime="3119.555">
    Ms. Dorothy T. Beasley 
    Yes, indeed. 
    He is attacking the system and that is what he would have to do if he had raised it properly at the time and introduced this evidence to show that there was systematic exclusion, perhaps. 
    But he doesn’t have a claim here because he doesn’t tie himself into a denial of any right that he has. 
    The cross-section concept has always been in terms of the equal protection cases and used in that where somebody has been excluded and the person who has been tried to spent a member of that excluded group. 
    And so it’s the harm flowing to him.

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Isn’t it in the nature of the due process argument that it’s process, system, procedure which is being attacked?
speaker="dorothy_t_beasley" startTime="3137.394" stopTime="3295.403">
    Ms. Dorothy T. Beasley 
    Yes, indeed but I do not think and again, I will give you another analogy that merely showing that there has been something wrong in the system can be sufficient to overturn the conviction of the person who says he has been denied due process. 
    He has been denied due process. 
    The Court says that he has been deprived whether he has been deprived of his liberty without due process of law, not somebody else. 
    The second analogy I would like to present other than the Witherspoon case would be the very recent case is following U.S. versus Jackson. 
    And I point particularly to Brady where although the statute was declared to be unconstitutional in Jackson, in Brady, the Court said it didn’t matter in his case eventhough the death penalty and jury tie in under the kidnapping statute in Jackson was used and was involved in Brady’s case. 
    Still, it didn’t affect his plea. 
    And therefore, we are not going to overturn his plea because it didn’t -- the use of the statute in that case didn’t harm him. 
    And I think that we have exactly the same situation here. 
    I think it’s also important to recognize that in the cases that are cited by the appellant which have talked about an absolute right to a cross section of the community period without talking about exclusion of members of your own race that the rationale in those cases doesn’t answer the question why should you have this cross section of community period. 
    And I think, that’s where they fall short. 
    If we talked about whether there should be a cross section, the idea is to make sure that we have an impartial jury and that we have a fair criminal proceeding. 
    Now, if we do have a fair criminal proceeding with respect to Peters, then again, there is no denial of due process. 
    And it seems to me in the leading the cross-section cases that that really is a measuring device and not a subsentive light because he has a right to a cross section of the community, not to a proportion representation or not with trial by members solely of his race.

    Ms. Dorothy T. Beasley 
    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 
    I wanted to address the question and discussion that we had with Mr. Justice Stewart with regard to the Strauder case. 
    I think, there is vast distinction here because this arises under the Federal Habeas Corpus Act and under the theory of Federal Habeas Corpus or habeas corpus generally, a person would be challenging his own conviction and saying that he was denied his own constitutional rights by virtue of something that happened that his trial or afterwards whereas Strauder of course being the removal statute case involved something else entirely in its context. 
    Moreover, Strauder too was Negro in that case and the opinion does talk to a great extent about prejudice that devolved to him which we don’t have in this case at all. 
    He is not -- Peters is not a person aggrieved by what he claims was not proper in that sense.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3369.588" stopTime="3388.507">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Unless you take the position suggested by my brother Douglas that a constitutional definition of a jury is a jury selected under a system which does not discriminate and that every man, every criminal defendant has a due process right to be tried by a jury selected under such an none discriminatory system.
speaker="dorothy_t_beasley" startTime="3388.507" stopTime="3468.503">
    Ms. Dorothy T. Beasley 
    Yes, it would be then an abstract principle which has not been held for the application of constitutional rights to others in other context I think. 
    And I think an answer to that I would quote from the Fay case which Mr. Justice Douglas mentioned in 1947. 
    “The defendants have shown no intentional and purposeful exclusion of any class, and they have shown none that was prejudicial to them. 
    They had had a fair trial and no reason appears why they should escape its results. 
    To reverse the judgment free from intrinsic infirmity and perhaps to put in question other judgments based on verdicts that resulted from the same method of selecting juries reminds too much of burning the bond or to roast the pig.” 
    And I think we have that same situation here. 
    As in Fay so in Peters, the challenge to this judgment under the Due Process Clause must stand a fall on a showing that these defendants have had a trial so unfair as to amount to a taking of their liberty without due process of law. 
    And I think on this record, we would find that he does not allege anything more than that he was a white person. 
    He doesn’t allege any affinity or identification with those who are excluded. 
    He is not a member of class. 
    He doesn’t allege that he was a member of the class or was harmed, and therefore, I think that his judgment should not be overturned. 
    Thank you.

    That is to assume that it had a bias of some sort and assuming, you can say that it was a white bias. 
    We say all juries should be absent, white bias or other type of bias, and that that is the fundamental issue here.
