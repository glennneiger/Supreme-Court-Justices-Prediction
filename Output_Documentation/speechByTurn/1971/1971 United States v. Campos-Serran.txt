    Mr. William Bradford Reynolds 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    This case is here on writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit to review the decision of that Court, reversing a judgment of conviction of the District Court. 
    It presents important questions relating to the manner in which immigration investigators can without infringing on the individual right against self-incrimination under the Fifth Amendment, carry out their statutory of responsibility to determine whether aliens or persons believed to be aliens are lawfully in the United States. 
    The facts were essentially these. 
    On the morning of November 19, 1968, approximately eight agents of the immigration and Naturalization Service conducted an investigation of employees as a rule on manufacturing company in Chicago, Illinois where it was expected that aliens unlawfully in the United States were working. 
    Some 15 or 16 aliens were arrested for being in the country in violation of the immigration law, including Juan Miguel Rico. 
    All were place in Agent’s Automobile and as is customary practice, they were driven to their respective residences to gather their personal belongings. 
    Upon arriving at Rico’s residence at approximately 8:45 am, Rico and two INS investigators, Jacobs and Beryl, went to the door of his apartment. 
    Rico knocked and respondent opened the door and admitted the three men. 
    The Agents identified themselves and explained to respondent in Spanish that Rico had been arrested and that they were there to collect his personal belongings. 
    No search was made of the premises. 
    Agent Beryl accompanied Rico into his room, Agent Jacobs remained in the living room with the respondent. 
    Jacob who is an INS investigator is authorized by statute to interrogate without warrant, any alien or person believed to be an alien as to his right to be or remain in the United States. 
    He inquired in Spanish as to respondent's citizenship. 
    Respondent replied that he was Mexican and when asked about his alien status, he stated that he was a resident alien. 
    Jacobs then asked for proof and respondent produced his Alien Registration receipt card which is the identification card that is issued by the immigration service to all the aliens who have been locally admitted into the country in a permanent resident status.

    The statute does not require that he display it.

    Mr. William Bradford Reynolds 
    Well, he has the -- he has -- he is required by law to register at the time that he had admitted into the country and his status is on the registration form, that is information that is in the government's possession and he -- if he had the passport for instance and can show that he is in the country, has a valid passport and give his name, you can determined his status from the alien registration form which is on file with the government, but the card is I think the most direct way to establish it.

    I think it is the matter of policy that they would have done nothing other than the court. 
    There is a -- it is a misdemeanor to be in the country illegally and there is that possibility, but as a matter of policy, the government would have deported him. 
    In fact that is what the government did with Rico in this case. 
    They deported him. 
    He was in the country unlawfully.

    He was indicted for registration of a false document required for entry into the United States, is that not issue in this, (Voice Overlap) covers an alien registration?
speaker="william_bradford_reynolds" startTime="424.069" stopTime="628.640">
    Mr. William Bradford Reynolds 
    That is correct. Jacobs inspected the alien’s registration receipt card and also he found a social security card which had been produced on request and he showed both the cards to Agent Beryl. 
    The lighting conditions were extremely poor and on this viewing, the Agents found nothing in it. 
    They returned the documents to respondent and then left the apartment with Rico who had by then collected his personal effects. 
    Now, respondent raises no objection to this initial inquiry and the Court of Appeals found that it did not violate respondent's Fifth Amendment privilege. 
    This initial inquiry occurred in what the Court of Appeals characterized as “the normal immigration inquiry situation and that is what permissible, the court concluded, since the card served the non-criminal purpose of an enabling the government to be aware of a number of aliens in the country and their status. 
    When the Agents returned with Rico to the car, a third investigator, Agent White, motioned toward another individual approaching them and suggested that he had been acting -- he had acted suspiciously on seeing the Agent and should be questioned. 
    Agent Beryl spoke to this individual, Jose Rodriguez Ortiz and inquired as to his citizenship. 
    Ortiz produced an alien registration receipt card which upon examination both Beryl and White found to be altered. 
    Ortiz was then placed under arrest. 
    He was put in Jacob’s car and given Miranda warning in Spanish by Jacobs. 
    He was asked if he wanted to obtain any personal belongings. 
    He stated that he did and indicated that he lived in the same apartment building from which the agent had just emerged with Rico. 
    Agents White and Beryl then went with Ortiz. 
    Unexpectedly, he led them to the same apartment that was occupied by Rico and respondent. 
    Ortiz opened the door with a key and as the three agents -- and as the three men entered, respondent came out of the back room into the living room. 
    While Agent White accompanied Ortiz into his room to collect his clothes, Agent Beryl spoke with respondent in the living room. 
    He explained to respondent in Spanish that Ortiz was under arrest and was being permitted to collect his clothes. 
    Then Agent Beryl thinking that if Ortiz’s card was altered, there was a possibility that respondent's card too was altered and recalling that its earlier inspect -- earlier inspection of respondent’s card had been in the dimly living room. 
    He asked to see respondent’s registration card, alien registration receipt card again. 
    Respondent gave him the card and Beryl examined it a second time. 
    The card was shown to Agent White and both agents inspected it under a flashlight.

    Mr. William Bradford Reynolds 
    That I suppose could well be, Your Honor, and might a warrant of some further investigation on the part of the agents as to this subject, but in terms of what they could do at that time, they were in -- they had no authority to do anything more.

    Mr. William Bradford Reynolds

    Your honor, in these circumstances, we submit that there was, if we are now positing that the card had not been produced, there was not reason to believe in these circumstances that respondent was in the country unlawfully.

speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="744.589" stopTime="780.580">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Then my last question on that point is, does this man, whatever his name is Serrano, did he know that the agents could arrest him. 
    One did he know he did not have to show the card? 
    Perhaps he said there was indeed there was nobody. 
    The man just gotten in and said I got Ortiz, I just arrested Ortiz, I am going to take him away. 
    Now, let me see your card.

    Mr. William Bradford Reynolds 
    As to what respondent felt the record is silent on that.

    Mr. William Bradford Reynolds 
    It maybe requested legitimately under the law properly by the lawful authority, but if there is nothing in the law which requires that he produced it, at the time of that request, but Shapiro, Your Honor I believe, suggested that if you have a record which is required to be kept and it is a required record, that then if an officer asked for the record that you -- the law would assume that it should be produced under the required reference law.

    Mr. William Bradford Reynolds 
    To the -- yes, Your Honor, well, in that respect, yes. 
    I assume you were asking whether there is an obligation on the statute to produce it and our position is that, if they required reference and it is asked, then there is an obligation to produce it without the protection of the Fifth Amendment.

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Well, I know and I understand your position, in which case then that obviates the application of Miranda or in any event, he was not in custody that was in the requirement of Miranda and on that ground Miranda was enacted, that is your position?
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="1239.486" stopTime="1287.062">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Mr. Reynolds, my problem is that assuming that you did not have any Miranda problem, if I can go and ask the man, are you an alien or not, solely because of the statute which puts -- which gives the Agent the right over alien, right? 
    If you are still in that, does it automatically follow that the same alien and the same officer, is in the identical position of no Miranda ruling when the purpose is to find evidence to convict of a crime. 
    Again, I come back to the difference between deportation and criminal conviction?

    Mr. William Bradford Reynolds 
    Your Honor, I believe that the answer to that is that when you were talking in the Miranda area, you’re talking apparently, I think that in this respect --
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="1299.959" stopTime="1306.520">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall

    Alright, that is close to custody.
speaker="william_bradford_reynolds" startTime="1325.890" stopTime="1382.266">
    Mr. William Bradford Reynolds 
    Well, Your Honor, I do not believe that Miranda defines custody as meaning focus. 
    I think that what Miranda said quite explicitly is that focus in the Escobedo sense under the Sixth Amendment question that focus means custody that that custody does not mean focus. 
    Now, our position is that in the first instance when he first was in the room and asked the initial time, that was not in custodial situation and we submit that there is nothing at the second -- on the second occasion, if you look at the surrounding circumstances of the second request, that would have changed what was a clearly non-custodial situation into a custodial situation. 
    Now, it maybe that there was heighten suspicion on the part of the agent, not probable cause -- but --

    Mr. William Bradford Reynolds 
    Yes, Your Honor. 
    I would have to submit that he would have been -- but he was not deprived from freedom of action in any significant way which I believe is a Miranda test. 
    The agent, after they were given the card went into the kitchen and left the respondent alone in the living room while they examined the card. 
    So I think in that respect --

    Mr. William Bradford Reynolds 
    I am not saying that. 
    What I am saying is that I believe that if you have a non-custodial situation in the first in the instance that what the agent was doing even though there was heighten suspicion in the second which was, they were making the routine request, I mean, a routine interrogation as to whether this alien was lawfully in the country. 
    It was no less no routine because they might have been a little more suspicious that he had a forged card, he was still trying to determine whether this alien was lawfully in the country and in our view they are very --

    I would like to say just a word about the -- the public of the required record document. 
    Our view is if it is a public record and it is a record that is required by law to be kept in the possession of the alien for very legitimate regulatory purposes and in that sense it is in the most traditional sense within the required records document. 
    It is a record of public or again it is one that contains information that is public in nature, that is information, it is already in the possession of his Government. 
    It had only information as to identity, name, sex, date of birth, his alien status, his registration number, his photograph.

    I believe that there was a subpoena.

    The element in Shapiro that is not present here is that Shapiro was addressed to what are essentially private records. 
    And here we ask what are in a most traditional sense a public record and for that reason the additional factor that was suggest in Shapiro and appeared again in Marchetti and Grosso that is if the record be as a kind customarily checked.

    Whether or not they could have at that point searched them or whether they would have been legal process, but that is the type of requirement. 
    Davis indicates that in those circumstances where you are dealing with a public record, the police officer may well, on the Fourth Amendment ground be able to go a little further than he would normally be able to go in terms of obtaining the document.

    Mr. William Bradford Reynolds 
    Well, Your Honor, that I think is what was troubling the Court of Appeals. 
    The required record document turns on the record-keeping requirement, possession of a card and if that card, under the statute and that possession of keeping requirement is one that is not aimed at a highly selective group, inherently suspected of criminal activity which we maintain is the case here. 
    Here you deal with all aliens. 
    Then the fact that -- in this particular instance we are dealing with a forged card, is not enough to state that this particular case has the required record document. 
    You have to look at the scheme, statutory scheme and see where the scheme, the statutory scheme is directed -- is at criminal activity alone. 
    I believe that was the threat to the plurality opinion in California v. Fires last term and I think that the scheme itself is important and if in this particular instance the respondent is maintaining that he alone because he acted in an unlawful manner, he would have to incriminate himself by producing it. 
    That does not take the doctrine out the required record.

   Argument of John J. Cleary

    Mr. John J. Cleary 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    In response to one of the questions earlier put the requirement, I would like to point out to the Court, in 1896 Code Section 1357 (a) (1). 
    It deals with the right of an immigration officer to interrogate any person, any alien, or any person believed to be an alien concerning his citizenship. 
    There is not the next step to the next as said, because there is another statute requiring this individual to carry his alien registration with the card that he might been produce the card. 
    There are three separate statutory sections, on the problems confronting the defendant in this case which of course, he felt, was not need to be raised, it is possibly to discriminatory inherent defect within the statute which means to say that anyone could be inquired or interrogated in this fashion. 
    In this case, the defendant contends that the interrogation conducted in this case, under these circumstances call for the application of Fifth Amendment. 
    He would even contend that it is even stronger than Miranda because of the circumstances involved in the nature of the interrogation.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2107.017" stopTime="2114.646">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Now what Miranda does is it prevents the introduction of the evidence at the interogee’s subsequent criminal trial.

    Mr. John J. Cleary 
    Yes, Your Honor.

    What was the evidence introduced against your client in this -- just the false card, was it not?

    Mr. John J. Cleary 
    Government's exhibit one, for identification was hos forged card.

    They also introduced a statement of Mrs. Diana Barbette Garcia, concerning her statement requesting another card because she lost the card in a court, we have asserted that this is taken (Inaudible) in the violation of his confrontation, introduced the statements of another person. 
    Those two items were an essence to (Inaudible)

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Yes, of his conviction, but what evidence specifically was introduced that was secured in violation under your submission of the Miranda rule?
speaker="john_j_cleary" startTime="2158.870" stopTime="2269.709">
    Mr. John J. Cleary 
    Several; first the actual knowledgeable possession and that was manifested by, show me proof of citizenship or upon the second interrogation, produce your card. 
    It was no longer a proof was the term he asked the first time, second time, produce your card. 
    So by producing a card he would then portray a verbal act that he had knowledgeable possession of that card. 
    One of the elements of the offense is his knowledgeable possession. 
    Two; the card itself, in the result the actual production of the card, turning over the card was introduced in evidence against, those were the items that incriminated. 
    In other words, there was a combination of both a physical and a verbal act. 
    There was also a statement on this man that he was and acknowledged the card and there was one confession I was able to knock out on the ground that volunteer Mr. McMeller (ph) rule and the District Court did grant that, but they let in another one, an earlier statement to the authority. 
    At this time was neither the Court, I would like to ask permission to be able to cite two additional authorities concerning my case. 
    The first one deals with, a Court of Military Appeals and that is, U.S. versus Nowling, 9 United States Court of Military Appeals, 100, 1958, and the other Court case I would like to cite and that is on the issues one and two dealing with Fifth Amendment and the production of the card, an item, 4 (c), requirement of defense counsel be allowed to interview witnesses before they are deported as affective assistance to counsel, I would cite to the Court an -- it was not in the F 2nd reporter yet, U.S. versus Linda Rodriguez, Ninth Circuit, Number 71, 1238, dated, 13, July 1971.

    That case dealt with almost head on with this type of situation that we have here in the sense that and the Courts below, the Lower Court certainly not binding on this Court, it was where an Air Force policeman thought that an Airman did not have a proper pass, a required document possibly by the Military Service. 
    He went up and he -- thinking that he might possibly not have an appropriate pass, he said, produce your pass. 
    The man produced the pass and the Court held that this was in violation of Article 31 of Uniform Code of Military Justice which is the precursor through the Miranda position on the warning it must given to servicemen.

    Are the decisions of that court reviewable anywhere?
speaker="john_j_cleary" startTime="2322.256" stopTime="2524.410">
    Mr. John J. Cleary 
    Well, that is a question that I would not be able to really respond to Your Honor. 
    The question of the interrogation in this case, one has to take a look at the total circumstances. 
    This was task force group of the Immigration and naturalization Service. 
    This is a sweep type of a procedure whereby they apprehend certain aliens. 
    It is brought out in the transcript that they knew of people that they had planned to apprehend. 
    They apprehended them and then extended to them the courtesy of securing their own their clothes. 
    In this case, there was an entry made into the apartment the first time. 
    That time the authority of the officer was present and it was, demanded up to defendant and say, produce proof of your citizenship. 
    He complied, a certain production was made at that time. 
    Thereafter they left. 
    When they left they arrested another one on the street, another alien as they determined because this man now had a forged card. 
    The other had none. 
    With this knowledge the agents most candidly stated for the record that I now thought that the other man when he entered the apartment had a forged card. 
    He had that knowledge. 
    He then, going back into the apartment, entered the apartment again for the alleged purpose of securing clothes of their prisoner. 
    But it is our contention of course, and it is stated in the brief that this one is beyond the legitimate ambit of their entry into the apartment and then interrogated this defendant with the express design of producing that which would incriminate. 
    The Court of Appeals felt that this was the equivalent of making a man produce varied evidence of his guilt which in fact was not clearly demonstrated in this case. 
    These are the circumstances that was trigger, if at all, the application of the Fifth Amendment privilege. 
    It is our contention that the required records document as really initiated and formulated in Shapiro deals with the quite different situation. 
    In that case, there was business record. 
    In this case we have a personal card belonging to the individual. 
    The Shapiro case was further refined in the language of Justice Harlan in Marchetti and he sets out certain requirements. 
    The third one is the key requirement and that is the requirements dealing with the Albertson Rule and that is to say, when it focuses in on certain suspect class. 
    Our contention is not even a class, it is an individual, one defendant and when that class cannot be penalized, and here the penalty is most obvious. 
    In Miranda, the man only gave a statement of complicity. 
    In Miranda he did give evidence of his guilt or his statement leading to evidence. 
    In this case it was the whole act was the admission of guilt. 
    If there is some relationship in the intensity that would require for the interplay of the Fifth Amendment especially when here the status of the agent is greatly enhanced. 
    For example, if they were suspecting of him some ordinary criminal offense, he could not so interrogate him. 
    With this case they cannot ask if he has the the citizenship. 
    They can ask anyone and it is a more a possibly a danger when you have a man who is from a foreign land, does not speak our language, would not necessarily be in the likeness to our laws or as to his right to resist if at all.

    The immigration was adamant. 
    Their general contention was yet fooled in IFS and as agent on the first time, by the first go around and hence they would import what I felt was draconian penalty.

    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Does that appear in the record?
speaker="john_j_cleary" startTime="2575.022" stopTime="2722.507">
    Mr. John J. Cleary 
    Yes, it appears in the characterization of Judge Lynch, where Judge Lynch said at the time you arrested him, you did have him for the forged card, was the violation of Title XVIII and their contention was, the immigration contention was, well, we had him for that, but really we do not have to do anything with the Minor Rule 5 of the Federal Rules of criminal procedure because we have him administratively and we do not need to bring him before a magistrate. 
    Judge Lynch discounted that and said no, when you have him for a federal crime you must comply the Rule 5 and bring him before a magistrate. 
    He was not brought before a magistrate but was held a month until counsel was appointed and one of the arguments we have laid before in the Trial Court and Court of Appeals and again before this Court, is the delay in the appointment of counsel. 
    The nature of the interrogation here was unique. 
    It was in the man’s home. 
    The status of the investigator has been clearly demonstrated by the counsel for the -- Solicitor General has indicated that they stated their purpose while they were in there. 
    They readily had apprehended two of his roommates and it demonstrated their power to seize and apprehend persons. 
    The critical point that we try to raise is that trying to understand what the Fifth Amendment was trying to do and that is the spirit. 
    Here, we have light years of different between an alien from a different country, on foreign soil, unfamiliar with the laws, unfamiliar with the language dealing with the federal investigator’s experience bi-lingual, knowledgeable on his own home ground. 
    There was no place that was safe from this immigration examination or question. 
    And somewhere along the line, the Fifth Amendment protects this type of conduct. 
    We contend that the circumstances here are far more coercive and far more detrimental than those existing in Miranda. 
    If anything, we would try to draw upon the analogy in Orozco versus Texas indicates that the Fifth Amendment should be applied not in terms of a geographical study but in terms of a right or privacy of the individual. 
    If there is some zone or right of the individual to be protected and that right to be protected against self incrimination should not depend upon whether he is in a jail house or in his flat. 
    But a fortiori that being in his own flat, he was entitled to some deference by the immigration agents.

    For his benefit?
speaker="john_j_cleary" startTime="2744.546" stopTime="2775.671">
    Mr. John J. Cleary 
    I would have to say that it is for a mutual benefit that of the Government and that of the individual. 
    For example, if the man was an alien, and asked to produce some evidence, they only show may be a passport or birth certificate, that is not legitimate authority to have it here in the United State lawfully. 
    So hence, he would have to maybe check with the INS or something like this. 
    The card would give him that advantage. 
    The benefit of the Government of course is to regulate the aliens which was the very basis of the act when it was passed, I believe in 1941.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="2775.671" stopTime="2777.625">

    Is that their primary purpose?
speaker="john_j_cleary" startTime="2777.625" stopTime="2866.027">
    Mr. John J. Cleary 
    Primary purpose is to really identify and provide a means of authority. 
    The contention of the defendant would be that Congress have to fulcrum on his head and the question is the card is there, that Congress felt that it was appropriate for them to produce the card and I think it should have made a legislation to that effect. 
    There is no such legislation. 
    In fact in the same way that the man could have produced other evidence, I am sure that would have been satisfactory, but this is a convenient form to show a person’s legitimate data. 
    I think the point made by Justice Douglas and that is considered by the defendant such is upon the matters that when the inquiry went into the second time what it was dealing with was a legitimate alien registration receipt card. 
    It was dealing with a piece of, for lack for a better term, contraband or evidence that would be able to prove guilt. 
    At that time, this assignment was required to produce that evidence. 
    And it was no longer using which we go along with and we did argue with the Court of Appeals, now we assert in this Court that the Government could not make general interrogation. 
    Sullivan versus the United States attacked the right to make general neutral inquiry. 
    I think it is totally permissible, and I think that is wholly within -- inconsistent with the Fifth Amendment but to focus in on this type of defendant, I think it transcends that and the Government should not be able to do as a bootstrap, statutory right to make interrogations in justifying the constitution.

    We had made the contention that interrogation had gone beyond the legitimate scope of the entry, that is one of the additional argument in support of our position and my contention is that the basic inquiry, even conducted out in the street, given these circumstances, the agent walking up, thinking that the man has a forged card and then he asked him to produce it under the semblance of his authority, I still feel would violate the Fifth Amendment.

speaker="john_j_cleary" startTime="3294.703" stopTime="3678.929">
    Mr. John J. Cleary 
    That is right. 
    Again the logical extreme. 
    If I could comment briefly on the contentions we made concerning an equal important point, but a jurisdictional point, touched upon by Justice Stewart and that is the application of 18 U.S.C. 1546 to an alien’s registration receipt card. 
    The card here serves as some type of entry document, but the document is a re-entry document. 
    On the card there was a back portion where aliens living the country and re-enter with the alien registration receipt card. 
    The contention made here is that the statute does not cover this particular card. 
    The first one is that entry is distinguishable from re-entry and to the Court we cite the precedent of this Court in (Inaudible) case as interpreted by the McFarland, a Second Circuit’s opinion. 
    Second point that we make is the regulatory characterization of the card by the immigration authority. 
    There was a two categorization, registration card and evidence of registration. 
    This card is secured within 30 days after entry into the United States, not at entry. 
    That is our contention that the ambit and scope of 1546 was directed at those who would put forward some type of legal documentation to indicate lawful status in the United States. 
    That is to say, false birth certificates or other items to give him the aura of legitimacy within the United States that this was not the intent of Congress. 
    Further it can be easily reviewed by taking a look at the regulatory scheme, as Justice Marshall first defined it early and that is that there is a scheme of removal of those unlawfully in the United States who misconstrue the, so to speak, poem on the Statute of Liberty, who look for a better land as in this case, this defendant. 
    And that at first is a voluntary return, no deportation necessary, a person can be returned with Government funds or without Government funds to Mexico. 
    Two, deportation, three, unlawful entry under 8 U.S.C. 1325, first offense, $500.00, six months, second offense, two years, $1,000.00, next step will be 9 1326. 
    The person who has been deported unlawfully returns, two years, $2,000.00. 
    Then moving on, to the more serious ones, 1546 and we have the five years and then 1306 (c) and that is the one who counterfeits the alien registration receipt card. 
    The further point is that within the statute we have a patent in consideration and that is that in the second paragraph of 1546, there are set forth a statute to deal with the counterfeiting of documents required, for instance, in 1306 of Title VIII (d), there is also a like provision dealing with counterfeiting but this time specifically dealing with alien registration receipt card. 
    This counterfeiting provision does not meet our situation where we have only possession, but it is submitted by the defendant that if a specific statute deals with alien registration receipt card as others in the document required for entry and that both of this statutes were enacted as part of the same package legislation, Immigration Nationality Act, therefore, given affect for both statutory sections there is an inconsistency. 
    Applying the principle of legacy , I think the only answer is that that this type of violation and it is treated that way in most ordinary cases even aggravated cases is no more than a misdemeanor under 8 U.S.C. 1325. 
    The other arguments contended by respondent in this case dealt with the cert and that was the aggravating statute upon the entry into the premise under the excerpts of the United States, the Fourth Amendment protection is not complete. 
    And that here, there can be no showing that the defendant who consented to this type of interrogation even though the agent might have the right to conduct that interrogation on the street or at their office, their going into his own home, there is no showing of that. 
    They gained access by the use of the other of his other prisoners to pick your clothing that did not give him, the agent the right to conduct this type of criminal inquiry. 
    The hearsay rule was a statement of Ms. Diana Varga. 
    We do not take, so to speak, opposition to the public record exception which the Solicitor General wishes to contend. 
    We contend that if the statement by the selective service file or other public documents made by the public official, they can come in as a traditional exception for the hearsay rule. 
    However, what we do take exception with is, when there is a statement of a witness which is made and then becomes a part of the file and then the file is introduced, not much the whole file, but that statement is introduced and there is no showing of unavailability of the witness, we contend that that denies the right of confrontation. 
    Further, the question of defense counsel, we were -- I was appointed in this case, I think approximately four days after the two witnesses, the last as to which has been deported back to Mexico beyond the reach of any type of subpoena. 
    In my motion to dismiss the indictment, I alleged this prejudicial delay because here counsel was unable to effectively prepare this case by interrogating two key witnesses who would have very definite information as to the circumstances surrounding their consent to the INS agents to enter the apartment. 
    The Government cite, U.S. versus Coleman in the reply brief which I reviewed on the Tuesday, but in reading that case, one can see that it is totally distinguishable because counsel in that case was appointed or re-countered his appearance in August, the man was not deported until the following January. 
    In this case, my appointment followed the deportation. 
    Two, in the Coleman case their was no showing that the prosecution was aware of the transportation. 
    Here, the prosecutor was present in Court when the Court ordered remanded Linda Mendez for the INS for deportation. 
    But I say that in this case, it was prejudicial, it was not speculative because it deals as one of the essential issues here in a sense.
