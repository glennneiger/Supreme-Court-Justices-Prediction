Huffman v. Boersen

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    -- first this morning in number 71-5097, Huffman against Boersen. 
    Mr. Eisenstatt, you may proceed whenever you're ready.
speaker="leo_eisenstatt" startTime="16.567" stopTime="603.893">
    Mr. Leo Eisenstatt 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    This case is on petition for writ of certiorari from the Supreme Court of the State of Nebraska and involves in its essence a -- several questions involving the annulment of a marriage, a determination of paternity and the allowance or granting or the violation thereof the right to be present at trial. 
    These proceedings now before the Court commenced by the filing of a petition for annulment in the District Court of Hall County, Nebraska, Grand Island approximately in the middle of the state. 
    The defendant in that case, petitioner here Harold Eugene Hoffman was at that time incarcerated in the state penitentiary in Lincoln, Nebraska approximately a 110 miles away. 
    Throughout the proceedings, Mr. Huffman appeared pro se until the appointment of counsel by this Court in response to his request for a writ of certiorari. 
    The essential facts, as we view them, would be that on March 5, 1969, these two parties, Harold Eugene Hoffman and Faye Boersen were married in Las Vegas, Nevada. 
    At that time, the parties had been living in Hamilton County, adjoining Hall County in a small town known as Giltner, Nebraska. 
    At that time, there was -- there had been filed by Faye, a petition for divorce from a marriage contracted according to the record with Richard A. Boersen and with respect to whom there were two children at that time of the marriage. 
    Now the, and I will get into the facts in a little more detail, the petitioner's view of the issues in this case are in two general areas, and that is, was the equal protection of the laws violated with respect to the petitioner by reason of the dismissal of his appeal in that annulment case by the Nebraska Supreme Court because he failed to file a $75 cost security, bond or cash in lieu thereof, and secondly, were his rights to be present at the trial violated when he was incarcerated at the state penitentiary at the time of the trial. 
    The facts are not in dispute and although there are lengthy pleadings on file, a distillation of those facts in our opinion could not make the facts very complicated. 
    Now, before referring to these additional facts, I would like to footnote Nebraska provisions dealing with the matter of appeal. 
    Since its founding, the State of Nebraska has had in its Bill of Rights, a provision, guaranteeing right of appeal in all civil cases. 
    Article 1 Section 24, provides the right to be heard in all civil cases in the court of last resort by appeal, error or otherwise shall not be denied, and as announced by a long line of Nebraska cases, more particularly as it applies to this case and we've cited in our brief, the case of Ferber versus Leise which held that this right of appeal exists irrespective of the merits or the lack thereof in the court or in the record. 
    In other words, they take the position that our Supreme Court should not consider a case until it's been properly presented and not try to anticipate whether or not the appeal is frivolous or has some substance. 
    Now the records shows that Faye had been married to or entered into a marriage ceremony with Richard Boersen in June of 1964. 
    And she had filed an action for divorce, well, there were two of them, but the one involved is in February of 1969 and that action Boersen had filed a counter suit. 
    Then on March 5, as I stated, she married the petitioner in Las Vegas, Nevada. 
    And about a-month-and-a-half later, April 24, a divorce decree was entered. 
    In October of that year, 1969, she gave birth to a child, a child which the petitioner claims paternity and is also one of the issues involved in this case. 
    Now, in November 1970, Faye filed the petition for annulment in the Hall County district court. 
    Huffman was incarcerated in the state penitentiary on November 9. 
    The sheriff of Lancaster County pursuant to our local procedure served the summons. 
    He was allowed in to serve the summons on the petitioner and service in written was made of that fact. 
    In the pleadings that followed as I said all filed by Huffman pro se, by the way Mr. Huffman is the inmate's legal assistant at the Nebraska penitentiary. 
    A review of the record in this case would indicate some expertise and knowledge on his part that might not be possessed of an ordinary layman. 
    Now, among the pleadings filed, he raised the issue of denial of her right to annulment. 
    He raised the issue and claimed the right to be found -- the father of his child born in October 1969 and he also demanded in several pleadings the right to be present at any trial. 
    He also advised the court that he was without funds and had no counsel. 
    Now, the record is undisputed that about that time, Mr. Huffman had approximately a $114 of resources and this has been stipulated and admitted. 
    The case as I said was filed in November, in March of 1971 Faye's attorney ex parte asked the court to set the case for trial, which was perfectly in line with local procedure. 
    The case was set for trial on March 26. Huffman was given notice of that trial, again by the sheriff of Lancaster County, who served this upon him on March, 22. 
    On that same day, Mr. Huffman wrote a letter to the judge, which appears in the Appendix at Page 48, stating that he had just received this service which was four days prior to the trial, that he had no counsel, and again, renewed his demand to be present. 
    Now, in a prior document, which he filed, called a motion for appearance, he had advised the court of the same facts and further advised the court that all it took was a simple order by the court to have the warden produce Mr. Huffman at his trial on the annulment in Grand Island. 
    On March 26, the trial took place and a decree or order of annulment was entered. 
    Huffman's pleadings were all dismissed, held for naught. 
    On April 9, Huffman filed his notice of appeal and this is all in accordance with Nebraska procedure and he paid a $20 docket fee which is also required by our statute. 
    He also filed praecipes for the preparation of a transcript, preparation of a bill of exceptions, which were prepared; the transcript by the clerk, the bill of exceptions by the court reporter and these all appear in the Appendix. 
    Now Section 25, 1914 of our Nebraska statutes among other things requires that the cost security of $75 be filed. 
    Now our Nebraska statutes have, I think, as most states do requirements which must be followed in order to lodge an appeal in the Nebraska Supreme Court. 
    The notice of appeal and the $20 docket fee are denominated as jurisdictional.

    Well, I wish to withdraw that. 
    Mr. Dowding did appear at the argument in the Supreme Court, but Mr. Huffman did not, he was in the penitentiary. 
    I haven't got into that point, but in the Supreme Court the --

    Mr. Leo Eisenstatt 
    No sir, it was raised however by Mr. Huffman in his pleadings. 
    Now as I said, he filed the praecipes, he filed a notice of appeal and the $20 docket fee. 
    Statute requires within 30 days of that date, the cost security to be filed. 
    On May 19, Faye's attorney filed a motion in the Supreme Court of Nebraska to dismiss the appeal for failure to file the cost security.
speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="666.449" stopTime="679.202">
    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    Mr. Eisenstatt, as a matter of practicality, how much protection is a $75 bond in Nebraska practice? 
    What is the average -- what do the average cost amount to, in excess of that?
speaker="leo_eisenstatt" startTime="679.202" stopTime="701.302">
    Mr. Leo Eisenstatt 
    Very much in excess of that, Your Honor. 
    My own personal experience say, even a small brief is over $200, and most of the time there are $300 and $400 present prices. 
    Now the Supreme Court has a rule which provides for reimbursement at $2.60 of pay which comes to $195.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="701.302" stopTime="705.645">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Could the appellee tax the cause of his brief in the Supreme Court of Nebraska?
speaker="leo_eisenstatt" startTime="705.645" stopTime="720.419">
    Mr. Leo Eisenstatt 
    He can -- the winning party in the appeal gets reimbursement for 75 pages x $2.60, which is taxed as cost. 
    Only the appellant however must file a cost security.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="720.419" stopTime="726.750">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    And the purpose of the cause found in nearest to the benefit and of the other party, the appellee in this case?
speaker="leo_eisenstatt" startTime="726.750" stopTime="733.491">
    Mr. Leo Eisenstatt 
    That's right, because the statutory cost as far as the state are concerned in an appeal are taking care of the $20 docket fee.

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    What is the actual cost of printing a brief per page out in Omaha and Lincoln?

    Mr. Leo Eisenstatt 
    In excess of $3, three and a quarter. 
    Sometimes -- and now up to four, depending on which printer, at least in Omaha.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="747.848" stopTime="753.383">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    I see, so it could rule on $2.60 a page is reasonably modern.

    Mr. Leo Eisenstatt 
    Very modern.

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    But, what about the $75 statute that Mr. Justice Blackmun raised. 
    How old or new is that statute?
speaker="leo_eisenstatt" startTime="763.012" stopTime="771.309">
    Mr. Leo Eisenstatt 
    That statute has been on our books since the turn of the century.

    Now that we've interrupted you --
speaker="leo_eisenstatt" startTime="773.036" stopTime="780.831">
    Mr. Leo Eisenstatt 
    No, that's quite right. 
    I would like to respond to the questions as they're raised. 
    Now to fill you in --
speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="780.831" stopTime="781.477">
    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    Could I ask one more then --
speaker="leo_eisenstatt" startTime="781.477" stopTime="783.772">
    Mr. Leo Eisenstatt 
    Yes.
speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="783.772" stopTime="798.160">
    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    Somewhere in here, I have the impression that there is a statement that relief from printing cannot be obtained in the Supreme Court practices, is this a rule in your state?
speaker="leo_eisenstatt" startTime="798.160" stopTime="832.788">
    Mr. Leo Eisenstatt 
    There is a provision, Your Honor, in the rules of the Nebraska Supreme Court, which provide that the Rule 9 (a) of the Supreme Court which is quoted on page 5 of our brief provides in part, all briefs shall be printed unless otherwise allowed by the court on good cause shown.
speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="832.788" stopTime="846.510">
    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    Well, I think perhaps in the opposition's papers, there was an intimation at least that she had to have her briefs printed and could get no relief and I wondered about the accuracy of that statement?
speaker="leo_eisenstatt" startTime="846.510" stopTime="973.621">
    Mr. Leo Eisenstatt 
    I would agree with that statement based upon the background and experience of our court, our Nebraska court to date. 
    The provision for waiver or some kind of amendment that that refers to. 
    I have no knowledge of any case where that has been waived or there has been any change about it or even a provision for paying it on the installment plan, for example, or provided -- well, they wouldn't be for payment on the installment, it would be up to the printer and the petitioner or the appellant. 
    But the waiver of that or the right to provide typed briefs has not to my experience been permitted and in my own knowledge as far as the Bar Association is concerned, we've attempted on several occasions to get that rule amended without success. 
    That, of course, is outside the record. 
    When Faye's attorney filed the motion to dismiss appeal for failing to supply the cost security or Huffman was given notice by mail and he at that time filed an objection, the document entitled the objection. 
    He filed a motion to proceed in in forma pauperis. 
    He filed an affidavit and also filed a motion to stay the mandate but the court ruled against him so that he could lodge a petition for writ of certiorari in this Court. 
    The appeal was dismissed without opinion, just an order entered in their journal. 
    And on June 14, there was a hearing at which Faye's attorney was present and I might advise the Court that at the time involved Mr. Huffman had ordered a brief from the Gant Publishing Company in Lincoln, Nebraska at a cost of $88.58, which had to be paid in advance. 
    So after he paid the $20 docket fee and after he had paid the printer, his $88.58, he had less than $5 left to his name which is set forth in his affidavit. 
    The money that he --
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="973.621" stopTime="989.577">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Mr. Eisenstatt, do the Nebraska decisions indicate that dismissal is automatic upon failure to file the $75 bond or does the Supreme Court on occasion exercise some sort of discretion?
speaker="leo_eisenstatt" startTime="989.577" stopTime="1008.140">
    Mr. Leo Eisenstatt 
    There is no case in the state where a waiver has been granted. 
    There are one or two decisions only, Your Honor, that have ruled on this and other requirements and all have been to the effect that these are reasonable requirements and that the appeal be dismissed.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1008.140" stopTime="1014.236">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    So, so for as Nebraska law is concerned, the failure to file a bond would be an automatic ground for dismissal?
speaker="leo_eisenstatt" startTime="1014.236" stopTime="1211.203">
    Mr. Leo Eisenstatt 
    Although it isn't classified as jurisdictional, as the notice of appeal and the $20 docket fee, it has the same effect. 
    You are dismissed from your appeal if you do not comply with it. 
    And there has been at least one case where a dismissal has occurred because of this. 
    There are very few decisions, one or two at the most. 
    Now the rule involved in this case and for which petitioner seeks redress at this Court stems mainly from the rule in Boddie versus Connecticut, decided by this Court in March of last year. 
    The Court in Boddie, this Court in Boddie was careful to announce that it was deciding the case only on the basis of the fact that it was a marital situation, allowance of an indigent to file a divorce petition, and because the state exercised control over it, the marital relationship in its dissolution, it held that this case then merited the application of the rule that had long been in effect with respect to criminal cases. 
    Now on that basis alone, we have a similarity here in our Huffman case. 
    We have an annulment and a matter of determination of paternity. 
    The issue, of course, goes one step further and that is the matter of appeal and it is petitioner's opinion that the rule of Griffin versus Illinois, decided in 1956, is applicable here and also the cases which have followed Griffin. 
    Griffin held that an indigent in a criminal case was entitled to have a transcript furnished by the state, if he could not afford it in order to provide him with an appeal. 
    As the court pointed out, appeal is not required, but if the state allows appeals as a general practice and in its rules and procedures, then it cannot as a matter of equal protection of the law deny the same rights to indigents. 
    And there have been a host of cases following Griffin in the criminal field and the rule has been amplified, for example, in Williams versus Oklahoma City decided in 1969 by this Court, extended the Griffin rule to a quasi-criminal case which was a violation of the city ordinance, 90-day jail sentence and a small fine. 
    It also involved the issue of free transcript. 
    And then in December of this year, in Mayor versus Chicago, this Court extended the Griffin rule to a misdemeanor case which involved a fine only. 
    And based upon Boddie, which extended the right of access to the courts in a marital situation, we feel mandates, the application of Griffin and its progeny to this case.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1211.203" stopTime="1226.909">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Mr. Eisenstatt, do you see any legal significance in what at least appears to be a factual distinction here that this bond is not something that goes to pay for something that the appellant has but is to reimburse the other party for an expense that they have incurred?
speaker="leo_eisenstatt" startTime="1226.909" stopTime="1272.570">
    Mr. Leo Eisenstatt 
    Yes I realize, this is a distinction, but if in our opinion this is a distinction without a difference. 
    First of all, it is state action. 
    Secondly, it is a minimal protection. 
    Thirdly, it makes no difference as we see at whether this -- the cost requirement in the handling of a case is to pay a fee which is state action or to pay a printer which again is individual action or to pay a cost security. 
    Now in Lindsey against Normet which was just recently decided by this case the -- I think this Court has answered that question, and we must keep in mind in Lindsey, that there were two --

    Justice Byron R. White 
    Which way did we decide it?
speaker="leo_eisenstatt" startTime="1274.406" stopTime="1280.939">
    Mr. Leo Eisenstatt 
    You decided that the double appeal was not valid and put as a matter of equal protection of the law cannot be imposed upon attainment.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="1280.939" stopTime="1282.558">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Or the double bar I guess?

    Mr. Leo Eisenstatt 
    Yes.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="1283.725" stopTime="1292.281">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    But didn't we decide that the litigant could be forced to protect the landlord against loss of rent?
speaker="leo_eisenstatt" startTime="1292.281" stopTime="1293.206">
    Mr. Leo Eisenstatt 
    That's right but there was --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="1293.206" stopTime="1298.559">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Protect the landlord against loss, so he would have to pay money in the court, to protect the landlord against the loss --
speaker="leo_eisenstatt" startTime="1298.559" stopTime="1304.338">
    Mr. Leo Eisenstatt 
    But there the Court was addressing itself protection of property that is the tenant was occupying the --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="1304.338" stopTime="1310.128">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, it was protecting the landlord against the financial loss from the litigation?
speaker="leo_eisenstatt" startTime="1310.128" stopTime="1319.075">
    Mr. Leo Eisenstatt 
    Well, but it did not address itself -- we're talking about the initial, the payment or requirement of paying rent during the pendency of the action.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="1319.075" stopTime="1327.079">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    That's right, and the court yeah, and the only reason to do was protect the landlord from economic loss?
speaker="leo_eisenstatt" startTime="1327.079" stopTime="1354.918">
    Mr. Leo Eisenstatt 
    But it applied to a particular situation Your Honor, it dealt with property that the tenant was occupying, it was this case and the matter of cost are not opposite, I mean are not consistent or the same. 
    There you have the protection or as the rule stated protection of the property as a landlord, or to protect a judgment secured, you don't have that here.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="1354.918" stopTime="1369.597">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    So you say it's just not unconstitutional or that it's unconstitutional for the state to insist that litigants protect those who may sue against the cost the parties will incur --
speaker="leo_eisenstatt" startTime="1369.597" stopTime="1370.934">
    Mr. Leo Eisenstatt 
    Well at least --

    Mr. Leo Eisenstatt 
    That's right, if it denies him access to the courts and this has already been the Court's position in Boddie. 
    There was no requirement to there so far as protecting the other party and here in Boddie there was a waiver of the filing fees which the state mandated as well as what the sheriff required.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="1394.683" stopTime="1401.835">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    You think the state would also have to relieve non-indigents from the obligation to pay the other party's cost?
speaker="leo_eisenstatt" startTime="1401.835" stopTime="1423.926">
    Mr. Leo Eisenstatt 
    Not necessarily, and there is another thing Your Honor, I would like to point out in that regard. 
    In the filing of the original petitions, State of Nebraska does not require a bond to protect the defendant, if the plaintiff loses and the appeal, only the appellant must file this. 
    There is no cost security given to the appellee.

    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Isn't that a fairly common practice among all the states though to say that once that litigation has been come to a decision in the trial court that then the burden shifts and effects so far as securing costs?

    Mr. Leo Eisenstatt 
    Yes, it's very common and it is a -- and we do not attack the essential validity of that, we agree that this is a valid exercise of state rights. 
    But when it prevents the indigent from coming into court or getting a rights of appeal without any regard to their merits then it is an invidious discrimination which the Constitution prescribes.

   Argument of Vincent L. Dowding
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1903.787" stopTime="1911.151">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Thank you Mr. Eisenstatt. 
    Mr. Dowding.
speaker="vincent_l_dowding" startTime="1911.151" stopTime="1976.747">
    Mr. Vincent L. Dowding 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    I would like to address myself to two points that were raised in the questioning. 
    First of all, the statute involved as I read it does permit discretion. 
    Page 5 of respondent's brief quotes this statute and it says that the appeal maybe dismissed on motion and notice in the Supreme Court that no bond has been given and certified in the transcript or within such additional time as maybe fixed by the Supreme Court for good cause shown. 
    So that even the failure to file this bond or undertaking and it can be cash, would not necessarily be an automatic dismissal. 
    So there is discretion here, but I am assuming as is Mr. Eisenstatt that they did dismiss this simply because the money was not posted.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1976.747" stopTime="1985.090">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Do you disagree with Mr. Eisenstatt's statement that the Nebraska case law indicates that dismissal will follow virtually automatically?
speaker="vincent_l_dowding" startTime="1985.090" stopTime="2043.585">
    Mr. Vincent L. Dowding 
    I respect his decision on that, but you can't tell from the record why they dismissed it here, but I think we all are assuming it was because he didn't come up with the $75. 
    I would like to address myself to a question Mr. Justice Douglas raised with reference to whether or not the Boddie case was raised in the Nebraska Supreme Court. 
    My colleague Mr. Belcher argued that motion for dismissal in the Nebraska Supreme Court, and I was informed and it was our point that the Boddie case is distinguishable herein because the purpose of this bond statute and urged to the benefit of a private litigant and not to the state. 
    Now there was no written opinion issued by the Nebraska Supreme Court when they dismissed. 
    I don't know but that basically was the only argument that was made because Mr. Huffman did raise that case very well in his objections to our motion to dismiss.
speaker="william_o_douglas" startTime="2043.585" stopTime="2050.826">
    Justice William O. Douglas 
    As long as it's a state action, I don't suppose that would make any difference as to what the purpose of it may have been?
speaker="vincent_l_dowding" startTime="2050.826" stopTime="2059.945">
    Mr. Vincent L. Dowding 
    No, I really don't whether they went off on that ground or not. 
    I think as Mr. Eisenstatt said it's --
speaker="william_o_douglas" startTime="2059.945" stopTime="2065.531">
    Justice William O. Douglas 
    Are there any other decisions of the Nebraska Supreme Court on this
speaker="vincent_l_dowding" startTime="2065.531" stopTime="2090.857">
    Mr. Vincent L. Dowding 
    No. 
    No, there isn't Your Honor. 
    It is our basic contention that the statute which barred held Huffman from an appellate hearing is constitutional for the basic reason that it gives the respondent herein Faye Boersen financial protection on appeal and is therefore not in violation of the Due Process Clause and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

    Mr. Vincent L. Dowding

    Mr. Vincent L. Dowding

    We say this for two basic reasons and here I am just attempting to address myself to the Due Process Clause only. 
    In the Boddie case, the Court was very careful, too limit it to its facts and it was careful to state that it was not a holding that in some cases access to courts cannot be denied.

    Mr. Vincent L. Dowding 
    Yes, that's right Your Honor. 
    It's our theory that the right to appeal is not a fundamental right as defined in the Boddie case, under the Due Process Clause because as I understand the law, the Due Process Clause does not require a state to afford an appeal and therefore we argued from that that the right to appeal is not a fundamental right as defined by Boddie.

    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Well, what you say is Nebraska says you have an absolute right to appeal in any civil case, if you have $75?
speaker="vincent_l_dowding" startTime="2391.571" stopTime="2395.599">
    Mr. Vincent L. Dowding 
    That's what it amounts to Your Honor in Nebraska, that's right. 
    And the reason --
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="2395.599" stopTime="2398.080">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    That squares with the Federal Constitution?
speaker="vincent_l_dowding" startTime="2398.080" stopTime="2422.745">
    Mr. Vincent L. Dowding 
    We feel that it does. 
    We feel that the Boddie case is distinguishable basically because this particular cost bond requirement is for the benefit of a private civil litigant and does not go into the state coffers. 
    Now in the Boddie case, there were two policies set up by the state of Connecticut, two reasons; one to recoup the cost and two to deter frivolous litigation.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="2422.745" stopTime="2426.161">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    And ought to be correct to recoup part of the cost?
speaker="vincent_l_dowding" startTime="2426.161" stopTime="2427.416">
    Mr. Vincent L. Dowding 
    Yes, it's right Your Honor.

    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well isn't that equal protection for other parties to make sure that the action isn't frivolous?
speaker="vincent_l_dowding" startTime="2433.973" stopTime="2438.953">
    Mr. Vincent L. Dowding 
    I agree that the policy behind this statute, one of which is --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2438.953" stopTime="2442.520">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Or it isn't any longer, the policy of the state anyway?
speaker="vincent_l_dowding" startTime="2442.520" stopTime="2463.117">
    Mr. Vincent L. Dowding 
    I feel that it is still one of the policy for this particular statute to deter frivolous appeals. 
    I don't rest on that distinction. 
    I rest on the distinction that the state, this is a reasonable purpose a constitutional permissible purpose for state legislatures to protect civil litigants on appeal, such as in Lindsey against Normet.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2463.117" stopTime="2468.523">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    But the -- that isn't the policy of the state of Nebraska anymore, is it?
speaker="vincent_l_dowding" startTime="2468.523" stopTime="2545.373">
    Mr. Vincent L. Dowding 
    No, not now, nit in forma pauperis. 
    So that distinguishing Boddie on the policy grounds we feel that it's different that the state has power to protect the private civil litigants on appeal. 
    We feel that that distinction alone lightens the impact of Boddie as (Inaudible) under the Due Process Clause. 
    Now with reference to the Equal Protection Clause, and that's Griffin versus Illinois and the cases that have followed it, to my knowledge the Griffin case has not been applied to a civil litigation on the appeal level. 
    We attempt to go to some standard tests under the Equal Protection Clause to determine whether or not this particular legislation is valid. 
    Is the purpose of the statute constitutionally permissible and two, is the statute rationally set up to reach that means. 
    Now, in Lindsey against Normet, the Court said that at least on its face the standard bond requirement in there was constitutional. 
    So we feel that it is constitutionally permissible for a state to setup this type of financial protection in civil litigation.

    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Well, my case is that if we agree that in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution, the court gave all of this to the plaintiff in the case and left the defendant broke.

speaker="vincent_l_dowding" startTime="2609.971" stopTime="2638.631">
    Mr. Vincent L. Dowding 
    Well, this is where I am asking the Court to draw the line. 
    I am not going to object to appellate fees that are set up and going to the state treasury and I think it's a fairly fine line, and I'll admit that but I feel that when you judge this legislation against the Equal Protection Clause that the state does have the right to protect private litigants. 
    And I think the state can come in and say probably that the appellee also has to post a bond on appeal. 
    I mean --
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="2638.631" stopTime="2641.844">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    It posted a cost bond, they just say a $75 bond?
speaker="vincent_l_dowding" startTime="2641.844" stopTime="2643.627">
    Mr. Vincent L. Dowding 
    Yeah, no it's a cost bond.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="2643.627" stopTime="2664.074">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Well, if the case involved 14 constitutional points and $16 million and the brief cost $4,000 and 75 bucks. 
    It is a very simple point and it required 6 pages of brief in, $75.
speaker="vincent_l_dowding" startTime="2664.074" stopTime="2703.465">
    Mr. Vincent L. Dowding 
    That's right, in some cases perhaps this statute is not adequate, perhaps we need more protection, but again get back to the point and that is the line that the respondent is asking the Court to establish at this point. 
    When a state establishes, reasonable, financial requirements to protect private litigants in civil cases, then it is constitutional. 
    That's the line we ask you to draw, and I am willing to concede the $20 docket fee because I don't think the state's policy -- I think in Boddie the court pointed out, that the state's policy in recouping part of the cost does not outlay this right to access.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2703.465" stopTime="2705.210">

    Yes he did, and he also paid for the printed brief. 
    Now, I don't know if he were to come in and move to, ask for a type written brief, whether it would or not have been granted, but if he could have got a type written brief then he would have had enough money to make the bond and that's the problem, but he just came down to this last point and couldn't come up with the money.

speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2787.850" stopTime="2798.119">

    Mr. Vincent L. Dowding

    Mr. Vincent L. Dowding 
    Yes I would. 
    Here's what would happen in the Lindsey versus Normet. 
    Let's suppose that all he had was the standard bond requirement there and the tenant was absolutely broke and had a meritorious appeal, then you would have basically the same question you got here except that it's outside the scope of domestic relations. 
    And it would be my contention in that case that, that standard bond requirement would be valid even though it denies access because it's set up as a valid state purpose to protect the private litigant.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="2863.018" stopTime="2878.610">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Mr. Dowding, do you think it would be an appropriate solution of this case if the Court were to decide to remand it to the Nebraska courts and let them reconsider the whole problem in light of the new statute?
speaker="vincent_l_dowding" startTime="2878.610" stopTime="2954.214">
    Mr. Vincent L. Dowding 
    I do, I certainly could not object because the purpose behind this appeal statute was to give my client financial protection. 
    If I were given permission to file a type written brief without coming up with the cost, I could not complain. 
    Mr. Huffman would then have a hearing and my client would have the same protections she had under the statute and that's the alternative relief that I ask. 
    I do feel however that if the Court reverses and holds this statute unconstitutional that you have thereby probably unless you stick to domestic relation situations granted an indigent a free pass on basically all litigation, because it's a lot tougher I feel -- it's easier to say that the state can afford to absorb the loss and that's not a valid purpose to reimburse the state treasury. 
    But I think it's a lot harder to say when you have got two individuals and they are protecting one litigation that that's unconstitutional. 
    I feel that once you say that, that's it's unconstitutional in this case that really I think about all financial requirements are out as far as an indigent is concern unless you stick again to the domestic relations area.

    Mr. Vincent L. Dowding

    Well, I would say it probably was under Nebraska pleading because Huffman set it up in a cross petition. 
    I personally do not feel it was validly determined and I am willing to stipulate at any later litigation that Mr. Huffman can come in and determine this. 
    I didn't intend to have that issue determined, let's put it that way. 
    He filed a lot of pleadings and they weren't under any description or name allowed by Nebraska law and he did raise the paternity issue in there and it was rejected.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="3089.547" stopTime="3102.438">

    Mr. Vincent L. Dowding 
    Yes, it is Your Honor, but our Nebraska court has held that either party can raise that issue in an annulment, if it has alleged that there are issue at the marriage and as far as I am concerned that issue is not been foreclosed.

    Then you shouldn't say as you are doing your brief that the appeal was frivolous?

    Mr. Vincent L. Dowding 
    Alright Your Honor, I will even concede that if in fact the paternity issue was decided --

    Justice William O. Douglas 
    Yeah.
speaker="vincent_l_dowding" startTime="3315.902" stopTime="3323.778">
    Mr. Vincent L. Dowding 
    -- but I am again willing to open up the Courts on remand or anything for Huffman to decide this issue. 
   
   
   
   Rebuttal of Leo Eisenstatt
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="3323.778" stopTime="3332.088">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Thank you Mr. Dowding. 
    Mr. Eisenstatt, your time was consumed but if there is any important factor you wish to make, we will give you a minute or two.
speaker="leo_eisenstatt" startTime="3332.088" stopTime="3348.656">
    Mr. Leo Eisenstatt 
    Just two minutes, if you may Your Honor. 
    First, you can't, in Nebraska, stipulate the jurisdiction as far as the paternity issue. 
    He said that he will be willing to stipulate, I just wanted the Court to know that a stipulation of counsel will not vest any court with jurisdiction to hear the matter.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    But it may have something to do with whether or not this appeal is a substantial appeal or frivolous one?
speaker="leo_eisenstatt" startTime="3353.419" stopTime="3402.402">
    Mr. Leo Eisenstatt 
    Right, and as to one point with respect to the Lindsey versus Normet case, I would like to call the Court's attention to the distinguishing characteristic of that bond or payment provision for rent pending appeal and the Court said, there are unique facts and legal characteristics of landlord-tenant relationship that justifies special statutory treatment inapplicable to other litigants and then goes on to refer to the fact that the landlord is incurring expenses and the tenant will be getting free occupation. 
    So I reiterate my statement in my original presentation that the original or bond covering the payment of the actual rent is distinguishable from this case.

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    You agree with Mr. Dowding that a remand to the Nebraska Courts would be an appropriate solution to this problem?
speaker="leo_eisenstatt" startTime="3411.658" stopTime="3428.342">
    Mr. Leo Eisenstatt 
    I would hope it would. 
    I would want this Court to, I think give it a bit of a nudge Your Honor. 
    If they could have a chance to interpret this contrary to applying of section LB 1120, they might do it.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="3428.342" stopTime="3434.109">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Now that you -- when you say give them a nudge you mean by that to make it clear that we expect Nebraska to solve this problem?
speaker="leo_eisenstatt" startTime="3434.109" stopTime="3435.780">
    Mr. Leo Eisenstatt 
    Yes, Your Honor.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="3435.780" stopTime="3448.233">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Thank you. 
    Mr. Eisenstatt you appeared here by our request and by appointment of the Court and after the Court I want to thank you for your assistance not only to your client, but to our Court.
