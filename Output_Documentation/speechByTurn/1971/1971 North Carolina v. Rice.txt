North Carolina v. Rice
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="0.000" stopTime="8.817">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    -- in Number 70-77, North Carolina against Rice. 
    Mr. Safron, you may proceed whenever you are ready.
speaker="jacob_l_safron" startTime="8.817" stopTime="132.355">
    Mr. Jacob L. Safron 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    This case is before this Court upon a petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit which held in Rice versus North Carolina that upon the strength of Pearce, the imposition of a greater sentence is impermissible in a situation in which a defendant receives a trial de novo in the Superior Court from a Lower Criminal Court. 
    And that was the legal conclusion without the Courts giving any legal reasoning. 
    The course then went on to stage in reference to all the cases to the contrary, but they simply disagreed and ordered the State of North Carolina to expunge any record of Mr. Rice’s conviction in the Buncombe County Superior Court. 
    Wayne Claude Rice was originally arrested on July 2, 1968 for driving under the influence of alcohol. 
    On July 19, 1968, he was tried in the Buncombe County Court which was then in existence and received a sentence of a nine-month sentence suspended upon payment of a fine of $100.00 and costs. 
    As was his absolute right, he applied for a trial de novo in the Buncombe County Superior Court. 
    On August 2, his right to trial de novo was assured and on that day he first pled guilty to twelve offenses of uttering worthless checks and then was tried upon his plea of not guilty on the charge of driving under the influence.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    I noticed Mr. Safron in the brief the reference to the worthless check charge, that has nothing to do with the issues before us (Voice Overlap)
speaker="jacob_l_safron" startTime="141.668" stopTime="147.351">
    Mr. Jacob L. Safron 
    Only in this regard, Your Honor. 
    There were these twelve worthless check charges.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="147.351" stopTime="148.189">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Yes.
speaker="jacob_l_safron" startTime="148.189" stopTime="180.774">
    Mr. Jacob L. Safron 
    He pled guilty to those, was then tried upon the plea of not guilty as driving under the influence. 
    The sentence or the sentences that were then imposed, he received a two-year active sentence for driving under the influence, the maximum then permitted under the law, but the same time when the judge sentenced him as to the worthless check charges, he was sentenced to the consecutive one-month sentences to run concurrently with the sentence imposed for driving under the influence.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="180.774" stopTime="188.152">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    But was only partially concurrent. 
    In other words, one with a total of one year and on the driving intoxicated was a two-year sentence?
speaker="jacob_l_safron" startTime="188.152" stopTime="189.546">
    Mr. Jacob L. Safron 
    Yes, Your Honor. 
    It was concurrent --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="189.546" stopTime="192.616">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    So, we do not have really the concurrent sentence doctrine?
speaker="jacob_l_safron" startTime="192.616" stopTime="206.716">
    Mr. Jacob L. Safron 
    No, not except for -- to the first year of the sentences were concurrent whereas the Court could have imposed the sentence consecutively, it was imposed concurrently and he received no greater sentence as result of having pled guilty to the twelve worthless check charges.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="206.716" stopTime="211.242">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Now, we have at least one additional year based on the driving while intoxicated?
speaker="jacob_l_safron" startTime="211.242" stopTime="212.501">
    Mr. Jacob L. Safron 
    Yes Your Honor, that is true.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="212.501" stopTime="221.444">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    And in the original so-called sub-constitutional court, “your adversary” his sentence was what?
speaker="jacob_l_safron" startTime="221.444" stopTime="226.375">
    Mr. Jacob L. Safron 
    His original sentence was nine months suspended upon payment of $100.00 fine and costs.

    Mr. Jacob L. Safron 
    Oh yes, Your Honor, quite clear!

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    It is not blunted at all really by the concurrent sentence doctrine?

    Mr. Jacob L. Safron 
    No, not at all. 
    In fact concurrent sentence, Your Honor, I believe is merely something applies to the federal judiciary and it is not applicable to the states.

    No, Your Honor. 
    This gentleman has a record dating back to 1948. 
    I have here the so-called FBI wrap sheet.

    This was not his first.

    Mr. Jacob L. Safron 
    Your Honor, I would say this. 
    Unfortunately, the District Courts are the courts of original jurisdiction. 
    This is where the great mass of cases are tried. 
    The felony cases are only minuscule part of the total case load in the criminal judicial system and unfortunately in the District Courts, the District Court judge does not have made available to him, all the resources which are available in the Superior Court.
speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="494.235" stopTime="504.281">
    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    Well, I am confused about two things in Mr. Rice’s brief. 
    It is stated this was Mr. Rice’s first conviction for driving while intoxicated. 
    This is a misstatement.
speaker="jacob_l_safron" startTime="504.281" stopTime="505.740">
    Mr. Jacob L. Safron 
    This is a misstatement, Your Honor.
speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="505.740" stopTime="515.172">
    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    And then secondly, I am confused about the nine months sentence for it imposed in the County Court when the statute says for the first conviction, only 30 days?
speaker="jacob_l_safron" startTime="515.172" stopTime="523.746">
    Mr. Jacob L. Safron 
    Oh! We are talking now Your Honor of nine months of driving with the influence, 30 days was the bad check charge.
speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="523.746" stopTime="533.628">
    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    Well, I am not talking about the sentence. 
    I am talking about the statute. 
    Does the statute not make the first offense punishable no more than 30 days?
speaker="jacob_l_safron" startTime="533.628" stopTime="561.308">
    Mr. Jacob L. Safron 
    No, Your Honor. 
    There is a problem involved here due to the fact that the sentence for driving under the influence was amended subsequent to Mr. Rice’s trial. 
    Whether or not that amendment in the statute and the downgrading of the maximum should be part of the issue here, I am merely not sure. 
    The maximum now I believe is six months for first offense driving under the influence.
speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="561.308" stopTime="563.139">
    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    In any event he got nine months?
speaker="jacob_l_safron" startTime="563.139" stopTime="567.718">
    Mr. Jacob L. Safron 
    Well, he received nine months at the time when two years was a permissible maximum, Your Honor.
speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="567.718" stopTime="569.671">
    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    Only for a third offense?
speaker="jacob_l_safron" startTime="569.671" stopTime="588.094">
    Mr. Jacob L. Safron 
    No, Your Honor, at that time the statute permitted up to two years for first offense driving under the influence. 
    He did receive the first, the maximum, but this is bogging the issue because of subsequent legislative down grading of the maximum sentence.
speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="588.094" stopTime="595.490">
    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    Well, it is evident I am referred by your statutes. 
    I hope Mr. Van Alstyne can straighten it out.
speaker="jacob_l_safron" startTime="595.490" stopTime="610.093">
    Mr. Jacob L. Safron 
    But since I have this here, I just want to point out that since 1948, Mr. Rice spent more time in custody than he has out of custody.
speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="610.093" stopTime="620.709">
    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    One last question. 
    Even if he were to plead guilty in the Lower Court, does he have the right to a trial de novo (Voice overlap)
speaker="jacob_l_safron" startTime="620.709" stopTime="667.634">
    Mr. Jacob L. Safron 
    There is an absolute right to trial de novo in the State of North Carolina, Your Honor. 
    It does not matter whether or not the defendant pled guilty or not guilty. 
    If he pleads guilty and is not satisfied with the sentence that is imposed, he can apply for trial de novo that wipes the entire proceeding clean. 
    It is completely off the record and he will then have an opportunity for a jury trial in a Superior Court as if nothing had ever happened before. 
    I just have been advised that according to Mr. Rice’s prison jacket he received the same sentence in the Superior Court as he had received in the County Court upon the worthless check charges. 
    Now, subsequent --
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="667.634" stopTime="678.290">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Is it possible, you can clear this up as you go along, is it possible that the information about this prior record came to the attention of the Court, the second Court involved in de novo trial?
speaker="jacob_l_safron" startTime="678.290" stopTime="729.415">
    Mr. Jacob L. Safron 
    Your Honor, I am confident that upon his trial in Superior Court which was then the responsibility of the Solicitor to a full jury trial that this information was obtained. 
    Now, I am familiar with procedures in the District Court, previously the County Courts. 
    The only record available to the judge at the time is they listed a man's convictions in that particular court. 
    The Court does not have available to it due to the tremendous number of case which are processed. 
    The availability of say FBI record or in our state an SPI record in addition to determine the man’s total background. 
    I know when I tried cases in the District Courts, we merely have a box which contains a card with the man’s name and his previous convictions from that court, nothing else.

    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Mr. Safron, suppose a man appeals -- no, suppose if a man after he is convicted, a month later after the sentence, two months later after the sentence had been pronounced, the judge has come across that wrap sheet, does he do anything about it --

    Nothing at all, Your Honor.

    Mr. Jacob L. Safron 
    Well, the point is this, Your Honor. 
    We are talking now about the District Court judge or Superior Court judge?

    Mr. Jacob L. Safron 
    Well, I think there is a clear distinction to be made, Your Honor. 
    The District Court judge once that say one week term is over, could not impose the greater sentence. 
    In fact, I would say to this. 
    If the District Court judge had imposed a sentence and then subsequently determined he wished to increase it, he could not increase it, not that particular judge. 
    But here is a situation where a man exercises absolute and unlimited to right to appeal his conviction to a Superior Court and in the eyes of our case law and our statutes, this wipes the slate clean, as if it never happened and he is given a new opportunity.

    Mr. Jacob L. Safron 
    One, the cases within the jurisdiction of a District Court are two-fold. 
    Those which are petty misdemeanors, is only person’s violations, traffic violations. 
    Two, those which can be noted as serious misdemeanors. 
    As to those which are serious misdemeanors, constitutional law, federal constitutional law requires that he be given an opportunity to a jury trial. 
    As to those which are petty misdemeanors, he would have no federal constitutional right to a jury trial. 
    In any event our state constitution as a part of the organic law of the State of North Carolina, Massachusetts and several others states provides that there shall be a right to trial de novo.

    Mr. Jacob L. Safron 
    The procedure would be this of course, Your Honor. 
    If the defendant is tried in the District Court, he can apply for trial de novo in the Superior Court. 
    If he is unsatisfied with the conviction and, well, I should say sentence, but unsatisfied with conviction in the Superior Court, he may apply, he may appeal as a matter of right to the North Carolina Court of Appeals. 
    From the North Carolina Court of Appeals he could then if it is a constitutional issue presented which are not previously been determined, apply either by certiorari or direct appeal to Supreme Court, Your Honor.

    Your Honor, (Voice Overlap) we have to make a distinction here I believe between the case of North Carolina versus Pearce which is the basis of this and the facts presented here. 
    In the Pearce case a defendant was convicted in a Superior Court of right. 
    Ultimately because of the inadmissibility of his confession, the Supreme Court of North Carolina reversed and received a greater sentence upon retrial in the same court which convicted him the first time. 
    Here, it is an entirely different proposition.I 
    t is not the same court.

    Mr. Jacob L. Safron 
    There is an order that we have which has been stayed, but that order is effective. 
    The American Bar Association has had the opportunity to review this very contingent and the American Bar Association standards relating to jury trial I point this Court’s attention to 1.1 (b) and the American Bar Standards to prove draft issued in 1968 states, defendants in all criminal cases shall have the right to be tried by a jury of twelve whose verdict must be unanimous. 
    Except that we are not barred by applicable constitution provisions, the right to jury trial may be limited in one or more of the following ways; of requiring trial of that jury for lesser offenses provided there is a right to appeal without unreasonable restrictions to a court in which a trial de novo by jury may be had and that is exactly the situation which our District Court system provides. 
    In the commentary, in the ABA’s approved draft, it also discusses the various states in which this is a part of the state constitution and that includes Delaware, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Virginia, and Massachusetts. 
    In fact, I would like to point this Court’s attention to the fact that the Supreme Judicial Council of the State of Massachusetts had just had the opportunity to review this very issue because the Massachusetts as in North Carolina, this is an organic part of our state constitution and the case of Mann versus Commonwealth which was first decided June 15 of this year and is reported in 271 North East Second at 331, a very recent case came out in the (Inaudible) just the end of last month. 
    The Chief Justice of Massachusetts for a unanimous Court found as has the State Supreme Courts of North Carolina, Virginia, Nebraska, Michigan, Maine and the First Circuit Court of Appeals in the Moe v. Robins that the imposition of a greater sentence upon trial de novo is not viable to the due process and does not contradict this Court’s opinion in North Carolina versus Pearce.

    It is tried before a Superior Court judge, more evidence is brought out. 
    The cross-examination is more intense, more records are made available to the court. 
    I say that the authority, the discretion of the judge at Superior Court is at question that if judges of the Superior Court where there because we expect their expertise and who developed an expertise in that particular case before them cannot exercise their judgment and their discretion, then how long can the court system continue?

    Mr. Jacob L. Safron 
    Your Honor, there are many different states. 
    Now, some states, now, in the petitioner’s brief he cites, excuse me, in professor's brief, he cites the DaBonus (ph) case from New Jersey which was determined by the Supreme Court of New Jersey as a policy issue. 
    As a matter of policy the Supreme Court of New Jersey took the opportunity to criticize the structuring of their municipal courts which were locally appointed part-time judges. 
    In North Carolina, we have a District Court system with full-time judges. 
    It is a unified system which has taken 15 years to implement. 
    The professor cites comments from a report in the mid 50s and that report we took to heart and the State of North Carolina revamped its entire judicial system. 
    We have a completely unified system now with full-time judges who are paid a very respectable salary.

    Well, there are several reasons.

    You said because you do not want to increase the number of cases in the Superior Court?
speaker="jacob_l_safron" startTime="1735.396" stopTime="1802.345">
    Mr. Jacob L. Safron 
    Let me say this. 
    Number one, the professor states in his brief there is no provision for representation in the District Court that is wrong. 
    He cites as precedent for one point, the case of State versus Mars which he cites for the proposition that the Supreme Court of North Carolina has refused to adapt the holding in the Patent case which was the basis for Pearce. 
    But in that very case State versus Mars, Associate Justice Suzie Sharp (ph) held that a man has a constitutional right to representation by counsel if he is indigent in the District Court in a serious misdemeanor. 
    We have counsel in those courts and if that man wishes to appeal, it goes on to the Superior Court, that same counsel paid for by the state. 
    If he wishes to appeal to the Court of Appeals, we pay for counsel. 
    This year we funded $1.8 million with the appointment of counsel. 
    We have public defenders in two of our counties. 
    We have counsel in on those courts. 
    The public defenders office in their report to the Court which, excuse me Your Honor, I see that I --

    Mr. Jacob L. Safron 
    In the public defenders office and under our statutory scheme which provides for the appointment of counsel any felony case and any misdemeanor case for which the authorized punishment exceeds six months in prison or $500.00 we have counsel. 
    And to illustrate this very point, the public defender's office and the two test counties where we presently have public defenders, in one county they were appointed to represent 949 persons during the year, that was 877 felonies and they also were involved in 396 serious misdemeanors in the state. 
    The course of its representation, the office made 612 appearances in the District Court, 404 in the Superior Court. 
    The other office, the office made 601 appearances in District Court, 239 in the Superior Court. 
    We do have counsel in the District Court System.

   Argument of William W. Van Alstyne

    Mr. William W. Van Alstyne 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    If I might rather than launching into an original argument, attempt to respond to some of the questions which were directed to Mr. Safron, simply by way of helpful clarification. 
    So far as the technicality of what it is called in 16 (a) new trial against the correction of what he may believe to be an injustice committed in the course of his original trial, in the General County Court or now in the District Court, it is perfectly clear that even in the view of state itself it is an appeal. 
    Indeed or by turning to page 17 of petitioner’s appendix, one of the note that the statute so defined it itself, it is called an appeal to the Superior Court, subsequently appeal from District Court, subsequently appeal from justice trial de novo.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1925.637" stopTime="1935.981">
    Justice Potter Stewart

    Mr. William W. Van Alstyne 
    Indeed, that is --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1936.675" stopTime="1941.853">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    One has an absolute right to this new trial without even claiming any error in the original trial?
speaker="william_w_van_alstyne" startTime="1941.853" stopTime="1964.314">
    Mr. William W. Van Alstyne 
    Unquestionably correct. 
    What needs to be observed side by side that observation, however, is it that it is also the exclusive recourse one has from any grievance which he may honestly feel to pervade that original trial. 
    In this respect it seems to me therefore most important that one take the accurate measure of the character of the Court in which he is first tried.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1964.314" stopTime="1978.043">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    In that connection Mr. Van Alstyne, does this mean that if he feels there is error below in the District Court that he may not even move for a new trial in that court, his only avenue of relief is to take this so-called appeal?
speaker="william_w_van_alstyne" startTime="1978.043" stopTime="2009.962">
    Mr. William W. Van Alstyne 
    To the best of my knowledge that is the case. 
    That is correct, there is no other recourse. 
    The Court in which he is first tried is not a Court that merely tries petty offenses. 
    I quite take exception to that description. 
    Indeed the original and exclusive jurisdiction, original and exclusive jurisdiction of a District Court runs to misdemeanors which in North Carolina are defined as offenses punishable by as much as two years in prison. 
    Indeed that is exactly this case and that is how it originated. 
    I think it is quite then begs the question.

    On the drunk driving offense itself to be sure the legislator has since revised the maximum penalty downward, Mr. Justice Brennan, but at the time in question it was punishable by two years. 
    There is no doubt or fault between us. 
    That the sole jurisdiction in the first instance was in the General County Court that there is no possible relief from the sanction and result of that decision in the County Court, other than to an appeal for trial de novo.

    My frank position would be that result should be the same because I do think that there are other course in these elements to this time of procedure. 
    But it is true that if we had an election in the first instance, respecting the court in which you might first be tried, there would be less reason for this Court to be apprehensive that the Superior Court judges would harbor the motive to discourage seeking access to the District Court in the first instance through the menace diminish hardship sentencing. It is also true that with that election in front of him, honestly to be made, in the initial preference for the District Court it may consciously be entertained by the accused that he may be more leniently treated.

    Indeed the reasoning of Pearce, if I may quote the Court’s opinion was this, “Due process of law requires that vindictiveness against a defendant for having successfully attacked this first conviction, must play no part in the sentence he received after a new trial and since the fear of such vindictiveness may constitutionally deter a defendant's exercise of the right to appeal or collaterally attack his first conviction. 
    Due process also requires that a defendant be freed of apprehension of such retaliatory motivation on the part of the sentencing judge.”

    Nothing in the argument presented below, nothing in the fabric of Pearce suggests that a conviction subsequently secured pursuant to a fair trial is obliterated or that all go free. 
    It is rather that the excess of service attributable to the constitutionally improper harsher sentence must be relieved to the extent, therefore, that the order was to expunge the whole conviction rather than to let the public record show that the sentence is merely that originally imposed in the General County Court.

    One of these of course, bears upon the possibility of subsequent conviction for another offense, that sentence imposed pursuant to the subsequent conviction might foreseeably of course be harsher than it would, otherwise in light of previous sentences, that is to say not really the record of conviction, but surely the degree of sentence, the severity, a punishment.

    I do not think so.

    It is we see again the more drastic sentence on the second trial as a denied of federal due process and by discouragement it impinges upon the state given appeal.

    Mr. William W. Van Alstyne 
    Indeed. 
    Yes. 
    May I observe also with regard to the alleged parade of horribles that is foreseen to flow from an affirmance in that regard as a perfectly ordinary decision. 
    That at least nine states sort of examined this problem have already set their face systematically against harsher sentencing even in the context of these absolute rights for appeals for trial de novo. 
    Five of these have based it on Pearce itself and the reasoning is identical all the way through. 
    Indeed, as the Indiana Supreme Court has observed this year, exactly with respect to this situation. 
    “we failed to see whether de novo aspect of the trial in criminal court has any bearing upon the logic of the Pearce case which is simply that the threat or possibility of having a greater sentence imposed should not be a deterrent to the exercise of one's right of appeal. The states include Arizona and Indiana, Hawaii and Maryland. 
    New Mexico by statute and not merely by judicial fiat, the Louisiana since about 1950 has had a dual trial system, but under a construction of the state’s own constitution, has for more than a decade forbidden harsher sentencing. 
    The alleged parade of horribles has simply not materialized.

speaker="william_w_van_alstyne" startTime="3421.602" stopTime="3554.415">
    Mr. William W. Van Alstyne 
    We do not. 
    A question was raised earlier as to the ascertain frequency of harsher sentencing in North Carolina in this configuration of cases. 
    I tried to determine that and there are no records kept of this matter. 
    Indeed, I think one can understand the readily why, since the General County Court and now the District Court makes no record and the state normally treats it as though it were indeed a new ball game. 
    We have nothing to compare to work that. 
    This Court however did rely upon a relatively informal survey in Pearce itself that was published in the Court Journal, finding by sample of the judges and their records in the Pearce profile allocations, that harsher sentencing was imposed upon new trial in roughly 70% of all retrials following successful appeal. 
    Now, I am not a practitioner in the North Carolina District Court. 
    I can merely assure the Court that there is wide spread interest in the bar because it is habitual for attorneys to advise the clients pursuant to the District Court proceeding. 
    And unless they are confident of success there ought not to appeal for trial de novo for the frequency harsher sentencing is believed to be quite widespread. 
    But there are no figures available, as I say I do not believe that the condition of records makes it possible together that information at all. 
    Respectfully then, I want to return to our regard the central issue. 
    The court has establish a set of sub-constitutional courts that systematically deny an accused his fundamental Fourteenth Amendment safeguards. 
    It does not give him an opportunity to pray that off against the Superior Court. 
    This is not a case of bargaining of any kind. 
    He stood upon his plea of innocence and he sought recourse to the only mechanism which the state possibly allows him. 
    The state then essentially sets up a kind of electric fence, but if one is brazen enough to press forward with a demand for rudimentary fair play, he is made to take the risk of judicially un-reviewable and unexplained harsher sentencing. 
    That is in the essence is this case. 
    I say the great majority of case State Supreme Courts, not Federal Courts, State Supreme Courts which have reexamined this system subsequent to Pearce, have pronounced it absolutely inadequate and I can anticipate no parade of horribles.

    I am not prepared quite frankly to take position that no aspect to the Fourteenth Amendment whatever applies though the penalty cannot exceed 90 days. 
    Possibly counsel, but at least the impartiality of the trier of facts, for instance, and the requisite of hearing itself, these are all hardcore elements of due process and an absolute notion that they can all universally be dispensed with because a man may be subjected to no more that 90 days laws of freedom.

    The report reads, “Concern has been expressed as to incident of indigency among the defendants and criminal cases processed by our courts. 
    As to the Trial Court’s this data not available. 
    In the appellate division it is available and interesting. 
    Of the criminal appeals docketed in the Court of Appeals during calendar year 1968, 70.3% involved indigents. 
    The figures for 1969 and 1970 were 72.2% and 76.1% respectively. 
    In the Supreme Court 73.1% of the criminal appeals docketed in 1968 were brought by indigents. 
    During the two succeeding years the percentages were 71.8% and 81.1% respectively. 
    This data which seem to support the inference already drawn by some on the basis of the records on appeal that many indigents have come to the appellate court for no other apparent reason and that the court is there.”
