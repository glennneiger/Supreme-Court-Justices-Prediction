speaker="harvey_j_barnett" startTime="42.417" stopTime="264.571">
    Mr. Harvey J. Barnett 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    I am the attorney for the respondent Earl D. Mosley. 
    This case is on certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit and it has been consolidated with the case of Grayned versus the City of Rockford, which is on appeal for the Supreme Court of Illinois. 
    This case concerns a disorderly conduct ordinance of the City of Chicago which prohibits all picketing on a public way within 150 feet of a primary or secondary school. 
    The ordinance exempts from this prohibition, the picketing of a school involved in a labor dispute. 
    It became effective on April 5, 1968. Since September, 1967, respondent Earl D. Mosley had picketed Jones Commercial High School, located in the city of Chicago. 
    He simply walked in the public sidewalk, adjoining Jones High School, carrying a sign which reflected his belief that Jones High School was discriminating against blacks in its admission policies and in the treatment that are afforded to him. 
    It was admitted at trial by the city that at all times Mr. Mosley's activities were peaceful, orderly and quite. 
    It was further admitted at the trial by petitioners that at no time did Mr. Mosley’s activities in picketing the school by himself or with a few other persons ever caused a disturbance at the school or interfered with traffic around the school. 
    After being advised of the passage of this ordinance, Mr. Mosley contacted the Chicago Police Department and was told that he would be arrested, if he continued his activities in picketing Jones. 
    The city admitted at trial that it intended to enforce this ordinance and in fact Mr. Mosley would be arrested if he continued to picket the school. 
    He then filed this declaratory judgment action, seeking a declaratory judgment and an injunction against the enforcement of this ordinance. 
    On the grounds that had violated his right to Freedom of Speech and there was a violation of Equal Protection Clause. 
    The Lower Court after a trial, held that the ordinance was constitutional. 
    On appeal, the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals reversed, finding that the ordinance on its face violated Mr. Mosley’s rights to Freedom of Speech, because the ordinance was overly broad. 
    This ordinance was a violation of the First Amendment right to Freedom of Speech because it is overly broad. 
    The vice of this ordinance is that it sweeps within its prohibition, protected free speech, such as the quite, peaceful picketing of respondent Mr. Mosley. 
    In fact Mr. Mosley engaged in almost the identical activity as that engaged in by Mr. Thornhill in the case of Thornhill versus Alabama, some 30 years ago. 
    This Court has held that peaceful picketing is protected free speech and the state can regulate only the abuses of picketing which is articulated as the test of the regulation of the manner of picketing or the purpose of picketing when there is something in the manner or purpose which gives grounds for the dis-allowance of that picketing.

    Mr. Harvey J. Barnett 
    If the court please the -- at no time have I been able to find any decision of the court which has stated that place and place alone is sufficient to permit the regulation of picketing. 
    It must be coupled with something in the manner of picketing or the purpose of picketing which would give grounds for the disallowance of that picketing.

    Mr. Harvey J. Barnett 
    Well I would say, Your Honor that that statute would be lawful, but Your Honor the difference between that case and this case is that we have picketing here on the public way which in no way -- which prohibits the respondent in this case from lawfully and legitimately exercising his right to Freedom of Speech. 
    The ordinance which Your Honor or the statute which Your Honor would propose, I think would be attached to some legitimate state concern.

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Are you familiar with, I think it's Title 18, Section 1501, that forbids picketing on the sidewalk around this building?
speaker="harvey_j_barnett" startTime="340.400" stopTime="353.703">
    Mr. Harvey J. Barnett 
    I am not familiar with that statute, Your Honor. 
    I am familiar with the Court sanctioning of the statute in Cox versus Louisiana which prohibited the picketing of a courthouse with the intent to influence the administration of justice.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="353.703" stopTime="354.953">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    That’s the same statute.
speaker="harvey_j_barnett" startTime="354.953" stopTime="390.715">
    Mr. Harvey J. Barnett 
    That statute Your Honor, as the Court noted in the Cox case, was one which specifically dealt with a purpose of picketing and the Court found in that case, that the purpose was legitimate, could legitimately be regulated by the state because the state had a legitimate interest in protecting courts from the undue influence and the interference with the administration of justice. 
    The problem with the city of Chicago ordinance is it is not a nearly drafted enactment, that aims specifically at some evil, some abusive picketing.

    Mr. Harvey J. Barnett 
    It’s an ordinance.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="396.666" stopTime="410.030">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    An ordinance. 
    This ordinance had in it that no one can picket within 150 feet of the school for the purposes of disrupting the school. 
    You think that (Inaudible) in Cox case?
speaker="harvey_j_barnett" startTime="410.030" stopTime="421.727">
    Mr. Harvey J. Barnett 
    I think that statute maybe constitutional, Your Honor. 
    They would have to -- the city would then be put to prove at a trial in that case, that it was intent of the person to disrupt the school.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="421.727" stopTime="429.898">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, what of the words were for the purpose of it -- for the purpose of enforcing the administration of the school?
speaker="harvey_j_barnett" startTime="429.898" stopTime="439.945">
    Mr. Harvey J. Barnett 
    I wouldn’t think that the city would have in that instance a legitimate right to be concerned with the influencing the administration in school.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="439.945" stopTime="445.929">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    In the Cox case it was for the purposes of influencing the administration of justice.
speaker="harvey_j_barnett" startTime="445.929" stopTime="489.150">
    Mr. Harvey J. Barnett 
    That’s correct, Your Honor. 
    In that case the Court went on at great length to note that picketing around a courthouse may cause us an undue and an oppressive influence upon jurors, let us say, who are attending the trial in that particular courthouse. 
    In the hypothetical which Your Honor posed, I would think that someone who picketed a school with the intent to influence the administration of that school to get them to, let’s say, meet more blacks or to afford blacks different treatment such as Mr. Mosley's intent, that would be a legitimate concern on his part and the state would not have an overriding interest in preventing that type of conduct and that type of free speech.

speaker="harvey_j_barnett" startTime="494.576" stopTime="542.389">
    Mr. Harvey J. Barnett 
    That’s true -- that’s correct, Your Honor. 
    They both mean of his expressions are Freedom of Speech and that is the problem with this ordinance because what Mr. Mosley was doing, was exercising nothing more than protected free speech. 
    The city admits that he never caused the disturbance or interference with the school and yet this ordinance arbitrarily creates a 150-foot limit within which he is prevented from exercising those rights of Freedom of Speech. 
    Now, the city harps over and over in their brief about disturbances and disruptions around schools as a means for justifying this ordinance. 
    But the simple answer to that is that this ordinance is not directed at disturbances, at disruptions or picketing in such a manner as to create disturbances or disruptions around schools.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="542.389" stopTime="560.651">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    There is a Federal Statute that forbids demonstrations of any kind within either 500 feet or 1000 feet of an embassy of a foreign country. 
    Would you think that falls under the same vein as the argument you're making?
speaker="harvey_j_barnett" startTime="560.651" stopTime="583.837">
    Mr. Harvey J. Barnett 
    I think the Court in one of its decisions indicated that the rationale of the embassy ordinance was that for security purposes and that the government had a legitimate concern in that particular instance of protecting these types of embassies from potential violence and disruptions.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="583.837" stopTime="599.035">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Well, in this case isn’t the ordinance for the purpose and certainly does it not serve the purpose of avoiding distractions of the students from their studies?
speaker="harvey_j_barnett" startTime="599.035" stopTime="612.335">
    Mr. Harvey J. Barnett 
    It may serve their purpose Your Honor, but on the other hand, it brings everything within its ambit. 
    It prohibits all types of picketing, violent and disruptive picketing as well as purely --
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="612.335" stopTime="617.058">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Aren't all types of picketing prohibited under the embassy (Voice Overlap)?
speaker="harvey_j_barnett" startTime="617.058" stopTime="660.126">
    Mr. Harvey J. Barnett 
    They are, Your Honor and I would have my doubts as to the constitutionality there. 
    As I stated, I am not sure if that ordinance is -- that statute has ever have been passed upon, but I think the rationale was that there was a certain legitimate concern about security around embassies. 
    I would think however that if one person was peacefully picketing an embassy, and one of the picket within the 500-foot limit then he want to be entitled to do so under his First Amendment Rights to Freedom of Speech and that is exactly what we have here in this case for Mr. Mosley had no time to cause the disturbance around the school. 
    He had at no time interfered with the administration of the school or disrupted any school activities.

    Mr. Harvey J. Barnett 
    No I think that there would be -- the state would have the right to prevent people who coming on the school house property as such certainly in a protection of students. 
    But this ordinance is specifically drafted to be 150 -- picketing within 150 feet out of public way, so --

    Mr. Harvey J. Barnett 
    Yes, I would think that on a public sidewalk, a person should have the right to peacefully picket and express his views, and this Court has always sanctioned the use of the public sidewalks, the parks in the recent Food Employees case as areas where historical First Amendment Rights to the Freedom of Speech has been sanctioned, and have been --

    Mr. Harvey J. Barnett 
    Well, my argument on it is two-point, Your Honor. 
    One it may well cause a disruption of the school activities, and secondly I think the state has a legitimate concern in protecting the interest of students, in terms of bodily harm to them from outsiders, indiscriminately coming on inside school --

    Mr. Harvey J. Barnett 
    Well, Your Honor I think it's a difference in -- a qualitative difference between someone standing outside a school or public sidewalk, walking in front of that school, and between a person coming in the school, whether there may well be a danger of physical harm to students, well certainly the state has an interest in protecting --

    Mr. Chief justice and may it please the Court. 
    My defendant is -- my client is Richard Grayned. 
    He participated in a demonstration. 
    He was arrested, convicted and fined for violating two ordinances of the City of Rockford. 
    One of the ordinances is the same as one in the Mosley case. 
    It involved not picketing or demonstrating within an 150 feet, and accepted the person picketing on the spot for labor dispute. 
    The other ordinance, prohibited a person engaged in conduct wherein he willfully may or assisted in the making of a noise or a diversion which disturbed or tended to disturb, the peace and good order of the school session. 
    We defend that and we have constantly throughout the litigation contended that these two ordinances are both unconstitutional, that they are violative of the Fourteenth Amendment, and that it represents an interference by the state with a person's right to picket or to speak or assemble. 
    The facts in the Grayned case prior to proceeding in this Court, have not been disputed. 
    The record went up to the Supreme Court on a short record. 
    There was no transcript of proceeding of what occurred in the trial. 
    I -- the motion which made before the Illinois Supreme Court. 
    Without objection of Counsel, we submitted the case on the facts as represented in the briefs which we submitted. 
    For the first time, the city of Rockford has disputed, the facts in this case. 
    And I submit that they not only have disputed them, but they have also made misstatements of fact. 
    I have with me, a report of proceeding that occurred in the Circuit Court of the Seventeenth Judicial Circuit in the case of the city of Rockford versus Richard Grayned. 
    This report of proceedings was ordered by our office, and at our own expense, but not supplied by the city of Rockford. 
    We ordered it back in November, and it was delivered to us this past month on January 17. 
    I brought this report of proceedings with me because I thought the Court might be interested in seeing what the facts were in this case.

    Is that your fundamental position?

    Ms. Hal M. Brown 
    That's the fundamental position with respect to Section 18.1 (i) and also we argue that 18.1 (i) violates the Equal Protection Clause.

    Your Honor, I think that to try and use numbers as a 150-feet and the number of people avoids the whole problem involved here. 
    We are concerned with the interest of the state which are involved. 
    We are concerned with what the people who are picketing or concerned about picketing. 
    We are concerned about the effect of their conduct.

    Ms. Hal M. Brown 
    If an ordinance was passed which said that there could not be so many people picketing who obstructed the ingress and egress with respect to the school, who stopped traffic, who prevented people from using the public way, if that's what the ordinance says, if that's what the ordinance said then it would be constitutional, but there is not evidence of that here. 
    There were 200 people in our particular instance who walked up and down the sidewalk in front of West high school carrying signs which said that “Black cheerleaders may cheer too,” “Black teachers, we want black teachers for black history courses.” 
    They walked up and down in a peaceful and orderly fashion and then the police came, they turned on their loudspeakers, read their ordinances over the loudspeakers and started to arrest people. 
    And the facts in this case show that that's when it appears that people thought what was going on.

    Ms. Hal M. Brown 
    That's correct. 
    Your Honor and I submit that, that language is vague and it does not comport with the standards of due process of law and giving due notice. 
    The persons which to -- to comply with the law and who at the same time wish to exercise their First Amendment freedom, does not give them an opportunity to exercise them, but they don't know what they are going to be arrested for.

    Ms. Hal M. Brown 
    Your Honor, it's also based on the First Amendment because via why its vagueness, which violates due process, it is subject to an over broad application to perfectly protected constitutional freedom.

    Ms. Hal M. Brown 
    I will have to -- the people who drafted the statute, what would be their purpose in drafting it? 
    What state interest would they want to protect? 
    Do they want to protect this Court from being disturbed? 
    The statute in Cox versus Louisiana concerned one that was narrowly drawn which said we will prohibit picketing of persons who seek to disturb, I don't have exact language of it, disturb the processes of administration of justice. 
    In that particular incident, whereas the court is concerned, and where the statute is so narrowly drawn as this Court held it was, I would say that it was --

    Ms. Hal M. Brown 
    I think, Justice Stewart made the appropriate statement when he wrote this Court's opinion in Tinker versus Des Moines. 
    He said, there must be a substantial showing that there would be an interference with the orderly process of the school administration. 
    There has been no such showing in this particular case, Your Honor. 
    As a matter of fact, I think, it is important and I am in accord with this decision, it is important that the students in our school be allowed to see and to participate in exercising their First Amendment freedom, so that in the school they are not only taught for three hours, but they are also taught how to be citizens in this country and how to exercise their rights guaranteed by the First Amendment.

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger

speaker="hal_m_brown" startTime="1551.863" stopTime="1601.077">
    Ms. Hal M. Brown 
    Yes, I do and I also would say that it is significant in my particular case that the City of Rockford has eliminated the labor picketing distinction. 
    Now, Section 18.1 (i) is just at all labor picketing, all picketing completely is prohibited within 150-feet which shows that at the time this ordinance was applied to my client, it not only, it is a remission by the city that it is not only violated the constitution but or it showed that obviously that they were picketing exemption had no compelling state interest to warrant it being there. 
    So, at the time this ordinance was applied to my client, the city had mis-stated, it violated the constitution.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1601.077" stopTime="1681.495">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    I don't suppose the city would agree with you, the change in the arguments has that meaning and only that meaning now would -- 
    I would presume that they would bring forth some other reasons but I submit that this change at this time shows that it has no compelling state interest. 
    I wanted to make a point about 19.2 (a). 
    I already have mentioned that I think it violates due notice, because the person cannot know what conduct is prohibited. 
    So, even if he is trying to comply with the laws, at the same time exercises his constitutional right, he does not have an opportunity, so consequently he cannot act at all without fear of going to jail. 
    The other point is that, with respect to 19.2 (a) as this ordinance is drafted, it says that a person who willfully makes the noise or diversion would violate that section and then it seems to modify that which disturbs or tends to disturb the peace and good order of the school session. 
    I submit that what is happening is that the person is being convicted when he makes a noise or diversion and his intent is just to make the noise or diversion not to disturb or disturb the peace of good order of the school.

   Argument of Richard L. Curry

    Thank you, Ms. Hal.

speaker="richard_l_curry" startTime="1905.555" stopTime="2113.424">
    Mr. Richard L. Curry 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    The issues of this case as viewed by the city of Chicago are three. 
    Does the claim of a free man to use the streets as a public forum exclude even modest regulations as to the time and place within which his rights maybe exercised. 
    Two, if modest regulations are permissible in protecting substantial governmental interest, is Chicago in error in ascribing such importance to its schools and three, is the Chicago ordinance void by reason of being over broad. 
    The city of Chicago believes that the rule of this case ought to answer each question in the negative. 
    The ordinance before the Court is at partial restriction as to picketing and demonstrating around elementary and secondary schools. 
    Reasonable as to time, that is during classes and a half hour before and after, and reasonable I submit as to place, that is within 150 feet of the school building. 
    When local government is attempting to harmonize and accommodate, conflicting demands for the use of streets, the standards as to time and place or every bit as relevant as the controls upon manner and purpose. 
    This ordinance ought not to be viewed as a ban on First Amendment rights. 
    It is clearly and properly, a phrasing or timing of the activities in recognition, that at a certain time and within a certain limited area, there does exist competing interest which the city may rightly acknowledge and regulate. 
    The purpose of the ordinances and the reason for its passage and the reason for the phasing and timing contained in it, is that the city sought to impose a very simple ordinance on school picketing. 
    The city council sought to assure that school kids have a setting for education where tranquility, order, calm and quite might prevail or at least not be minimized by introducing picketing or demonstrating in a customary counterparts. 
    Adderley versus Florida tells us, that there maybe some public places which are so clearly committed to other purposes, that their use for airing grievances is anomalous. 
    In Adderley, it was the private drive way to the jail. 
    In Cox versus Louisiana, it was near a courthouse and in Cameron versus Johnson, it was access to public buildings. 
    Chicago believes that the school house ought to receive similar insulation from what has been traditionally described as speech plus activities, while classes are in session. 
    The ordinance in Chicago was passed in response to widespread and ugly demonstrations, which were taking place on the daily basis at elementary schools, where black students were being bused for the first time. 
    The respondent Mosley would have this Court believe that an ordinance with such a derivation was nearly ploy for stifling his cry for a larger black enrollment at Jones Commercial High School.

    We submit, Justice Marshall, that this is very narrow. 
    This ordinance is narrow and is not vague. 
    The ordinance is precisely drawn and patently designed to accomplish its objectives. 
    It thus fits the court's off, repeated description of the kind of law that should be drawn in the state's exercise of generally unquestioned constitutional power to regulate picketing and street activity. 
    The ordinance does as Thornhill directs us, aims specifically at evils, within the allowable area of state control and does not leave one to guess at where fanciful possibilities end and intended coverage begins.

    Mr. Richard L. Curry 
    Justice Brennan, the exemption for labor picketing has a derogation in these facts.

    That was not adequate protection for the school children against the kinds of distractions and disturbances that generally and usually follow the picketing and demonstrating in the street.

    Mr. Richard L. Curry 
    There is not. 
    A bias posture in this case, if the court please, Mosley would arrogate to himself unimpeded use of the sidewalk actually abutting the school. 
    There is choice of the public forum to remain unencumbered by restrictions as to time and place so long as he is peaceful. 
    And enough gain is staged, he addresses his protest to what is clearly a captive audience. 
    The students themselves forced to attend by state regulations requiring daily attendance. 
    Having rejected the alternative of being across the street or the alternative of coming back when school is out, it is clear that the Mosley's protest is intended primarily for student consumption and here the analogy between Mosley and the hate-oriented group that meets the bus at the other school and which this ordinance is related directly to becomes clear for the first time. 
    The analogy is absolutely precise because there too the activity is intended for student consumption. 
    While respondent cleverly tests this ordinance without arrest and jokingly characterizes his presence at Jones as “sort of a nuisance value especially when I was in private school,” the real object of this ordinance that harassing, bullying, snarling, threatening and intimating entrance way mob waits in the Illinois Appellate Court for this decision to resolve their case. 
    The liberty guaranteed by the constitution is liberty regulated by law and social compact and in order that all men may enjoy liberty, it is but the tritest truism to say that every man ought, if not must, renounce unbridled license. 
    Liberty can only be exercised, this Court reminded us in the Cox's case, liberty can only be exercised in a system of law which safeguards ordinance. 
    For these reasons and for those elaborated in our principal reply brief and in recognition of the substantial governmental interest in education and the relevancy of the time and place criteria established by the Chicago ordinance in protecting that substantial governmental interest from disturbance and distraction, I would hope that this Court would reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit and uphold the validity of the Section 193 of the Municipal Code of the City of Chicago. 
    Thank you very much.

    Mr. William R. Quinlan 
    If the Court please, as we now know this Rockford appeal is identical to the Chicago one in that the anti-picketing ordinances of both cities were identical. 
    It differs in some respects as counsel pointed out the city of Rockford recently amended the anti-picketing ordinance by eliminating, deleting the provisions provided that this subsection does not prohibit the peaceful picketing of any school involved in a labor dispute. 
    Counsel comes to the conclusion that this represents the mission implied to the city that the anti-picketing ordinance as originally passed was obviously unconstitutional. 
    We recognize of course that the amendment that the city of Rockford made has no bearing whatsoever on appellant's personal situation. 
    However when we're talking about motivation, the counsel provides us, the fact is that there could be a question under Fourteenth Amendment and the discriminatory provisions of the labor dispute exemption, there could be and the city of Rockford, the city counsel felt as incidentally to other city counsels and other school boards throughout the length of this country that if that is the problem, we will delete and we did delete the labor dispute exception. 
    It is by no means an admission that the Fourteenth Amendment has been violated.

    Mr. William R. Quinlan 
    Well if I were – I were running the labor union, my pickets would be done at the Board of Education offices, but I think it's possible that there could be some labor dispute. 
    It's never happened in our town, it could happen. 
    And I suppose it's possible and that's what counsel was talking about possibilities that there could be some pickets that use a non-union labor to build Eisenhower School, for instance. 
    Ordinarily, it wouldn't have any application to this ordinance, because it's confined while the school is in session and ordinarily you don't have the school in session until the school is built. 
    Anything is possible. 
    I have the same question, that's about all I can say. 
    It is improbable and the reason, one of the reasons that our legislative body exempted disputes is frankly we had no trouble in that connection and legislators being what they are generally legislate towards some specific situation.

    As to the definition of diversion, I believe the Illinois Supreme Court took that up, specifically the word itself and I hope I can find it immediately or in -- it said, we do observe while the defendant charges that the terms appearing in the ordinance such as noise and diversion -- I am reading from the Illinois Supreme Court opinion, lack of constitutional precision and are two indefinite common terms such as alarmed, disturbed, interfered with and hindered, have been determined to comply with the constitutional requirements of Mississippi.

    I didn't want to (Inaudible) the Supreme Court of Illinois.

    Mr. William R. Quinlan 
    Nor in the magistrate's court, however, I didn't try the case but it does not appear here and it does appear in this transcript the discussion concerning instructions to be submitted to the jury. 
    So probably it didn't occur, at least it wasn't recorded. 
    Now I see my time has almost expired. 
    It seems to me basically that the Rockford ordinances do not differ greatly from the ordinance of the second Cox case, both the ordinances. 
    They are specific as to place, a 150 feet is quite definite and incidentally reasonable. 
    15 feet wouldn't help much and 1,500 feet probably would be too far. 
    The specific as to time, and incidentally the anti-noise, anti-diversion ordinance says around adjacent to the school, the school property not the building, the picketing ordinance, the measurement starts at the building, not the property. 
    Spatially these are specific, I think these ordinances can be. 
    The standpoint at time they are both restricted as to a little different however, the picketing ordinance, a half hour before and after schools in session, the anti-noise and diversion ordinance while school is in session or if they have a meeting anytime during the day and night, when a meeting is being held in the school house.

    What is beyond noise and diversion? 
    What is just beyond protection against the noise and diversion does the anti-picketing ordinance protect against?
speaker="william_r_quinlan" startTime="3559.167" stopTime="3579.678">
    Mr. William R. Quinlan 
    None. 
    I think that the -- and in the preamble of the anti-noise ordinance is for the protection of schools. 
    So that the educational process will continue uninterruptedly, that's the rationale of both ordinances and they were passed just for that purpose and for no other purpose. 
    I believe my time is up.
