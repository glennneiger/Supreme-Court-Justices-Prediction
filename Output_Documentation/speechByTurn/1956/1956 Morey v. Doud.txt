Morey v. Doud

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Yowell, you may proceed.
speaker="g_kent_yowell" startTime="7.198" stopTime="87.967">
    Mr. G. Kent Yowell 
    Thank you, Your Honor. 
    This record shows, if the Court please, that we are dealing with the sale of money orders, small money orders from one cent to $100. 
    Neither American Express Company nor these appellees ever sells a money order for more than $100. 
    Mr. Smith, the Executive Vice-President of the American Express Company testified in this case that the average amount of money orders sold by American Express Company is in the neighborhood of $15, that's the average size. 
    This is obviously not something that is peculiar to Illinois. 
    All over the United States, you see ads in the paper, full-page ads. 
    They don't tell you how much things are anymore. 
    They tell you how much a week it is and many people don't have bank accounts and that accounts for the great growth in -- in the credit, the transmission of credit, the little folks that have to send money orders because they don't have bank accounts.
speaker="harold_burton" startTime="87.967" stopTime="92.945">
    Justice Harold Burton 
    Is there any real difference between these and the type of checks that they use in money?
speaker="g_kent_yowell" startTime="92.945" stopTime="533.563">
    Mr. G. Kent Yowell 
    Not any real difference except this. 
    These appellees' money orders are orders on a bank just like a bank check. 
    They have an account in the bank, special account to cover these money orders. 
    It comes in to the bank, the bank pays automatically. 
    Theoretically, I suppose that they wish they could call up and stop payment on a particular order but that it have to be pretty quick about it because they get right into the bank, the local bank and are paid. 
    Whereas the American Express money orders are not orders on a bank or on anyone. 
    They're a little more like a promise that the American Express Company will pay and as a matter of fact we asked Mr. Smith of the American Express Company, if you ever had some agents that went bad and became dishonest and he said, “Yes, they did occasionally.” 
    And we asked him if in all cases their money orders were paid and he admitted that they are not, that sometimes they suspect there might have been some chicanery they won't pay their money orders and he admitted that sometimes their opinion is not in accord with the -- the man's opinion who put up the money and bought the money order and litigation ensues. 
    And in that connection, the record shows that the American Express Company is not an express company at all. 
    It is not licensed in Illinois, that's admitted in the pleadings. 
    It is a joint stock company under the old Dutch laws in New York. 
    It has only five in Illinois under the Illinois assumed name statute, a certificate that 25 individuals, all non-residence of Illinois are doing business in Illinois under the assumed name of American Express Company. 
    And we asked Mr. Smith about those various individuals and we found out that five of them, including Theodore Roosevelt are dead, presumably this (Inaudible) was filed before any of them died but that is the record in this case, that it is not a certainty that when a person in Illinois buys an American Express money order, it is not absolutely certain at all events that he -- that that will be paid. 
    The Court also had reported the fact that there are three cases in Illinois where the American Express Company was sued and they defended on a ground other than the merits of the case which they might -- might not have any significance because there are only three of them. 
    But as a matter of fact, the American Express Company, the Court should know, was in existence before counsel says it was 1882 because the first case in Illinois was in 1865 when they were actually in the express business in Illinois. 
    Somebody made a shipment of money by way of American Express. 
    The money was lost and a suit followed and the American Express filed a -- an affidavit that the service wasn't good because it wasn't a corporation, it wasn't a legal entity and couldn't be sued, the Supreme Court of Illinois held that that wasn't a good plea because they had to give the plaintiff a better rip which has no significance, no claim it has except that it does show that in 1865 there really were an express company. 
    Now, there were some mention of generic terms expressing exception whether an exception perhaps should be in generic terms rather than singling out someone by name. 
    New York has a statute that contains an interesting exemption that is generic in its nature and it provides -- it's not the statute referred to in the appellant's brief which is the New York check-cashing statute that has no exemption in it and nothing to do with this case, but this is Section 180 in Mckinney's Consolidated Laws of New York, Book 4, part 1, Banking Law, Section 131 and Section 180, "Prohibitions against encroachments upon certain powers of private bankers, saving banks and savings and loan associations. 
    Except as authorized by this chapter, no individual, either for himself or as trustee and no partnership or unincorporated association shall engage in the business of transmitting money or selling money orders unless he puts up at each place from which his money orders are sold, bonds, the federal, state, municipal or preschool district bonds in the amount of $100,000 for each place at which such business is to be conducted." 
    Nothing in this paragraph shall apply to an unincorporated express company having a contract with a railroad company. 
    Mr. Smith, the Executive Vice-President of the American Express Company, testified that American Express Company has a contract -- a contract with a railroad in New York. 
    He said he thought it was -- it was the Skaneateles Railroad Company. 
    The Skaneateles Railroad runs from the town of Skaneateles at the north end of Lake Skaneateles and Onondaga County to Skaneateles junction, a distance of five miles. 
    Because the American Express Company has that contract, a contract with a railroad, it does not have to put up $100,000 bonds in each one of the -- that 2500 places in New York, $250 million in order to sell money orders averaging $15 a piece. 
    Now, we're not attacking the New York statute but it was in generic terms and I give it for the purpose of this illustration. 
    As a matter of fact, the Supreme Court of Missouri had this identical exemption before it and held that it violated the -- the Equal Protections Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment as well as the Missouri Constitution of this very statute.

    Mr. G. Kent Yowell 
    -- that illustrates a point I want to make, if the Court please, if the definition is something -- if it applies to cities of 500,000 and over, we have it in Illinois, if it applies to cities of 500,000 and over, it's good although at the time there's only one city --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="576.207" stopTime="576.803">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Yes.
speaker="g_kent_yowell" startTime="576.803" stopTime="582.444">

    -- but if it says all cities now having a population of 500,000 and over, it's bad.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="582.444" stopTime="583.838">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    And perhaps that that you wouldn't --
speaker="g_kent_yowell" startTime="583.838" stopTime="585.348">
    Mr. G. Kent Yowell 
    But that's a special legislation.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="585.348" stopTime="589.832">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    You wouldn't give that an illustration as one of the most admirable edifying aspects of law would you?
speaker="g_kent_yowell" startTime="589.832" stopTime="735.036">
    Mr. G. Kent Yowell 
    Oh, no, I certainly wouldn't. 
    No and I'm not. 
    Now, I'm giving this New York statute as an illustration because the fact is appellee's licensors in this case has an express company called the Travelers Express Company and it has a contract with a railroad in New York State which runs all the way out of the State, a distance of 11 miles and today there is free competition in New York between the American Express Company money orders on the one hand, Bondified express company money orders on the other hand. 
    There is today free competition between the Bondified Systems and Mr. Smith of the American Express Company mentioned this in his testimony in Missouri and in New York and in Ohio and in Massachusetts and in California and in Texas and in New Jersey but not in Illinois. 
    Now, some of the members of the Court asked the question as to a limitation of $5 million. 
    Well, if the limitation had a reasonable relationship to the objective of the Act, of course it's good. 
    If it doesn't have, of course it's bad. 
    Now, it's one that I think is bad but this is a matter of illustration, Florida passed an Act that nobody can sell a money order in the State of Florida unless he has assets or it has assets that exceed his liabilities by $1 million and unless for a period of five years before they passed the law it sold Travelers checks and money orders in Florida. 
    Now, that I would say doesn't necessarily have a reasonable relationship to the purpose of the Act, although it can be argued that it would have. 
    But that is not the thing we're dealing with here.

    Mr. G. Kent Yowell 
    No, they do not, Your Honor. 
    I tried to get that --

    Have we got any light on how this came to be, that just some fellow -- was it just one of these -- these are pieces of legislation?
speaker="g_kent_yowell" startTime="909.014" stopTime="999.176">
    Mr. G. Kent Yowell 
    No, Your Honor. 
    I will say this; Judge Schnackenberg who was the Circuit Judge who presided in this case below was -- happened to have been the speaker of the House of -- in the House of the Illinois legislature when this statute was passed. 
    Judge Schnackenberg said this at page 116 of the record, Judge Schnackenberg. 
    "Let me ask this, with the exemption of this law we are considering, do you know of any Illinois statute which -- which exempts any corporation or individual by name?" 
    Mr. Soble - “Well, as I say that blue sky law does.” 
    Judge Schnackenberg - “That doesn't exempt the individual by name, it exempts certain securities of their net worth on the New York Stock Exchange and certain exchanges but here the legislature writes into the law itself three organizations that are exempt from the operation of the law and I ask you, has there ever been a statute passed within a law like that before?” 
    Mr. Soble - “Well, I cannot say that I know the answer to that question one way or the other, I don't know.” 
    Judge Schnackenberg, and this gets down to Your Honor's question, "Now, in the legislature it has been almost a religion with us that if anybody was to be exempted or any laws to be applied to a group, it would be described in abstract terms as a class having certain characteristics. 
    I have often wondered where this bill came from named A, B and C, those sacred cows who were beyond the pail of the law."
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="999.176" stopTime="1009.782">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Well, my question was not about the sacred cows but about the law itself. 
    What -- what lead the legislature to deal with this problem?Do we know anything about that?
speaker="g_kent_yowell" startTime="1009.782" stopTime="1043.525">
    Mr. G. Kent Yowell 
    I have nothing about that, Your Honor, except hearsay and I would certainly hesitate to state that in this Court. 
    But I will say that Judge Tehan, who was one of the judges in the Wisconsin three-judge court, he was a Wisconsin State Senator when that law was passed and I have the record here, he said, “Well, I didn't know about this law. 
    I was in the Senate then and I didn't know that they had put this through that wasn't -- he said, “It wasn't ever argued on the floor of the House and it was never on any committee that I knew about." 
    And Judge Lindley said, "Well, Judge, that wont disqualify it." And that's all there was in that record about that.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1043.525" stopTime="1060.267">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Well, lots of legislation comes here. 
    Some years ago I had to write an opinion, the substance of -- in a statute, the substance of which offended me greatly whereby the male bartenders got a law passed to keep out the female bartenders with exceptions.

    Mr. G. Kent Yowell 
    That may not be very chivalrous but at least there was some attempt to have an explanation. 
    Now, the judges -- the three judges in Wisconsin and the three judges in Illinois, they were very aware of the need to defer to the legislative judgment, I think they have as much deference for it as this Court, but they had this record and they have this statute and they could not find that any reasonable relationship of this so-called classification, which actually isn't much of a classification, to the objectives and the stated purposes of the Act which was not only to -- to protect the public but the stated purpose, one of them was to foster currency exchanges.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="1150.180" stopTime="1164.645">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Incidentally, Mr. Yowell, was there a reason you selected the exemption from -- for American Express and did not point at the Western Union or the Postal Telegraph and the other one?
speaker="g_kent_yowell" startTime="1164.645" stopTime="1189.231">
    Mr. G. Kent Yowell 
    There was a very good reason, Your Honor. 
    As a matter of fact, I believe it is three-and-half -- less than three-and-half months after the Act passed, the Postal Telegraph Company went out of existence. 
    I think it was swallowed up by the Western Union. 
    The Western Union Telegraph Company, in order to operate in Illinois, first of all has to get a license as a corporation --
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="1189.231" stopTime="1191.238">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Is this under Public Utility Regulation Act?
speaker="g_kent_yowell" startTime="1191.238" stopTime="1236.572">
    Mr. G. Kent Yowell 
    That's right. 
    It has to subject itself to the Public Utility Commission of the State and come under the Public Utility law as a public utility as does an express company operating in the State of Illinois. 
    Not only that but the utility statute provides that if a corporation is operating as a public utility, it must submit for an inspection and regulation to the Commission any other business it may carry on. 
    So that if the Western Union Company is sending money orders, of course strictly speaking it does, it wires it's agent to pay somebody some money and he doesn't pass money orders over-the-counter, but at any rate it is subject to the laws of the State of Illinois. 
    It is under the --
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="1236.572" stopTime="1239.342">

speaker="g_kent_yowell" startTime="1274.865" stopTime="1299.922">
    Mr. G. Kent Yowell 
    Well, the Act might be very reasonable and permitting them to -- not to have to conform to the regulations prescribed by the Act if the State in some other -- the -- another commission has jurisdiction over them. 
    In other words, if they are submitting to -- to regulation under another statute, I can conceive that it would be a -- a reasonable thing for the legislature to say well, we don't have to make them do it twice --

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    But you -- you think it's unreasonable, so unreasonable it is unconstitutional for them to say, "We know Uncle Sam has trusted its money business enterprise. 
    We know New York has some oversight." 
    They can't say that but if it were required to take out a utility license unrelated to this very business then it would be all right.

    Well, I wanted to answer Mr. Justice Frankfurter, I think I should tell you that in the Wisconsin trial, Judge Tehan who had been in the Senate, he wanted to know, “Well, who's back at this,” he said, “Is it the American Express Company? 
    Is it somebody who just reamed this up or is -- what is the reason for it?" 
    Well, nobody could tell and I'm not in the position to tell the Court here.

    Mr. William C. Wines 
    I told Mr. Justice Brennan that the Act limited the number of agency in a given locality in accordance with the finding of needs of the community. 
    On reflection and recollection, that was done by an amendment to the Act which was not in the original Act and not before the Supreme Court of Illinois when the -- they expressed approval of the exemption.

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    I know but it would still be true, would it not, that if American Express Company locations in a given community where they give a number sufficient that no more locations by American Express or anyone else ought to be in that community, Bondified even if it otherwise qualified under the statute could not get a license to locate in that community.

    Mr. William C. Wines 
    Unless it should be held that the -- it was the amendment to the Act and not the original Act that was unconstitutional, the amendment limiting the number.

    I don't --
