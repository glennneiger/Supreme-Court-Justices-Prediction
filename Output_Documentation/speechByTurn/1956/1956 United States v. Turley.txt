    Mr. Roger D. Fisher 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    This case, the United States against Turley, reaches this Court on direct appeal in the District Court for the District of Maryland. 
    The sole issue involved is the meaning of the word “stolen” as used in the National Motor Vehicle Theft Act. 
    In April 1956, an amended information was filed against the defendant in the District Court. 
    There was only one count. 
    It appears on page 4 of the record. 
    Your Honors would -- in front of you, I think it will help get the facts very clearly in mind. 
    The information alleged that a year ago, January 1956, James Turley did lawfully obtain a certain Ford automobile from its owner, with permission of the owner to use the automobile briefly, on that day to transport certain of their friends to the homes of the latter in Columbia, South Carolina, and to return with them. 
    But that after so obtaining the automobile and transporting said persons to their homes, and before returning with them or delivering back the automobile to its owner, Turley, without permission of the owner, and with the intent in South Carolina to steal the automobile, did convert the same into his own use and did unlawfully transport it in interstate commerce from South Carolina to Baltimore, Maryland, knowing it to have been stolen, where he did on the next day, sell the automobile without permission of the owner. 
    The statute involved is even shorter. 
    It's one sentence. 
    It appears on page 2 of the Government's brief, “Whoever transports in interstate or foreign commerce a motor vehicle or aircraft, knowing the same to have been stolen, shall be fined not more than $5000 or imprisoned not more than five years or both.” 
    The defendant moved to dismiss the information on the ground that it did not state an offense against the United States. 
    The District Court construed the word “stolen” in the statute as applying only to those motor vehicles which had been acquired in such a way that their acquisition would have constituted the offense of larceny as understood at common law. 
    The District Court then found that the circumstances here involved would not have involved the offense of larceny as understood at common law and dismissed the information.

    Mr. Roger D. Fisher 
    -- case comes up to you on the information and its dismissal. 
    The United States agrees that under the circumstances of this case, the -- the conduct be -- would not have constituted the offense of larceny at common law. 
    So, the sole issue is one of statutory construction as to whether the word “stolen”, as used in this Act, is limited to those stolen vehicles and limited to those vehicles that require in a manner which would have constituted common-law larceny or whether “stolen” has the more common everyday meaning of a stolen car, a hot car is used, generally understood in the contemporary community. 
    The Government's position in the word “stolen” is used in the general accepted -- generally accepted meaning of having been taken from one's own use without right and with the intent to deprive the owner of it. 
    We -- more technically, we think that stolen vehicles are those taken by any of the theft crimes, namely, larceny, larceny by trick, false pretenses or embezzlement. 
    We do not think the word should be construed that a stolen vehicle should be analogized to a verb stealing, take one -- taken by stealing that stealing necessarily means larceny, that larceny means larceny as defined at common law for there were statutory crimes, embezzlement and so forth. 
    The appellee's position here is basically that criminal statute must be construed narrowly, that as between the two meanings that might be given to stolen, the common-law definition is narrower and he suggest more definite. 
    He concludes that under the statute, no vehicle could be considered a stolen vehicle but the circumstances in which were acquired would have constituted larceny as understood at common law. 
    The -- there is no definition of stolen in the statute. 
    The legislative history is not decisive. 
    We get some help from it, but I will touch on that in a moment.

    You're stating the legislative report that bears explicit on the meaning of a phrase that has a lawyer's meaning reported by a lawyer's committee without any definition that is to be taken by a non-lawyer committee.
speaker="roger_d_fisher" startTime="498.338" stopTime="668.637">
    Mr. Roger D. Fisher 
    The one discussion by lawyers of the language of the bill occurred on the Senate floor, where the -- there was language in the statute. 
    The statute originally read -- the succeeding section, which also has the word “stolen” in it, originally read that “Whoever shall, with the intent to deprive the owner of the possession thereof, receive, conceal, store, barter, sell or dispose of any motor vehicle moving as, or which the part of, or which constitutes interstate or foreign commerce, knowing the same to have been stolen.” 
    This phrase “with the intent to deprive the owner of the possession thereof” was deleted by the Senate and remained out of the bill. 
    The only language discussing it -- that's -- at all useful is that which appears on page 13 of the Government's brief, where Senator Nelson, who was not the Senator who proposed the deletion but -- explained -- he's the only one who really commented on the problem, says that the Senator -- it's on page 13 of the Government's brief, the Senator from Iowa allowed me a desire to say to examine the authorities upon one of the elements of the offense of stealing is a deprivation of the owner of the things stolen without his consent. 
    The words referred to by the Senator from Connecticut do no harm, though they are really surplusage. 
    Their meaning is implied in the word “theft” or in the “stealing”. 
    If the Senator will look at the textbooks, he'll find that a part of the element of the offense to deprive the owner thereof without his consent. 
    The statute as it was then being considered had the intent to deprive the owner taking place at the time that the automobile was to be received, concealed, stored, bartered or sold, disposed of. 
    The intent was -- was specifically to take care the intent to deprive the owner to use referred to at that time. 
    The fact that it was considered to be surplusage indicates that they understood that theft will include depriving the owner, dishonestly, this property, whether the intent occurred at the time the automobile was originally acquired or whether the intent occurred at the time it was disposed of. 
    I don't think that we can make too much of this. 
    I only think -- I don't think I can say -- say this is controlling, but it seems to me that this is the only legislative history we have aside from the fact that figures were used for stolen cars, which there is no reason to believe we're limited to cars taken by larceny --

    Mr. Roger D. Fisher 
    The word “stolen” has a long history and has never been used until recently as the same as technical common-law larceny. 
    It has been used by non-lawyers and by others from way back, including the sense of embezzlement. 
    I -- I went through the --
speaker="harold_burton" startTime="711.186" stopTime="714.590">
    Justice Harold Burton 
    Was there ever such a common-law crime of stealing?
speaker="roger_d_fisher" startTime="714.590" stopTime="789.998">
    Mr. Roger D. Fisher 
    No, there was never a common-law crime of stealing in our common law. 
    The crime of larceny was expanded by judicial decision from that constituting a trespass at the time to where you could assume a trespass, where there was a -- a fraud. 
    You acquired the possession by fraud, and they said constructed trespass where a servant had the property, and they said, “Well, they had custody and not possession and therefore, there was a trespass when he changed from custody to possession.” 
    And right on the breaking of the bulk cases, where a man takes a barrel of wine and he opens the barrel, they say, “Well, although the barrel was given to him rightfully, it's not embezzlement. 
    It's a -- it's larceny because he committed the wrongful act in opening the barrel.” 
    The -- the crime of larceny was expanded steadily by judicial decision until various embezzlement statutes, and the -- the reason it has never got beyond where it got 100 years ago is that most States, at least in this country, completely have made these crimes dealt by statute. 
    And in many States, larceny by statute is expanded to include the offenses that we're talking about here.

    Mr. Roger D. Fisher 
    The -- the -- I would like to say that while the common law was developing, the word “stolen” was not -- it was being used in the earliest days. 
    Oxford Dictionary traced it back to 1380 and earlier where stolen is used. 
    In -- in the 15th century, there are two cases, instance that they give and examples of the use of the word and it would include what we would call embezzlement. 
    The example given where in the -- where they're referring to Gospel of St. John where Judas bear the person stole that which was given to Christ, 12th Chapter in John, where there -- this is a discussion commentary in the 15th century. 
    In the -- 1640, other reference to it that the -- by the Protestants and the church were fighting that the church is merely -- the wealth of the church is -- is stolen wealth, clearly not taken, not any idea. 
    This was taken by common-law larceny. 
    The word “stolen” has had two meanings. 
    I appeal to Justice Frankfurter that one meaning is the narrow technical one of common-law larceny.

    For the purposes of this case, Justice Brennan, where we have in effect stipulated the -- the information was drafted between the Government and counsel to state the fact as to when his intent took place in South Carolina and there he started -- from there, he started driving north.

    That's my --
speaker="roger_d_fisher" startTime="1245.590" stopTime="1329.626">
    Mr. Roger D. Fisher 
    -- statute. 
    I would like to get right to that point because, well, on this case, it is said that it's stolen there. 
    This will be -- a statute will be impossible to administer construed as three circuits have construed it and not as the other three have construed it. 
    Take two cases, current types of cases, both of which have been litigated. 
    Take the Turley case right here. 
    If the federal statute is limited to common-law larceny, the state authorities will not know what is the federal offense in which they can call in the FBI to help get them on it or not. 
    Unless they can figure out what -- whether Turley deceived his friend when he borrowed the car or whether he would change his mind later because if he got the car by fraud, it will be larceny by trick then the possession will fall in the common-law definition. 
    He changed his mind a block later. 
    He decided to go up to the car then it would be embezzlement. 
    The statute would not cover it. 
    So, the line between state and federal help on acquiring cars would turn on someone's guessing what Mr. Turley's mind was like at the moment he said, “I'll borrow your car and I'll drive his friends to their houses.” 
    Now, we have stipulated here to raise the issue which has come up now in seven -- six circuits. 
    We want a decision on it that his -- he borrowed it honestly and he then changed his mind, embezzled. 
    But if the construction --
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="1329.626" stopTime="1336.081">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Well, in fact then, that worries me.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="1336.081" stopTime="1342.241">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    How would you think the FBI would resolve that ambiguity in any case that they thought was important?
speaker="roger_d_fisher" startTime="1342.241" stopTime="1473.558">
    Mr. Roger D. Fisher 
    Well, you've got a -- a difficult problem of the -- I think they would operate the way they've been operating since those decisions but the -- they've been assuming that they haven't. 
    But the same case takes place when you have a rented car, same problem whether he -- when he rented the car and he acquired possession by trick, finding to go off with it or whether he acquired possession, changed his mind later. 
    In more frequent cases, the installment purchase of a car, here, if he gives a bad check on an installment purchase, buy the new automobile and gives the down payment with a bad check intending to -- to fraud. 
    If you're in a state where the seller's interest is a title interest, the seller keeps the title. 
    He only gives possession then you've got a case where it will fall under larceny by trick because he only gave up possession. 
    If you have a state where the more -- the seller's interest is a land and he intended the title to pass, you will find that this is a false pretenses, and not common-law larceny, and not covered. 
    Now, in the Hite case, which in 1948, 29 years after the statute was passed for the first case to hold that “stolen” was not the definition we urge for but was limited to common-law larceny. 
    In that very case, the Hite case in the Tenth Circuit, the Court looked to the Oklahoma mortgage statute on automobiles in order to find out whether the seller had intended title to pass or had intended to keep the title, which would have made it or not a common-law larceny offense. 
    I might say that following that decision, people who had been convicted and plead guilty to having stolen a car before are then brought 2255 actions and were released on the ground they thought they'd stolen the car. 
    Their lawyer thought they'd stolen a car. 
    I wouldn't thought they'd stolen a car, but the Tenth Circuit now held that this was not a stolen car and so people who were serving time were then released on the misconstruction of the statute. 
    That is the reason another point on two other briefly touched on construing --

    That's further.
speaker="roger_d_fisher" startTime="1500.481" stopTime="1550.241">
    Mr. Roger D. Fisher 
    That's basically our position, that the word "stolen vehicle," whether the verb to steal is used only as to larceny, I think there's a slight difference. 
    But when you get to past participle of stolen, the status of the car, this statute only deals -- and I think that's why they -- the statute that's been passed only said stolen, because it only deals -- it doesn't deal of the taking of the car the way the statutes -- stealing Government property is going to embezzlement or other languages. 
    This deals with the status of a vehicle that has been dishonestly moved by intent to deprive the owner of it and move to another State. 
    It's a -- it's a stolen car. 
    If -- if -- I have a hard time explaining the principle of this case is going to about.

    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    The Government, which is the Dyer Act to cover all kinds of misappropriations of vehicles which are transported across state lines, the Government has asked on a number of occasions that Congress amend the Dyer Act to say specifically what the Government is contending for here today. 
    They are bound successful in the attempt to secure congressional amendment and so --

speaker="fenton_l_martin" startTime="1852.494" stopTime="1979.619">
    Mr. Fenton L. Martin 
    It is referred to Your Honor, in the Government's brief on page -- pages 14 and 15. 
    They have asked that the Act be broadened so that it covers such language as embezzle, feloniously converted or feloniously taken by fraud. 
    Those amendments have failed the passage. 
    So today, the Government is here asking this Court to declare that the Dyer Act is meant all along what Congress has failed to amend it to mean. 
    The only real argument advanced by the Government in support of its position is the fact that Congress would have no reason to differentiate between these various types of takings of automobiles when Congress passed the statute. 
    I think that there are reasons for such differentiation. 
    First, I think that we should bear in mind the time when this statute was passed. 
    The statute was passed in 1919. 
    At that time, the constitutionality of the Act itself was in doubt. 
    There was some discussion as to whether the Interstate Commerce Clause was adequate to cover the transportation that the Dyer Act sought to prohibit. 
    That question was finally resolved by this Court in the Brooks case in 267 United States. 
    I would like, if I might, to read one sentence from the Brooks opinion. 
    This Court said, “Elaborately organized conspiracies for the theft of automobiles and spiriting them away into some other State and their sale or other disposition far away from the owner and his neighborhood have roused Congress to devise some method for defeating the success of the widely spread schemes of larceny.”

    Justice John M. Harlan 
    I missed the significance of that quotation you read in the Brooks case.
speaker="fenton_l_martin" startTime="2060.648" stopTime="2490.174">
    Mr. Fenton L. Martin 
    The significance I think, Your Honor, is that this Court when it was first placed with the Dyer Act, it felt that the Dyer Act was aimed at organized conspiracies of thieves who had “schemes of larceny” to take cars across state lines and sell them, the point being that these organized groups of thieves operate in ways which are traditionally within the framework of common-law larceny. 
    This Court so thought, the lower court in this case so thought, and it was admitted by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals that this was the situation which primarily motivated the Congress when they passed the Dyer Act. 
    I'm referring now to Smith versus United States, one of the cases giving a broad construction to the Dyer Act, withholding that they must admit that typically an unattended car is taken and that this is the traditional form of common-law larceny. 
    I think then that it is not unreasonable to suspect that Congress did not have in mind all of the various ramification of wrongful taking at the time that this Act was passed. 
    Congress was acting or reacting to a need. 
    There was a clearly felt need and the conscious action of the Congress was directed toward common-law larceny. 
    Now, there are other indications of that fact which I feel in all frankness are not determined, given in anyway of the issues in this case. 
    For example, the title of the Act, the Motor Vehicle Theft Act. 
    The Government argues in its brief that the word "theft" is broader than common-law larceny, and it cites Bouvier's Law Dictionary for that proposition. 
    I feel that the word "theft" is a synonym for larceny. 
    It was soused by Blackstone. 
    Other cases have indicated that the word “theft” is a synonym for larceny as understood at common law. 
    There's the matter of Senator Nelson's statement about the textbooks. 
    That was a statement made during the course of debate and perhaps is not entitled of great significance, but surely it must refer to common-law larceny and to treat as is that so define common-law larceny. 
    Now, in view of the fact that the legislative history of the Dyer Act is not itself conclusive, comes in paramount importance, I think to consider the word that Congress used in the Act itself, the word “stolen” and the meaning of the word “stolen”. 
    In this regard, we have I think the help of a number of set of rules of statutory construction. 
    It should be presumed that Congress understood when it used the word “stolen” in the Dyer Act, that a common-law term which is used in a criminal statute and is not otherwise defined by the text takes its common law meaning. 
    Now, I have cited in the brief a number of decisions of state courts holding most emphatically that the word "steal" is synonymous with the word “larceny” as understood at common law. 
    Now, it is true that the word “larceny” is not often defined by use of the word “steal”. 
    It is, however, also true that the word “larceny” in its traditional definition is also -- or that the traditional definition given to the word “larceny” at common law is also the traditional definition of the word “steal”. 
    Now, there are other definitions of the word “steal” over and above broader than the common-law larceny. 
    But in all of the dictionaries, I think, the definition which coincides with common-law larceny is the primary meaning given. 
    The other meanings are given as second and additional meanings as Funk and Wagnalls says in definition too loosely to acquire by other means than stealing -- than larceny. 
    I think we must presume that Congress intended to use the word in its primary and most important and well-understood sense, rather than in a loose and largely undefined sense when it passed the Dyer Act. 
    I think Congress must be presumed to understand that criminal statutes are traditionally strictly construed and that clear and unequivocal language must be in an Act before it will be extended by court to cover other offenses not clearly within the meaning of the words used. 
    Now, I think also with respect to the matter of purpose of the Act, that the history of the Dyer Act in connection with the National Stolen Property Act and the National Stolen Cattle Act is important. 
    The Dyer Act was passed in 1919. 
    It uses only the word “stolen”. 
    It is the contention of the appellee. 
    Of course, the word “stolen” refers to the traditional kind of common-law larceny. 
    And when in 1934, the National Stolen Property Act sections were passed relating to securities and money transported across state lines or the receipt of securities and money which were transported across state lines, that Act used other -- an additional words to the word “stolen”, which clearly indicated an intention to broaden the scope of the -- meaning of the Act. 
    The reason I think is that securities and moneys are more traditionally subject to taking by embezzlement than would be an automobile. 
    When later in 1941 the National Cattle Theft Act was passed, again, the Congress reverted to the use of the word "stolen" alone. 
    That Act also says simply knowing the same to have been stolen. 
    Can we not see that the reason for that is that cattle are traditionally stolen in a sense of taking which would be common-law larceny? 
    It is not often I think that cattle are embezzled. 
    Congress felt no need to extend the scope of the statute beyond the common-law larceny type of situation. 
    When Title XVIII of U.S.C. was codified in 1948, all of the sections were adopted and put under one heading, but they all retained their own words as they had before. 
    So, with the Dyer Act stole -- says "stolen”, the Act relating to securities and money contains additional phraseology and the Cattle Act also says "stolen".

    Mr. Fenton L. Martin 
    Well, a number of those cases are cited. 
    The language from them I should say is cited in the appellee's brief, beginning on page 7 and continuing through page 11. 
    Those cases have -- in the vast majority of instances held that the word "steal" or "stolen” means common-law larceny. 
    In fact, the Courts have been most emphatic about it. 
    The North Dakota court quoted on page 7, said that “steal” was a word of art imposing -- importing a common-law larceny.

    I think --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2702.986" stopTime="2713.790">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    -- they revised it when they got around to revise it. 
    He's talking about simplifying and taking out devious words and combining, left only differentiations on construing this.
speaker="fenton_l_martin" startTime="2713.790" stopTime="2918.048">
    Mr. Fenton L. Martin 
    Yes, Your Honor, they did. 
    I think that Congress had many words at its disposal, had it wished the Dyer Act to cover other than common-law larceny. 
    Now, I would like to make it quite clear that I'm not saying that the word "stolen" cannot mean something broader than common-law larceny or that it cannot mean something broader than common-law larceny in the criminal statute. 
    The point is that if the word is otherwise undefined, it takes the meaning of common-law larceny. 
    The Courts that have held adverse to my position here have quoted liberally from Crabb versus Zerbst and from United States versus Stone, cited in my brief on page 19 and on page 20. 
    Those cases are often cited as authority for the fact that the word "stolen" has a broader meaning than that of common-law larceny. 
    But in those cases and in each of the other cases cited by the Government, the statute was broader in its own language than is the Dyer Act. 
    That was pointed out quite clearly by Judge Hammond in the United States versus Stone case, when he said that “in spite of the fact that the word "stolen" can mean more than common-law larceny, I would hold it here to mean only common-law larceny,” and this case involve stealing goods from a wreck within the maritime jurisdiction, were it not for the fact with the word "stolen" in that statute was joined with the words “plunder” and “destroy,” and the use of those additional words show the clear congressional intent to encompass the whole field of taking from the vessel. 
    But absent such additional words, Judge Hammond said that he would be constrained to hold that statute applicable only to common-law larceny. 
    And that is the distinguishing point in all of these cases that the Fourth, Sixth and Ninth Circuits have relied upon in holding the Dyer Act to have a broad meaning. 
    I think it's important to consider also what the Dyer Act means if it does not mean common-law larceny. 
    A lot of loose language has been used in giving meaning to the Dyer Act in the broader sense. 
    The traditional definition used by the Fourth, Sixth and Ninth Circuits is that it covers any misappropriation without right or law. 
    Other expressions have been to any wrongful taking, any dishonest taking, any unlawful taking and so forth. 
    Now, it is our position that if the Act were so broadly construed, it would be vague and indefinite to the extent that a constitutional issue might arise. 
    And that the Court in considering what Congress met when it passed the Dyer Act should consider that Congress would have desired to avoid any conceivable constitutional issue in using the word “stolen.” 
    And that leads us again to the belief that the word means common-law larceny alone. 
   
   
   
   Rebuttal of Roger D. Fisher

    Mr. Roger D. Fisher 
    I have a minute or two left. 
    Mr. Justice Black, on the amendments to this Act, none of them were voted down. 
    Two of the various amendments proposed passed different Houses but died in the rush of business. 
    Most of them included other minor changes in the Act, including adding tractors and things of that kind, although, a couple were limited to adding the word "embezzlement". 
    I'd like to cover the other federal statutes so we can see that most times in most of the theft crimes, Congress has added a spring of words together. 
    There are, however, cases such as in 18 U.S.C. 1710, whoever being a post master or postal service employee takes or steals any newspaper packets from the post office --

    Mr. Roger D. Fisher 
    Takes or steals any newspaper or packets of newspapers from the post office. 
    Now, under common law definition, you would -- a post master would hardly be stealing things from the embezzlement of materials in the post office service. 
    The vagueness point we think is unimportant. 
    The administrative point or the difficulty of administrating a statute which has a hard time deciding whether it is a federal offense or not depending upon the intent of the individual is the major point which the Government would like to leave with you. 
    Thank you.
