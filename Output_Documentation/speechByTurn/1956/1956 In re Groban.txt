    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Allison, you may proceed.
speaker="earl_w_allison" startTime="5.664" stopTime="191.792">
    Mr. Earl W. Allison, Jr. 
    If it please the Court. 
    We were just before the recess discussing the question of this Court's jurisdiction to hear this particular case. 
    We have presented certain matters to the Court, which I believe clearly indicates that this Court does not have jurisdiction to consider the sole question which is raised here. 
    I would like to merely bring out one or two other points. 
    Perhaps, they are repetitious and so, they are deserving of emphasis. 
    First of all, this hearing, which has been referred to as a hearing is not a -- in fact, a hearing at all. 
    It is described as an investigation. 
    Purpose of that investigation is not merely to find out if somebody is guilty of a crime and then charge him with arson but it is to find out certain other facts, because of the fire as to whether or not it was in incendiary in nature or the result of carelessness and perhaps other matters which come within the province of the State Fire Marshal of the State of Ohio. 
    Secondly, there is one point which I would like to bring out at this time, and that is that we have stayed away in this case from the question of the enforcement here. 
    We did not want to bring in collateral matters which we felt had -- would only more or less clutter up the case, but the Court's attention should be directed to the fact that although, Section 3737.99 provides a more or less summary commitment, there is an alternative procedure which could be followed here, and that is Ohio Revised Code Section 29 -- 27 -- 2917.26 is a general section which makes it a misdemeanor to commit contempt by refusing to obey the subpoena of or to refuse to answer questions or refuse to be sworn of a Court or other legal authority. 
    Other term or other legal authority there would cover of course the many state departments, administrative departments which do have the power to subpoena and examine witness before them. 
    So that -- that section also provides that that would be handled in the usual manner of going in before a Court and having that contempt charge would be an open hearing and that would of course, do away completely with any application of the Oliver and Murchison cases here. 
    So that --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="191.792" stopTime="201.798">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    You -- you suggest do you that the Fire Marshal might intend to follow that procedure rather than -- than the summary one?
speaker="earl_w_allison" startTime="201.798" stopTime="218.898">
    Mr. Earl W. Allison, Jr. 
    I suggest that in view of the Oliver and Murchison cases, I would hope that the Attorney General of the State of Ohio who is the legal adviser to the Fire Marshal might point out the possible advisability of following that procedure.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="218.898" stopTime="223.952">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well, isn't that locking the barn door after the horse is out? 
    He did commit this man, didn't he? 
    This man.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    No. 
    He committed him, didn't he? 
    Not for commitment by someone else, he committed him himself, didn't he?

    Mr. Earl W. Allison, Jr. 
    As I stated earlier, Mr. Chief Justice, the men were never actually committed, that's why I hesitate to say “Yes” to your question -- to your question. 
    He was delivered for commitment but before they could be committed, they were released.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well, I understood you to say that the Sheriff appeared and -- and orally admitted that -- that he had been committed to him, did have him in his custody and justified.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well, he -- he did it for the purpose of this Act, did he not? 
    He admitted --

    Mr. Earl W. Allison, Jr. 
    That is correct.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="273.589" stopTime="274.423">

    -- that he'd been --
speaker="earl_w_allison" startTime="274.423" stopTime="274.651">
    Mr. Earl W. Allison, Jr. 
    That is correct.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="274.651" stopTime="282.735">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    -- committed. 
    And the only way he was committed was -- was by this Fire Marshal who put him under arrest and sent him there.
speaker="earl_w_allison" startTime="282.735" stopTime="284.216">
    Mr. Earl W. Allison, Jr. 
    That is correct.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="284.216" stopTime="291.523">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well then, what -- what distinction do you make between that in any ordinary commitment or attempt to commit?
speaker="earl_w_allison" startTime="291.523" stopTime="320.964">
    Mr. Earl W. Allison, Jr. 
    Well, I was more or less lost in the simultaneous circumstances here which occurred all at the same time. 
    He was delivered to the courthouse. 
    He was delivered to the Sheriff's Office for a commitment and the Sheriff, as you point out, did enter and open the Court and in his return, state that he had received custody of these individuals and that they were then and still are out on bond.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="320.964" stopTime="333.952">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    But that is an unusual procedure, in habeas corpus, is it? 
    That you submit -- submitted defendant even to the custody of the Sheriff for the sole purpose of -- of a -- of having really habeas corpus issued?
speaker="earl_w_allison" startTime="333.952" stopTime="335.547">
    Mr. Earl W. Allison, Jr. 
    That -- that's correct.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="335.547" stopTime="340.871">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    So, this is normal procedure in that respect.
speaker="earl_w_allison" startTime="340.871" stopTime="396.397">
    Mr. Earl W. Allison, Jr. 
    Now, with that, I believe that I have completed our arguments as to the question of this Court's jurisdiction to pass upon the question raised by appellant, namely, the right of counsel in this investigative hearing and the effect thereon by the Fourteenth Amendment. 
    That the argument on the question of whether or not in the event the Court decides to proceed with this matter, the argument as to whether or not the Fourteenth Amendment does apply to the matter here before the Court for consideration will be presented by my colleague, Mr. Werum.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="396.397" stopTime="421.657">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    May I ask you? 
    How could -- how we could, in your judgment reach this conclusion that you assume? 
    As I gathered, you assume that probably the Court in future cases might defy this, your own statute which allows a man to be tried in court before he's committed. 
    I -- I gather that's what -- why you cite that statute, is that right?
speaker="earl_w_allison" startTime="421.657" stopTime="423.617">
    Mr. Earl W. Allison, Jr. 
    I cite that as an alternative --

    Yes.

    Mr. Earl W. Allison, Jr. 
    -- merely the -- this -- the applicability of the Oliver case here was to the effect that the defendant in a contempt proceeding would -- was not granted the right of trial in open court. 
    Under this other section, which I have just referred to, that does provide for a contempt charge makes it a misdemeanor and would, of course, provide such a hearing in open court besides --

    The only way --

    The only way that could be reached would be in some way to vacate this judgment unless the Court considers the case on the basis of a -- of that statute in Murchison and Oliver.

    Mr. Earl W. Allison, Jr. 
    I -- I am merely trying to point out, Mr. Justice, that counsel for the appellants have stated previously in their argument that this private hearing could not be enforced because if this -- if it were committed here, if the witnesses did answer questions or refused to answer after they were sworn that the Oliver case would apply, I was merely trying to point out --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="514.957" stopTime="515.034">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Yes.
speaker="earl_w_allison" startTime="515.034" stopTime="521.234">
    Mr. Earl W. Allison, Jr. 
    -- to the Court that if we went by the other proceeding in the future, the Oliver case would still have no application.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="521.234" stopTime="521.666">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Now, that --
speaker="earl_w_allison" startTime="521.666" stopTime="560.447">
    Mr. Earl W. Allison, Jr. 
    But it must be remembered here that these witnesses, when they were summoned, even refused to take a note. 
    This is not a question of refusing to answer a question directed to them which might have been -- they might have claimed self-incrimination or something like that. 
    That question is not before this Court. 
    These witnesses refused even to be sworn when they entered this investigative hearing. 
    And that of course, in our opinion, is only a further point that this Court has -- this should not take jurisdiction to consider the question which is presented here.

    Mr. J. Ralston Werum 
    If the Court the please. 
    For the purposes of this phase of the argument, I shall assume that this Court has taken jurisdiction of the problem that has been raised, actually, all the way through and the only problem and that is. 
    Do these people have a right to have counsel present at the time that they are before an administrative body or at the time that they are to be sworn? 
    I too have been over all the cases and find that there are very few. 
    In fact, I found none that would say that a witness as such is entitled to counsel. 
    There's no question as to an accused, but you must remember that if the stage of the proceeding that this person was subpoenaed, it was merely a preliminary inquiry, an inquiry by an administrative body. 
    That person, the Fire Marshal was there to investigate.

    For what purpose?

    Mr. Werum?
speaker="j_ralston_werum" startTime="885.003" stopTime="910.000">
    Mr. J. Ralston Werum 
    As he is required under statute to determine whether or not the fire was accidental in origin or incendiary. 
    And if so, if there was a cause, perhaps from that, he can determine who might be one to be charged with it. 
    In which events, that information is directed under the statute to be turned over to the prosecuting attorney for a submission to the grand jury.

    It could be, but at that time and there is nowhere except in the charge as the Court pointed out in the petition of writ of habeas corpus filed by the defendants as they're nowhere do we know what the final outcome would be of this administrative hearing. 
    It might have been a charge. 
    It might have been the causing the arrest of these defendants. 
    It might have been that the fire was found to be of accidental origin. 
    In which case, there would be no criminal charges at all growing out of it.

    They're of the same thing if you find a person dead, don't you?
speaker="j_ralston_werum" startTime="949.744" stopTime="949.976">
    Mr. J. Ralston Werum 
    That is correct.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="949.976" stopTime="953.147">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    You start looking around and --
speaker="j_ralston_werum" startTime="953.147" stopTime="1178.659">
    Mr. J. Ralston Werum 
    And it would be somewhat -- in that case, be somewhat similar to what we call in Ohio, the "coroner's inquiry," in which he investigates in the beginning as -- in effect an administrative body to determine whether or not the suspicious death was in fact a one which bears further investigation from a criminal standpoint. 
    In my research, I did discover what I consider a case not on all fours with this fact pattern on one of which is similar and that was decided by the Seventh Circuit Court. 
    And then, it is cited in our brief and that is Bowles versus Baer. 
    In that case, it arose under the price or rather the Emergency Price Control Act of 1942 and that then a Price administrator had a right for investigation. 
    And that investigation could also be private and that the -- a hearing called by -- or rather I should say the investigation called by the Price administrator, Mr. Bowles. 
    The witnesses showed up with their attorneys and the question was then raised and fought through to the Court of Appeals of the Seventh Circuit and that's recorded in 142 as noted in our Federal Second, as noted in our brief. 
    And there, the Court said and made a -- to me, which I believe is the distinction which I should like to urge upon this Court, that there is a difference between a hearing and an administrative inquiry or a preliminary inquiry. 
    That under due process of law where there is a hearing involved which normally would end up and that a person might, as the end result of that hearing, lose property, his person, liberty. 
    He is entitled to the safeguards that are provided by the Fourteenth Amendment. 
    He is entitled to have his counsel. 
    But at a preliminary inquiry in which there is no deprivation of those rights, in which there is an administrative body that then he is not entitled to have counsel with him. 
    Nowhere have I found anywhere, any case, any time that says that the Fourteenth Amendment requires and you must have a -- a counsel with the person if he so desires it when he is being sworn as a witness. 
    I haven't found a case anywhere on that point. 
    But I did find as one federal case in which interpreting the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution, it said that, “Since a preliminary hearing is an investigative thing in which he will have his day in court at a later time before that body if it is so deemed by the legislature in giving that power to the administrative official, it can't be secret, counsel can be excluded.”

    Do you think that the State could provide that any of its administrative officers or executive officers could have the right to subpoena witnesses and -- and bring him in, in private without -- without the aid of counsel and question him under oath concerning any matter that fell within the purview of their offices?
speaker="j_ralston_werum" startTime="1208.245" stopTime="1218.238">
    Mr. J. Ralston Werum 
    I think that the power is there for the legislature to give it to a -- to the any administrative official. 
    I doubt the wisdom of giving that power but --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1218.238" stopTime="1219.553">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    No, but you do think they could do it?
speaker="j_ralston_werum" startTime="1219.553" stopTime="1262.435">
    Mr. J. Ralston Werum 
    I do you think they have the power so long as a person from that hearing, it isn't the form of administrative inquiry as to determine facts that upon which might be based in the criminal action in the future time. 
    Now, in this case, to me is the perfect example of it if the Fire Marshal through this hearing determines first that there has been a -- the crime of arson. 
    And secondly, that this person looks like they might have done it to bring that to the attention of the prosecutor or to a charge in an affidavit and bring it through to the grand jury and there you have your normal course of criminal proceeding.

    Mr. J. Ralston Werum 
    My personal opinion, Your Honor is -- is to the extent, based upon the Oliver case that -- that undoubtedly would be held by this Court to be unconstitutional.

    Mr. J. Ralston Werum 
    No, sir. 
    I don't think you do, for the simple reason and I don't think that the Ohio courts have passed on this because it was never raised until this Court. 
    And that this -- this defendant here based upon what he has said the case was at all times has been a -- a fact that it was the right to have counsel and not the right of the direct commitment. 
    That has never been raised --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1323.414" stopTime="1323.949">

    Yes. 
    That --

    Mr. J. Ralston Werum 
    And therefore, if that is now the question then perhaps the thing to do, although I hate to say it, is to go back down and start up all over again and give the state courts a chance to pass on this based upon the pronouncements of this Court. 
    But on the question that is before this Court if you take jurisdiction, that question, I think, should be answered also because this Court has never passed on it. 
    And that is the right of a witness under the Fourteenth Amendment to have counsel before an administrative body hearing and not one in which it might subject to a action in which he could be end up in jail.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1371.556" stopTime="1413.611">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    The one -- one thing that would lend weight to -- to your suggestion as a possibility is this -- this fifth head note on page 11 in which it says, "The provisions of the 3737.13 are not violative for the provisions of Due -- of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution." 
    And that -- that Section is the -- is the one which says, “Investigation by or under the direction of the Fire Marshal maybe private. 
    The Marshal may exclude from the place where such investigation is held, all persons other that those required to -- to be present.”

    Why -- why under those circumstances if you -- isn't a -- isn't it true that he has raised the question of illegal commitment, even though he may have asserted fair grounds pursuant to this?

    Of course, in respect to Your Honor, the -- quite often, courts overlook sometimes obvious things, both with the agreements of the parties that they overlook it in order to test out an issue. 
    And as the -- as the facts were stated to you here by Mr. Graham in his opening statement, originally, this was to start out at the level of the Supreme Court of Ohio, but due to an apparent administrative conflict, the commitment was turned earlier. 
    And the -- so, they started to take the long path through to the -- by the Common Pleas Court and up to the Court of Appeals in Ohio. 
    At all times and at all points along this, the only arguments that were presented by either side were always directed to the point that is before this Court today.

    Mr. J. Ralston Werum 
    That basically in an investigation, there is the right -- this Court doesn't under the Fourteenth intend to limit the State as to the means that it chooses for investigation so long as before that person is convicted or is find that they may have the benefits of the Fourteenth Amendment. 
    If the States selects as part of its proving of the investigation to make the hearing secret, then that is up to the State. 
    Certainly, in the grand jury there's many reasons why the grand jury's probe should be secret, not only not to injure and embarrass innocence. 
    That's probably the chief reason. 
    And in this instance, if they want to give the Fire Marshal that right, he has the right. 
    But the Fourteenth, we submit does not mean that he has -- has the right to have counsel present during this administrative investigation because it is not a hearing.

speaker="james_f_graham" startTime="2456.169" stopTime="2532.480">
    Mr. James F. Graham 
    What is to be gained by sending this case back for further records? 
    We take these statutes as they are. 
    We were confronted with an Assistant Fire Marshal telling our clients, "You are coming in. 
    You are going to bring your records. 
    You're going to be sworn. 
    You're going to testify. 
    You're going to do it without counsel. 
    There's a record going to be made and if you fail to testify, we will commit you until you do testify." 
    And that was the order of the commitment as provided by this statute, committed to jail until he testify. 
    Now, that -- those statutes has to be read together. 
    Now, where was we as their counsel or they as the parties going to decide when he had a right to the appearance?

    Not a party.
speaker="james_f_graham" startTime="2559.296" stopTime="2560.467">
    Mr. James F. Graham 
    I beg your pardon?
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2560.467" stopTime="2562.324">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    I didn't say a party. 
    I said a witness.
speaker="james_f_graham" startTime="2562.324" stopTime="2949.562">
    Mr. James F. Graham 
    Eyewitness is subpoenaed before grand a jury in Ohio. 
    I do not believe that they're entitled to counsel, because there -- there are 15 people besides the prosecutor and the grand jury has no right to commit if that witness says, "I decline to testify. 
    I decline to be sworn." 
    All the grand jury can do is to go the Common Pleas Judge and present the matter to the judge and the judge acts from their own. 
    I want to say, Justice Frankfurter that it's a practice in Ohio that usually not to bring or try to bring the accused then. 
    They watch that very closely. 
    Now, Mr. Justice Frankfurter, while we're on that point, let us look at Section 2935.23 of the Revised Code. 
    “Examination of witnesses before arrest after a felony has been committed and before any arrest has been made, the prosecuting attorney of the county or any judge or magistrate may cause subpoena to issue, returnable before any court or magistrate for any person to give information concerning such felony.” 
    This subpoena shall require the witness to appear forthwith. 
    Before such witnesses required to give any information, he must be informed of the purpose of the inquiry and that he is required to tell the truth concerning the same. 
    He shall then be sworn and be examined under oath by the prosecuting attorney or the Court or magistrate, subject to the penalties for perjury under Section of the Code and subject to the constitutional right of the witness. 
    Such examination shall be taken in writing, in any form and shall be filed with the Court or magistrate taking the testimony. 
    Here, we were confronted in this case now by saying "Come in. 
    Bring your records. 
    What proof of loss is filed with the insurance companies will have a bearing on this case and you testify. 
    No counsel." 
    We said “No.” 
    We went to the Attorney General's Office, whom we are on very friendly relationship and on an honorable basis and said to them, “We don't think that's the law, although your former predecessor has said it was.” 
    He said, "Well, we will be glad to cooperate with you and have it questioned. 
    Get it decided." 
    He agreed with us that we should go to the Supreme Court and we did went to the Chief Justice Weygandt. 
    And they said they would hear us one week, just take a week time. 
    We said, “We have no question of delay here.” 
    Now, remember, this is in -- in a small community and these things have bearings upon people's business and upon their standing in the community. 
    And if they -- they went in there and didn't want to testify, the people would gain the suspicion that they were guilty. 
    It tells notoriety. 
    So, we said we will go to the Supreme Court to save time. 
    Whoever is guilty of any crime up there, we will not try to hinder you from finding out who it is. 
    It is not that. 
    It was not our purpose. 
    If you will let my son and I as counsel for these men, we will come in and we will try to answer any question that you want to ask us. 
    We will give you any record that we think you're entitled to. 
    He said, "No. 
    You're not coming in." 
    The Attorney General said, "Well, look, let's get it decided.” 
    Said, “You get your petition all ready. 
    You come over. 
    You'll have to have it, show that, though there have to be a commitment because we just couldn't go into court and get a declaratory judgment on this case." 
    So, with that gentleman's agreement with the Fire Marshal concurring, we appear before the Fire Marshal at 1:30 in the afternoon. 
    The Fire Marshal informs me. 
    He said, "I'm not allowed to come in." 
    I said, "I understand that. 
    I appreciate that." 
    I said, “My clients are not going to testify.” 
    They went in, came back out, refusing to testify. 
    He comes out and he says, "Come on, you're going to jail." 
    And I said, "Well, wait a minute here. 
    We have an agreement. 
    We're going to the Supreme Court. 
    You're not to put these men in jail. 
    You're just to commit them.” 
    "Oh, no." 
    He said, "No, no. 
    We're taking them down to jail." 
    So, they're defying my rights. 
    I've got rights here and I'm going to see that they testify and they're going to obey me. 
    He takes them down on the elevator, takes them down to the Sheriff's Office. 
    The Attorney General was dumbfounded. 
    Certainly, it was not in keeping with our understanding that he -- he was shocked about it. 
    Now, no one, but these prosecutors were gentlemen at all times so was the Attorney General. 
    They took him down and the Sheriff was kind enough to let him sit down in the outer office and that's where they remained until we got one of the Common Pleas judges to grant the writ. 
    Now, that's what -- that is the actual facts as to how these things come up in our hand. 
    So then, when we went in to the Common Pleas Court, we told the Common Pleas Court, "We raise the question that they have -- that they did have a right to counsel in this kind of a hearing before this officer that had this power -- amended powers under the statutes." 
    Because when we're going to make the decision under those cases.

    That statement indicates to me at least pretty clearly that the real essence of your grievance here is not the commitment, not the Murchison case, but the question of whether the Fire Marshal can get testimony without counsel being present.

    But I -- it is our contention that when the statutes have read apart from this brilliant officer, the powers of these statutes have granted him, that he's entitled to counsel. 
    That as Mr. Justice Frankfurter pointed out, we raised it at the -- at the very instance, very beginning. 
    Then, as to the fact that the reason why the Attorney General and our office was wanting to cooperate with it, was for the purpose of keeping away from delay.

    He had no power of commitment. 
    Now -- now, if the Court please, Mr. Justice -- Mr. Justice Harlan.

    But that was not the Oliver issue and that was not the Murchison issue.
speaker="james_f_graham" startTime="3265.564" stopTime="3271.696">
    Mr. James F. Graham 
    You didn't say that in the Murchison issue because that -- it was not -- it wasn't raised in that method in the Murchison case.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Isn't the question of raising, it's the substance of what the claim was? 
    Isn't not -- it isn't -- it isn't there whether it was raised in the beginning or in the middle or at the end, but what was complained of. 
    The Murchison -- the Oliver and Murchison problem was -- was a totally different one from this one.
speaker="james_f_graham" startTime="3291.630" stopTime="3297.605">
    Mr. James F. Graham 
    Well, if -- if this case goes back, if the Court please. 
    If this case goes back, we can write back up with it.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="3297.605" stopTime="3313.688">
    Unknown Speaker 
    But if this case go -- goes back, the chances are that the attorney for the Fire Marshal won't advise him to commit direct in the face of the Murchison case, but advise him to take the alternative method to go before a -- a judicial officer and commit him that way and -- and then you will not have this trouble at all.
speaker="james_f_graham" startTime="3313.688" stopTime="3318.156">
    Mr. James F. Graham 
    I don't believe that under the statute he has that -- he has the right to go to any, because --

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Suppose your client -- suppose -- Mr. Graham, if you don't mind, having been duly advised by you, just as witnesses are advised to go before the grand jury without having the lawyer present. 
    Suppose your client having been advised by you, suggests that he come within anytime of reasonable line, trudging something that you think enter upon the domain or privilege of self-domination, he says, I refuse to answer. 
    I refuse to answer. 
    Well, (Inaudible) and the Fire Marshal doesn't even got there with the privilege against self-incrimination doesn't at all (Inaudible) 
    And your client (Inaudible) to answer his ground and he's committed.

    Mr. James F. Graham 
    Oh, no, if the Court please. 
    I doubt it, Mr. Justice Frankfurter, under no circumstances. 
    I say this.

speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="3398.826" stopTime="3411.419">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    I agree with you. 
    And if he abuses his power or exercise this power he hasn't got, you'd get your relief by coming before a Court and saying, “This man can in secret do what was sought be done in the Oliver case.”

    Mr. James F. Graham 
    Judge Frankfurter -- Justice, I say to -- I -- I say, it is our contention that we have already got him in that position. 
    That he has done something that he's had no right to do.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="3425.547" stopTime="3456.257">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Well, that's right. 
    And that -- they are not -- I'm not willing to pass on your substantive issue, namely, whether the Ohio statute on its face is unconstitutional in that it concurred power upon the field -- insofar as the field Marshal is the only one that might be in companion, the Fire Marshall. 
    The Fire Marshall cannot be authorized to hear a witness without an attending counsel. 
    That is the substantive issue which you contend to this case.

    Mr. James F. Graham 
    Well, let me put it this way with you, Mr. Chief Justice. 
    We didn't argue it from the standpoint if you want to say it of the Oliver case from that standpoint, no. 
    We said that he had no right to commit him because he wouldn't let him have counsel, wouldn't let him have the things that he was entitled to. 
    You see that I didn't want to bring up that test. 
    I didn't want to -- I didn't want to deny the right to go -- of these people. 
    I didn't want to make up a squabble to say that they didn't want to testify. 
    They wouldn't testify because we will testify.

    Well, it -- it wasn't the commitment that we asked to have.
