Service v. Dulles

    Mr. Donald B. MacGuineas 
    May it please the Court. 
    Counsel's skillful argument of yesterday invested petitioner with an aura of irreproachability which I think is scarcely warranted by the record. 
    The facts that were before the Secretary of State, when he exercised his discretion to dismiss the petitioner were these. 
    His counsel indicated, “When petitioner was on assignment with the army as a Foreign Service Officer during the war in China in 1944, it was his practice to prepare the usual Foreign Service reports.” 
    The original of which was transmitted to the Secretary of State, other copies went to the Army and it was his practice to retain one copy in what he termed his personal file. 
    The petitioner himself classified many of those reports as either confidential or secret, and that he was authorized to do. 
    A year later, when petitioner returned to Washington, without making any effort to declassify those reports, without obtaining any clearance from any person in authority in the Secretary in the Department of State, he gave his copies of the Foreign Service reports to Mr. Jaffe.

    Mr. MacGuineas, I don't want to take your time but you surprise me a little bit. 
    Of course, there must be officers since the Government is in obstruction.

    Mr. Donald B. MacGuineas 
    Now, when petitioner, upon his return to the United States, decided that he would go to Mr. Jaffe's hotel room at the Statler, here in Washington. 
    He had not known Jaffe previously. 
    And yet, on that same day, it appears that he made inquiry of a mutual acquaintance of himself in Jaffe as to whether or not Jaffe was a communist. 
    And the reply that he received was not very assuring. 
    The reply in effect was, “I don't think he is but he is very sympathetic.” 
    And later on, petitioner obviously had strong reservations about the character of Mr. Jaffe because he asked another person who was himself admittedly a former communist as to whether Jaffe was a communist. 
    And this other person replied, "No, he is not but he is bad medicine." 
    Now, under those circumstances, petitioner loans to Jaffe several copies of his classified documents without any further control over them whatever, and Jaffe takes them off to New York. 
    He does with them as he pleases, and a week or so later, petitioner meets with Jaffe in New York and recovers possession of the reports.

    All right.
speaker="donald_b_macguineas" startTime="666.584" stopTime="776.272">
    Mr. Donald B. MacGuineas 
    -- in meeting Jaffe. 
    Well, I -- I'm really pointing out that those were facts which were before the Secretary of State when he formed his judgment as to whether or not petitioner should be retained as a Foreign Service officer. 
    Now, I'm not sure whether it was made plain from the argument yesterday, that in so far as the Secretary of State exercised his purported authority to dismiss Jaffe under the Loyalty Program, that is Executive Order No.9835. 
    The petitioner has already received the relief to which he was entitled. 
    When this case was heard in the District Court, this Court's opinion in Peters v.Hobby had just come down. 
    That of course established that the handling of this case by the Loyalty Review Board in the Civil Service Commission was beyond its jurisdiction. 
    And the District Court recognized that and he said that “the opinion of the Review Board is a nullity and I will order the Civil Service Commission to expunge the opinion from the record,' which is precisely the relief which this Court granted in Peters versus Hobby. 
    So, to us, petitioner's present contention and I may say that that relief was granted without objection on the part of the Government. 
    Petitioner's present contention as to the adequacy or the vise of the proceedings before the Loyalty Review Board as an exercise of purported authority under 9835 is simply bidding a dead horse that's not in this case.

speaker="donald_b_macguineas" startTime="809.620" stopTime="853.316">
    Mr. Donald B. MacGuineas 
    Most of these facts were developed at the hearings before the State Department Board and the conclusion of the State Department Board was this. 
    They said, “Petitioner has been guilty of serious indiscretions in giving these classified reports to Jaffe without making a proper investigation of his character. 
    And furthermore, petitioner has been guilty of a breach of the Department's regulations.” 
    “But,” said the State Department Board, “in our opinion, he has now learned his lesson. 
    And therefore, will not in the future be a security risk. 
    And therefore, we recommend that the Secretary not find that he be a security risk.”

    Mr. Donald B. MacGuineas

    Mr. Donald B. MacGuineas 
    No, because there was no elaborate hearing on this last investigation before the State Department Board at which petitioner testified at great length and other people testified. 
    And I may say that the Secretary has before him one other fact and that was the curious contrast between petitioner's dealings with Jaffe and his dealings with Brooks Atkinson who is a reporter of the New York Times. 
    Mr. Atkinson testified before the State Department Board on behalf of the petitioner and he said in effect, “I have always found petitioner exceedingly stroked of us about not giving out confidential material. 
    He has always refused to let me see any classified material.” 
    And yet, by contrast, when petitioner is dealing with Jaffe, a man whose reputation was doubtfully in his own mind, he did not have any such reservations or scruple.

    Very well, I'm suggesting that the Jaffe episode was 1945 and the fact that he was discrete with Atkinson in 1948 wouldn't show that he sought out Jaffe as a good fellow to leak to but was held at from Atkinson.

    I suggest that that's vital in order to draw any inference, discreditable or adverse to Service that later -- that at a later time, he said, "Oh, no, I'm not even going to give it to so estimable on that as Mr. Atkinson."

    Well, believing that he committed no impropriety in turning these papers over to Jaffe.
speaker="donald_b_macguineas" startTime="1284.482" stopTime="1342.954">
    Mr. Donald B. MacGuineas 
    Because when Service was in China, which was of course Chungking in 1944 was a very different atmosphere from Washington, D.C.in 1945. 
    He was on his own so to speak. 
    He was the political advisor of General Stilwell in China. 
    As such, Service considered that he have the right within proper limits of security to discuss with the press the Chinese situation. 
    And he considered, so he testified at least that he has that right to carry that over into Washington when he was back here and that what he did to Jaffe fell within what he considered that right. 
    Although, I say I -- I do not consider that anything at the record that supports the view that even petitioner considered that he have the right to turn over the physical classified documents to anybody.

    This -- this was developed initially before the State Department Board, and then in supplementary fashion, before the Loyalty Review Board which held its own hearing.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1358.051" stopTime="1385.554">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Now, you must choose the way you argue the case of course. 
    But Mr. Atkinson says within explicitness which I should think carries weight in the case, not only as an ex Secretary of State or Secretary of State for the lawyer with his sense of relevance. 
    I did not read the testimony taken in the proceeding to Mr. Service's case before the Loyalty Review Board of the Civil Service Commission.
speaker="donald_b_macguineas" startTime="1385.554" stopTime="1385.775">
    Mr. Donald B. MacGuineas 
    True.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1385.775" stopTime="1404.174">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Not to me. 
    That's rather striking. 
    I can't tell, asking myself, why should a lawyer, let alone, the Secretary of State make such a statement being a lawyer of Mr. Acheson's understanding of what is relevant and what isn't relevant. 
    A complete disavow that even looked at his testimony.
speaker="donald_b_macguineas" startTime="1404.174" stopTime="1637.355">
    Mr. Donald B. MacGuineas 
    Well, that leads us into what we consider the real issue in the case. 
    And if I may, by way of introduction, give the legal situation as it existed at the time that Mr. Acheson made his determination. 
    At that time, there were four statutes and one executive order, which gave Government employees a different classes, certain procedural protections with respect to their removal. 
    There was, of course, the Civil Service Act which covered employees in the classified Civil Service who might be removed to promote the efficiency of the service. 
    There was the Veterans' Preference Act, which gave similar protection to veterans in the Service. 
    There was the Foreign Service Act, which gave Foreign Service officers such as petitioner, a procedural protection of not being dismissed except pursuant to a hearing before a Board of Foreign Service officers. 
    There was, in addition, the Act of August 26, 1950, which this Court construed in Cole versus Young which authorized a dismissal in accordance with prescribed procedure of any employee in the interest of the national security. 
    And finally, there was Executive Order No.9835 as amended which prescribed procedure for the handling of cases of doubtful loyalty. 
    Now, with all those procedures report, Congress, in the Appropriations Act for the State Department gave to the Secretary of State in these words, “The absolute discretion not withstanding the provisions of any other law to dismiss any officer or employee of the Department of State whenever he might deem not necessary or advisable in the interest of the United States.” 
    Now, to us, Congress by that simply wiped out all the law with respect to procedural protection in the dismissal of employees in the Department of State. 
    It left those employees, strictly employees at will at the pleasure, if you please, of the Secretary of State. 
    Now, that of course is not really so remarkable. 
    For a hundred years in our Government, essentially, all employees in the executive branch held tenure or rather lack of tenure solely at the pleasure of the superior officer, the President or the officers under him. 
    And indeed, today, the highest level of officials in the executive branch, hold office solely at the will, solely at the pleasure of the President. 
    By this statute, as we see it, the relationship which obtained between Foreign Service officers and the Secretary of State was exactly as that which obtains between the President and the Secretary of State himself. 
    In other words, the President at any time is free to say to the Secretary of State, "You're doing a fine job but you don't get along with the press or you don't get along with Appropriations Committee, so you've got to go," and that's it, no notice, no charges, no proceeding. 
    And by this statute, the Foreign Service officers were placed in exactly that situation. 
    So --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1637.355" stopTime="1646.647">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well, does the -- does the constitution or any statute say that the President has the discretion to do that or that he has the power to do that?
speaker="donald_b_macguineas" startTime="1646.647" stopTime="1685.725">
    Mr. Donald B. MacGuineas 
    Well, the -- the President's right to do that is derived from the -- his constitutional duty to execute the laws and implied in that, of course, is that if he is to execute the laws, he must have complete control over the executive personnel whom he needs to discharge that function. 
    And hence, except as Congress may otherwise validly provide with respect to inferior officers of the Government, all the executive officers and employees hold their position solely at the pleasure of their superior officer.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1685.725" stopTime="1692.435">

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    As I understood you, Mr. MacGuineas, you said there were four ways of disposing.

speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1772.796" stopTime="1779.439">

    He could have chosen the one that let them free entirely on credits and debits to be supported.”

    Mr. MacGuineas, may I get back with you for a moment to your comparison of the discretion under this statute with the authority in the President at his pleasure to terminate the incumbency of the Secretary of State himself? 
    Now, I gather the Government's position is that in the case of the President terminating the Secretary of State. 
    Now, the President may do that at his pleasure whether or not the President deems that termination necessary or advisable in the interest of the United States may.

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Yes. 
    Well, now, what do you do then with the language of Section 103 which while it speaks in and -- and actually the wording is to terminate in his absolute discretion. 
    That termination is tied to a standard, isn't it, whenever he shall deem such termination necessary or advisable in the interest of the United States?

    Mr. Donald B. MacGuineas 
    But the only question then in this case is did the Secretary make that determination?

speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2072.101" stopTime="2174.382">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    That isn't what he said, Mr. MacGuineas. 
    If you will read and I still insist but not only if I have before me an affidavit of the Secretary of State but one who -- one doesn't have to take much judicial notice, a singularly careful and acute lawyer, to use his language with care. 
    In paragraph 4, he said, “Acting in the exercise, I made a determination to determining -- I made a determination to terminate." 
    That's his conclusion. 
    The next paragraph tells you the basis of his conclusion and the basis of his conclusion, "I made that determination solely, solely as the result of the findings of Loyalty Review Board and as a result of my review in the opinion of that Court." 
    So, namely, that having decided, he had his legislative authority. 
    He had the general security system, loyalty scheme. 
    One must take oneself back to January 1953. 
    That is a very dominant consideration in the mind of everybody from the president, down. 
    I made a determination in the light of the -- having -- having the authority of Loyalty Program gave me and the McCarran Act. 
    I made a determination of severance, but it stopped there. 
    I think we would have one argument, but he goes on and says, "I made that determination, solely as a result of the finding of the Loyalty Review Board."
speaker="donald_b_macguineas" startTime="2174.382" stopTime="2218.840">
    Mr. Donald B. MacGuineas 
    Now, what the Secretary of State seems to me plain enough to be saying there is this, "I exercise my statutory discretion. 
    The only datum, the only fact which I had before me which caused me to exercise that discretion was the opinion of the Loyalty Review Board." 
    In other words, he said, "The only thing I looked at when I made up my mind was to read the opinion of the Loyalty Review Board." 
    Now, that brings us to the heart of the petitioner's case. 
    Concededly, the opinion of the Loyalty Review Board in it and of itself was not an act of Government. 
    It did not establish any legal rights or obligations, either the petitioner or the Government.

    He said, I don't -- I don't agree with the Board. 
    But nevertheless, that is a decision of a Board which goes to the press. 
    It affects the relations of the Department of State with Congress and with the public and I deem within the interest of the United States in the light of that fair fact that the -- such an opinion has been issued that Mr. Service be dispensed.

speaker="donald_b_macguineas" startTime="2655.460" stopTime="2706.805">
    Mr. Donald B. MacGuineas 
    Well, I must take to Your Honor's statement that he made a decision on something they didn't have a right to take in. 
    That's just my point. 
    He did have the right to look at this opinion whether it was legal or illegal. 
    He had the right for instance. 
    Suppose he had said, "I make this decision solely on the basis of the court case in Jones versus Smith.” 
    And subsequently, it turns out that the decision in Jones versus Smith was rendered by a court without jurisdiction. 
    Would that vitiate the Secretary's exercise of absolute discretion? 
    I say no. 
    "Absolute discretion" means jurisdiction to decide rightly or wrongly. 
    It means jurisdiction to decide without subject to review by any other organ of Government and that is plainly what Congress meant, would emphatically used the word "absolute discretion."
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2706.805" stopTime="2772.019">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    At the time that Secretary Hall denied that passport to that Swedish lady, she was Swedish, Danish, whatever. 
    Sorry, going on, Mr. Elg. 
    At the time that Secretary Hall withheld a passport from her, he could have withheld the passport at that time. 
    I think the law seems to be clear that the Secretary of State had untrammeled discretion in the matter. 
    I don't mean to imply controversy and I simply state what the opinion, what the law then was. 
    But that isn't what Secretary Hall did. 
    He gave a reason and there was argued at the bar of this Court, I think as vigorously and as confident as your argue is. 
    It's is one of my first arguments, I remember, that first arguments that I heard. 
    That in as much as the Secretary had absolute power for good reason, bad reason, no reason at all. 
    The fact that he gave a reason that isn't any good doesn't limit his power.

speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2796.931" stopTime="2815.246">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    -- say so as one who had something to do with it years ago. 
    It came to me as a great shock to find that they could be any question about it. 
    And that's why I'm saying the assumption of Perkins against Elg is that the Secretary has absolute power, except, he gave a reason and this Court said, “That reason is no good.”
speaker="donald_b_macguineas" startTime="2815.246" stopTime="2965.429">
    Mr. Donald B. MacGuineas 
    What -- what this Court conclusively established as an interpretation of the passport statute in Perkins v.Elg is that the Secretary of State's discretion is not untrammeled, that it is subject to judicial review with respect to issues of law. 
    Now, here -- and then, may I say otherwise, you are not dealing there with problems so internal to the executive branch of the Government as the tenure of executive personnel. 
    You were dealing with the rights of private citizens who have no employment relationship with the Government. 
    And that right as established by this Court in Perkins v.Elg has about it elements of justiciability which the right or privilege of executive's tenure does not have. 
    Now, even in the case of a dismissal under the Civil Service law where the phrase is, “in order to promote the efficiency of the service,” this Court has consistently held that the discretion on the executive as to the reason for dismissing the man, also the evidence or the data on which he does it is a matter of unreviewable executive discretion. 
    This Court will review for compliance with prescribed procedure and that only. 
    The most striking case to illustrate that is the ever lying case in 257 U.S., where a man was dismissed form the Civil Service for taking bribes. 
    Subsequently, a reinvestigation was held and the President himself decided that those charges were wholly unfounded. 
    The man was innocent and he was reinstated. 
    He then sued in the Court of Claims for his back pay during the period that he was out of a job and the claim that came here on appeal of this Court. 
    The question was whether this Court could take into account the admitted error in the initial or executive determination that the man was not guilty of the things for which he was dismissed, and this Court said, "No. 
    We can't consider that. 
    That is wholly within the discretion of the executive." 
    He got the procedure, which the law gave him to it and as far as the Courts are concerned, that's the end of the matter.

    May I offer you another string to your bow? 
    It isn't -- it isn't merely that if he acted under the Loyalty Program, then he acted under a determination, which this Court held the Board was powerless to make. 
    But at least not to the string to the bow for you to pass, but the -- the difficulty here is not nearly that he doesn't -- he does the Hobby as he notified the legality of that. 
    But the conditions under which the Loyalty Board as I understood Mr. Rhetts' argument that the circumstances of the -- before the Loyalty Board on the basis of which they rendered their decision to it and not now needless to say committing myself to it that they acted on testimony which was the demonstrably or concededly inaccurate, unreliable, etcetera, etcetera, made a basis for judgment which on the face of it shows couldn't have been, if it relies on -- if he parted to that into account that that is also subject to -- to challenge on the general theory that any abuse of discretion no matter how unlimited this subject to challenge. 
    And that if -- that if the Secretary of State sets forth, I acted on the testimony of absolutely disreputable people. 
    I'm hoping to say that this was -- I acted on the testimony of actually disreputable people, people on whose testimony I wouldn't dream of facing the slightest reliance on my own affairs of light and that's good enough for me. 
    I'm not so sure you would be standing here and say, "That's an unreviewable discretion." 
    All discretion is subject to the implications of a Due Process Clause even though it may not be a due process problem.

    But in this field of executive employment, I do stand here and say exactly that, and I say it because it's what this Court has held time and time again.

    There's never -- have those been cases in which the exercise of discretion was challenged as based on conduct which if it took place in the criminal case, one would say violated due process?

    Mr. Donald B. MacGuineas 
    Well, certainly, traditional concepts of due process have never been considered applicable to executive dismissal.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Well, when you say they've never been considered? 
    They may -- certainly, Perkins v.Elg was a brand new decision so far as anybody who is earning a knowledge of the law was concerned. 
    When you say it's never been considered, one can say it's never been before this Court that the basis of determination was something which if conceded by the Government would in a criminal case involve violation of due process.

    Mr. Donald B. MacGuineas 
    Well, all I'm pointing out is that in the Civil Service dismissal, the employee doesn't even get a hearing in the most rudimentary sense of the term.

    I agree with you entirely. 
    I -- I for myself go with you most of the way, almost all the way that under 30 -- under 103, the Secretary of State in just -- had this Secretary tell Mr. Jones that his services will terminate that afternoon and he is not responsible to anybody.

    And if that reason is an invalid reason. 
    But, are we getting attention to the whole of the affidavit of the Secretary? 
    Do we end the discussions thus far take account of the last paragraph of it or any sense in determining to terminate the service of Mr. Service? 
    I did not consider that I was legally bound or required by the opinion of the Loyalty Review Board to take such action. 
    On the contrary, I consider that the opinion of the Loyalty Review Board was merely an advisory recommendation to me. 
    And that I was legally free to exercise my own judgment as to whether Mr. Service's employment should be terminated and I did solely exercise that judgment. 
    Is that what he said?

    Mr. Donald B. MacGuineas 
    Exactly. 
    Now, what the Secretary is saying there is, "I recognize that this opinion of the Loyalty Review Board had no more force than a newspaper article.

    Could you -- could you take the two minutes that's remaining to deal what seems to me to be the real trouble in this case.

speaker="donald_b_macguineas" startTime="3382.656" stopTime="3408.327">
    Mr. Donald B. MacGuineas 
    No, our position, which I can only state in summary fashion on the regulations argument, is this. 
    First, those regulations by their own terms are dealing with terminations on these grounds either of loyalty or security. 
    This was not a termination of petitioner, either for loyalty or security ground. 
    This was a pure termination in the interest of the United States.

    Whether he did or not if -- if that's the sole thing they acted on and all they had to do with was security and loyalty.

speaker="donald_b_macguineas" startTime="3469.147" stopTime="3473.072">
    Mr. Donald B. MacGuineas 
    Because he was discharged under the statute, and the statute under which --

    Because of what was said into the Loyalty Report.

    Mr. Donald B. MacGuineas 
    But not that the Secretary concluded that this man was disloyal merely because he read an opinion. 
    He may have disagreed with everything in that opinion and still said --

    And still said, “I'm doing it solely on the ground of what they said.”

    Mr. Donald B. MacGuineas 
    No, doubt about that but --
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="3514.075" stopTime="3519.825">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Well, what's the difference between that in substance, the real substance of discharging him for loyalty reasons?
speaker="donald_b_macguineas" startTime="3519.825" stopTime="3547.736">
    Mr. Donald B. MacGuineas 
    The difference is what I thought I had previously indicated. 
    The Secretary may have looked at this report and he said, "I don't believe a word in this report, but it's the only thing I'm going to look at. 
    But nevertheless, the pubic relations at the time indicate that it's desirable to dismiss the Secretary." 
    Now, that's not a dismissal on loyalty grounds, to security grounds. 
    It's merely a dismissal because the Secretary conceded to be in the interest of the United States under all the circumstances to dismiss the man.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="3547.736" stopTime="3551.353">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Was that what they told Service, they discharged him for?
speaker="donald_b_macguineas" startTime="3551.353" stopTime="3625.418">
    Mr. Donald B. MacGuineas 
    Well, that was -- the Secretary told him. 
    He said, "I am discharging you, both under the loyalty ground and under the absolute discretion statute." 
    Now, the second point, if I may proceed on the regulation point is that even if contrary to our contention, the Court treats those regulations as applicable to an exercise of absolute discretion in the interest of the United States. 
    Those regulations were complied with. 
    I --I regret that the time does not permit but the details of that are set forth in our brief. 
    The final and last point is the one which was not raised by the Government's result, was advanced only by the Courts and the suggestion that Congress passing this statute in the circumstances that existed at the time, was all these procedural laws in effect intended that this discretion be exercised without any procedure, whatever. 
    And that therefore, if the Secretary under that statute turns right around and proscribed the same procedure that he had already he's merely nullifying the course of the statute.
