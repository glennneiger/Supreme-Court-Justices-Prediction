    Mr. David Previant 
    If the Court please, this case comes here on writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of the State of Wisconsin to review a judgment of that Court which restrains the petitioners from peaceful picketing at the place of employment of nonunion workingmen. 
    Litigation was initiated in the Circuit Court for Waukesha County which entered ex parte temporary and permanent injunctions against such picketing. 
    On appeal to the Wisconsin Supreme Court, it, first, rendered the decision, in which unanimously held, that the lower court was in error and reversed the lower court with directions to dissolve the injunction. 
    Upon motion for rehearing and after re-argument, some seven months later, the Court reversed itself and, by a vote of six-to-one, reinstated the permanent injunction, holding that it was in error in its first opinion when it directed the lower court to dissolve it.

    Do we have to pursue a study or a motion?
speaker="david_previant" startTime="101.257" stopTime="300.373">
    Mr. David Previant 
    On motion. 
    The case presents the question whether such peaceful picketing at the place of employment of nonunion employees, unaccompanied by any demand upon the employer and preceded only by a solicitation of the nonunion employees, is protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments of the Constitution or whether, as the court below found that such picketing was engaged in for the unlawful purpose of compelling the employer, through economic coercion, to interfere with the rights of his employees not to join a union in violation of the state law. 
    The evidentiary facts are simple and they are undisputed. 
    The employer operates a place of business in a gravel pit in the Town of Oconomowoc, County of Waukesha in the State of Wisconsin. 
    In its operations, it employees from some 10 to 15 employees, all of whom are eligible for membership in either of the three unions which are the petitioners here. 
    In August of 1953 and again in April of 1954, the petitioning unions solicited directly the membership of these nonunion employees, discussed with them the advantages of organization, but their invitation was rejected. 
    Now, there is some statement in respondent's brief that this solicitation occurred over a period of 12 months. 
    The record does not so show it, but we believe it is immaterial. 
    After the refusal of the employees and, again, without any approach ever having been made to the employer, without any demand ever having been made upon the employer, the petitioners commenced picketing. 
    They picketed at the site of the gravel pit on a public road immediately adjoining the gravel pit where the employer maintained his place of business and where the nonunion employees were working. 
    The sign which they displayed carried the very simple and truthful legend that the men on the job were not 100% affiliated with the American Federation of Labor. 
    And, the sign was signed by the three unions involved, the Building and Construction Labor's Union, the Operating Engineers' Union and the Teamsters Union and, that is, the local unions of those organizations. 
    There is no proof with respect to the extent of the traffic which used the road. 
    There was no proof with the extent to the number of customers which might come to that particular job site to transact business with the employer. 
    The picketing was completely peaceful and completely orderly. 
    There was no obstruction of any kind, no threats, and no violence.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="300.373" stopTime="302.689">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    In number, how many were there?
speaker="david_previant" startTime="302.689" stopTime="603.547">
    Mr. David Previant 
    Two or three, sometimes one. 
    The record is -- I don't believe that there's even a reference in the record to that. 
    It may be, if there is, that there were one. 
    But, there was no mass picketing, no finding of mass picketing of any kind. 
    Now, some truck drivers of material suppliers to this place of business refused to go through that picket line. 
    In consequence of which, the employer used his own trucks with which to pick up the materials which had been or would have been delivered by these other truck drivers who did not go through the line. 
    He did sustain inconvenience. 
    He sustained expense and he sustained damage. 
    When I say “he,” I speak of the employer. 
    Now, all of these facts were alleged by the employer and they were admitted procedurally by the petitioners. 
    I say, therefore, there is no undisputed evidentiary fact in the record. 
    When respondent says that there is some dispute, respondent refers to the allegation, also contained in the bill of complaint, that the picketing was unlawful because it was indulged in or engaged in for the purpose of coercing the employer to coerce the employees in the exercise of the right not to join a union and, therefore, to coerce him in violation of state law and, therefore, the picketing was unlawfully purposed. 
    It was also charged that the picketing was unlawful per se because of the existence in the State of Wisconsin of a statute which defines a labor dispute as a controversy over wages and working conditions between an employer and a majority of his employees and a further statute which says that unless there is a labor dispute as so defined, picketing is unlawful. 
    The Union denied the unlawful purposes. 
    The Union asserted that the wages and working conditions of these employees were less than those which prevailed in union contracts. 
    They asserted the desirability of inducing these employees to join their union for the purpose of protecting their standards, and they asserted the unconstitutionality of the Wisconsin statute which was invoked defining a labor dispute and prohibiting picketing unless pursuant to a dispute so defined and asserted also that any restraining order or injunction which might be entered under these factual circumstances would deprive them of their rights under the Fourteenth Amendment conjoined with the First Amendment. 
    In the circuit court, or what would ordinarily be the trial court, in view of the allegations of the complaint and the admissions of the petitioners here, there was no evidence taken. 
    The Court made its decision based upon those uncontroverted facts. 
    It found, number one, that there was no unlawful purpose. 
    It found, number two, that there was a purpose to organize the employees who did not belong to the union, said, as a matter of fact, to induce the plaintiff's employees to organize and affiliate with the unions. 
    It found that to be the purpose. 
    However, it felt that it was bound by the Wisconsin statutory scheme of prohibiting picketing unless the picketing was pursuant to a dispute between a majority of the employees and the employer. 
    So, it found the picketing unlawful, under the statute which I've alluded to, and entered a temporary injunction restraining the picketing. 
    The parties there upon stipulated that the record contained all of the facts that would be adduced in Court on the merits. 
    And, on such stipulation, the Court then entered its permanent injunction making, again, the same findings of facts and the same conclusions of law. 
    From that point, the unions took an appeal to the Wisconsin Supreme Court and because the holding of the Wisconsin Supreme Court initially is pertinent to these proceedings with the leave of court. 
    I would like to quote this one flat unequivocal finding of the Wisconsin Court in the first decision. 
    The Court said, “The testimony would not have supported a finding of the facts constituting a violation of either of the subsections.”

    Mr. David Previant 
    111.06 (2)(a) restrains the unions from coercing employees in their right to join or not to join a union.

    Mr. David Previant 
    The final rehearing was that the violation of (b) and that is all that is involved in this case. 
    Now, again, the Wisconsin court said no threats were made against the plaintiff. 
    No demands were made upon them. 
    It does not appear that any of it's -- it does not appear that any of the defendant's representatives had even spoken to plaintiff law officers about their desire to organize its employees. 
    There was no violence, no force, no threat of force, no disorder, or physical destruction to plaintiff's property. 
    There was no evidence that defendant's representatives had coerced or intimidated any of plaintiff's employees in the right to join or refuse to join either of the defendant unions. 
    There was only peaceful persuasion exercised by the carrying of a banner bearing a truthful legend.

    Mr. David Previant 
    It could not have found coercion to accomplish an unlawful purpose in violation of Wisconsin statue.

speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="731.935" stopTime="734.179">

    Mr. David Previant 
    -- but it may have been coercive. 
    It may have been compulsive. 
    It may have been inducing. 
    There are many adjectives that might describe the effect which picketing may have. 
    But, to say that it is illegally coercive, in that, it was to compel the commission of an unlawful act is an entirely different thing. 
    That is the finding which the trial court refused to make. 
    That is the finding which the Wisconsin Supreme Court refused to make in the first decision. 
    That is the finding which the Wisconsin Supreme Court made in its second decision.

    Would that be unconstitutional?
speaker="david_previant" startTime="872.342" stopTime="919.802">
    Mr. David Previant 
    Well, now, the Wisconsin Court did find that this was coercion to get Union recognition by using the influence of the employer in that regard. 
    In other words, by either having the employer say to the Union, “I recognize you” or having the employer say to the employees, “You must join the Union or I'll discharge you” and thereby putting the Union in a position of representing the employees. 
    Now, that's what the Wisconsin Court said. 
    And, we're not according with any statutory policy that says an employee has a right to refuse the join a Union, that says that an employer must not interfere with the exercise of that right, and that says a Union shall not picket the employer to compel the employer to interfere with the exercise of that right.

    That that was a disallowable inference by the Court, is that right?
speaker="david_previant" startTime="1038.230" stopTime="1203.823">
    Mr. David Previant 
    It's precisely our position, Your Honor. 
    The Wisconsin Court did reject the idea that picketing here could have been restrained because of the statute which said it had to be only in pursuance of the dispute between a majority and an employer. 
    In fact, in another case decided the same day, it had declared that statute unconstitutional and they had refused to apply that principle on this case on the authority of the Swing and Wohl cases. 
    On rehearing, however, without the -- without any further facts, without any further evidence, and without referring to any further acts, the Court concluded that it was in error in making its initial finding that the record would not support a finding of unlawful purpose. 
    It said it had given insufficient consideration to other rights which might be involved in the situation. 
    It said it had a right to draw its own inferences from the undisputed facts, just as we say this Court has the right to do so. 
    It concluded that the Union hoped that the picketing would interfere with the business of the employer and, thus, bring pressure upon the employer to coerce the employees to join the Union. 
    It concluded that the message of the banner could not have been of any enlightenment to the employees because the employees had already been solicited and were aware of the fact that the Union wanted them to join. 
    It concluded that, since the picketing was on a country road and business was patronized by only a small number of customers. 
    When I say that, that's an inference which the Court drew, it's not in the record. 
    This picketing could not be the guidance of the -- or it could not for the guidance of the community. 
    So, having rejected those possible bases for picketing, it came to the ultimate conclusion that the only purpose was to influence the deliverymen and this would then compel the employer because of the inconvenience and damage sustained by it to either continue -- permit the continuance of the picketing with loss to him and, possibly, the loss of his business or by some means or other coerce his employees, in violation of the Wisconsin statute, to join the Union in violation of section 111.06 (2)(b) and, therefore, the Court vacated its original mandate that reinstated initial judgment. 
    The Unions were permanently restrained from engaging in any picketing at or about the premises where the nonunion employees were employed and where business is located.

    Mr. David Previant 
    That's right. 
    The picketing cases of this Court are very extensively reviewed in the brief that was filed here by amicus curiae. 
    We don't intend to examine and analyze each of those cases in detail. 
    They may be summarized generally and briefly, as holding number one, that picketing is the working man's means of communication. 
    It is a form of free speech. 
    Number two, that in some aspects it has some plus considerations and, so, it may be a little bit more than free speech and, therefore, it is subject to regulation by the State in some limited aspects. 
    Those limited aspects, under the decisions of this Court, were that picketing which is enmeshed with violence or in a background of violence could be restrained, or that picketing a place which has no economic connection with the area of the dispute could be restrained, or that picketing to compel the violation of a valid state policy could be restrained. 
    This Court did make it clear, however, that picketing to -- could not be restrained merely based upon the State's notion of what is a labor dispute or trying to establish artificial bounds to a labor dispute. 
    Actually, this case involves that series of cases in which this Court held that picketing to compel a violation of the valid state policy may be regulated or restrained by the State regardless of whether that state policy is announced by the judiciary or by the legislative branch of the State.

    Mr. David Previant 
    No, Mr. Justice Frankfurter, you're right. 
    What I am seeking to do here inept way is to emphasize the fact that that is the only issue and that we should not be detoured from that issue by appeals that had been made by the respondents here with respect to other policies which might be applied, or the strength of a labor union, or the growth of a labor union, or change of economic circumstances. 
    That is the only issue here.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1420.344" stopTime="1421.180">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    All right.
speaker="david_previant" startTime="1421.180" stopTime="1545.300">
    Mr. David Previant 
    And, we say, in considering this record, this Court is not bound by the conclusions of the Wisconsin Supreme Court with respect to the purpose of the picketing based upon undisputed facts in the record. 
    We say that that is not a finding of fact. 
    It is a conclusion of law. 
    It is, at most, a mixed finding of fact of law and that this Court has traditionally asserted its right to draw its own conclusions whereas, here, the facts are undisputed. 
    We say that even if it may be considered a finding of fact, as distinguished from a conclusion or inference of law, that it's still subject to independent review and evaluation here because it involves a claim of first rank and that's his rights under the First Amendment. 
    That was decided, we say, by this Court not only in the other civil liberties cases involving coerced confessions or discrimination in the empanelling of juries, but was decided by this Court in the very picketing cases which have previously been before this Court, and I refer to Thornhill, Meadowmoor, and Graham in which this Court said so. 
    We think there's one other consideration which this Court must give in determining whether or not the inference or the conclusion drawn from Wisconsin is a valid one and, that is, we believe, the presumption which would ordinarily prevail in favor of state action does not operate when, as here, a substantial claim is made to First Amendment rights. 
    We say this normal presumption must yield because of the presence of other considerations, other than the comity between state and federal government. 
    The freedom of expression, under the decisions of this Court, is the rule. 
    The restraint is the exception and any doubt, we say, under the decisions of this Court, must be resolved in favor of the fundamental right. 
    Where they had at least --

    I appreciate that some of the Justices feel that they are in a preferred position. 
    I appreciate that some of the Justices feel that they have a momentum for respect. 
    I think, to quote Justice Frankfurter's language, but I think, in any event, all of you have agreed that they are entitled to a great weight -- a sufficient weight to overcome the presumption of constitutionality. 
    I think where the figure of agreement is that there is no presumption of unconstitutionality in examining the statute. 
    Now, we do not so here assert that there is a presumption of unconstitutionality in the action taken by the State here through its judiciary.

    Mr. David Previant 
    Well, all right. 
    Well, we do say that, under the decisions of this Court, no matter what the test the Court may have applied, the Court has made it fairly clear, it seems to me, that there is a heavy burden upon those who would justify the restraint to prove the basis for that restraint, and that you need clear unequivocal and convincing proof.

    At least, the Court has agreed also that there is required a solidity of evidence. 
    In other words, if you're dealing with these rights, whether you say go slow or whether you say the burden has shifted or whether you say the presumption has shifted, you must have something in the record more than the various kind of an inference based upon speculation or remote possibilities.

    May I ask you a question to get myself clear. 
    You say the only thing we have to consider here is whether there was any right to draw an inference that this statute was violated, Number 111.06 (2)(b). 
    You -- you agree that the statute is valid in saying that there can be no picketing to coerce, intimidate, or induce an employer to interfere with his employees in enjoyment of their legal right.

speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="1755.144" stopTime="1787.429">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    And, you say your only quarrel is that they found the statute was violated with inadequate inferences -- inadequate evidence to support the inferences. 
    In what is it short, do you say? 
    Do you say there's no evidence to show that they coerced, there's no evidence to show that they intimidated, no evidence to show the purpose to induce, or that there's a failure to show that the purpose was to interfere with some of the employees in enjoyment of their legal rights?

    We say the Union may not coerce the employer to coerce the employee in his right not to join. 
    And, we say there is not one single fact in this record from which a reasonable inference may be drawn, from which a finding may be made, that the picketing, under these facts and under these circumstances, was for the purpose of coercing the employer to interfere with the rights of his employees.

    A solicitation of nonunion employees by representatives of the labor union and a discussion with them of the advantages of organization, followed by peaceful picketing with a truthful banner at the site at which these nonunion employees are working, unaccompanied by any threats, violence or intimidation, unaccompanied by any demand made upon the employer to enter into a contract with the union or to interfere with the rights of his employees not to join or to join the union.

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Well, now, what other -- what I gather -- I understood you to mean by conclusion or signal or whatever the word is, that, in that way, pressure was exerted upon the employer, which I think you said earlier would be unlawful pressure, to induce his employees to join this union so that the normal operations of the business could resume.
speaker="david_previant" startTime="2694.116" stopTime="2732.758">
    Mr. David Previant 
    Well, if we were to assume that one of the objects, one of the things that at least the Union foresaw was that this would act as a signal, it would not flow from that that, because some person, the employer in this case, might violate the law as the consequence of what is agreed to be the exercise of a constitutional right, you can then reason backward from a subjective reaction of the employer to the consequential damage and say that the action, therefore, in its beginning was unlawful.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="2732.758" stopTime="2752.834">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    No, what I want to get to -- what I want to get to is if, in fact, this picketing was in part purposed to shutoff deliveries to this employer and so affect the conduct of its business that it would, in an effort to relieve itself, put pressure on the employees to join this Union. 
    Would you have a case?

speaker="david_previant" startTime="2757.190" stopTime="2805.097">
    Mr. David Previant 
    Well, on that hypothesis, I don't have a case because you have assumed what has to be proven here and which was not proven. 
    You have assumed in your statement that, number one, it was intended solely to be a signal. 
    Number two, that the signal was responded to. 
    Number three, we knew it would be responded to. 
    Number four, we knew if it were responded to, it would hurt the employer. 
    Number five, we knew that it would hurt the employer, he would violate the law. 
    Therefore, we intended to hurt the employer to violate the law. 
    Therefore, we go back to the signal and say it is no longer constitutionality protected. 
    Now, it's that kind of a priori reasoning, non-sectarian reasoning, upside down or backward reasoning that motivated the Court, in our opinion, in this case.

    To say that picketing was --
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="2807.089" stopTime="2815.352">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Of course, if you had taken the newspaper advertisements or had an article written, you probably would not have accomplished shutting off deliveries to this employer, would you?
speaker="david_previant" startTime="2815.352" stopTime="2891.708">
    Mr. David Previant 
    We may or we may not, and I don't know that that's the test, whether effectiveness is the test. 
    It may be that, in a particular community, the State of organization is so high that even a newspaper ad might induce a great many union people not to go to the store or to make deliveries to the store or to the gravel pit. 
    It may be, as in a small community like Waukesha County, that neither picketing, nor advertising, nor radio, nor movies would persuade anybody not to continue to do business with this employer or not to continue to go to that employer's place of business. 
    But, I say that our right to picket, a constitutional right, if you please, does not depend upon such slender rights that we're going to look to the effectiveness, that we're going to look to the subjective results, and then reason backwards from that point to determine whether, in the first instance, we were unlawfully purposed when placed that picket or we were malicious or we intended deliberately to run somebody out of business in this way or compel it in the alternative to violate the law. 
    And, that is what Wisconsin did to us here. 
    They made that conclusion on the record which, in our opinion, is completely excepted or completely lacking in any justification for that kind of a conclusion.

    Would it have made any difference to your case if there had been evidence in the record that the Union had gone to the employer before picketing and politely, without coercion, without threat of picketing, said “we'd like to have your shop organized”?

    There might be, then, a great deal more basis for drawing an inference that we're trying to put the heat on the employer because we've made glorified effort to interest these people in organization. 
    Supposing we had drop a hint some place down the line to one of the employer's competitors. 
    We're going to make this employer sign the contract and then we picketed, but nothing like that is in this record and that is precisely our point, Your Honor.

   Argument of Leon B. Lamfrom
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3185.319" stopTime="3191.126">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Lamfrom.
speaker="leon_b_lamfrom" startTime="3191.126" stopTime="3329.721">
    Mr. Leon B. Lamfrom 
    If the Court please, I would like to just -- for the enlightenment of the Court, restate a few things about the pleading and the manner of disposing of the case on the pleading. 
    And, I should like -- what I think of it, Mr. Justice Brennan, to say to you that the Court -- the Wisconsin Supreme Court which determined that it had the power to make findings of its own on a record of this kind, where there was no oral testimony, did find in effect that one of the purposes of the picketing was to cut off the transportation facilities of the employer. 
    I may call your attention to page 35 of the transcript on that point. 
    In the middle of the page, the Court says, this is its second opinion, “the question then arises whether the defendants violated Section 111.06 (2)(m) of the statute and, thereby, engaged in picketing for an unlawful purpose. 
    The trial court refused to find as plaintiff requested that the picketing on plaintiff's premises had been engaged in for the purpose of coercing, and so forth, to become members of the defendant labor organization and for the purpose of injuring the plaintiff in his business of his refusal to, in anyway, interfere with the rights of his employees to join or not to join a labor organization.” 
    They go on to say here, “We are of the opinion that the finding should have been made picketing may be more than free speech when it is conducted as it was in this instance, upon a rural highway at the entrance to a gravel pit for an exceedingly small number of possible or probable patrons of the owner's business might pass and be influenced by the Union's banner. 
    It is more than the mere exercise of the right of free communication.”

    No, they were not controverted, not in any manner of shape or form. 
    We must remember, if you please, the Wisconsin Supreme Court undoubtedly took judicial notice of the situation which was existing here with reference to the geography of the State. 
    The premises in which this gravel pit was conducted were described by meets and bounds as in the town and readily intelligent to the Supreme Court judges of the State of Wisconsin as to what the locus in Court was, and that is taking into consideration in their making these various findings which they themselves made as a result of the motion and argument on the rehearing.

    Mr. Leon B. Lamfrom 
    Well, I think they arrived at that finding, Mr. Chief Justice, upon their own knowledge of the situation as it existed in that locus because that is a sort of a trunk -- county trunk road, off even the -- off the main highway and is in a distinctly rural situation where it is not used by persons who are normally engaged in business back and forth.

    Mr. Leon B. Lamfrom 
    Page 30 of the transcript. 
    I would like to, if I may, read just what the Court said in the first paragraph of its opinion to indicate to Your Honors here the basis upon which it made the final holding in this case. 
    We have concluded that we were in error in our original determination of the issues in this case and, therefore, withdraw the opinion on the mandate previously entered. 
    We are convinced that, in our study of the issues presented, we gave too little consideration to the fact that there are limitations upon the right of free speech and that the prohibition of action against free speech is not intended to give immunity for every use or abuse of language. 
    We gave him sufficient notice to the fact that free speech is not the only right secured by our fundamental law and that it must weighed here, for instance, against the equally important right to engage in a legitimate business, free from dictation by an outside group of the right to protection against unlawful conduct which will or may result in a destruction of a business, that both the right to labor and the right to carry on business are liberty in property. 
    We left out of calculation the rule that the Court is to consider not only the established facts, as they appear in the record, but that it should also give attention to the inferences reasonably and justifiably to be drawn there from. 
    Now, in connection with that, I would like to point out to you in a sort of an itemized way the different elements that entered into the Court's conclusions and those are contained on page 49 of our brief. 
    It sums up the bases, the factual bases upon which the Court came to this conclusion. 
    The title of -- the title is the right to engage in a lawful business free from outside interference is also a constitutionally -- is constitutionally protected. 
    When the Supreme Court handed down its second opinion upon rehearing, it recited the following principles among others which, in part, have motivated it to reverse its first decision and to which it had previously given too little consideration. 
    And, those are the facts which I call to Your Honor's attention to in the beginning of the decision. 
    There are some other considerations which commence with (e) on page 49 that, in considering the right of freedom of speech, it must be recognized that the right is to be evaluated with the right of the many who have no interest whatsoever in the relationship between the defendant union and those who may seek to acquire as members. 
    That, by its very nature, every right is related to a duty to exercise so as to cause a minimum of harm to another, least of all to an innocent bystander, that the right of freedom of speech may not be considered a part from that of society to maintain order, that when one who seeks freedom -- that one who seeks freedom may not wholly ignore his neighbor's right to it. 
    Now, we have had quite a lot of controversy in the labor relations and in the legal actions that flow from them about recognition picketing and organizational picketing. 
    Some inquiry from, I think, Mr. Justice Clark --

    Mr. Leon B. Lamfrom 
    Well, it was directed to that point as to whether or not there is a difference between picketing which results from a demand upon the employer to recognize it as a bargaining agent and picketing which is indulged in without any demand or communication between the Union and the employer. 
    There has never --it has never seemed to me that there is any difference in that kind of an approach because the objectives, whether it is so-called recognition picketing or so-called organizational picketing, is the same, namely, to achieve a status whereby the Union gets the representation for the employees involved and proceeds along the normal lines of the sequence of Union representation to attempt to get some kind of a collective bargaining contract. 
    Now, what was the employer here, under the law of Wisconsin, up against, regardless of whether this was organizational picketing or recognition picketing? 
    Our statutes provides, the Wisconsin Employment Peace Act which have been before this Court a good many times in other cases, that it shall be an unfair labor practice for an employer to bargain with the representatives of employees who do not represent the majority. 
    If this Union had come to the employer in this case, not representing a majority, and the employer would have bargained with it, he would have been guilty of an unfair labor practice under the law of the State of Wisconsin.

    Mr. Leon B. Lamfrom 
    If an employer, Mr. Justice Black, bargains with a union, it does not represent a majority of the employees involved in the Union, he is guilty of an unfair labor practice. 
    Now, obviously, this employer must have known that this Union didn't, in any manner, represent the majority of the employees, so that if he had even desired to bargain, he would have been guilty of an unfair labor practice. 
    Now, what was the other alternative for him to do? 
    He was confronted with the picketing which had the same effect the moment that picketing -- the picket was placed there, it had the same effect upon his business situation as a home, a house, would have if you put a sign on the door, there is a hysteria here. 
    There is no difference from the moment that that picket got there, as far as this company was concerned, as to deliveries of supplies in and finished product out, it was quarantined. 
    You must remember that we have here the Teamsters Union. 
    The Teamsters Union, and I have no doubt that it was perfectly legitimate for the Supreme Court of Wisconsin, if it did so, to take judicial notice of hot cargo clauses, anti-picket crossing line clauses. 
    The employer was, from the time that that picket was placed there, cut off from the proper conduct of his business.

    Mr. Leon B. Lamfrom 
    Under the Wisconsin statute, and I think it should be. 
    I think, here, you yourself, in one or two opinions and some of your writings, have indicated the -- that picketing is per se more than freedom of speech. 
    That it has coercive elements in it which distinguish it from freedom of speech and make it something considerably more. 
    And, now, what happened here, if Your Honors please, was a realistic dramatization of modern labor relation. 
    It is all right to use the word “peaceful picketing” and “peaceful persuasion.” 
    That it is all right to use the word “organizational picketing” or “recognition picketing” to distinguish between certain rights which are conceived by some courts and some writers and conceived by more courts and more writers not to have any difference. 
    But, here was a drama that was actually taking place. 
    The actions in it spoke louder than the words. 
    They had -- contrary to counsel's statement, the Union had been, for over a period of a year, at various intervals, doing their best, I presume, as the fact show here, to persuade these employees to join the Union. 
    And, these employees, as the trial court expressly found, the express finding had no -- had no desire and made that manifest for the Union to join the Union. 
    Now, the arts, the very keystone, of the Wisconsin Employment Peace Act is the freedom of employee choice, and all the allegations and all the unfair labor practices which are set out in that Act, and there are many of them, both on the part of employees and the unions and on the part of employer, are designed to protect that freedom of -- freedom of choice on the part of the employee, whether or not they want to be members of a union or whether or not they don't want to be a member of a union. 
    And, one of the unfair labor practices on the part of employees is that, where the employees exert pressure upon the employer to exert pressure upon the employee --

speaker="leon_b_lamfrom" startTime="4953.133" stopTime="5076.155">
    Mr. Leon B. Lamfrom 
    -- the one that I have here. 
    I just want to press upon Your Honors, although I know the question of facts that is here, that the Wisconsin has never been a laggard in social and economic progress and in the progress of labor relations, legislation and judicial decisions which have for their purpose, generally speaking, of bringing about industrial peace and economic justice. 
    This Act says that labor relation constitute a three-way street, that they employ -- impose obligations and duties and confer privileges on employees, unions, and employers and, upon those two elements in labor relations, to serve the interest of the public. 
    And, I repeat again that the safeguard that is in that Labor Relations Act or in the Wisconsin Employment Peace Act is the fact that the right of the employee to choose to join a union or not to join a union is the whole keystone of the Act, and that any party to the labor relationship that, in any manner, tries to intimidate, coerce, induce, or force in any manner an employee to make a choice against his will is guilty of an unfair labor practice. 
   
   
   
   Rebuttal of David Previant
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="5076.155" stopTime="5083.688">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Thank you, Mr. Lamfrom. 
    Mr. Previant, you have some time left.
speaker="david_previant" startTime="5083.688" stopTime="5205.945">
    Mr. David Previant 
    I'm addressing myself to the question asked from Mr. Chief Justice Warren. 
    There was no allegation and there was no proof with respect to the number of people who travels on this county highway, this country road, or with respect to the number of customers that might be there. 
    It first arose in the Court's decision on the motion for rehearing and we, in a footnote to our brief, point out that there is no evidence to support it. 
    I think the case has been thoroughly canvassed.I just want to point out that there are other alternatives to an employer in this position. 
    Many employers survive picketing very well. 
    Many employers, in fact, increase their business on the patronage of those who, for some reason or other, are not sympathetic to the union's cause. 
    If any, this particular employer might increase his truck fleet to get his deliveries just on the money he may be saving by his employees not being members of the union and not drawing the union wage. 
    And, finally, although we have never ourselves believed that an employer should be anything but strictly neutral in these matters, this Court and the law have indicated that it is not beyond the possibility for an employer to sit down with his employees and to discuss with them, fully and frankly, both the advantages and the disadvantages of organization if he does not, in so doing, either make a promise of benefit to them in exchange for whatever action they may take or to threaten them with reprisal in exchange for whatever action it takes.So, we are not here confined, as the case might indicate, with solely the question that he has either got to yield or go out of business. 
    And, again, I say, the fact that an employer might be inclined to violate the law is applying a subjective test. 
    It's applying a test of the effectiveness of the picket line and should not be used in determining whether or not a right which is of constitutional rank is unlawfully purposed or not.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="5205.945" stopTime="5218.945">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    May I say, I am cheered by the suggestion that, in Wisconsin, the atmosphere is such that that's a reasonable expectation on the part of the employer.
speaker="david_previant" startTime="5218.945" stopTime="5232.736">
    Mr. David Previant 
    Thank you.
