    You may proceed.
speaker="stanley_fleishman" startTime="30.506" stopTime="163.011">
    Mr. Stanley Fleishman 
    If the Court please. 
    This is a criminal appeal from the State of California. 
    The appellant was convicted under California Penal Code, Section 311, which among other things makes it a crime to keep the sale and to advertise obscene books. 
    The case started with array. 
    At an appointed hour, police officers descended upon the home, the business office and the warehouse of appellant and they seized hundreds or thousands of books and pictures, parting them away in two trucks and in a car. 
    Appellant was charged in the exact language of the complaint. 
    The evidence was simple. 
    The State proved that the appellant had in fact mailed circulars advertising pictures and books. 
    And then it proved that the appellant in fact kept pictures and books to fill by mail the orders received by mail. 
    From the welter of material seized, the State selected some 31 books, 10 magazines and an assortment of pictures and introduced them together with some mailing paraphernalia such as circulars and the like. 
    This was the entire case of the State. 
    The trial court found the appellant guilty and sentenced him to a 60-day jail term, a $500 fine and gave him two years probation. 
    In affirming, the Appellate Department stated that it found that appellant had in fact kept books for sale and had advertised the books. 
    The Appellate Department did not consider the pictures that were in the case.

    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Is it possible to tell from this record what pictures these were from (Inaudible)
speaker="stanley_fleishman" startTime="191.869" stopTime="237.699">
    Mr. Stanley Fleishman 
    I would say that it would include the six books, if anything, that the State insists were included in it. 
    There are three novels and three medical text or works by doctors. 
    There are some confusion as to three but I would say that at least the three novels were found by the trial court to be obscene and the State now says they're obscene, although the Appellate Department did not rule on that, Your Honor. 
    There's a procedural thing, I think, it's not material however, to the issue as we -- as we view it because it's our position that the statute and our attack here, Your Honor, is upon the statute. 
    We believe that --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="237.699" stopTime="263.680">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Is that the -- it may not be material from what you want to argue. 
    But is that the only question before us? 
    Are you -- put constitutionality to -- aside, evidently, you don't put that aside. 
    You don't -- I mean the constitutionality of the statute on its face. 
    I gather from what you've just said, you don't raise a question that assuming the statute was constitutional, it wasn't evidence justifying the conviction.
speaker="stanley_fleishman" startTime="263.680" stopTime="271.112">
    Mr. Stanley Fleishman 
    We do take that position.

    Well, but again --

    Yes, Your Honor.

    Yes, Your Honor.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="281.218" stopTime="301.324">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    -- to that conclusion, argumentative. 
    Assume that you make any other point that there wasn't evidence by which the trial court could have found that these books were obscene within the scopes of the statute as construed by your court, whatever -- it made a construction maybe to make that point.
speaker="stanley_fleishman" startTime="301.324" stopTime="308.358">
    Mr. Stanley Fleishman 
    It's our position that under the construction of the statute by our court, each and every book was not obscene.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="308.358" stopTime="325.358">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    All right. 
    And so that passing or before getting to the -- or not getting to the main question that you seek to raise, and you say, we would have to say whether this particular book was obscene.
speaker="stanley_fleishman" startTime="325.358" stopTime="330.055">
    Mr. Stanley Fleishman 
    It would be our position that we would be entitled to a reversal, Your Honor, if -- because --

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    I just want to know what the issues are here. 
    You just -- you said a minute ago, this is all the material because you say the statute on its face is unconstitutional.

    Mr. Stanley Fleishman 
    That's correct.

    Mr. Stanley Fleishman 
    Then, we say there is other confusion in the record as to what we were convicted under.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="349.914" stopTime="372.474">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    That's the next question I was coming to. 
    That was the bearing of Justice Harlan's question as I understood it. 
    Namely, do you maintain that in as much as there was a hodgepodge and no -- no selection that the judgment of conviction violated due process because you were convicted on no particular charge or -- or the charge wasn't sustained?

    Mr. Stanley Fleishman 
    It includes that there, it was stated differently, yes, Your Honor.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="436.334" stopTime="443.797">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well, let's take it the way it's stated in your brief.
speaker="stanley_fleishman" startTime="443.797" stopTime="446.047">
    Mr. Stanley Fleishman 
    It's under 1 (c).
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="446.047" stopTime="448.337">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    All right. 
    How does that read?
speaker="stanley_fleishman" startTime="448.337" stopTime="457.535">
    Mr. Stanley Fleishman 
    "It is impossible to determine even after conviction and affirmance in the state courts in what particular appellant defended the law."
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="457.535" stopTime="471.615">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well now, and must that not be read -- that's only a part of a sentence. 
    It's only a clause in there. 
    Shouldn't you read the whole (c) with that?
speaker="stanley_fleishman" startTime="471.615" stopTime="516.924">
    Mr. Stanley Fleishman 
    Certainly, there were -- we had a whole due process question here, Your Honor. 
    In the due process question under (c), we had in mind the vagueness of the statute, and because of the vagueness of the statute, the necessary vagueness of the trial throughout, it was all tainted with the -- and it's all tainted because of the essential vagueness of the statute, Your Honor. 
    But that part of it, in my opinion, was that particularly whereas in the case at bar, it is impossible to determine even after conviction of what we were convicted. 
    That was meant to include the argument that we are now discussing.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="516.924" stopTime="548.656">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    May I suggest the reason when I asked the particularity about these matters is that when briefs are submitted, your jurisdictional statement or petition for certiorari raising questions, the Court then decides whether it wants to bring out as it brings the case here all the questions or whether it wants to sit down. 
    And that's why this Court has been very strong against considering questions that weren't formulated on the basis of which jurisdiction was noted.
speaker="stanley_fleishman" startTime="548.656" stopTime="553.985">
    Mr. Stanley Fleishman 
    Well, I think in our jurisdictional statement, we did attempt to set it forth fully, Your Honor.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="553.985" stopTime="574.330">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Well, you really, Mr. Fleishman. 
    You think your questions in your jurisdictional statement remotely would indicate to consider anybody. 
    To me, thinking to try and to read it intelligently that you wanted to raise that there wasn't evidence on which the Court could have convicted. 
    Do you think that's involved into the one?
speaker="stanley_fleishman" startTime="574.330" stopTime="587.285">
    Mr. Stanley Fleishman 
    Well, it's not a -- an evidence question, Your Honor. 
    This is a -- a constitutional question. 
    What we meant to raise by the jurisdictional statement was that this trial because of the vagueness of the statute resulted in a hodgepodge as Your Honor point --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="587.285" stopTime="613.298">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    You didn't say a word about vagueness in your statement of constitutional questions presented, not one word or intimation. 
    Other -- in other cases indeed as triad, there were those explicit statements. 
    This appeal presents the following questions under the constitution of the United States, one and two. 
    One is that that it abridges freedom and two that it conflicts with the mailing, then it was preempted by the federal authority.
speaker="stanley_fleishman" startTime="613.298" stopTime="620.715">
    Mr. Stanley Fleishman 
    One was that it abridges freedom because it a vague statute, it's a sensorial statute. 
    It's -- it's vague in -- in the area of free speech, Your Honor.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="620.715" stopTime="627.842">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Well, you -- you're now telling me it's vague. 
    What I am saying is you didn't say any of your jurisdictional statement.
speaker="stanley_fleishman" startTime="627.842" stopTime="630.483">
    Mr. Stanley Fleishman 
    I'm sorry if -- if Your Honor didn't see it there. 
    I -- I thought we --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="630.483" stopTime="635.541">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Alright. 
    I couldn't see it if it isn't there.
speaker="stanley_fleishman" startTime="635.541" stopTime="848.875">
    Mr. Stanley Fleishman 
    As I was saying, the appeal here is basically upon the statute. 
    Penal Code, Section 311 makes it a crime for anybody to write, published, print or in anyway distribute or advertised an obscene book. 
    That's all that said in the statute. 
    There is no definition as to what is obscene. 
    There has been a construction given to this statute by the Appellate Department to the Superior Court in the case of People versus Wepplo. 
    That is the authoritative construction of the statute. 
    There it is said that a book is obscene if it has a substantial tendency to corrupt or to deprave its reader. 
    How? 
    By arousing lascivious thoughts and inciting lustful desires. 
    Now, it's immediately apparent, Your Honors, that this statute encompasses all books at the outset, all books. 
    Then, a court may in a sifting process permits some books to go as good and condemn others. 
    But in doing so -- in doing so, the Court has no guidance or whatsoever because we submit at the outset that it is impossible, utterly impossible, for a defendant to know in advance whether a book is going to arouse lascivious thoughts or lustful desires and if these desires and thoughts in turn are going to corrupt the person. 
    And it is likewise impossible for a judge or a jury to make this determine -- determination legally, they may make it emotionally. 
    Now, there are, of course, a great number of cases. 
    This Court holding that where a statute is so broad that it may encompass protected as well as unprotected First Amendment rights that the statute must hold before we ever reach particular application of the statute. 
    Our first contention is that because this statute, as interpreted, applies only to thoughts and only to desires because it has nothing to do with conduct that this statute is absolutely forbidden in total nothing, no book we contend that only arouses thoughts and only arouses desires maybe condemned under the First Amendment. 
    I say no book. 
    But in any event if some books may be condemned under the statute, it's perfectly claim that the statute is broad enough to include within it books that may not be so condemned. 
    History proves this under the standard obscene works of the greatest work have been condemned and with in a great variety of cases. 
    The State concedes as much. 
    They say that's true but that was of yesterday, they say, those things don't happen today.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="848.875" stopTime="856.698">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Are any of -- are any of these books obscene as of today?
speaker="stanley_fleishman" startTime="856.698" stopTime="861.750">
    Mr. Stanley Fleishman 
    Certainly, Your Honor. 
    Lillian Smith's Strange Fruit is an obscene book.

    I say that the standard that California replies, which is a mental obscenity statute which says, "That if a book is going to arouse bad sexual thoughts that it's a bad book and it's an obscene book and that that book may not be distributed." 
    I say that is no good. 
    Now, it may be -- it may be that an obscenity statute which is narrowly drawn and which is related to conduct may breach some material which Your Honors think maybe controllable.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="928.716" stopTime="936.417">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    What do you mean by related to conduct that the book must say to whomsoever it's addressed you go out and do this, is that what you mean?

    Mr. Stanley Fleishman 
    I'm saying that we would have to have, Your Honor, a much narrower statute.

    Now -- if on the other hand, something that Your Honor may have in mind, it could be tied in with conduct perhaps and could be specifically defined, perhaps that would be reachable. 
    I have in mind for example Judge (Inaudible) and Judge Frank's test that they set forth as constitutional requisites. 
    Now, there is much there that may not satisfy all of us but at least it shows the relevant factors. 
    You have to have a narrow statute and you have to relate it to conduct.

    Mr. Stanley Fleishman 
    I'm not prepared to draw the statute that may meet the test, Your Honor. 
    My argument here is merely that our statute is so broad that it includes what Your Honor has in mind when he says pornography, as well as works of great value that all of us would admit has to be permitted and that if the State may control some part of this area, it must do it by narrower legislation than we have before us today.

    And which is so vague that this Court constantly divides on that. 
    The fact that a concept may have different content for different people doesn't mean it's unconstitutional.

    Mr. Stanley Fleishman 
    Let me answer it this way, if I may, Your Honor. 
    I believe that there is some material that is so highly erotic that perhaps most of us in this room and most people in America would say that this is so erotic as to offend most of us and therefore, we personally don't like it. 
    I would concede there's that much. 
    But I do not concede that there is anyway where by you or I or anyone in this room can look at a book and say of that book that it's going to arouse lascivious thoughts, lustful desires and corrupt the person. 
    I say that's impossible.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1184.369" stopTime="1239.643">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Well, I think, if I may say so, you -- you're raising two different questions. 
    I understand you, intellectually I understand you, when you answered a little while ago that near arousing of thoughts of feeling, not incitation, now that's an ambiguous word, not telling me or somebody else to do something that conduct must be carried, not merely the likelihood that conducts may come. 
    You say unless the book says on the titled page, this is calculated to have you go off and commit federacy or something like that. 
    I understood you to say that it's necessary to have the additional factor of conduct. 
    Now, you say, there may be books that -- to offend everybody. 
    Now, offend is a personal feeling or a community feeling. 
    It has nothing to do with conduct.
speaker="stanley_fleishman" startTime="1239.643" stopTime="1242.790">
    Mr. Stanley Fleishman 
    That's true. 
    And I think that the First Amendment forbids that, Your Honor. 
    I don't --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1242.790" stopTime="1282.153">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Very well, I understand you. 
    Now, if you stick to that, I understand you. 
    If you say that you take the position that no statute can outlaw or make it an offense or inappropriate ways or ascribe books that have tendency that maybe deem to offend the community. 
    I understand you that there must be the additional factor of making somebody go out and do something, which the community may implicate. 
    But you can say it may be so offensive but then, it can because once you open the door as to who's to judge, what does and what doesn't offend.
speaker="stanley_fleishman" startTime="1282.153" stopTime="1295.256">
    Mr. Stanley Fleishman 
    If Your Honor please. 
    Perhaps, I can clarify it this way that insofar as the material may offend, only offend unrelated to conduct, the First Amendment absolutely prohibits. 
    The second point that we raised is --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1295.256" stopTime="1305.224">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    And unrelated to conduct, you mean that the author must indicate in pretty or ambiguous way that he wants to read or to do something, is that what you mean?
speaker="stanley_fleishman" startTime="1305.224" stopTime="1305.707">
    Mr. Stanley Fleishman 
    Yes.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1305.707" stopTime="1307.049">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    All right. 
    I understand you.
speaker="stanley_fleishman" startTime="1307.049" stopTime="1409.146">
    Mr. Stanley Fleishman 
    The other point is that due process wise under our statute which says that you have to incite -- the book has to incite thoughts and arouse desires that nobody can tell in advance neither the defendant in advance nor the jury when it has to determine the question or the judge so that under our definition of what's obscene, it's impossible. 
    There's no -- there's no point where we can say this is -- this we agree is bad under that statute. 
    There is nothing. 
    There is no line or whatsoever. 
    Now, all of the tests, Your Honor, that have been looked to, to justify, these obscenity statutes, upon examination show that in truth they are no justification. 
    The one that perhaps has been resorted to most and with less -- with the least, perhaps, of justification is history. 
    When you have an argument in one of these cases, you go before a court and you say "But what's obscene?" 
    They say, "Well, obscenity has been defined so long. 
    It's been around so long that everybody knows what it is because it's been with us for so long.” 
    If Your Honors please, I think that history proves the opposite insofar as certainty is concerned because history proves that under the standard, all manner of things that are -- today admitted to be good, had been condemned as bad so that it gives us no light in terms of finding particularly in terms of identifying how a particular book is going to have the -- the -- affect that is attributed to it.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Does the Board tried -- wrote a book called "Convicting the Innocent." 
    I must have viewed that from time to time, innocent people have been convicted of murder because of misjudgments. 
    Does that mean --

    Mr. Stanley Fleishman 
    You can prove after the event that that's false.

    It's --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1445.043" stopTime="1448.887">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    But I thought you just proved it by saying history proved they were wrong.

    Mr. Stanley Fleishman 
    Not in terms of arousing lascivious thoughts or lecherous desires or whatever statute that's being used. 
    If Your Honor please, let me give an illustration. 
    As I said, the people -- the State said that all of the mistakes were of yesterday that they don't make mistakes today. 
    Now, maybe this is so. 
    Maybe they are wiser today and use their judgment in such a way that they think only bad books are reached. 
    But I oppose this to Your Honors, if the State decided to bring a complaint against a bookseller for selling Kinsey's reports might not a jury find and properly under the standard used that this book, Kinsey's report, might arouse lustful desires or lascivious thoughts and thereby -- and thereby, corrupt and deprave a person. 
    Now, if it might, there would be no way of reversing this item because the jury makes the law as it decides the case. 
    They say it's going to have this effect and then, there is no way of disproving it and that's the difference, Your Honor, between convicting the innocent and convicting the guilty because you can disprove it. 
    If a man is wrongly -- wrongly accused of murder and he can prove otherwise, then he will ultimately justify himself.

   Argument of Fred N. Whichello
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1571.622" stopTime="1576.636">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Whichello.
speaker="fred_n_whichello" startTime="1576.636" stopTime="1829.644">
    Mr. Fred N. Whichello 
    Mr. Chief Justice and Associate Justices. 
    I'm sure that as I begin my first address to this addressed tribunal that I share the feelings of all the counsel who have preceded me through the years that this is perhaps the highest achievement that a counsel can reach in practice. 
    I wish I thought more adequate to it. 
    In answering counsel for the appellant, if Your Honor please, I would like first to attempt to clarify the issues as I see them express as best I can in legal language from the jurisdictional statements and the briefs and as best I can together what that counsel has just said. 
    As I see it, the contention of the appellant is basically that the statute is unconstitutional on its face in any event because it violates the First Amendment, invades and encroaches upon the right of freedom of speech and freedom of the press because it is so vague and indefinite as to constitute a deprivation of property and liberty and a violation of due process of law for the reasons that one cannot tell when he is violating or encroaching on this statute by his conduct and because prosecutors and judges may become censors by arbitrary action. 
    And lastly, that in this particular application, the exclusive postal power of the Federal Government has been encroached upon. 
    That last point in my opinion was due respect to appellants' counsel, and so totally without merit that I'm not going to spend anytime on it at all. 
    I would like to call Your Honors attention to the fact that the statute involved here has in its introductory sentence something quite important on several of the issues involved here. 
    It commences with the words every person who willfully and lewdly either rights, keeps for sale, advertises and so on. 
    Now, those words "willfully" and "lewdly" are not always present in such statutes. 
    And they, of course, post a degree of safeguard for the defendant under due process as well as it's exemplified in the same Wepplo case that we have mentioned in which counsel and I differ as to whether the construction of the statute on the definition is pure dictum as I contended it is because the case was reversed on this very word "lewdly" and that that defendant in Wepplo was asked by his counsel if he did whatever he was trying to do lewdly and an objection was sustained to that. 
    And the case was reversed because of the fact that the statute said "lewdly" and the defendant should be allowed to testify that he didn't presumably as he was going to that he didn't do it lewdly. 
    Now, the Court, before coming to that point, does use the phrase that counsel mentioned and to that extent as -- as dictum, as an expression of opinion by the Court, becomes of some interest, although, I don't think it binds anybody because it is pure dictum. 
    And also, I think we should bear in mind while I'm speaking of that that it went as far as it needed to for the facts in that particular case. 
    Now, in that same connection, I want to call the Court's attention to the fact that it's been mentioned that that is that the defendant or the appellant here, who could have had a jury under California law if he had chosen, chose to waive it in the manner was tried by a court. 
    Therefore, there was not at any stage of this proceeding and instruction defining the word obscene. 
    And it is our contention that it -- that under the presumption of constitutionality and the presumption of regularity in the lower courts that the trial judge is presumed here and in all the intermediate courts after the conviction to have correctly and accurately and constitutionally define the word obscene if it's possible so to do. 
    I mentioned that because nowhere here do we have an instruction which pins us down to a particular definition that no court in California, as a matter of fact, has given a definition other than as dictum in the Wepplo case as I have described. 
    Now, I don't want to be misunderstood. 
    I feel that our exhibits in this case, very definitely, do meet that test, although, I think we also go further and into a definition, which is perfectly proper under all these circumstances of the word obscene even though it was necessary in the Wepplo case. 
    Now, I would like to make this point --

    Would you mind stating --

speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1903.824" stopTime="1914.064">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    I found it on the very first page. 
    I've just opened it. 
    The Wepplo say -- said it doesn't give the definition. 
    I don't know what you mean by saying it doesn't -- what do you conceive the definition of this?
speaker="fred_n_whichello" startTime="1914.064" stopTime="1917.687">
    Mr. Fred N. Whichello 
    Your Honor, there's a definition there but it was -- by way of dictum.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1917.687" stopTime="1918.602">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Why was it dictum?
speaker="fred_n_whichello" startTime="1918.602" stopTime="1935.172">
    Mr. Fred N. Whichello 
    Because they reversed the case for lack of admission of evidence that the defendant was not acting lewdly and there was not an attack on the question of -- of the definition of the word "obscenity" in any sense. 
    The Court merely makes the statement in passing and -- and I don't quarrel with it, Your Honor. 
    My only objection is it didn't go quite far enough.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1935.172" stopTime="1954.852">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Well, it does -- it said something in the second paragraph, which is from my point of view, very important since Section 311 Penal Code condemned the sale of a book rather than a part of a book. 
    Do you agree with the contention that a book must be considered as a whole in determining whether this law is violated?
speaker="fred_n_whichello" startTime="1954.852" stopTime="1955.275">
    Mr. Fred N. Whichello 
    Yes, I think that's --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1955.275" stopTime="1965.228">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    In that sentence, it already reached it one of the most important aspects of this problem and the source of all mischief due to (Inaudible) definition --
speaker="fred_n_whichello" startTime="1965.228" stopTime="1965.622">
    Mr. Fred N. Whichello 
    Yes, Your Honor. 
    I think we --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1965.622" stopTime="1970.465">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    -- because they have no definition. 
    That's one of the most important aspects of this whole problem.
speaker="fred_n_whichello" startTime="1970.465" stopTime="1975.852">
    Mr. Fred N. Whichello 
    Yes, I think we're all agreed that these works must be construed on a whole, Your Honor, and not on an isolated passage, yes.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1975.852" stopTime="1979.678">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Maybe agreed on the fact but its significance becomes relevant, doesn't it?
speaker="fred_n_whichello" startTime="1979.678" stopTime="2102.629">
    Mr. Fred N. Whichello 
    Yes, it does, Your Honor. 
    I would like to make the point, if Your Honors please, that the contention that these works are not obscene and have any social or scientific value or whatever was not made at any stage of this case until the appellant's closing brief in this Court. 
    Other counsel during the trial and the entire record is before this Court, including every word of argument was made at no time contended these works weren't -- were of scientific or of any other type of value. 
    He merely argued they were vulgar rather than obscene. 
    In appellant's opening brief, there was no such contention. 
    And in our brief, we make the statement that to give appellant his duty, he never contended these things had any social value. 
    Now, of course, in his closing brief and in his oral argument, he contends otherwise. 
    Now, in that particular regard without standing here and quoting from some of these exhibits as I would hate to do, I want to call Your Honors attention first to the fact that in this record there is something that is very unusual, which appellant asked to be made part of the record and I'm glad that he did. 
    And that is an analysis that was prepared by our office of the exhibits originally for our own use. 
    When the Appellate Department of the Superior Court, Los Angeles County, some in our oral argument using this, they asked for copies and it was stipulated they might have them and it's become part of this record. 
    That suggests which particular exhibits and which pages we consider the most obscene and I feel what was on that basis, you'll find the decision was made by the Appellate Department of the Superior Court and they do not doubt that some of the books were obscene. 
    Again, bearing in mind carefully, that this was a court trial and if the Court found anyone of these exhibits to be obscene, the defendant is properly convicted so far as that point is concerned. 
    And the fact that some other exhibit might turn out to be innocuous does not mean that the Court in California, trial or appellate, held that the innocuous book was obscene. 
    I'll be frank to state to the Court, if I've been trying this case, I wouldn't have put so many exhibits in. 
    I would have made a more careful selection, but as long as -- the legal situation is as it is, I feel that if anyone of these exhibits is obscene, the Court properly found at least so far as this Court is concerned that the defendant did violate the statute.

    Mr. Fred N. Whichello 
    Yes, Your Honor. 
    But in a criminal case, of course, the Court draws no findings. 
    He simply speaks at the end and he says he finds the defendant guilty. 
    Now, even if earlier in the trial, he made remarks to the contrary about one of these exhibits as counsel makes the point, his verdict where he finds the defendant guilty is the thing that speaks the loudest. 
    And the presumption of regularity we feel, it's at least our contention, is such that if any of these exhibits considered as a unit on the whole are obscene. 
    We've indicated the ones we think so. 
    Then, so far as that point is concerned, the conviction is proper so far as this Court is concerned.

    And -- and may I answer that by taking just a moment to say this. 
    I think all this business about the term being vague even as Judge Frank says, exquisitely vague is a complete somatic misunderstanding. 
    I think it confuses the proposition that some things are hard to tell on borderline cases with basic vagueness or -- or indefiniteness. 
    Now, there's a very fine illustration of that in the Solicitor General's brief in this case. 
    He said "If you take a motion picture" such as Justice Douglas mentioned a moment ago which starts off innocuously, as all such pictures do that I've seen and ends up with something that is so obscene that even Mr. Fleishman would agree that it was obscene. 
    There is a point in the frames on that motion picture where it passes the line and becomes obscene.

    Now, may I say just one very brief word about this? 
    Appellant's brief and many of the opinions in this case is construing similar statutes to this. 
    It seemed concern entirely with people who like these items and who sent for them and who are erotically aroused by them. 
    I want to submit to this Court that I have set forth in my brief six classes of people that I don't think are ever any moral danger of being aroused by these things but whose disgust and reaction of this pleasure is something entitled of protection of the State under the police power that this in considering the -- the social value of these materials compared briefs to free speech, this short -- Court should consider these classes of people who do not like these things, who are disgusted by them and in the case of little children who are terrified by them. 
    As we mentioned in our brief, it's a common experience with every prosecutor whoever prosecuted criminal cases. 
    That one little girl there are shown of obscene pictures by sex criminals are the preliminary step to their crime and it happens literally every week in the courts, the invariable reactions of that child is far from being erotic or being any danger to make her immoral. 
    She is simply terrified. 
    And we'll submit that under those circumstances, those class of people should be considered by this Court. 
    Now, the rest of the time is reserved for Mr. Clarence Linn, a distinguished Assistant Attorney General of the State of California. 
    Thank you, Your Honor. 
   
   
   
   Argument of Clarence A. Linn

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Linn.
speaker="clarence_a_linn" startTime="2790.518" stopTime="3152.188">
    Mr. Clarence A. Linn 
    Thank you. 
    Counsel is worried about people who had good motives suffering under the statute at California. 
    A reading of the statute that counsel has referred to it, every person who willfully and lewdly, either rights opposes, stereotype and so forth. 
    Under that statute, no person exhibiting the statue of Hallebardier or Venus de Milo or any pictures of the classical nature exhibiting nude figures put under any circumstances to be affected by this statute. 
    Counsel didn't mention -- hasn't mentioned yet but probably will. 
    The Chaucer's Canterbury Tales could be prescribed by the statute. 
    I don't know how anyone who take in addition ancient or modern of Chaucer's Canterbury Tales and exhibit them lewdly. 
    It's just -- those are the things that -- that don't happen. 
    And they don't happen under the California statute. 
    The Wepplo case has been referred too. 
    The case went off on the point that the Court had refused to instruct the jury properly on the question of whether these matters were exhibited lewdly. 
    Then, in dicta, the Court gave a good definition of what the Court thought would -- would answer the statute. 
    You must consider the whole book and its purpose. 
    Otherwise, you have nothing to worry about in the case. 
    I think -- probably, the question of definiteness and indefiniteness will come up later. 
    Before I come to that, the counsel -- there were questions asked about the evidence in this case. 
    There was no objection raised in the lower court or here that the evidence is insufficient. 
    No question of that kind at all, the question briefed and submitted, not with the chandler that was exhibited in the New York case and Wepplo whether this statute such a standard by which a defendant do not know how to protect himself. 
    That's all there is in the case here. 
    And also whether the First Amendment prohibit all interference with speech. 
    Now, that question has been answered in the Chaplinsky case and the quotation in a complete answer to -- of that proposition allowing the broadest scope for the language and purposes of the Fourteenth Amendment. 
    It is well understood that the writers' free speech is not absolute at all times on and under all circumstances. 
    There are certain well-defined and narrowly limited classes of speech, the prevention and punishment of which have never been thought to raise any constitutional problem. 
    These include the lewd and obscene, the profane and libels and the insulting or fighting words. 
    Those which by their very utterance inflict injury or tend to insight an immediate breach of the peace is that well observed that such utterances, and here is the essential part of that quotation. 
    Those utterances are no essential part of any exposition of ideas or of such slights social value as a step to truth but any benefit that may be derived from them is clearly out waived by the social interest in order and morality. 
    A complete answer by the late Mr. Justice Murphy to the argument as of May -- as to the First Amendment is included in the Fourteenth. 
    And then, we come to the question of definiteness and that matter was to dispose of by Honorable Judge Frankfurter in this language. 
    In these matters, legislatures are confronted with a dilemma. 
    If a law is framed with narrow particularity, too easy opportunities are afforded to nullify the purposes of the legislation. 
    What risks do the innocent run, a draft of paragraph, of being caught in a net not designed for them? 
    How important is the policy of the legislation so that those who really like to pursue innocent conduct are not likely to be caught unaware? 
    How easy is it to be explicitly particular? 
    How necessary is it to read a somewhat penumbral margin but sufficiently reveal by what is condemned to those who do not want to sail close to the shore of questionable conduct? 
    These are light questions confront legislative press. 
    Answers to these questions are not to be found in any legislative manual or in the work of great legislative craftsman. 
    They are not to be found in the opinions of this Court. 
    They are questions of judgment but purely within the responsibility and the competence of legislatures. 
    The discharge of that responsibility should not be set if not by abstract notions about indefiniteness.

    Mr. Fleishman.

    Mr. Stanley Fleishman 
    If Your Honors please. 
    I'd like to come back to a statement Mr. Whichello made in passing certain in which he was discussing the Wepplo case. 
    And he said he's only disagreement was -- with it was that it didn't go far enough. 
    And Your Honors would -- will observe in the brief where actually he tended to push the effect of these statutes. 
    Now, I want to in the brief time left me -- left to me make just one single point. 
    And that is that the State of California throughout, including today in Mr. Whichello's argument, has contended that "The Picture of Conjugal Love", this picture, is one of the most obscene books in the record. 
    It's our contention, Your Honor, that this book happens to be a classic. 
    It's just that simple. 
    And any standard that properly applied and the State said that they are properly applying the standards of this book, any standard which is properly applied and which will catch with in its net. 
    This book must be a bad standard and unconstitutional --

    A Dr.Venette. 
    It was written in 1688, Your Honor. 
    It was the first Kinsey report. 
    It was the first Kinsey report that is being condemned now.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    I'm just addressing myself to your suggestion that this book, which -- in my ignorance I have not heard of, perhaps, in my undue purity, I have not heard of because it's a classic, therefore, okay.

    Mr. Stanley Fleishman 
    If Your Honor please, this -- this work illustrates to me one of the really difficult problems in this whole area. 
    We all approach it, if Your Honors please, with a prejudice. 
    I know it because when I had it on my first case, I was prejudice also. 
    But the fact of the matter is that in this area of sexual conduct, we are now undergoing great changes, the people of America. 
    And can't the people think about --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="3365.033" stopTime="3370.190">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Because I take that as a -- as a dogmatic proof or scientific proof.

    Mr. Stanley Fleishman 
    That --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="3370.350" stopTime="3380.652">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    These statements that are made about what the American people think on sex. 
    Are those all established canons that came from Moses to Sinai by Kinsey?
speaker="stanley_fleishman" startTime="3380.652" stopTime="3386.718">
    Mr. Stanley Fleishman 
    I believe that -- that it's -- at least as established as many of the things that are asserted as being the basis for obscenity --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="3386.718" stopTime="3396.291">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    That's where -- that's where the fun come between the judiciary and the legislature comes in because they are susceptible of scientific proof. 
    This Court doesn't sit here as college of purity.
speaker="stanley_fleishman" startTime="3396.291" stopTime="3408.656">
    Mr. Stanley Fleishman 
    But if Your Honor please, these three legislatures doesn't draw the standards for obscenity, the judge and the jury draw it. 
    And each case, the standard is made, the law is made for that case. 
    That's not the function of courts.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="3408.656" stopTime="3414.375">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    So, it isn't negligence. 
    So, it is the difference between manslaughter and murder. 
    So, it isn't Sherman law cases.
speaker="stanley_fleishman" startTime="3414.375" stopTime="3418.076">
    Mr. Stanley Fleishman 
    If Your Honor please, in criminal law cases, the standard has to be more specific.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    -- where Justice Holmes for this Court said, well, I suppose would put an end to this argument that simply because they're on the risk of what a jury may have to decide doesn't mean the legislature have exceeded the constitutional speed limit.

    Mr. Stanley Fleishman 
    I say the California standard and that's all that we have undertaken, Your Honor, the California statute which says that a defendant must know in advance that this book of "Conjugal Love" is going to so arouse people and incite such bad sexual thoughts in them that they are going to be corrupted and deprave. 
    I say that is unknowable by everyone in this courtroom. 
    It is unknowable fact.
