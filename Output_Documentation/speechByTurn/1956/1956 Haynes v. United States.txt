    Number 257, Gordon P. Haynes and Essie M. Haynes, Petitioners versus United States of America. 
    Mr. Hudson.
speaker="john_h_hudson" startTime="27.378" stopTime="357.620">
    Mr. John H. Hudson 
    Mr. Chief Justice, associate justices, may it please the Court. 
    It is my hope in presentation the case for the petitioners that we will give the Court a rest from some of these abstruse and profound principles. 
    This case comes to this on a report by which of the fact that a man by the name of Gordon P. Haynes during the year 1949 was an employee of the Southern Bell Telephone Company under what is called here a plan case. 
    I'm sorry Your Honor, I'm really not able to carry on but it's a proposition where one has to so I do the best I can. 
    This plan is incorporated in the record. 
    It has a schedule of payments to its employees fixed on the length of service. 
    Mr. Haynes suffered an accident prior to the time he become ill with what is known as causalgia or balloon nerve. 
    During this 1949, he did not perform any service for the Southern Bell Telephone Company. 
    He was home sick so the record in the evidence show. 
    Did not so much as go to the office because of his disability. 
    When the time came for passing upon the question of whether or not the $2100 which he earned that year or which came to him by virtue of the fact that he was home sick, was taxable as income -- gross income or was exempt under Section 22, the fact the Telephone Company itself was not certain about it so they went ahead and turned $318.44 to the tax Commissioner. 
    Then the case of Epmeier came along and the question rolled as to whether or not this entire fund was what is called under this exemption or under the law, income law whether or not it was income or whether or not it was upon receive because of illness, sickness or was benefit upon received from this plan as such that it was not proceeds from capital on the part of Haynes, that it was not earnings on the part of Haynes and therefore the entire $2100 was exempt from taxation. 
    And the question before the court is at this time whether or not this is income, gross income and is taxable or whether or not it is fund received from sickness and disability benefits and therefore is exempt. 
    Now we think and may it please the Court, that we are dealing here with the exemption not so much of the tax statute as funds which are exempt under the 22 (b) (5) that are not taxable. 
    Our contention is that this cannot be what is known as income from labor because under the plan and Haynes had served under this plan more than the 25-year period and was entitled to what is known under the plan as full compensation or full payment. 
    Now, the Government takes this view of this entire proposition that the payments which went to Mr. Haynes while he was sick and totally disabled was simply a continuation of salary plan and that it was taxable.
speaker="william_o_douglas" startTime="357.620" stopTime="360.114">
    Justice William O. Douglas 
    What was it? 
    The amount of the salary?
speaker="john_h_hudson" startTime="360.114" stopTime="719.571">
    Mr. John H. Hudson 
    The amount of the salary, the total he earned in 1949, may it please the Court was $2100. 
    Now that, may it please Your Honor was the sum which he would have received if he had been on the job the full 52 weeks of 1949. 
    That is one point which the Government contends that this is income and it is taxable. 
    It is not sick and disability benefits which are exempt under the statute involved. 
    We think among some other contention that it must the intent and purpose of this plan, it really in substance is insurance, although it is not marked or labeled insurance and the Government points out that that is one of the weaknesses of our contention then it is not issued by a commercial insurance company. 
    No objection that the government has to our contention is that this plan and this -- what we call for petitioners, sick benefit do not require and the company does not require that its employees pay a cash premium for this protection. 
    Now we don't think that that really makes any difference. 
    The services which he rendered to the Telephone Company as an employee for more than 25 years, we think is ample payment of what we may term premium. 
    Now there are several -- there are several other marks of similarities and marks of dissimilarity in -- on both sides of this question. 
    If I could bring myself to conceive of a person who does not qualify either under receiving something from capitals such as interest or grants on an investment or not receiving something for the labor that he performed. 
    If I could bring myself to the conclusion that nevertheless that sort of income is taxable then I wouldn't be here before this honorable Court but I just cannot conceive of that. 
    We get income from two sources mainly. 
    One of them is from capital investing. 
    The other one is from our labor. 
    Haynes had neither. 
    This came to him straight because he was protected or because he came under this plan and because he was sick and could not perform any service. 
    Now on capital -- look at this pamphlet which is the heart of our record, you will find that there are graduated scales. 
    One reason or one point made by the Government and I'm trying to be as brief as I can and -- but I do want to be clear. 
    I don't know that I shall be that at all but I want to be. 
    Since Haynes had neither capital nor labor and since this benefit fund came to him by reason of the fact of the length of his employment with the Telephone Company and by reason of the provisions of the plan of the Telephone Company which has given to each employee as the employee starts to work for the Telephone Company. 
    And the employee has to do two years work for the Telephone Company without the provisions or any benefit at all, sickness or disability or accident before he begins to receive any benefit from the plan. 
    Now we say in our contention is that this is obliged to be insurance because we don't pay people for being sick. 
    We can't afford to pay people for being sick. 
    It is their sickness and not their services that brings this benefit to the employee. 
    If we could say as it's sometimes contended that well the Telephone Company then has a plan which makes sickness and accident profitable, then we should reverse our philosophy with reference to those -- to disadvantages and arrange some way to have as many accidents and as much sickness as possible in order to profit by that, but that's inconsistent. 
    That's an inconsistency. 
    That is not the way human affairs ran and that is not the way business is ran.

    Mr. John H. Hudson 
    The original sick leave, he gets nothing the first seven days that is described in the plan. 
    Another point of distinction if I may proceed is that the Southern Bell Telephone Company is not licensed in the State of Georgia to rate sickness and disability insurance. 
    It is in the record that the Southern Bell Telephone Company in the State of Georgia under the Workmen's Compensation Act is a self-insurer. 
    Now we do not contend and we think that we are not compelled to contend the logical argument that that of itself weren't authorized the Southern Bell Telephone Company to write or issue, sickness and accident benefit insurance. 
    We do contend that this plan has been in effect, it's in the record since 1913. 
    There have been instances since the inauguration of this plan in 1913 where in many instances, the benefits received by employees of the Telephone Company have been held to be exempt. 
    I have one of those instances here a moment ago. 
    Back in 1918, may it please the Court, this question came up before the tax commissioner. 
    The Supreme Court under the date of May the 20th, 1918 and in other cases where in reference has made to case of Stratton's Independence against Howbert, 231 U.S.399 to page 415. 
    It was stated that income maybe define as gain derived from capital, from labor, or from both. 
    It is therefore held that the amounts received by an employee or his personal representative from a benefit fund which represents payment on account of death, sickness or injury of an employee is not income within the meaning of the Act.

    I got it in the brief --
speaker="john_h_hudson" startTime="1030.661" stopTime="1525.358">
    Mr. John H. Hudson 
    Now, may it please Your Honor, the Government starts back with the history of this particular matter as taxation or taxation viewpoint and a taxation question and it comes on down and the Government has certainly prepared and we appreciate a brilliant brief on this – will you pardon me if I say a little question? 
    On up to 1954, the amendment which Congress enacted specifically in exempting this type of benefit. 
    Now the Government takes this view and we appreciate that the only thing that Congress did in 1954 when they put on the amendment which specifically exempted compensation or benefits received under the plan or benefits received in the nature of sickness and accident benefits. 
    The Government takes a view of it that that is not to be interpreted as broadening the exemption, that this to be taken, that is to be viewed in a limited sense and simply applies to the exemption and is to be construed in a restricted sense. 
    Now the Government begins with the history of this taxation and comes all up to that particular point and it didn't appear brilliant and a very skillful manner we think. 
    Now we start right, if it please the Court, and we go back down to the same trail that the Government comes up. 
    It is our opinion and it is our contention in this case that what they did, what Congress did in 1954 was illustrated of the intent of Congress at the time they made that amendment, that all the time, these questions were coming up from 1913, 1918, 1924 and questions arose that the tax commissioner was referenced to some claims, was in doubt that's in the case of American Telephone and Telegraph Company, December 24, 1918 when they rule that this kind of compensation or this kind of income was not taxable. 
    And then we drew along a little bit further in the history of this taxation when the tax commissioners in various places held that it was gross income and that it was taxable. 
    Now taking the 1954 amendment which was put through by Congress as indicating or a circumstance which may indicate an Act which -- from which we might infer that all the time, all these years from 1913 to 1954, it was the intention of Congress to exempt funds received from this type of benefit. 
    In other words, this particular kind of insurance. 
    Now that is exactly we know, contract to the contention of the Government. 
    Now here, we have a -- we have live, we have a vital issue not affecting compensation received under this plan or any other employer-employee plan but affecting a large number of claims now pending in the various Circuit Courts of this country under this plan and similar plans as to their earnings up to and during 1939. 
    Now we say very frankly, candidly that if this honorable Court takes our view of it, makes a ruling in favor of the taxpayer, it follows on necessity that the Government will lose some revenue. 
    But we also take this viewpoint, it's our contention that this nontaxable income is correct, then the withholding of these funds -- pardon me please -- from these taxpayers in the various Circuit Courts did not give the Government a title to these funds or this particular fund as they're sticking straight to this case. 
    And in as much as it did not, in as much as the Government as we contend collected it illegally, it never had the title to it. 
    It was not entitled under the law if our contention is correct, to receive these funds or hold these funds. 
    Therefore, in the estimate, advised by the Government and we got no right to dispute it. 
    It isn't -- we've got no way of disputing it successfully even if it is a mere estimate that approximately $6 million are involved. 
    We say that our position is direct if we are right, then all of the funds that are being held now by the tax commission since 1949 and even prior of that time up to the statute of limitation. 
    It is holding -- it is withholding those funds from the taxpayers illegally, therefore an order requiring the commissioner to make these various refunds in whatever amount is perfectly all right because the Government is not really losing anything that it was entitled to. 
    Now there is another side of course to this argument. 
    While some $6 million in funds probably more, probably less are involved in actual dollars and cents. 
    There is a large number of employees of the various companies through the years have founded beneficial to inaugurate or establish a plan although no cash premiums are required in order to receive the benefits under the plan. 
    Thank you. 
    I meant to divide my --

speaker="john_h_hudson" startTime="1527.980" stopTime="1628.664">
    Mr. John H. Hudson 
    Thank you. 
    I intended to divide my argument but it is very difficult to put logical, concise argument within the 30 minutes period. 
    I'm just a country boy and I'm rather slow. 
    What about the large number of employees who may I say have a vested interest in these benefits? 
    They have done the work. 
    They have earned it. 
    They have satisfied the employees. 
    They are entitled to the benefits under this plan. 
    Now to cut them off and say that this is taxable income when they started out under the idea that it is nontaxable income, we say that is a very widespread injury that is going to and necessary result to a lot of people that involves probably is going to fall on employees who are least able to withstand that motion.

   Argument of Hilbert P. Zarky

speaker="hilbert_p_zarky" startTime="1630.763" stopTime="1780.080">
    Mr. Hilbert P. Zarky 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    I think it's quite clear from Mr. Hudson's remark what this Court has a narrow little question of statutory construction. 
    These are the statute in question which was governing during the years here in controversy. 
    Here are some of the appendix to our brief beginning at the bottom of page 40 up to page 41 that being code Section 22 (b) (5). 
    It creates an exemption from tax -- I'll skip the opening part of the sentence which has no relation to our problem here. 
    It exempts amounts received through accident or health insurance or under Workmen's Compensation Act, compensation for personal injuries or sickness. 
    Those are the amounts which are exempt from tax. 
    At the beginning of the page appears old Section 22 (a) with which this Court has had much familiarity where Congress has defined in the broadest terms possible, its concepts of what is taxable income. 
    And of course included in Section 22 (a) is compensation for personal services. 
    So the definitional section includes compensation for personal services and the exclusion section exempts amounts received for sickness under health insurance. 
    And so the question here really is this, where an employer either voluntarily or pursuant to a plan as it's true in this case, undertakes to tell its employees that we will continue to pay you in whole or in part some part of your salary during some periods that you maybe ill. 
    Is that compensation for personal services as the Government contends? 
    Or is that amounts received for illness under health insurance which Congress has exempted under Section 22 --

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    What's the first alternative you're proposing?

    Unknown Speaker 
    Mr. Zarky, do you remember I asked Mr. Hudson what the difference was between what I call during the first seven days that a man might be out in his payment, and here applies that there would be no payment during the first seven days. 
    No brief has a statement because I like to have explained. 
    It says although employees with conflict offenses continue to receive their regular salary during the first seven days of illness, a benefit not provided by the plan. 
    These payments which are maybe recognizable taxable sick leave payments are indistinguishable under the plan.
speaker="hilbert_p_zarky" startTime="1819.163" stopTime="1920.992">
    Mr. Hilbert P. Zarky 
    Your Honor, we'll turn to page 89 of the record. 
    You have defendant's exhibit number one which starts at page 88. 
    As I recall, this is part of the, one of the annual statements of Southern Bell Telephone Company. 
    And toward the bottom of page 89, there is paragraph dealing with sickness and accidents and it says at the second line, a total of $1,700,000 is paid as sickness disability benefits under the plan and $1,090,000 for sickness pay during the first seven days of absence was charged a departmental expense. 
    You'll immediately see that the amounts paid during his first seven days are not substantially less than the amount paid under the plan. 
    The only difference as I understand it is, that under the plan which the company of course had the right to change it anytime. 
    But under the plan, precisely what you would receive was set forth while during the first seven days, it was discretionary for the company to pay or not to pay. 
    But I would guess from these figures that the company exercises discretion mostly to pay and that's the only difference that I can see between what was paid during the first seven days and what would be paid after, inclusion of the first week of illness and yet the contention here of that is that what's paid under the first seven days is not exempt and what's paid after the first seven days is exempt. 
    In our view, both payments as I shall develop I hope is compensation for services rendered or to be rendered by the employee and it's nothing more or less than that.

    Mr. Hilbert P. Zarky 
    Well, let me develop my point if I may Justice Frankfurter. 
    I think that our economy as long as the time when we think of compensation as being paid pro rata, per hour of services rendered. 
    The whole American economy has developed a system whereby private industry is really implementing what the Government had try to do to Social Security programs, of leveling out salaries, of keeping labor turnover down to a minimum and the Southern Bell Telephone plan here is one of the ways on which it has done. 
    For example, set this is not the only benefit pay. 
    Payments are made on debt. 
    Payments are made on debt depending on length service. 
    Payments are made for accidental injury, not attributable to employment or covered by Workmen's Compensation, the Christmas bonus, it's not on this plan, is a well known measure of compensation in American industry. 
    In recent years, stock option plans, pension funds, profit sharing, a whole (Inaudible) of methods of compensation which cannot be related to precise hours of work has taken its place in the picture of compensation in the American economy. 
    A pension which is played on retirement is not a gratuity, it's not a benevolence, the employee is paying -- employer is paying that because he hopes that by offering this inducement, his employee will stay in employment for a long period of time.

    And why I say that the employer here is paying, he's paying for services rendered in the past or induced to be rendered in the future.

    Mr. Hilbert P. Zarky 
    If Congress so intended, of course and it has done so in the 1954 code where it made its intention clear that payments made by employers during absence from work are exempt, but Congress put in a very limited exception in 1954, only $100 a week no matter what the salary of the employee is and nothing during the first week of illness, so that well under the taxpayer's argument --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2407.123" stopTime="2408.311">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    What period of illness?
speaker="hilbert_p_zarky" startTime="2408.311" stopTime="2410.351">

    The first week of his period of illness.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2410.351" stopTime="2422.534">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Well I know, but that -- that shows that they want to take care of the great body of workmen -- of employees, $100 a week means $5000 a year which takes care of a lot of these.
speaker="hilbert_p_zarky" startTime="2422.534" stopTime="2483.055">
    Mr. Hilbert P. Zarky 
    Yes. 
    The only difference is that on the taxpayer's destruction of 1939 Code, the president of the company, doing a salary of $75,000 and ill for a year would have $75,000 exempt. 
    Well Congress when it spoke on the matter after study included that only a $100 a week should be exempt. 
    So that when we get to what Congress intended, it speaks -- it seems to be with clarity in 1954 and we think it's a piece of clarity before 1954 in the opposite direction. 
    The origin of the statute itself indicates to us that Congress was thinking in terms of ordinary commercial policies of insurance. 
    There is nothing in the statute in its origin which would indicate that Congress was speaking in terms of an employer's plan to continue paying compensation, wages or it might during the period when an employee was absent from work.

speaker="hilbert_p_zarky" startTime="2648.073" stopTime="2692.519">
    Mr. Hilbert P. Zarky 
    Well it dealt with the whole question of insurance comprehensibly and so far as the statute relates to the kind of problem presented by this case where the employer makes payments, not to any insurance company. 
    Then what the employee receive is up to $100 a week but only after $100 a week is exempt while the contention being made by the taxpayer here is under the 1939 Code, everything was exempt no matter what the amount and our dealing of the legislative history of 1954 Code probably show that Congress was not cutting down an exemption that it thought existed on the 1939 Code. 
    Congress thought it was creating something which wasn't in existence under the 1939 Code.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="2692.519" stopTime="2697.190">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Is this all you rely on for that proposition?
speaker="hilbert_p_zarky" startTime="2697.190" stopTime="2856.077">
    Mr. Hilbert P. Zarky 
    Yes. 
    The general tenor, what's said and what's not said and we have a succinct illusion here of a several pages of comment by the committee, but what we have here we think is still the thought that you get from the entire report that Congress was changing a law and changing it in this limited respect. 
    The fact that Congress had a definite notion of what is insurance and what is not insurance, we think is also evident by another amendments that took place in related areas between 1918 and 1954. 
    For example, from the very beginning, amounts received as life insurance had been exempt for income tax. 
    Now then the question would arise paralleling this case where under a plan of the employer and its part of the plan to which this employer had certain lump sum payments are made to a widow or other beneficiaries when an employee dies, is that insurance? 
    Now it seems to me that if the taxpayer's argument here that payments during illness is insurance, by wide token and payments on death or to be regarded as life insurance. 
    And yet, it was not until 1951 that Congress put in a special exemption where amounts paid by an employer to an employees beneficiaries on death and then put in a limited exemption, limited amount so that from this I would draw some conclusions. 
    The first that when Congress spoke about insurance, it had a very definite concept in mind and it didn't think that in payments made by an employer to an employee or to an employee's beneficiary were insurance. 
    Secondly, that when Congress with the social objective in mind has created this kind of an exemption is done limited in amount. 
    In other words, I think lurking in there is the feeling that companies cannot create large reserves for their favorite officers and get a tax exemption that was never intended to encompass that. 
    In other words, if the president of the company is sick, Congress didn't intend that his entire salary during illness should be exempt and the president of the company will receive several hundred thousand dollars on his death from the company. 
    Congress didn't intend that that should be exempted as life insurance.

    Mr. Hilbert P. Zarky 
    The Treasury -- may I take just a moment because I can't answer two succinctly. 
    The Treasury had originally ruled before the 1918 statute that amounts received under acts of insurance was taxable income. 
    Then the question reached Attorney General Gregory and taking some decisions of this Court like Lynch against Hornby I believe, Southern Pacific against Lowe, classic decisions of where the Court use broad pronouncement of what is income. 
    He distilled from that the idea not only that acts and insurance couldn't be income but because the human body was regarded by Attorney General Gregory as capital which was not being replaced, he thought this couldn't constitutionally be taxed as income. 
    It was a notion which under prevalent concepts of income which scarcely withstand analysis, but anyway, it was within that background that the 1918 enactment was made and Congress specifically said in the committee report that it was doubtful under the present law whether amounts received to acts and/or health insurance or under Workmen's Compensation, et cetera are required to be included in gross income.
