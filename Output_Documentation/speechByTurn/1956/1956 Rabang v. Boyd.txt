    Mr. John Caughlan 
    Within that time, I would like -- or that my answer is clear on the question of the significance of this proviso which reads, "Provided further that the provisions of this section shall also apply to the cases of aliens who come to the main land from the insular possessions." 
    The question was, we're the Filipinos aliens? 
    That was the question. 
    Do I understand correctly? 
    And may answer --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="31.835" stopTime="35.106">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Yes. 
    Are they included in that -- are they included in that word alien?
speaker="john_caughlan" startTime="35.106" stopTime="35.629">
    Mr. John Caughlan 
    That is right.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="35.629" stopTime="35.738">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Yes.
speaker="john_caughlan" startTime="35.738" stopTime="110.770">
    Mr. John Caughlan 
    That is the question. 
    My answer to that was posed upon the entirety, the composite of all the statutes as they applied in 1951 when this conviction took place as I must treat the statute. 
    But if I were to look back to 1931, not to determine what the statute says but what light we can get on what they might have been thinking at that time, what they considered aliens then. 
    Of course, the Filipinos at that time were not aliens but that leads me to the concluding matter which I cannot stress sufficiently. 
    That between that time and the time that the offense was committed, many statutes have changed. 
    That's why we were passed up the present state of the statutes, and most particularly, the statutes on page 7 of the Government's brief, the Filipino Independence Act which up to the 1946, made such clear provisions that the Immigration Act of 1917, which we've been talking about, relating to the immigration, exclusion, or expulsion -- may I finish the sentence?
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="110.770" stopTime="112.074">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Yes, of course.
speaker="john_caughlan" startTime="112.074" stopTime="168.991">
    Mr. John Caughlan 
    -- of aliens, the citizens -- the citizens of the Philippine Islands are to be considered as if they were aliens. 
    And then in 1946 -- that is further down on page 7, there was a complete sweep divorcing them entirely from nationality and giving them certain benefits to which Mr. Justice Frankfurter directed attention which I had here available. 
    So that, between that time and now, there were these statutes which completely made aliens out of the Filipinos so that as of 1951, when this conviction took place, there's no question about their being aliens, no question about the intent of the Congress as evidenced by all these statutes taken together to include them within the scope and to deport.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Now, may I ask you -- maybe you can answer at one word, yes or no. 
    Do the -- are these Filipinos included in that word aliens?

    Mr. Chief Justice, we'll recall at the outset as pointed out that there was the 1937 -- one status and there is the present status which controls as of today.

    I assume you do not want to leave the impression that whether or not a Filipino resident in the United States, who when he came here was a Filipino national, is included in the terms of the Act of February 18, 1931, any alien which is the real question before us. 
    I take it, you do not mean to leave the impression that that question is determined by our construction of the proviso about what we've been talking about, do you?
speaker="john_caughlan" startTime="257.498" stopTime="258.635">
    Mr. John Caughlan 
    Absolutely not.

    Yes.

speaker="earl_warren" startTime="264.101" stopTime="275.435">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well, I thought it might have some bearing because you -- you read -- read the proviso that just preceded it as -- as being very important to your case and I thought that possibly that --
speaker="john_caughlan" startTime="275.435" stopTime="275.577">
    Mr. John Caughlan 
    Well, I --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="275.577" stopTime="278.260">

    -- the next proviso might also have a bearing on it.
speaker="john_caughlan" startTime="278.260" stopTime="314.985">
    Mr. John Caughlan 
    I read all of these provisos as I stated at the outset to demonstrate two things to the Court. 
    One, that there were elements of manner and only those elements of manner were carried out. 
    Who should do the deporting in 19, where they should go to in 20?Things like that but that these provisos that were not pertinent, that were only pertinent dependent upon the rest of this whole complex of statues that in those cases, the pertinence as -- as to carry over was wasn't ill.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="314.985" stopTime="315.218">

    I -- I think that --
speaker="john_caughlan" startTime="315.218" stopTime="324.052">
    Mr. John Caughlan 
    They were not matters of manner, they were questions of who shall be deported, not how they shall be deported, and as such, had no place in the 1931 Act.

    That preceded the a whole string of acts which are set forth in our brief later but notably, I must hammer again, the Filipino Independence Act which specifically said, "They were to be treated as aliens and then on page 7 of our brief, really buttoned it up in 1946, when they were completely divorced from the United States.
