    Mr. Samuel Mezansky 
    May it please the Court. 
    The petitioner, the secretary-treasurer of a Local of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters was adjudged guilty of contempt of court by District Judge Noonan of the District Court for the Southern District of New York. 
    The contempt arose out of petitioner's failure to obey a direction of District Judge Noonan to answer certain select questions as to the whereabouts of the books and records of the local union in a grand jury investigation. 
    Petitioner's refusal is based upon the ground of self-incrimination and his privilege to remain silent under the provisions of the Fifth Amendment. 
    The petitioner's conduct was treated as a contempt committed in the actual presence of the Court. 
    And the petitioner was punished summarily and sentenced to six months imprisonment under Rule 42 -- 42 (a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. 
    The petitioner was given the right to purge himself of the contempt by appearing before the grand jury and answering the questions. 
    The District Court held that the petitioner did not sustain the burden of establishing that the answers to the selected questions would incriminate him. 
    The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the order of District Judge Noonan and this Court granted certiorari. 
    The questions involved upon this appeal are, first, whether it was evident from the implications of the questions and the setting in which they were asked that responsive answers to the questions or an explanation as to why they cannot be answered would be dangerous because injurious disclosure would result. 
    And the second question relates to the procedure for -- in the hearing before District Judge Noonan. 
    The petitioner made several request for an opportunity to prepare a defense and produce witnesses. 
    He made several request for a complete transcript of the grand jury testimony.

    Mr. Samuel Mezansky 
    That appears now for the first time. 
    And I'd like to go right to that. 
    Yes, I -- I think --
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="157.451" stopTime="160.912">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    It seems to me it eliminates a large part of the case.
speaker="samuel_mezansky" startTime="160.912" stopTime="250.002">
    Mr. Samuel Mezansky 
    That's correct. 
    On page 35 of the Government's brief, ninth line from the top, the statement is made that we do not deny in this Court that if petitioner had a personal claim of privilege in regard to such questions, the possibility of incrimination existed under the rule of Hoffman against United States. 
    So the Government upon this appeal takes a position different from the District Court and contrary to the opinion of the Court Of Appeals. 
    So in view of this very commendable concession, the issue presented now is a very narrow and legal one. 
    And that is whether the custodian of the records of a union may refuse on the ground of his personal privilege to answer questions as to the whereabouts of the union books which have not been produced pursuant to the subpoena. 
    As I stated, this was not the ground upon which the petitioner was adjudged guilty of contempt. 
    He was found guilty on the ground that he did not sustain the burden of establishing that the answers to the question would incriminate him. 
    Now, I think we should have a statement -- brief statement of the facts because we cannot consider this question of law abstractly without some relationship to the facts for --

    That was not argued in the District Court at all.

    And so far as the record shows, we don't know -- there's no basis or findings that the District Court would have held him responsible for accusing to answer on that ground and sentenced him on that ground, is that right?

    Well, then how could -- how could the Court of Appeals have sustained the sentence on that other ground if that wasn't an issue?
speaker="samuel_mezansky" startTime="424.438" stopTime="434.396">
    Mr. Samuel Mezansky 
    Well, it was argued from the first time in the Circuit Court of Appeals, the Government in its brief at the time presented for the first time the question that this petitioner had no privilege in reference to union books and records.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="434.396" stopTime="438.157">

    Mr. Samuel Mezansky 
    No. 
    And that's one of the points I'm making that he was -- the attempt is now made to sustain the conviction upon a ground not urged in the District Court.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Well, he -- it's more that. 
    It isn't merely a ground. 
    The Government as anybody else in a litigation can sustain a judgment on any ground to sustain but if I empower you, there was a finding of contempt and a sentence for contempt on a claim of disobedience to the Court's order, which is very different from the claim that is now made why he was disobedient.
speaker="samuel_mezansky" startTime="477.289" stopTime="478.695">
    Mr. Samuel Mezansky 
    That's correct.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="478.695" stopTime="486.594">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Well, I should -- that raises the -- not the usual questions sustaining the judgment on some other ground on that on which it was rendered.
speaker="samuel_mezansky" startTime="486.594" stopTime="916.164">
    Mr. Samuel Mezansky 
    That's right. 
    That's one of the points we urge. 
    Now, I might point out at the very beginning in view of the fact that the setting becomes important in these types of case that this petitioner was secretary-treasurer of Local 269 and he was served with two subpoenas. 
    He was served with a personal subpoena and a subpoena duces tecum. 
    And in each subpoena, he was directed to appear and testify as to alleged violations of the federal conspiracy statute. 
    Now, those subpoenas appear on pages 47 and 48 of the record and that fact will become significant. 
    Now, what was the general setting? 
    This petitioner was served with these subpoenas on April 9th for his appearance on April 10th. 
    About a week and a half before that date, a grand jury was impaneled in New York to investigate allegations of racketeering in the garment and trucking industries. 
    This investigation followed widespread public charges that seven local unions were recently chartered by the International Brotherhood of Teamsters to gain control of the Teamsters Joint Council. 
    It was charged that these seven locals were under the control of labor racketeers and gangsters and particularly one, Johnny DioGuardia. 
    One Martin T. Lacey was then president of the Teamsters Joint Council had commenced a civil action to declare a certain election null and void. 
    And in that civil action, Mr. Lacey had made this allegation of fraud.Judge Noonan, who found this petitioner guilty of contempt, had issued a temporary injunction in that action. 
    The newspapers carry stories about the fact that Mr. Lacey conferred with one of the Assistant United States Attorneys who had questioned the petitioner before the grand jury. 
    And these charges were dramatized in the local press, so that the setting was such that the petitioner would reasonably have feared that the -- and only was he -- to be fairly investigated but that he was to be prosecuted. 
    Now, as we all know in a war, an army starts an attack with an artillery barrage and when such a thing happens, the opposing army knows that it was about to be attacked. 
    Well, with this barrage of publicity, a lot of it consisting of press releases from the United States Attorney's office, this petitioner could reasonably have sensed the peril of prosecution for a wide variety of offenses. 
    So when petitioner first appeared before the grand jury on April 10 and his lawyers were then in Albany, he refused to answer most of the questions saying, as appears on page 65 of the record, “You are throwing legal stuff at me and I don't know whether you are trapping me or not.” 
    He was told to come back on April 12. 
    He came back and his attorneys remained in the anteroom. 
    He denied that he had possession of the books and records at the time he was served with these subpoenas or that he had possession for at least three days prior to the date he was served with these subpoenas. 
    And then at page 83 of the record, incidentally, the complete transcript of the grand jury testimony appeared in the record before the Circuit Court of Appeals but was not before the District Court, it was made part of the record by consent. 
    We didn't have a complete transcript of the grand jury testimony until after the petitioner was adjudged guilty of contempt. 
    And we -- we wanted part of the record, so to show the connection between the -- the questions as to the whereabouts of the books and other questions. 
    We're beginning at page 83. 
    We have a series of questions such as these, “Did you try and get in touch with Johnny DioGuardia, who was that well-known a racketeer after he was served with subpoenas? 
    Did you talk to him? 
    Did he order you not to produce the books and records? 
    Do you know John O'Rourke? 
    When did he last see the records?” 
    Then, the Government began a series of questions as to where the records were on certain dates. 
    And the petitioner sensing he was being tracked, said as follows at page 85, “They are leading up to something and I do not know what to do.” 
    And the Assistant United States Attorney again reframed the questions and asked the petitioner where the -- where the books were on various days for about two weeks prior to the time he was served with a subpoena. 
    And the witness refused to answer those questions on the ground of his right to remain silent. 
    And he was asked other questions about this local union who this stationary was that permit the stationary. 
    And finally, he was told to come back on April 17. 
    In the meantime, the total numbers of questions asked to the petitioner were about 225, most of which he refused to answer. 
    On April 17th, the grand jury recessed and reconvened before District Judge Noonan. 
    And at that time, the Assistant United States Attorney submitted as an exhibit only 15 of the 225 questions as the basis for this contempt. 
    And Judge Noonan asked the petitioner how answering the questions would incriminate him. 
    The attorney for the petitioner gave a very general explanation and referred to the charges made by Mr. Lacey in the civil litigation that was then going on upstairs. 
    The court's rule that the privilege was improperly exercised and direct to the witness to answer the questions. 
    The petitioner was taken again before the grand jury and he again refused to answer the questions. 
    He was brought back before Judge Noonan two days later and as the Assistant United States Attorney stated, for the purpose of having the contempt committed in the presence of the Court so that he could be punished summarily. 
    The petitioner was put on the stand and the Court picked out these 15 selected questions and the Court did not know of the nature of the other questions. 
    But these were the questions carved out of the 225 questions by the Assistant United States Attorney. 
    And the -- the witness again declined to answer those 15 selected questions as to the whereabouts of the books and records. 
    And the Court stated that under the decision in United States against Trock, decided by the Second Circuit, the burden was upon the petitioner to satisfy the Court that the answers to the questions would incriminate him. 
    Incidentally, this Trock decision was summarily reversed by this Court in the application for a petition for certiorari after this appeal was argued. 
    And we made a motion for rehearing on the basis of this Court's decision. 
    That application was denied.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="916.164" stopTime="920.149">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Had we taken that action before the Court of Appeals originally wrote the opinion which is --
speaker="samuel_mezansky" startTime="920.149" stopTime="1057.004">
    Mr. Samuel Mezansky 
    No, it was after. 
    Now, the question arose in the proceeding before Judge Noonan, whether this proceeding was a secret proceeding in view of the fact that the grand jury was present. 
    And the Court remarked, “No, it's not a secret proceeding.” 
    And the Court noted that the press was present. 
    And then on page 34 of the record, there appears a statement by Judge Noonan, which was hardly conducive to a frank disclosure of the reasons for not answering the question, at the bottom of page 34, the Court. 
    He is probably afraid that if he wakes up some morning with his head in the cement block at the bottom of the East River if he talks too much or at least he has to make some attempt to justify it if he should talk later and say anything. 
    He has got to make some showing in advance thereof that what he said was minimal and then only because the Court hit him over the head. 
    The Court -- later on, the Court said it was joking but I don't know whether the petitioner appreciated that humor in any event. 
    The attorney for the petitioner asked for permission to furnish the explanation in private, not in the presence of the Assistant United States Attorney or the grand jury. 
    That was denied. 
    The attorney for the petitioner asked for an opportunity of furnishing an explanation with the Assistant United States Attorney being present but not in the presence of the grand jury. 
    There are several requests for a complete transcript of the grand jury testimony because the attorney did not know what the nature of the other questions were. 
    These requests were denied. 
    And finally, the Court summarily found the petitioner guilty of contempt and sentenced the petitioner to six months. 
    It was after he was found guilty that the petitioner received a complete transcript of the grand jury testimony and which was incorporated in the record. 
    And several times during that hearing before District Judge Noonan, there were several requests for an opportunity to -- to prepare a defense and produce witnesses and those requests were denied because Judge Noonan move that under -- under Rule 42 (a), a summary proceeding, a hearing was not necessary.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1057.004" stopTime="1063.333">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    What -- on what ground were the grand jury minutes finally acquainted? 
    Who furnished it? 
    Was it by order of the Court?
speaker="samuel_mezansky" startTime="1063.333" stopTime="1195.615">
    Mr. Samuel Mezansky 
    By order of the Court. 
    The United States Attorney -- we -- we asked that the -- we incorporate in the record before the Circuit Court of Appeals these clippings that appear in the record. 
    They were not before the district judge. 
    And that is used -- the United States Attorney consented provided we consent that we have the grand jury minutes as part of the record and he obtained an order of the Court permitting those records to be made part of the record. 
    Now, to complete the picture, I should mention certain facts which occurred after this Court granted certiorari because briefs have been filed by the Government and by petitioner's attorney with respect to the possible mootness of this case. 
    Certiorari was granted on October 8, 1956 and about a month later, the Government subpoenaed the accountant and the bookkeeper for the union before the grand jury and they testified that there were certain books and records then in existence in the office of the union. 
    The U.S. Attorney then subpoenaed the petitioner and directed him to produce those books and records which were identified by the accountant and the bookkeeper. 
    These records were produced and the question arose what effect they would have upon the prior contempt proceeding and the Assistant United States Attorney made a claim that it would have no effect as far as the Government was concerned because the other contempt was one that was committed previously. 
    And the Government now states in the brief filed on the question of possible mootness and incidentally, the Solicitor General does not claim that this appeal was moot. 
    But says that now with the books in their possession, the question as to the petitioner's privilege stands in a different posture and that possibly, the petitioner could go to the lower court and ask for a modification of the sentence. 
    Now, I --
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="1195.615" stopTime="1199.732">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    But the contempt sentence was not for failure to produce the books, was it?

    Mr. Samuel Mezansky 
    No, failure to answer the questions.

    Failure to answers the questions.
speaker="samuel_mezansky" startTime="1203.157" stopTime="1204.357">
    Mr. Samuel Mezansky 
    Yes, but they say that now --
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="1204.357" stopTime="1204.642">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    (Voice Overlap) --
speaker="samuel_mezansky" startTime="1204.642" stopTime="1683.711">
    Mr. Samuel Mezansky 
    -- that they have the books and incidentally, those books contained entries starting with August 1956 and this contempt was committed in April 1956. 
    But they say that now that they have the books, the question of the petitioner's privilege stands in a different posture and they feel that if we went before District Judge Noonan, we might obtain a modification of the sentence. 
    However, in our brief filed, in respect to the question of mootness, we say that the petitioner's posture has not changed. 
    He stands convicted of an offense within the sentence of imprisonment of six months. 
    And he is reluctant at this stage to answer those particular questions on the ground of self-incrimination or to place himself at the mercy of the Court that found him in contempt to court. 
    And so we say that this appeal is, therefore, not moot and I believe the Government agrees. 
    But in frankness, these facts were submitted to the Court by separate briefs filed in December of last year. 
    Now, we come then to the main legal question, the Government concedes that if a -- if the petitioner had a privilege, that he made an adequate showing of possible incrimination, so that the Government is now seeking to affirm this order of punishing the petitioner for contempt on a theory, as Mr. Justice Frankfurter pointed out also, different from that on which the case was presented in the District Court. 
    Now, the Solicitor General argues that a custodian of union records may not refuse on the ground of his personal privilege against self-incrimination to answer questions as to the whereabouts of the union books and records. 
    The Government says that this issue is purely one of law that no hearing is necessary. 
    There is no need for any witnesses and that Rule 42 (a) therefore applies. 
    Now, before discussing that question -- that very narrow legal question raised by the Solicitor General, I should like to say something about this procedure under Rule 42 (a). 
    In the District Court, the petitioner was told very plainly that under the decision in Trock -- in United States against Trock, that he had the burden of establishing that the answers to the questions would incriminate. 
    He was not warned by the District Court that he had no personal privilege in respect to these questions. 
    So we say that as a matter of simple due process, whether the issue is one of fact or one of law, the petitioner was entitled to some notice that that was the basis of the charge against him. 
    Rule 42 (a) deals with contempt committed in the actual presence of the Court and upon facts which are within the judges' personal knowledge. 
    This Court has held that under Rule 42 (a), knowledge acquired from the testimony of others even the confession of the accused would not justify conviction for contempt without a trial and without giving contemnor an opportunity to defend. 
    Leading cases, the Terry case, in that case, the marshal was assaulted by a person right in the presence of the Court and there Rule 42 (a) applied and the Court saw the misbehavior. 
    But in this case, while it is true that the contempt consists of the petitioner's refusal to answer questions as directed by the Court, the validity of the court's order, directing the petitioner to answer the question, depends upon facts which were not within the knowledge -- personal knowledge of the judge. 
    And we, therefore, say in the First Circuit, in Carlson against United States so held that under these circumstances, a witness is entitled to notice of the charge against him and an opportunity -- he should be given an opportunity to defend the charge and produce witnesses if he so saw fit. 
    He was also entitled to a complete transcript of the grand jury testimony. 
    That was the holding in another case in the Second Circuit by a different panel of the same court, in Zwillman case. 
    In that case, the Court -- Judge Augustus Hand wrote that the Government was not obliged to disclose the testimony before the grand jury. 
    But if it chose to adopt such attitude and to confine the defendant's defense only to showing that the questions asked were incriminating on their face, you could not put him in contempt so long as it prevented him from adducing evidence that would demonstrate that his answers were likely to form links in proof of a conspiracy. 
    We turn now then to the basic legal issue as to whether or not this petitioner had a personal privilege. 
    The Government says that as secretary-treasurer of a union, he had no privilege what was bound to answer questions as to the whereabouts of the union books and records. 
    As I pointed out, this witness was served with two subpoenas. 
    A personal subpoena and a subpoena duces tecum. 
    And in each subpoena, he was directed to appear and testify and that we believe is a very significant factor. 
    We do not believe that this witness can be cutup into different personalities so conveniently and we do not believe that the petitioner's constitutional rights can depend upon the expert use of the scissors or the carving knife by carving out 15 questions and disregarding the other questions. 
    Out of an entire interrogation of 225 questions, can we carved out just 15 and say that as to these, although, the answers would incriminate the petitioner that petitioner in his capacity as custodian had no privilege? 
    We do not believe and we submit that if the constitutional question cannot be decided in a vacuum or in an isolation booth completely unmindful or insensible to all the facts and the fact that this petitioner was a perspective defendant and he was directed to appear and testify in both of those subpoenas. 
    Now, that fact is significant because we take the Wilson case. 
    In that case, this Court held that an officer of a corporation could not refuse to produce books and records even though those books and records would incriminate the officer. 
    In United States against White, that same principle was applied to union books and records. 
    But in the Wilson case, Chief Justice Hughes pointed out, there is no question, of course, of oral testimony or he was not required to give any. 
    In the Wilson case, it was simply a subpoena duces tecum with no direction to testify.

    And if we hold that the -- the privilege was -- was not available and what is their basis on --
speaker="samuel_mezansky" startTime="1721.746" stopTime="1729.308">
    Mr. Samuel Mezansky 
    Well, then you would be affirming a judgment on the ground other than that urged in the District Court.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="1729.308" stopTime="1734.614">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Well, so what --
speaker="samuel_mezansky" startTime="1734.614" stopTime="2179.427">
    Mr. Samuel Mezansky 
    Now, in the Wilson case, he was not required to testify. 
    In the White case, which was the case which applied to union books and records, Mr. Justice Murphy pointed out that there was no effort or indicated intention to examine him personally as a witness. 
    Well, those cases have no application and both of those cases were based upon the fact that a witness may not complain if records which were semipublic in character furnished the incriminating evidence. 
    And the question now presented is whether these principles in these cases may be projected to require oral testimony of an officer which concededly would be incriminated. 
    Now, the argument is made that if a witness of a corporation -- an officer of a corporation or an officer of a union is required to produce books and records, shouldn't he be required to answer questions auxiliary to their production? 
    That is as to their whereabouts. 
    There is a case in the Second Circuit where such -- such statement was made in the Court's opinion but that referred only to the identification of the records. 
    That was the Austin-Bagley case. 
    In that case, the defendant was charged with a violation of the National Prohibition Act. 
    The United States Attorney introduced the books and records of the corporation. 
    The counsel for one of the defendants, the officer, objected on the ground that the records were not identified and the United States Attorney called as a witness, the defendant officer, and asked him to identify these records. 
    And the Court held that he was required to identify the records because that question was auxiliary to the production of the books and records. 
    There is no decision on this precise question by this Court and the question has not appeared in any other decision and the only case directly in point on this precise question is a decision of a New York court recently rendered where it was held that an officer of a union could refuse to testify as to whereabouts of the union books and records. 
    Now, the Government says that we could have obtained this information in another way. 
    We could have started a proceeding to punish this petitioner for a contempt for failing to produce the books and records. 
    In that proceeding, he would have been required to furnish a reasonable explanation as to the whereabouts of the books and records. 
    Now, there is a decision in the Eighth Circuit, in Lopiparo against United States, decided in 1954, where the Court held, it was a 2-to-1 decision, where the Court held that in such a proceeding to punish a witness for a contempt for failing to produce corporation books and records, the witness was required to furnish an explanation as to their whereabouts. 
    There's a case that arose in the Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, Traub against United States, which rejects that reasoning and the Court stated to refuse to follow the Lopiparo case and gave adverse reasons the following. 
    In other words, the witness can choose his own brand of hemlock. 
    He can destroy himself either by failing to produce records called for by subpoena, even they were not in his possession or control when the subpoena was served, by refusing to answer questions even if he has claimed the privilege -- the protection of the privilege and there has been no judicial determination that it is not available or by giving incriminating evidence. 
    The Court stated that that view was plainly untenable. 
    Now, we say it's no answer that the Government could have started a proceeding to punish for a contempt for failing to produce these records. 
    In such a proceeding, the burden of proof would have been upon the Government to establish that these books and records were in the possession of the petitioner.In that proceeding, there would have been the presumption of innocence. 
    In that proceeding, the petitioner could have submitted other remedies rather than his own testimony as to the whereabouts of the union books and records and not be required to furnish the incriminating evidence from his own lips. 
    We recognized that the Fifth Amendment was written in part to prevent any Congress or any court or any prosecutor from prying open the lips of an accused to make incriminating statements against his will. 
    This Court has greatly spoken out plainly about the Fifth Amendment that is to be given a liberal application that it was not a historical relic to be tolerated. 
    It is not a constitutional nuisance. 
    We say that the principles of the cases in the Wilson or White cases should not be projected to require a person to furnish the incriminating evidence out of his own lips. 
    The argument of the Government cannot be reconciled with the principles established by the decisions of this Court as to the application of the Fifth Amendment. 
    We submit that this petitioner should not be required to testify to facts which would furnish a link in the chain of testimony to convict him. 
    No subtle or fine distinction should be permitted to deprive this petitioner of his privilege to remain silent and the Government has conceded that if he answered these questions, they would incriminate him. 
    Judge Medina, writing for the Circuit Court of Appeals, stated that counsel seems to suppose that notorious criminals, racketeers and unsavory characters generally have an open sesame to the privilege guaranteed by the Fifth Amendment. 
    We suppose nothing of the kind. 
    The rulings of this Court require that any assertion in good faith of the privilege against self-incrimination must be respected, whether the privilege is asserted by a criminal, a Communist, a school teacher or a business person. 
    We say that by reason of these facts, the foregoing principles, this letter should be reversed. 
   
   
   
   Argument of Beatrice Rosenberg
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2179.427" stopTime="2184.405">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Ms. Rosenberg.
speaker="beatrice_rosenberg" startTime="2184.405" stopTime="2298.334">
    Ms. Beatrice Rosenberg 
    Let me first clarify the procedure here and explain why we think that the issue that we say is here, we think the Court can decide here. 
    This determines the petitioner was served with two subpoenas, a personal subpoena and a subpoena duces tecum to him as secretary-treasurer of Local 269. 
    And it was served on April 9th, this may be turnable to 10th, but because the counsel wasn't available, it was put off until the 12th. 
    Now, on the 12th, he was asked a lot of questions not only in his capacity as secretary-treasurer, not only in relation to the subpoena duces tecum but others and he claimed the privilege in regard to most of it. 
    Nothing happened, he -- he was simply told to come back on the 17th before the grand jury. 
    And when he came back on the 17th, the only questions that were put to him were the questions that are, at pages 6 to 7 of our brief. 
    They are the only questions involved in this proceeding. 
    Those were the only questions asked of him on April 17th before there's been any request to the Court for a ruling, any of the sort. 
    And at that point, the Court looked at those questions. 
    They are all, all 15 of them, concerned with where are the union records to which the subpoena duces tecum relates?
speaker="harold_burton" startTime="2298.334" stopTime="2300.657">
    Justice Harold Burton 
    They don't depend in any way on the other 200?
speaker="beatrice_rosenberg" startTime="2300.657" stopTime="2475.307">
    Ms. Beatrice Rosenberg 
    No. 
    And they weren't put to him. 
    As to the other 200 or on April 12th, there was no request for a ruling by the Court. 
    Nothing was done. 
    He was simply told to come back. 
    Then when he came back on the 17th, these 15 questions were put to him. 
    He refused to answer. 
    Now, some of these had been put to him back in the 12th, some had -- and was mixed in with the other things. 
    When the attorney came on the 17th, these had been called out and were put to indirectly and they all related to these records. 
    I think it's fair to say they were -- he had been -- let me say this, that on the 12th, he had said that the union had books to his knowledge. 
    He had seen them and they weren't in his possession -- in his possession at the time that the subpoena was served on him. 
    But he claimed the privilege as to whether he knew who had possession whether they were in his custody as distinguished from possession and as to where they had been a few days before. 
    So that -- as I say that happened on the 12th and he did admit the union had the book that he didn't have it in his possession. 
    When he came back on 17th, these questions, I think, can fairly be said to try to reach the question of were they in his custody, is not in his possession or did he know where they were, were they in a possession of the union, as the union which after all was the organization who's books were subpoenaed and he was the officer who would normally have charge of those books. 
    Well, he claimed the privilege then on the 17th and it was at that point that the grand jury reconvened or if they came before Judge Noonan for a ruling on the question and it was at that point that they read only these 15 questions and asked for a ruling from the judge only on these questions relating to the custody in control of the union's book. 
    The United States Attorney made no attempt to put anything else at issue. 
    And it is true that they didn't argue with in exactly the same fashion that we intend to argue here, the reason why he had no privilege with regard to these books. 
    They talked about the fact that he didn't make a showing of incrimination. 
    But the fact is that the only question on which a ruling was sought were these questions about the union book and that was what the judge ruled and he had no privilege in regard to. 
    Again -- perhaps, the ruling might have been more articulate from our point of -- of our theory --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2475.307" stopTime="2479.094">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Where is the -- where is the ruling, Ms. Rosenberg?
speaker="beatrice_rosenberg" startTime="2479.094" stopTime="2553.369">
    Ms. Beatrice Rosenberg 
    At pages of -- 15 of the record. 
    He said -- and I will just have to read it, Your Honor, in the middle of the page, "All the ones I heard, he's now read to me seem repetitions and certainly the ones that I have heard have been properly asked and should be answered.” 
    That's 15. 
    And if you look over at page 16, the fact that this was solely confined to the books and records was certainly made clear to everybody because at page 16 of the record, the Government counsel said, where it says Mr. Wachtell, "I would like to check the record that there are other questions not pertaining to the books and records,” which it has been indicated to the Court that the witness did not answer on a prior proceeding. 
    The Government might feel at some future day that these questions are probable, so that everybody knew that these questions were combined to the books and record, all that -- which I say, the theory wasn't spelled out in exactly the same fashion. 
    I hope to discuss it here.

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    But has it ever been held so far that a person who might be under suspicion of having violated the law and subjected himself for a criminal prosecution failing to bring those books could be compelled to incriminate himself about him and confess it?
speaker="beatrice_rosenberg" startTime="2652.014" stopTime="2656.893">
    Ms. Beatrice Rosenberg 
    There is one holding on this precise issue which is by the Second Circuit, in the Field case.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="2656.893" stopTime="2657.995">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Has this Court ever held it?
speaker="beatrice_rosenberg" startTime="2657.995" stopTime="2779.401">
    Ms. Beatrice Rosenberg 
    No, this Court has not. 
    Let me say, however, that in the White -- in the Wilson case, the defendant who was told to bring the book there was under -- already under indictment. 
    Two indictments had been returned against him and he still had to produce the books. 
    And the whole rationale, as I understand it, is that the corporate book -- the corporate books or the union books are something separate and apart from the right of the individual. 
    Now, of course, whenever we're dealing with this artificial entity, you can't actually separate the entity from the individual. 
    It will become a legal question of, are we going to consider the entity and this individual merged into the entity and forget about his individuality or are we going to consider the individual and disregard the entity? 
    And it seems to me that it follows, despite the fact that this is testimony and other is producing books seems to me a different -- without distinction because there's no question about the fact. 
    It goes back to Boyd against the United States. 
    That is their -- the privilege. 
    It goes to the book. 
    If this man -- if these were his books, he couldn't be subpoenaed or at least he could claim the privilege in regard to showing them to the grand jury. 
    And he certainly couldn't be compelled to produce them at a criminal trial. 
    That would violate his privilege. 
    So that it doesn't seem to me the question of whether there is or is not a privilege can be said to stem from the fact that one is bringing in the book and the other is explaining why you didn't bring them.

    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Supposing this man had taken these books and used them for -- to start a fire, to burn down a government warehouse and then, he is called before the grand jury on that charge and he is asked the question, did you use these corporate books to start that fire? 
    Can he claim his privilege?

    Ms. Beatrice Rosenberg 
    I -- maybe so, Your Honor.

    Extreme case, but it --
speaker="beatrice_rosenberg" startTime="2804.999" stopTime="2827.712">
    Ms. Beatrice Rosenberg 
    Where I think -- what I think the law and legitimately is which is that it seems to me it goes as far as the union duty is. 
    Now, the union duty, the union, the owner of the books, his duty is to produce the books or to give an adequate excuse for nonproduction under Rule 17.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="2827.712" stopTime="2831.936">

    We don't argue that they weren't incriminating.

    No, it's not -- not the contents of the books or -- or records that I thought we were dealing with but his failure here to produce whatever his reason may have been for not producing, on any of those days exposed him to the possibility of prosecution for crime. 
    And on that circumstance, why isn't he justified at asserting the privilege against answering the question, where were they on Thursday, Saturday or Monday because if he admitted that he knew, he contribute to the Government's case against them for failure to have produced the books on one of those days.

    Now, we -- but this Court held in the Rogers case -- not held, I should qualify that suggestion in the Rogers case in discussing something else or assumed in the Rogers case that the secretary of the Communist Party, of a particular local, couldn't refuse to produce the books to the Communist Party because they weren't her books. 
    And under that, the mere fact of the production in that case, the mere fact of bringing the records into court would have been a change in some evidence against her in a prosecution for -- Smith Act or something of that sort. 
    But the Court said those aren't her books. 
    It was perfectly clear that if somebody else had those books and they -- we're told to bring them in, no matter how it -- no matter how they would incriminate the petitioner, they would be brought in for the theory of the corporate or association books as been, that the books of an association are so different and apart from the individual that even though the individual was the one whose before the Court, we have to considerate it as something different that the entities can't act except through individuals, that's true. 
    But when a man is asking for a union, he is asking at something different from what he's asking for himself. 
    And on that theory, it is the union's duty to account for the books. 
    And that's theoretical basis, of course, it has certain practical effects. 
    Now, what actually happened in this case, of course, is implicit. 
    In the record, if a man can come in, a custodian, who has no personal privilege in regard to the book, can come in and merely say, “I don't have them in my possession.” 
    And then refuse to say, “Did you turn them over to anybody else in the union?” 
    Then, you really do get again hard to see. 
    And so, you just pass it from one union officer --

speaker="beatrice_rosenberg" startTime="3478.084" stopTime="3636.975">
    Ms. Beatrice Rosenberg 
    That's what the Court of Appeals in New York had held. 
    They said he doesn't have to answer any questions about the books but he goes to jail for nonproduction. 
    In other words, you -- you go to jail in order to force an explanation from him. 
    It seems to me, more honest, more -- definitely accomplishing the purposes of the grand jury to say these aren't your books. 
    You're here only insofar as you represent the union. 
    Now, the union's duty is one of two things, not just one. 
    The union's duty is to produce the books no matter how much they incriminate you personally. 
    Your duty as a union officer is to produce those books no matter how much they're going to send you to jail. 
    And the union's duty that doesn't produce them is to account for them. 
    And if -- as you're here as a union officer, you've got to carry out the union's duty. 
    And the union's duty is to account for the book. 
    Now, once you account for the books, we're through. 
    And I started -- I think I got interrupted when I started saying your explanation of burning, that it seems to me that you showed the books were burned that, thereafter, we couldn't ask him. 
    Were they burnt in your direction? 
    Were they burnt before or after the subpoena? 
    As soon as he have accounted for the books, we agreed that we are through. 
    And on that basis, may I explain what I saw as embezzlement about -- about our concession in regard to mootness. 
    The judgment here with six months in jail with opportunity to encourage himself by answering these questions. 
    What we said was we can see that these we have the right to ask these questions only to the extent if they enable us to get the books that this Court said we're entitled to have, the union books. 
    Now, we've got those books and at this point, with the books in our hands, if he's asking question, he's got a personal claim of privilege. 
    We don't deny that. 
    We say he doesn't have a claim of privilege so long as the union, whom he represents, hasn't complied with its duty. 
    Now, the minute the union complied with its duty, his representative duties are over and he's an individual. 
    And so, the question we had about mootness was that the opportunity to purge is -- in the practical sense go. 
    And the question was, did that make it criminal or civil?

    And the -- on that basis, the only thing that was before the judge was a question, presumably, preliminarily because if the defendant had disclosed where the books were that would have been the end of the matter and it wouldn't have been unnecessary to proceed with the jail sentence for failure to produce the book.

    Ms. Beatrice Rosenberg 
    Well, on this question of mootness, this is -- we have an in between situation. 
    If he had simply been punished for refusing to answer the question, that would have been a strict criminal contempt and there's no question about the fact that it would survive no matter what happened later on to that book. 
    If this had been a civil case where it was purely remedial and the judges said you'll stay in jail until you answer the questions, then the purpose of these questions is to get the book. 
    Once the book got there, we would agree the case became moot. 
    Now, the reason we filed the memorandum bringing them back to the attention of the Court is that this is sort of in between the two. 
    It's criminal and that then that he is being punished for failing to answer. 
    But the judge did give it a remedial term by saying, “Well, I'll cut down your sentence if you answer the questions that will help us get the book.” 
    When we went into this matter further, we decided that under the authority and particularly, the decision of this Court in Grant against the United States in 227 U.S, the case was not moot because the Court had said that even though you have an opportunity to purge, if the criminal case under the old procedure reviewable by writ of error. 
    And therefore, the primary derived of the sentence is criminal. 
    On that basis the case is not moot. 
    Although as I say, we do admit that the opportunity to purge is in a different posture to this Court since the Government does have the book. 
    Well, basically, that is the Government's position that this is no different from what this Court has held in Wilson and in Grant and in Wheeler and in --

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Well then, when -- does this difference then when we get to the day when Judge Noonan put this question, “Where were those books a couple of weeks ago?” 
    On that occasion, when those questions were put, they are hung over the head of this defendant, the possibility being prosecuted for a crime.
speaker="beatrice_rosenberg" startTime="4345.696" stopTime="4347.434">
    Ms. Beatrice Rosenberg 
    Actually, that's right.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="4347.434" stopTime="4348.310">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    All right.
speaker="beatrice_rosenberg" startTime="4348.310" stopTime="4509.702">
    Ms. Beatrice Rosenberg 
    We -- as I say, I -- we have said in his brief and -- and we don't retract in position that if there is a personal privilege in regard to this, there's -- there's all kinds of basis. 
    There's a basis of the fact that after all if the Government found the book, they'd involve him and not only in the prosecution for a contempt but they might involve him in all the offenses that the book would show too. 
    But as I say, there's no question about the fact that in Wilson, he was already indicted for a crime and the books were, I think admittedly wanted -- well, they -- prior the same investigation in any case, so that they were there. 
    And it seems to me to make a different as the Court hadn't really recognized in other situations between written and oral testimony that is -- the fact that something -- that bringing in a book will implicate you in a crime. 
    It doesn't seem to me to be essentially different from the fact that answering a question will implicate you in a crime. 
    The real question is, since these aren't your books, then they belong to this artificial entity. 
    Can you obey the duty of the entity simply by saying, “Oh, but this is going to implicate me personally.” 
    The Court said you couldn't do it even though those books might involve you in all sorts of things. 
    It held that you couldn't do it even as I say in relation to a sole stockholder of the dissolved corporation and where the corporation has no longer had existed. 
    The only person interested was the defendant. 
    That was in Grant and Wheeler. 
    The Court said, nevertheless, those aren't your books and you've got to produce them. 
    So that I don't see the fact that this is oral testimony, if so can -- makes this situation that different. 
    And as to this matter about proceeding for failure to produce the books, it just seems to us a really more direct recognition of the custodian's duty to say, “No, you're a custodian. 
    You -- you got to account for the union books because they aren't your books. 
    They're the union's book.” 
    Then, it is to go ahead and say, “As a New Yorker it feels he did. 
    Well, you can claim your privilege but you got to have the bounty for nonproduction.” 
    And the Court -- this Court's Wilson case is clear.

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Yes, but you haven't prosecuted him for that. 
    In New York, what they did I assume was to prosecute a man for failure to produce the books and proves that he has the books, deliberately refused to produce, wasn't that the bases of that?
speaker="beatrice_rosenberg" startTime="4536.876" stopTime="4620.008">
    Ms. Beatrice Rosenberg 
    Well, if -- for nonproduction. 
    No, he didn't produce them and -- well, this is a man who admits that the union has book, admit that the union has book. 
    The subpoenas directed to him as treasurer of the union. 
    The union was supposed to bring the books. 
    Now, suppose the subpoena had gone, instead of being directed to Joseph Curcio, as secretary-treasurer, it had been directed to Local 269, just as such the Wilson case, it was addressed to the corporation. 
    The Wilson case said if it's addressed to the corporation, how do you punish the corporation? 
    You punish the person who represents the corporation. 
    Who taught -- who represents the corporation in relation to union book? 
    The secretary-treasurer, so that in a sense, a ruling contrary to the proposition here, forces us to go against the man to put him in jail, instead of recognizing that as a custodian, he's in a different position than as an individual. 
    And at the minimum what he has to do is at least account for the books in relation to the union.

    Of course, in this case, he did before the grand jury.

    Under this Court's Nilva decision, it's clearly wasn't an adequate excuse just for the man to come in and say, the union is not producing the books because I, individually, don't have possession at this moment. 
    So that it's perfectly true, the alternative to saying, you don't have to answer the questions here, is that the Government is going to say, “Okay, the union will be prosecuted for failure to produce the books or to give an adequate explanation.”

    No.

    It will be asked for a ruling. 
    It said, answer these questions and if he had answered them and the books have been produced, there wouldn't have been any prosecution. 
    Theoretically, there was a right to it but as a practical manner, people don't bring prosecutions for failure to produce books if they gotten the books through the man's testimony. 
    And this is a method of trying to see that a -- the subpoena isn't just disregarded by a kind of flimflam, just passing it from one member of the union to another without having to do with it by starting a prosecution for contempt for failure to produce.
