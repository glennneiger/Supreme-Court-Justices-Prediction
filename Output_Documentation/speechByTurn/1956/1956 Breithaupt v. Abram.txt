    May it please the Court. 
    Yesterday, I had commenced to explore the application of the position of this Court in Rochin against California to this particular situation. 
    And as I recall, had indicated that petitioner sees no particular reason for not applying the doctrine in the Rochin case simply because, here, there is no brutality for us. 
    There is no struggle to secure the vital blood in this case to be tested in order to supply the evidence in as much as petitioner was unconscious at the time.

    I think the fingerprint cases can be distinguished from this situation for the simple reason that the fingerprints involve identification, almost invariable. 
    And here, we are faced with a situation where they are trying to actually prove the crime. 
    It goes to the heart of the matter, rather than merely identifying him or placing him with the scene. 
    Sometimes, of course, fingerprints aren't even necessary. 
    It's merely a matter of routine. 
    But here, the thing is conceivably -- it could be said to be part of the corpus delicti with the aspect that he was driving the car that he may have been intoxicated, that they must take the blood or feel they must to make the test.

    Why, then it is used over objection at the trial. 
    So, it's -- it's more than a -- merely a self-incrimination or it's more than merely -- merely a search and seizure. 
    Because as I indicated, when -- in answer to Mr. Justice Brennan's question, I think this thing goes to the heart of the matter, they're conceivably could be no conviction, no showing of involuntary manslaughter where the Court says, driving while intoxicated is an -- or the Supreme Court of New Mexico has said, driving while intoxicated is an element to be considered in manslaughter prosecutions and therefore they are -- they're approving that element.

    Now is a good time, since Your Honor has brought it up. 
    The fact that, here, you have evidence that is obtained in the way it is that you can say -- you can't say, of course, that this is compelled testimony on that part of the accused because it's not. 
    He doesn't -- he doesn't testify at the trial but he supplies the evidence or he supplies the basis of that evidence, certainly involuntary because he's unconscious and the scientific test were performed. 
    And I see little difference between taking that from him when he is absolutely unable to protest and then drawing the scientific conclusions in making the testimony and -- and forcing a confession.

    And there's -- there's no question here but that the man was at the scene of the crime that the accident occurred and the state endeavors to show that in the accident in which he was involved, he was driving while intoxicated.

    Well, as I indicated a moment ago, I -- question whether there should be a matter of degree where there is any taking without consent but possibly if there'd been a struggle and he's been pinned down or --or strapped to the table or something and the blood extracted, why you -- you can say that was more reprehensible. 
    But on the other hand, if there can be no struggle -- if there can be consent, if there can be no way where -- because of his condition, because of the fact that he was injured in the accident and unconscious for hours or days. 
    I -- it seems to me that on that particular situation, which is what we are -- been trying to do it here. 
    I -- it is a denial of due process to use such evidence in the conviction. 
    The state cases are not too many which have dealt with this particular question. 
    The Iowa case of State against Weltha was almost identical on the facts in that particular case. 
    The decision doesn't indicate the exact ground for the Iowa Supreme Court's holding that the evidence was inadmissible and reversing this conviction that indicates that the Court has read a number of annotations in ALR and -- and lawyer's tradition on to the Supreme Court -- Courts and that's a 1940 cases, as I recall, and that because of this Court's decision in United States against Lefkowitz which was a federal case, which involved in unlawful search and seizure and in which the Court found violation of both Fourth and Fifth Amendments that as far as the Iowa Court is concerned, that settles. 
    They merely say that this evidence should have been admitted that -- if anybody wonders why we think so they can read the Lefkowitz case and the annotations. 
    So, it -- although it stands for the proposition against Iowa at least in 1940, such a conviction would be reversed. 
    If it's not of any great aid in spelling out why, in fact, the Iowa Court without citing the case had the exclusionary rule announced in the State against (Inaudible) some years prior thereto that any evidence that pertain through violations of the constitutional rights should be excluded. 
    But the court doesn't cite that in this Weltha and the Automobile case involving the blood test.

    Mr. F. Gordon Shermack 
    No, the -- a certain -- oh there was a certain exploration of the actual testing method employed to test the blood, but as to the taking, I don't recall a testimony shows there is any. 
    In the physician-patient privilege which generally comes up in these cases may have been mentioned but it certainly wasn't pressed. 
    Another State decision which involves, not a blood test but several other test which were compelled, the walking of the line, the urinalysis for intoxification or -- or at least for alcoholic content was stating (Inaudible) from Texas. 
    And there, on the grounds of self incrimination under the Texas State Constitution, the Court of Criminal Appeals reversed the conviction holding that it was a violation in the State Constitution without getting into a federal question of law. 
    One other state court decision which might be mentioned particularly or the consent involved is that cited in the brief for the respondents which is -- States against Cram from Oregon. 
    And in that particular case, we had identical facts for the present case, the conviction was upheld on the grounds that it did not violate the self incrimination provision of the state statute but the court very carefully and stoutly avoided, in fact, pointed out that they were not ruling since the question wasn't raised and whether or not this was a violation of the search and seizure provision. 
    And in the dissent by the Chief Justice of the Oregon Supreme Court, he indicates following and using, employing much of the language in Palko that he feels this is a violation of due process that the Court should have gone into whether or not this was an unlawful search and seizure, whether it was raised or not. 
    And the language of that case, the feeling in that case where the facts, the manner of the taking was -- was identical with that here present. 
    The language in the dissent and occasionally, the -- the sense of one generation become the opinions of the next. 
    The language of that dissent was very similar to in thought and in feeling to that of the majority of this Court in the Rochin case. 
    To summarize the major point course is, that the taking and the use of the evidence obtained from the taking offends the civilized methods of decency in fair concepts of decency in fairness, and there's a violation of due process and conviction so obtain should not stay. 
    It must be and should be like into the course of confession situations. 
    It must be distinguished from the mere fingerprint decisions of the cases that hold it. 
    You can compel a defendant to stand in Court or speak or even walk for the simple reason that this is more question of mere identity you're placing in the scene of the crime.

    Mr. Richard H. Robinson 
    With the Court's permission, I intend to attempt to convince this honorable body that in case at bar is not similar and should be distinguished from the Rochin case which the petitioner has more or less hung his head on and with the further permission of the Court, Assistant Attorney General Kegel will discuss the applicability or the lack of applicability of the Fourth and Fifth Amendments which has been mentioned briefly by petitioner's counsel. 
    I intend to use less than half of the time then give Mr. Kegel the balance. 
    In the Rochin case, the opinion was written by the Honorable Justice Frankfurter and one of the questions he asked in there was that had to be determined was whether or not the actions in the Rochin case and to refresh the Court's memory briefly, there, the officers had forced themselves into the home of the defendant, forced their way into his bedroom, saw these capsules of dope laying on the table, that's what they were. 
    The defendant quickly swallowed them then attempted right there to force the capsules from his mouth and enable to do so, they handcuffed him, dragged him down to a hospital, forced the medicine to his stomach and caused him to regurgitate, we covered that evidence which was used against him. 
    And one of the questions Justice Frankfurter asked was whether or not such actions offend the counts of decency and fairness which he expressed the notions of justice of English speaking people, even toward those charges of the most heinous offenses. 
    Justice Frankfurter stated that these actions in the Rochin case certainly shocked the conscience of the Court. 
    In distinguishing the case at bar, I should like to emphasize the fact that in the Rochin case, they started out by an illegal breaking and entering of the defendant's home without any type of processed warrant, whatsoever. 
    This does not exist in the Breithaupt case. 
    The case is barred, there was any struggle enforcing -- for the body, dragging him against the body and assault against the body and attempted to open his mouth. 
    That does not exist in the case at bar. 
    There was an illegal arrest made. 
    They're not able to obtain the capsules, not even be ensured they work though -- having no actual reason to make an arrest, they arrested the defendant in the Rochin case. 
    In this case, the arrest was completely legal. 
    There was an accident, crest of a hill on the wrong side of the road, as far as the defendant was concerned, three limit women lay dead upon the highway. 
    There was an almost empty bottle of whiskey with the defendant on the car and he smelled of alcohol. 
    There was an illegal arrest in the case at bar. 
    There was no brutality shown in the case at bar as was discussed by the Honorable Justice Frankfurter in the Rochin case. 
    In fact, he was taken to the hospital and attempt to save his life and was kept there several days, and as I recall, weeks, at the county expense in attempt to save his life. 
    It would have been impossible or had -- had any affect any way to wait until he could gain consciousness to give his consent if it were necessary. 
    The fact show and the Court's aware of the fact that the officer suggested a blood test and the doctor agreed to draw blood by merely the small prick of a needle.

    Mr. Richard H. Robinson 
    Not to my knowledge, sir. 
    We used several different types of tests but the alcohol -- the blood test is the most common. 
    And that's one that was used in this.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="1688.050" stopTime="1696.002">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Well, of course, actually, that's what the drunkometer test is except it arrives at it by -- the test as I understand it, the breath.

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    I said that's what I understand that drunkometer test is actually it arrives at the alcoholic content of the blood through analysis of the breath.
speaker="richard_h_robinson" startTime="1705.564" stopTime="1707.700">
    Mr. Richard H. Robinson 
    Through analysis of the breath rather than the blood, Yes, sir.

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Arrives with the same result that you'd be using with blood.
speaker="richard_h_robinson" startTime="1710.145" stopTime="1783.603">
    Mr. Richard H. Robinson 
    That's right. 
    They have the same result as I understand it, Your Honor, and frankly, I can't seen any difference in the drunkometer whether we had taken the breath of the defendant which I believe is possible although I'm not sure if he was conscious or whether we took blood from his veins. 
    In the Rochin case, as you recall, Justice Douglas and Black dissented on the ground to the Fourth and Fifth Amendment be binding upon the state. 
    However, Douglas -- Justice Douglas stated that he did not agree, that the exclusionary rule adopted by large majority of the states violates the decency of civilized conduct. 
    The rules formulated by responsible Courts with judges as sensitive -- as we are to proper standards for all administration and of the quote. 
    And as the Court has been informed, the State of New Mexico has adopted -- does not exclude the illegally obtained evidence or testimony. 
    It may be used regardless of the procedure which was employed in requiring the evidence.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1783.603" stopTime="1808.191">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Attorney General Robinson, in distinguishing these two cases, suppose instead of taking a blood test, they -- here they had -- they had taken the stomach test while he unconscious -- unconscious as they did in the Rochin case, would you still distinguish the cases on the grounds of the -- of the difference between the -- the two things that were done?
speaker="richard_h_robinson" startTime="1808.191" stopTime="1852.258">
    Mr. Richard H. Robinson 
    Yes, sir, conscientiously I could, in my own mind, distinguish the cases because the lack of brutality, the lack of the illegal arrest and it was in the Rochin case the stomach or pump test was preceded by any illegal arrest. 
    It was -- the illegal arrest was preceded by an illegal force in entering without a warrant and if the Rochin case, and it is the law of the land at this time, and if it is to remain the law of the land, I should certainly say that the actions in the Rochin case would shock the conscience of the Court, where, even in your hypothetical case in the case at bar, the illegal arrest is lacking, the illegal force in entering to the home is lacking and I think the cases could be distinguished, Yes, sir.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1852.258" stopTime="1867.072">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Would you -- would you distinguish that the two on the grounds that there was no physical opposition to taking it as it was in the Rochin case, do you think that makes any difference?
speaker="richard_h_robinson" startTime="1867.072" stopTime="1889.931">
    Mr. Richard H. Robinson 
    I think that makes some difference, Yes, sir. 
    I think that in deciding where the line is, where the cases start to shock the Court and where they don't, you have to consider all these elements. 
    Now, under the Wolf case, it would -- the Wolf case, as you recall, stated in the Weeks case, did -- did not apply to the state courts and they could have meet this evidence as their rules of evidence so provided.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1889.931" stopTime="1912.401">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Then, if it was a weak person physically who -- who couldn't object, let us say a woman or -- or a child, you would think that we wouldn't have another Rochin case because they had physically resisted the -- the efforts of the officers to do that, would you -- would you go that far?
speaker="richard_h_robinson" startTime="1912.401" stopTime="1978.328">
    Mr. Richard H. Robinson 
    Let me answer that, if I may, sir, this way, I still don't think that that type of action would be so shocking as the Rochin case. 
    And in the Rochin, as I say in -- in the further developing and studying of the Rochin case, the (Inaudible) case that you have to decide, possibly, at the trial, the attorney on the case arbitrarily whether or not this is going far enough to shock the conscience of the Court, but in answering your question, let's say that New Mexico had had a compulsory law requiring blood test for drunken driving cases. 
    It has been mentioned on the legislature some years passed, and in my understanding, it's going to be brought up again this January in the legislature. 
    But if such an Act would shock the conscience of the Court, such a law should also shock the conscience of the Court and I don't think those laws have been held to shock the conscience of the Court. 
    But we had a law requiring a drunken driving -- the suspect to submit the blood test, we could do it even by force and I don't believe that would shock the conscience of the Court under the Rochin case.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1978.328" stopTime="1999.515">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    But do you think in the Rochin case, if the man had just said, I object to -- to your doing this and then had not resisted the officers forcibly and -- and they had pumped his stomach as they did, do you feel that would immaterially have changed the posture of the case so far as the decisions was concerned?
speaker="richard_h_robinson" startTime="1999.515" stopTime="2014.923">
    Mr. Richard H. Robinson 
    Yes, sir. 
    It would change the degree of -- as I say, the shock upon the Court. 
    Somewhere in that field, you got to draw a line in where they start to shock the Court. 
    And I think it would put it certainly over on that side of that dividing line, if I may express it that way.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2014.923" stopTime="2022.688">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    It will take the law -- the law itself would resist for a man who is totally unconscious.
speaker="richard_h_robinson" startTime="2022.688" stopTime="2030.617">
    Mr. Richard H. Robinson 
    No, sir. 
    At least, I could find -- I could just find no authority saying it does.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2030.617" stopTime="2065.274">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    If one doesn't determine a problem of this sort by absolving it due by creating new process and the shorthand two words for denial of the First Amendment which is toward an attempt, and therefore, one cannot say the self incrimination with this unlawful search and seizure, one must go to (Inaudible) on each particular situation, is there any escape from that?
speaker="richard_h_robinson" startTime="2065.274" stopTime="2085.967">
    Mr. Richard H. Robinson 
    No, sir. 
    I -- my own personal feeling is, that I and Justice Clark so stated in the Irvine case, I believe it was, that if the Wolf case is to be the law of the land as it had been for years and it should be the law all the way and that the states should provide protection for violations of the self incrimination --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2085.967" stopTime="2099.854">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    So that means because there may be situation that violates due process and do not infringe or impinge upon a lawful search and seizure. 
    The Wolf case dealt with the particular phase, had it, whether the Week's (Inaudible) is incorporated in the process.
speaker="richard_h_robinson" startTime="2099.854" stopTime="2100.817">
    Mr. Richard H. Robinson 
    That's right, Yes, sir.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2100.817" stopTime="2112.855">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Never mind now. 
    I don't think (Inaudible) that's all that case concerns. 
    So that -- but -- unlawful search and seizure aren't the only things even in their ugliest forms that they divide it with due process.
speaker="richard_h_robinson" startTime="2112.855" stopTime="2113.388">
    Mr. Richard H. Robinson 
    That's right, sir.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2113.388" stopTime="2124.549">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    And unless you can take it under one of the nine amendments, what can you do except go to the substance and see what are the kinds of things that outdated that sense of justice which then contain the due process?

    Mr. Richard H. Robinson 
    Well that -- that's what the Court has done, as I understand it, in the Rochin case. 
    So that's why --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2128.883" stopTime="2141.022">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    It's done on all of the cases. 
    It was done in Palko, it was done in (Inaudible) due process clause was conceived to be not restricted to procedural informants.

    Mr. Richard H. Robinson 
    That's right, under the Fourteenth Amendment.

    Justice William O. Douglas 
    Herein to the -- to proceed the justice that you mean to -- went to suggest it in there and that a struggle between the police and the doctor in his bed? 
    What the doctor would anounce still without the Rochin --
speaker="richard_h_robinson" startTime="2186.844" stopTime="2190.858">
    Mr. Richard H. Robinson 
    I -- I didn't understand the Chief Justice's question to involve a struggle.

    Well, suppose they're hitting a struggle.
speaker="richard_h_robinson" startTime="2192.328" stopTime="2259.864">
    Mr. Richard H. Robinson 
    There was a verbal protest, I believe, in his hypothetical case, but no -- no struggle. 
    And to answer your question, as I say, it would be -- it would -- I -- in the case of a struggle, it would increase the degree of work to the -- to the point that might shock the conscience of the Court, I agree to that. 
    But the Rochin case, in addition to a struggle was surely illegal breaking and entering to the home, the illegal arrest, and the brutality shown all the way through it where you don't have it in this case and you'd only have a -- a lesser degree of it in your hypothetical case. 
    You'd have the lesser degree of brutality in the temporary struggle or however long it might last in forcing the stomach pump.But you still wouldn't go as far as the fact showed in the Rochin case. 
    And of course, it's entirely up to the Court to decide where the field starts in this due process cases in this type of arrest where it starts to shock the Court and where it doesn't. 
    And in your case, you would certainly be closer to the Rochin case but you still wouldn't involve the illegal arrest and the illegal search as the illegal force entry to the -- to the home.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2259.864" stopTime="2262.800">

    And the Court discussed the Rochin case which stated that they did not feel that the facts in the Haeussler case were sufficient to be shocking to the Court. 
    Of course, I refer to the Supreme Court of California and not to this Court. 
    They went on the State but this was a taking of real evidence rather than testimonial compulsion. 
    This People versus Cahan, 282 P.2d 905, State of California changed the rule of evidence in California. 
    It did not overrule the Haeussler case but it changed the rule of evidence and stated that illegally obtained testimony would no longer be admissible in the State of California because the Court well know is that -- is the minority rule throughout the United States and as far as the states are concerned.

    However, in this last case, I've just discussed in the Third Appellate District of California, it was a blood taking case and there were some evidence that was taken under protest. 
    At least, he withdrew his arm and they forced his arm back and took it. 
    And they held that even though the Cahan case now is a law that this was an illegal taking and that the -- and the conviction was upheld.

    Mr. Richard H. Robinson 
    Medically, in -- in every case that I ran into, I run into old cases where a properly taken blood test was not admitted as far as its action is concerned. 
    To conclude, I'd like to discuss briefly, I mentioned Mr. Clark's opinion in the Irvine case, but the Irvine versus California, 347 United States 128, decided February the 8th, 1954. 
    In that case, an officer had the key made to the defendant's home without the defendant's knowledge, used it to enter his home and placed the microphone, used it again to change the microphone into the privacy of the man's bedroom, then after being unsatisfied there, he moved -- went into the house again and moved it under the closet. 
    And as I recall, some evidence was taken during one of the illegal breaking and that the testimony from the records were used in convicting him of bookmaking. 
    And one of the points discussed by the Court -- or the -- this Court was the Fourteenth Amendment. 
    And in its decision, the decision was written by Justice Jackson. 
    He accorded the Wolf case and repeated that it was still the law that states are not prohibited from admitting illegally obtained evidence. 
    And in discussing the Rochin case, stated that in the Rochin case, there was coercion, brutality and so forth. 
    And it did not exist in the Irvine case. 
    And as I say in that case, Justice Clark wrote a concurring opinion, but he stated there he believed the Weeks case should apply to the states but since the Court in the Wolf case held that it didn't, then the Court should honor what they deemed to be the law. 
    I want to mention that case ever since it was decided after the Rochin case and a majority of the Court held that such facts do not -- did not shock the conscience of the Court. 
    And in my humble opinion sir, I think the Irvine case is much more shocking. 
    You have these degrees of being shocked again then the case at bar.

    They -- they -- let's say they -- they arrest him and saw him on the street and just took him in -- took him up to the -- the jail and had the jail doctor against his protest to take his blood in order to determine if that was a type of blood of the child involved so they could use it against him on the -- on the trial.

    I understand, I am not sure of this, I didn't check that point where they understand there are some states having statutes requiring blood test in paternity cases. 
    And certainly, such a statute would be upheld, and I think such action could be sustained even under the doctor of the Rochin case.

    But Mr. (Inaudible), I -- my understanding of blood test in paternity cases was that if there is not identity of type between the child and the putative father, that establishes or -- or nearly to establish unless medically that the father -- the putative father could not have been the father of the child and that the other is not true that the fact that there is identity or similarity of types doesn't establish that the putative father is the father nor can that evidence be used against him, isn't that so in your state?

   Argument of Walter R. Kegel
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3492.927" stopTime="3499.040">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Yes. 
    Mr. Kegel.
speaker="walter_r_kegel" startTime="3499.040" stopTime="3730.258">
    Mr. Walter R. Kegel 
    May it please the Court. 
    I think that in the discussion perhaps there is this one item which has not received as much attention as it might and that is the point that regardless of whether a given act shocks or does not shock, of course, it must be a violation of some right. 
    And it does not secure every shocking that encompasses the violation of a right, what may be shocking to me or to anyone else they'll still be perfectly within all legal rights. 
    And first, we must find some basic right which has been violated and then determine whether that right is so basic, so fundamental as to come within due process of law. 
    Before getting into that, however, I would like to discuss the violation of the Fourth and Fifth Amendments for two reasons. 
    First, because some members of the Court believed that per se they are adopted by the Fourteenth Amendment and if there is a violation of those here, then there is automatically a violation of due process. 
    And secondly, I would like to discuss them because it's apparently the contention of petitioner to some extent that the rights which are violated here are akin to the Fourth and Fifth Amendment violations if they're not violations of those practices, sort of a situation where a violation of the Fourth plus the Fifth equals the violation of the Fourteenth that apparently is the interpretation which petitioner has placed on the Rochin case. 
    As to the supposed violation of the Fourth Amendment, I think there are three reasons, basically why that has not controlled here. 
    In the first place, the Fourth Amendment prohibits only unreasonable search and seizures. 
    Here, there is no question, before there was a valid arrest. 
    Where there is a valid arrest, a reason for search is permitted and here I believe that with that arrest, the search of petitioner's body or the blood is just as valid as the search of his house, of his pockets, or of his fingers for fingerprints. 
    It all -- it was back to the same basic principle. 
    Historically, also, the privilege granted by the Fourth Amendment was not a privilege of the person but was a privilege of property affects a man's home is his castle and so on. 
    And furthermore, there is one additional reason why that could not possibly apply here and that is because it's certainly unreasonable to require more of the states than as required to the federal government. 
    And under the Weeks case, the evidence, although illegally obtained, if we're worrying about search and seizures, only, would not be excluded unless there was a motion to suppress. 
    And of course, here, there was no motion to suppress. 
    The only motions which or the grounds of the objection of the trial court were solely on self incrimination, the Fourth Amendment and the Fourteenth Amendment were never mentioned until the matter came up on habeas corpus.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3730.258" stopTime="3735.188">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Do you have that procedure in your state of motion to suppress evidence before the trial?
speaker="walter_r_kegel" startTime="3735.188" stopTime="3740.681">
    Mr. Walter R. Kegel 
    No, sir, we do not. 
    We've -- we have followed the -- we have not followed the Weeks case.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3740.681" stopTime="3748.251">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well, I mean there's matter of procedure, do you -- do you have any such motion in the criminal case to suppress evidence.
speaker="walter_r_kegel" startTime="3748.251" stopTime="3767.031">
    Mr. Walter R. Kegel 
    No, sir, we have not. 
    But the basis of the rule has been that the Court will not take time out during the trial of the case to determine the question on illegality. 
    And certainly, it should be called to the Court's attention prior to the trial.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    No. 
    I am -- I am just speaking in the abstract not as -- not as this defendant but if it was taken from him while he was unconscious, how would he know that that it was going to be used against him and how could he logically be required to make the motion?
speaker="walter_r_kegel" startTime="3795.246" stopTime="3929.921">
    Mr. Walter R. Kegel 
    Your Honor, I presume, even under the doctor in the Weeks case that that were brought to the attention of the Court in the federal proceeding that that would be a reason for not having a pretrial motion as long as the motion was made, as soon the facts were known. 
    Now, as to the -- as to the Fifth Amendment, of course, it isn't applicable in itself to the states. 
    But in addition to that, as far as Fifth Amendment itself is concerned, I think traditionally, it is limited to testimonial compulsion. 
    I think that is the effect to the ruling of this Court in United States verus (Inaudible) 
    That is certainly according to the majority of the students on the subject including Dean Wigmore as opposing counsel stated has been the rule that it is limited to testimonial compulsion and it is largely and these blood test cases, the early ones particularly, where there have been departures from that rule and I think largely because it was appealing amongst Courts at least in the early stages and the development of this scientific test of a type of revulsion against it and this of course was before Rochin and they would look at the possible means of excluding it and the reasons for excluding it and decided that they didn't want to exclude it and either pick the Fourth or Fifth Amendments usually the equivalent state Constitutions as a means for excluding this test. 
    The Texas case which was cited by counsel for petitioner about the Doctor versus State follows that. 
    And yet, the rest of the Texas law is practically uniform holding that the privilege of self incrimination does not apply with anything except testimony.
speaker="stanley_reed" startTime="3929.921" stopTime="3937.184">
    Justice Stanley Reed 
    Do this state case extended the privilege of the blood test cases make any effort to distinguish the fingerprint cases?
speaker="walter_r_kegel" startTime="3937.184" stopTime="4151.799">
    Mr. Walter R. Kegel 
    Most of them, Your Honor, that deny the -- the right to take the blood test while unconscious are of the same type was the Iowa case which counsel discussed. 
    They say, we're not going to permit it and if you want to know why, look at such and such or we believe that this is contrary to these great principles which we have long has espoused but don't -- significantly don't cite too many cases. 
    There are, I believe, more cases as far as case law is concerned on the side of permitting it. 
    Mr. Justice Douglas in his concurring opinion in -- in Rochin cited a great number of those cases together with cases on other subjects which -- of compulsion rather than blood test. 
    Well, it seems to me that question which we have here today is just as open as it was before Rochin was decided. 
    I don't think that Rochin controls the test as Justice Frankfurter stated in discussion that it is -- is not a new test. 
    It's a question of whether a right that's applied to a given factual situation is fundamental, is something in the words of Cardozo, implicit in the concept of ordered liberty, the test which go back to Palko verus Connecticut and Snyder versus Massachusetts. 
    And it's the contention of the State of New Mexico that when you take what is done here and compare it with certain rights which we've all considered to be rather fundamental rights which this Court has said are not embraced in the Fourteenth Amendment and are left to the states to decide, we feel that this right to be free from having blood withdrawn while unconscious and used in a trial involving intoxication to determine either guilt or innocence as the test may show, is not for example as fundamental as the right of trial by a jury. 
    And yet, the right of trial by jury is not guaranteed with the Fourteenth Amendment. 
    We say, also, it is -- it is not as fundamental as the right of testimonial, the freedom from testimonial self-incrimination, which likewise this Court has said, is not guaranteed. 
    We feel that in comparing these cases, which have gone through and said this is a right which is left to the states to determine and exercise their judgement. 
    But here, again, we have another situation which is in the same category. 
    We, likewise, feel that perhaps or at least we like to be that this case was the case that the Court was thinking of in the Rochin case where it exclusive cases involving modern Methergine devices for bringing wrongdoers to justice. 
    However, the state cases which have been decided since that time have been very split on whether that is the case that was being considered.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="4151.799" stopTime="4157.091">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    What is the status of this defendant now? 
    Is he in jail or does he serve his sentence?
speaker="walter_r_kegel" startTime="4157.091" stopTime="4352.161">
    Mr. Walter R. Kegel 
    Those are he's -- he's in the penitentiary at the present time. 
    He was released on parole during the pendency of -- of his petition. 
    His parole was revoked and he's back in the penitentiary now. 
    Of course, it's -- it's not ultimate authority to say that the large majority of state courts uphold this type of action. 
    As been pointed out by Mr. Justice Douglas, the majority of the California Highest Court approved the action in the Rochin case. 
    But if rights are fundamental or must be fundamental in order to be a part of due process, then the feeling of trial judges and appellate judges throughout the land as to whether those -- whether a certain fact to situations involved fundamental rights is certainly as much authority as a case because these judges, like any other court, are in contact with the people in our dispensing justice on a day to day basis. 
    And certainly, their feelings as to what is fundamental should govern to some extent. 
    We are not here to say that the end justifies the means but we do feel that it is important to point out that in this drunken driving cases, these are drunken driving alone or those involving deaths such as this one that the case of the drinking driver is the greatest problem without doubt of law enforcement in the United States today. 
    Both, as far as number of cases are concerned, and as far as the ultimate answer is concerned, the television night before last announced for example that the national safety counsel estimates that 4200 people will be killed in motor vehicle accidents this month alone. 
    And there are statistics which are published by that same body which indicate there are about one out of four of every fatal accidents, drinking is involved or the use of toxic. 
    That, of course, in and of itself is not an argument, but in these cases, the blood test is of great help, it's a great help in determining innocence as well as guilt. 
    And particularly, in this case, it does not -- it doesn't determine the basic matter of guilt any more than a finger print determines guilt in identification in a case involving identity or presence. 
    It proves the fact or disapproves if that's -- that's true.

    Mr. Walter R. Kegel 
    Unless it might be in the matter of its taking. 
    If it was taken by an accepted method, I don't believe it would make a better difference, Your Honor. 
    Now, certainly, we could go on and say that if he used the penknife and slashed his wrist and -- and caught it in a -- in a test tube that that would be brutal and it would be shocking and it would be beyond what he had any right to do. 
    But it seems to me that the matter of a lawful arrest also has a great deal to do with this. 
    We don't say that you can go down the street and stop every driver you see without any cause and record him to submit to a blood test. 
    I don't think that's right and I don't think it's anything which should be condoned by this or any other Court but in an instance as where there is enough evidence to permit the state to make a lawful arrest, then I believe that the blood test should be allowed.

    Mr. Walter R. Kegel 
    No, sir we have not but I -- I think I can say this that I know of no instance where such tests has been taken except by a doctor and some of those where they have no -- no medical facilities, they were doctors who were available for that purpose, the urinalysis test is used. 
    Of course, there again, running to the question of contamination but that's the matter which -- as a matter going to the weight of the evidence in the trial and certainly no one -- no one can be heard by -- from a physical standpoint. 
   
   
   
   Rebuttal of F. Gordon Shermack

    Mr. F. Gordon Shermack 
    If the Court please. 
    One or two points, Mr. Justice Harlan asked whether these tests were accepted medically in the part of the record which we had printed in, sometimes, I think, perhaps I should have had the whole thing credit. 
    I will get to the reason for that in a second. 
    It does indicate that there was, of course, cross-examination on the -- of the doctor although there was no evidence as to whether the thing was reliable other than it was done through cross-examination. 
    It does indicate that there are different standards, which are applied and further and this of course is explored to a considerable extent in law review articles and in that Journal of Criminology and criminal law. 
    There -- the -- there's this -- there's a tolerance, there's his own tolerance, their individual differences, of course, well that was raised on cross-examination and the doctor of course said sure some people are tolerant -- more tolerant than others. 
    And in this situation, the -- although this was not -- this of course is not our major -- our major point, I think, it -- it is something to be considered to whether these tests are reliable enough to be accepted by the Courts, they've been accepted by the state courts in some states, whether they are reliable or not, and if they are, why then of course next will be based with whether sodium pentothal, sodium Amytal, et cetera is also a reliable source of --

    Well that depends really on scientific acceptance, my understanding was that the -- is universal with scientific acceptance now with the reliability of blood tests to determine alcohol content not necessarily whether that alcohol content needs intoxication but rather but if there was any question about the test (Voice Overlap) --

    Mr. F. Gordon Shermack 
    Your Honor, there's one -- there's one article and I -- I don't have the -- I have actually gone into this for sometime and I did it in connection with another case. 
    I didn't feel it was of overwhelming -- overwhelming importance here. 
    There's one article in the journal of criminal law and criminology which indicates that this type of test and others that are employed is -- are not as satisfactory as this final puncture in order to get a true test of alcoholic content, in order to get the alcoholic content of the blood in the brain.

    Mr. F. Gordon Shermack 
    That is correct, but I mean that particular article says that merely taking it from the arms -- secondary evidence practically in that writer's viewpoint.

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    May I ask this, I understand now that -- there's been lot of discouragement of the practices smuggling diamonds by secreting them in bodily regions, the body orifices because they got some kind of machine now that as you pass through the isle, they can detect that you've done that. 
    And they move in and they extract the diamonds and then use them against the smuggler to convict him with smuggling. 
    Would that be within the -- the principle that you're urging on us today?

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Well, if the machine doesn't do it then they detect, as I understand it, that you secreted these things and then they extract them from your earlobe or wherever you might have them.
speaker="f_gordon_shermack" startTime="5156.214" stopTime="5179.541">
    Mr. F. Gordon Shermack 
    Well now, if a man walks into a prison with a gun concealed on his person and that is revealed through the usual devices there and the thing is taken from him and he's subsequently prosecuted for carrying a concealed weapon, I suppose he could raise some point there. 
    He's violated a couple of laws.

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Well, it's not your case anyway.
speaker="f_gordon_shermack" startTime="5202.806" stopTime="5285.888">
    Mr. F. Gordon Shermack 
    That's right. 
    The reason why I mentioned I wish I brought up the entire record is the Attorney General, both Mr. Robinson and his Assistant Mr. Kegel, have mentioned a legal arrest. 
    Well, first of all, I don't think it makes any difference whether there's illegal arrest in a situation like this. 
    If you have one that goes -- if you have a situation that is such that the evidence was secured in the -- a man's due process has been violated with differences and in the second place as far as I can recall from the record, there's nothing in there, one way or the other, to reveal that there was an arrest, that the man was of course unconscious that's shown by the parts of the record that had been printed, but there's nothing in -- and he was unconscious at the time he was picked up at the accident. 
    There's nothing to show an arrest that he was under arrest at the time of the taking of the blood. 
    As I indicated, I don't think that's important and there are one or two state cases that (Inaudible) on that. 
    But in this particular case, there was no -- there was no arrest at that time.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Shermack, it's our information that you have -- that this defendant is an indigent and that you have represented him without compensation through -- through the courts of your state and for that reason, the Court appointed you also to represent him in this -- in this Court. 
    That's a real public service and the Court is indebted to you for -- for what you have -- have done in the interest of the public welfare to see that an indigent is properly represented in Court. 
    And we thank you for it. 
    And Mr. Attorney General, that doesn't detract in the slightest from a great service you are rendering to the pubic service in what you have done. 
    You and your assistants have been very frank and very fair in this whole -- whole proceeding.
