    Mr. Thomas E. Stanton, Jr. 
    If the Court please. 
    This case presents the question as to whether the trustees of a collectively bargained multi-employer health and welfare trust funds have the right to collect under a Miller Act payment bond, contributions which a federal public works contractor agreed in a collective-bargaining agreement to make into the fund. 
    It comes to this Court by certiorari after a summary judgment was entered in the District Court against the trustees and in favor of the surety and after that judgment was affirmed by the Court of Appeals. 
    Each of the courts below held that petitioners do not have the right to recover because it would be necessary in order to give that right to use the words of the District Court to stretch the terms of the statute far beyond the limits of its objectives and purposes. 
    I think then to present this matter to the Court, I should start with the language of the statute, the pertinent portion of it, which is set forth in the appendix to our opening brief. 
    By that statute which is entitled an act for the protection of persons furnishing material and labor, for the construction, alteration or repair of said public buildings or public work, Section 1 (a) (2) provides that the contractor for public work having a value of $2000 or more shall provide a payment bond with a surety or sureties satisfactory to such officer for the protection of all persons supplying labor and material in the prosecution of the work provided for in the said contract for the use of each such person. 
    Section 2 (a) of the Act provides in pertinent part, "Every person who has furnished labor or material in the prosecution of the work provided for in such contract in respect to which a payment bond is furnished under this Act and who has not been paid in full therefore, before the expiration of a period of 90 days after the day on which the last of the labor was done or performed by him or material was furnished or supplied by him for which such claim is made, shall have the right to sue on such payment bond for the amount or the balance thereof unpaid at the time of institution of such suit and to prosecute said action to final execution and judgment for the sum or sums justly due him." 
    The courts below have emphasized certain of the literal language of that statute. 
    We wish to present to the Court the contentions that in order to meet the literal words of the statute, it is necessary to hold that we as trustees for the laborers are entitled to recover. 
    I emphasize the language that the bond is for the protection of those who have furnished labor. 
    As I will develop in my argument, contributions for which we sue are a part of the consideration agreed to be paid for the labor of the laborers who are entitled to the benefit of this fund. 
    And that in order to give them the protection that they are entitled under the statute, it is necessary to hold that these contributions are within the coverage of the payment bond. 
    I point further to the language of the second section which says, "Gives the right of action to anyone who has furnished labor and who has not been paid in full therefore." 
    And I emphasize to the Court that because of the nature of these contributions, as a part of the consideration for the labor being performed by the laborers on these public projects, the laborer has not been paid in full, unless the Court recognizes that the trustees or the laborer, who are the petitioners in this action, are entitled to the protection of the bond and the security of the bond for the payment of the portion of the laborer's consideration which has agreed -- in which the contractor agreed to pay into the fund.

speaker="thomas_e_stanton_jr" startTime="346.143" stopTime="659.312">
    Mr. Thomas E. Stanton, Jr. 
    Well, that -- in -- in the logical course of my argument just this day, I'll reach that. 
    This trust agreement which is Exhibit C to the statement of facts on which -- which appears at page 21 of the record is a pamphlet. 
    It's entitled a trust agreement for the laborers' health and welfare trust fund for Northern California. 
    It is dated March 4th, 1953 and it is between two chapters of the Associated General Contractors of America as employers in the Northern California District Council of Hod Carriers, Building and Construction Laborers of the International Hod Carriers, Building and Common Laborers' Union of America. 
    It recites -- recites the existence of certain collective-bargaining agreements between the employers and the union. 
    Those -- the existence of those collective-bargaining agreements is likewise alleged in the complaint and admitted on the stipulation on which the summary judgment was entered. 
    On page 2 of the document, the collective-bargaining agreements are further identified as being master agreements between the two agency chapters and the union which is the District Council of Laborers. 
    And at the end of the agreement, I further point out that those collective-bargaining agreements are identified as 46 Northern California Counties collective-bargaining agreements. 
    And the significance of that is that the agreements cover the entire 46 counties of Northern California, an area which is in excess in size of the entire New England States and one-half of the State of New York, an area which stretches 400 miles from the Oregon border to the northern border of Kern County. 
    The signatories to that agreement on behalf of the union is a Northern California District Council. 
    That Council is a council of individual labor unions which have territorial jurisdiction within the 46 counties, which have bonded themselves together for the purpose of dealing with the construction contractors. 
    The signatories for the employer are the Northern California Chapter of the Associated General Contractors of America and the Central California Chapter, the Associated General Contractors of America. 
    Those are associations of general contractors who have territorial jurisdiction corresponding to the territorial jurisdiction of the Laborers' District Council. 
    In other words, their jurisdiction for the employers stands over the 46 counties in Northern California. 
    Their membership is approximately 500 general contractors. 
    They performed by far the greater portion of the construction work that is performed in the northern counties of California and probably, with few if any exceptions, perform all of the major public work. 
    And they employ in doing that work, the vast majority of the laborers who are covered by the collective-bargaining agreements. 
    Your Honors will note on page 21 of this pamphlet that there is a list of signatory associations which identified by the names that they used, appear to be General Contractors Associations and Builder -- Builder Associations, which have membership throughout the 46 counties and who signed the collective-bargaining agreements, as well as signing this trust agreement. 
    They bring in within the scope of the collective-bargaining unit approximately a thousand or more contractors. 
    And then in the process of collective bargaining in this area, the Laborers' District Council makes individual agreements which are referred to in Article 9 of this trust agreement on page 19, whereby they affiliate with this bargaining unit individual contractors who are not members of the association by securing by -- of any of the signatory associations, by securing the individual signatures of the contractors to what are designated memorandum agreements. 
    They adopt for laborers employed by those contractors, the terms and conditions of the master agreement that is referred to in the trust agreement.

    Mr. Thomas E. Stanton, Jr. 
    I'm reading from the page 21 of the pamphlet, Your Honor, and I will get the reference in the transcript to the allegation but I simply direct the attention of the Court at this point to the fact that the Associated General Contract -- I mean, Home Builders of Sacramento appear as a signatory association to the trust agreement. 
    One, two, three, four names down on the left-hand side on page 21 and the allegation concerning the contractor's affiliation is at page 7 of the transcript where we allege that the Associated Home Builders of Sacramento of which defendant, Donald G. Carter, was at all times -- at all relevant times a member in good standing, signed said trust agreement and ratify and improved one of said collective-bargaining agreements for and on behalf of, and as the agent for the members of said association including defendant, Donald G. Carter, doing businesses for the construction company. 
    In other words, he was bound by virtue of his membership in an association which is a signatory association not only to the trust agreement but also to a collective-bargaining agreement which provided for the establishment of the trust and which provided for the payments into the trust. 
    And it is the obligation of Carter under that action on the part of his association binding into the collective-bargaining agreement that furnishes the basis for the suit that is -- has been filed by the trustees.

speaker="thomas_e_stanton_jr" startTime="878.654" stopTime="1019.206">
    Mr. Thomas E. Stanton, Jr. 
    Yes. 
    The provision is that contributions of the fund shall not constitute or be deemed to be wages due to the employees with respect to whose work such payments are made. 
    And I want to emphasize "with respect to whose work such payments are made" because that is significant. 
    We were not saying that they are not to be considered wages in a general sense. 
    We were saying that they were not to be deemed wages due to the individual whose work was involved and no employee shall be entitled to receive any part of the contributions made or required to be made to the fund in lieu of the benefits provided by the health and welfare plan. 
    Now, the significance of that provision, Your Honors, is that in order to set up this trust to provide health and welfare benefits of a very substantial nature, $2000 life insurance and additional $2000 for accident -- accidental death, complete -- practically complete hospitalization, medical and surgical treatment for the laborer and his dependents. 
    It was necessary to establish eligibility rules under which there would be some laborers who would perform work for which money would be paid into the fund but would not entitle the laborer to draw benefits, to have that coverage of the fund. 
    In other words, under the eligibility rules as pointed in the brief, established by the trustee, a laborer had to work 400 hours within a six-month period before he would be entitled to the benefits of the fund. 
    On the other hand, if he worked 600 hours or 800 hours during a six-month period, he got no more in benefits than the man who performed only 400 hours of work, so that you had at least two -- three categories of men. 
    You would have those who worked only 400 hours who have the minimum to qualify them. 
    You have the man who doesn't work 400 hours, who is not qualified during that particular six-month period. 
    And you have a man who works 800 hours, who you might say has had a sum which is more than necessary to provide him with the benefits that are provided in the fund.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="1019.206" stopTime="1019.671">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Yes.
speaker="thomas_e_stanton_jr" startTime="1019.671" stopTime="1129.208">
    Mr. Thomas E. Stanton, Jr. 
    But the way it has -- it operates is that the trustees pay a premium for the insurance that is provided. 
    That premium is an excess of the $80 a month, a -- a year that is paid in for the man who works the very minimum of 800 hours in a year or 400 hours in the six-month period. 
    But that increased benefit or ability to buy benefits comes from the man who works more than the minimum hours, it comes from the man that works less than the minimum hours. 
    But the great bulk of the laborers in this collective bargaining unit do get covered by the fund. 
    In other words, the eligibility rules are low enough so that every man with -- who's -- who's recently working in the industry gets a coverage and every -- and the trustee whole nature of the fund enables there to -- to be a fund which provides definite benefits to all the employees covered in the unit. 
    And its -- every man who works in that unit has the opportunity to acquire the benefits of those funds by working the 400 hours. 
    And the money that goes into his -- into this fund is the thing that makes this fund possible. 
    In other words, the 7 1/2 cents that was agreed to be paid into the fund by Carter along with the other contractors gets into that fund and it's the lifeline of the program. 
    Without it, it could not succeed.

    400 hours, yes.
speaker="thomas_e_stanton_jr" startTime="1158.468" stopTime="1334.615">
    Mr. Thomas E. Stanton, Jr. 
    -- 400 hours. 
    That's correct, Your Honor. 
    However, I don't say that the man does not have the benefit of the fund because the fund is established. 
    In order to have it established, to provide the substantial benefits that are provided and it -- was necessary in the judgment of the trustees to establish minimum work requirements. 
    And to my knowledge, every trust fund certainly in the health and in the construction industry does have minimum work requirements. 
    But the man who performs the labor, nevertheless, has the benefit of it because it's an established fund which he can -- by performing 400 hours of work, get the benefits of it. 
    And I want to point out to Your Honor that this is a matter of collective-bargaining under the statute, under the National Labor Relations Act with the Wagner Act which was enacted at the same time, same session the Miller Act was. 
    The employers are obligated under law to be with the Laborers District Council and with them alone. 
    In other words, this particular benefit being within the scope of collective bargaining has held by the Courts of Appeal, and this Court has denied certiorari, is one on which the contractor could not make an arrangement with his -- his own employees, the laborers. 
    His arrangement must be with the union. 
    Now, the union in order to establish a health and welfare fund that would be sound and workable in the construction industry with its casual type of employment. 
    In the exercise, we submit, of the authority which this Court has recognized in cases like Ford Motor Company against Huffman has determined that it is a proper matter to provide that the money of tens -- 7 1/2 cents per hour shall be paid into the fund, two trustees, who then, under the authority given in the trust agreement, can provide reasonable and nondiscriminatory eligibility rules under which it is possible that some laborers who do not work sufficient hours will not receive benefit. 
    But the great majority of the laborers within the unit are able to work the 400 hours and do receive the benefit. 
    And it's our position, as we've developed it in the brief, that the laborers union had the power to negotiate such agreement and that it did negotiate such an agreement and that is a part of such an agreement, it gave to the trustees the power to sue for and collect the contributions that are called for by the collective-bargaining agreement. 
    The contributions are not unrelated to the --

    Justice William O. Douglas 
    Well --
speaker="thomas_e_stanton_jr" startTime="1335.397" stopTime="1335.545">
    Mr. Thomas E. Stanton, Jr. 
    Yes, Your Honor.
speaker="william_o_douglas" startTime="1335.545" stopTime="1340.485">
    Justice William O. Douglas 
    Well -- well, that was the implied authority to them to sue and collect or --
speaker="thomas_e_stanton_jr" startTime="1340.485" stopTime="1464.429">
    Mr. Thomas E. Stanton, Jr. 
    It's expressed, Your Honor, in the trust agreement. 
    There is the provision of Section 3 of Article IV that the board of trustee shall have the power to demand and enforce the prompt payment of contributions to the fund. 
    I realize that the obligation to -- to make those payments rest in the collective-bargaining agreement. 
    The union has set in its negotiations with the employers and by its contract with the employers that such payments shall go to the trustees and that they shall have the power and authority to enforce these things. 
    And I want to bring out on other point which was emphasized by respondents in the lower court and which they -- that was -- were raised before Your Honors. 
    The man received the benefit of a contribution that was -- should be made under a collective-bargaining agreement even though the contribution is actually in default. 
    In other words, the man who worked on Carter's project received the benefit of the money that was due from Carter even though Carter to this date has not paid it. 
    For this reason, these are trustees by the collective-bargaining agreement. 
    They have been given the power and authority to enforce this portion of the collective-bargaining agreement, the obligation to pay into the fund. 
    And they consider that as trustees, it is their obligation to enforce it that they should enforce it as trustees for the laborers. 
    And that therefore, even though the man -- the money has not reached the fund, still, the contractual obligation that rest on the employer is sufficient to give the trustees the authority to give credit to the man for the hours that he worked under the collective-bargaining agreement.

    Mr. Thomas E. Stanton, Jr. 
    The Internal Revenue Code, there are -- and maybe that the Internal Revenue Code expressed that he excludes health and welfare contributions from wages in definition of the Act. 
    Certainly, the Social Security Act does. 
    It excludes from the definition of compensation the contributions of employers to health and welfare. 
    But as we point out in our reply brief, it's our position, that doesn't mean that they are not to be considered compensation for labor. 
    The very fact that Congress saw necessary -- deemed it necessary to exclude them by expressed terms. 
    In our view of the matter, argues very strongly that they are compensation for services and they are in a very broad sense -- sense wages because this -- the Courts of Appeal would have held that they are wages within the meaning of the National Labor Regulations Act.

    We -- we maintain that the trustees, by virtue of this collective-bargaining agreements, by virtue of the action that's been taken by the union and any employers, are in effect and in actual law, in fact, under the California decisions as a need of the laborers pro rata for this portion of their compensation. 
    And they are given by the trust agreement the authority to sue and we have alleged it in our complaint as -- which has been admitted in -- for the purposes of summary judgment that we sue in behalf of and as the representatives of the laborers.

    The condition of this obligation is such that whereas the principle entered into a certain contract with the Government numbered and dated as shown above and heard to attest.

speaker="richard_c_dinkelspiel" startTime="2176.310" stopTime="2259.441">
    Mr. Richard C. Dinkelspiel 
    Yes, Your Honor. 
    First of all, the Miller Act itself provides that the -- a bond shall be furnished to protect persons performing labor in connection with the government contracts. 
    And the cases that we have cited indicate that that is a strict requirement. 
    In other words, the person who is protected under the Miller Act is the laborer or material man, the person who performs work -- connected with the government contract. 
    Now, that's further backed up under the Davis-Bacon Act which is conceded to be written in because if payment is not made and the -- and amounts are withheld from the contract price, the laborer may apply to the Comptroller General to pay him his unpaid wages and they used the term “wages” so that the person who is entitled to sue is an issue in this action. 
    And as we pointed out in our briefs, by no stretch of the imagination can the trustees of a health and welfare fund redeem to be persons who performed labor in connection with the government contract?
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2259.441" stopTime="2272.803">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    No, but the second part that I'd like to have light shed on. 
    That may be so and yet he may, either the trustee or an assignee sue for the person who could support himself.

    Now --

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    What I want to know is indulgent sense.Would it make any difference if this were as I suggested a minute ago, a class suit on behalf of the specific laborer to work on this project.
speaker="richard_c_dinkelspiel" startTime="2289.053" stopTime="2300.245">
    Mr. Richard C. Dinkelspiel 
    The answer to the first question is that if the trustees are not suing on behalf of or as a class suit, they are simply suing here as trustees of a health and welfare fund.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2300.245" stopTime="2347.732">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Well, I have -- I have made myself interested to this. 
    I'm not -- I put to one side for the moment whether in fact there was an implied assignment. 
    I'm putting to that to one side. 
    I'm asking you whether if the trustees were out of it altogether. 
    John Doe, one of the fellows who worked on this project sued on behalf of himself and all the other (Inaudible) and that -- who worked on the project. 
    Would there be any difference in the amount of recovery in such a clear-cut conventional classes and what is sought for him by the trustees, not suing as a class suit but is suing trustees under the trust agreement?
speaker="richard_c_dinkelspiel" startTime="2347.732" stopTime="2348.676">
    Mr. Richard C. Dinkelspiel 
    Yes, there would be a difference, Your Honor.

    That has found that but if he --
speaker="richard_c_dinkelspiel" startTime="2350.512" stopTime="2412.718">
    Mr. Richard C. Dinkelspiel 
    Yes, because first of all, it would be in my reading of the trust agreement, "No right in the individual laborer to bring such an action for unpaid employer contributions, which are the subject of this suit." 
    In other words, the trust agreement itself specifically provides that the individual employee has no right, title or interest in any of the contributions. 
    It specifically provides in the trust agreement itself that these contributions are not wages. 
    It specifically provides that the contributions are not part of wages, and furthermore, that the only right that the individual employee may have is in any -- the benefits of any insurance purchased with the contributions so that the individual employee, I cannot see, would have any standing to sue for the unpaid contribution, if it were not made.

    Mr. Richard C. Dinkelspiel 
    The trustees of the health and welfare fund very definitely have the right to sue the contractor. 
    There is a debtor-creditor relationship between them and the -- or a contractual obligation between the contractor and the health and welfare fund.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2445.235" stopTime="2452.243">

    Yes, the bond must be given to provide that people or persons who have furnished labor as provided in the construction agreement will be paid in full. 
    And it is our contention that under the expressed wording of the construction contract, the full amount of the wages provided by that contract has been paid and it was so -- it is so conceited by the petitioners. 
    We have paid or Carter paid these employees their wages in full without deduction. 
    No, there is nothing unpaid under the construction contract to any laborer.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    The agreement came later than the surety bond. 
    Isn't it relevant -- isn't the Ford case which I deem to one respect irrelevant to the statute argument, relevant? 
    It is the -- that the terms of the Miller Act for the protection of all persons supplying labor and materials in the prosecution of the words. 
    If the person supplying labor and the material a part of the union which has -- will then secure certain terms with the supply of their laborers aren't almost done, which my brother Harlan a minute called -- a minute ago called the fringe benefits. 
    If they are the arrangements made between the union speaking for the men who supply the laborer and the contractor -- we'll get in a moment to the collective agreement. 
    Doesn't that -- isn't that to be read into provision of one or two?
speaker="richard_c_dinkelspiel" startTime="2742.670" stopTime="2795.750">
    Mr. Richard C. Dinkelspiel 
    I think that the answer to that is two-fold. 
    I think that the -- that the collective-bargaining agreement which has set forth generally the terms and conditions of the employment in the industry certainly binds the employer to that if he is a signatory to the agreement. 
    But that does not -- you can't jump from that immediately to say that then the surety on the Miller Act bond guarantees full performance of that collective-bargaining agreement. 
    It will -- it ensures that the employer will perform those parts of the agreement which he's agreed within the construction contract to pay, namely, the wages at the rate prescribed by the Secretary of Labor.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2795.750" stopTime="2806.760">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Because the bond -- because the bond may have it all for the voluntarily assumption of obligation but you say it doesn't, as a matter of law, cover anything except the terms of the contract agreement.

    Mr. Richard C. Dinkelspiel 
    The contribution was measured by the hours of labor. 
    That was a yardstick, and I think the petitioners must concede that it had to be a yardstick only as a convenient means of measuring what the contribution of the employer would be to the welfare fund. 
    Now, it could have been any other yardstick. 
    It could have been a flat sum or employer. 
    It could have been a flat sum per employee but it was not.

speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2942.525" stopTime="2962.523">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well then, if it -- if it was based upon the labor that these men performed, would it not come within Section 2 (a) which says, “Every person who has furnished labor in respect of which a payment bond is furnished and who has not been paid in full therefore shall have the right?”
speaker="richard_c_dinkelspiel" startTime="2962.523" stopTime="3012.943">
    Mr. Richard C. Dinkelspiel 
    Not necessarily because as we pointed out in our brief, these men working in the industry might not receive ultimately any -- any benefit from these contributions. 
    In other words, unless they worked for 400 hours in the employment, they would not be entitled to any benefits under the health and welfare plan. 
    So that the -- while the contribution required to be made into the fund might have been measured by the hours worked. 
    There was no direct benefit to the employee and I --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3012.943" stopTime="3017.993">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    If they had become injured on the job, they would have received benefits, would they not?

    Mr. Richard C. Dinkelspiel 
    No, not necessarily.

    Well, no -- and well, suppose they had some of the things -- some of the eventualities that -- that this fund was set up for, occurred while they were working.

    Mr. Richard C. Dinkelspiel 
    Now -- and interestingly enough, those rules are set up by the trustees. 
    They're not prescribed by the trust agreement. 
    In other words, those rules were subject to change at the whim of the trustees. 
    So that while a trust fund was -- was set up here and contributions were being made into the fund, the amount that the labor might receive back was a very nebulous thing. 
    It governs somewhat at the whim, I would say, in reading the agreement of the trustees and the rules they might set up.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3081.710" stopTime="3112.343">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    And does the fact that they don't -- most of them would not get any benefits because the eventualities wouldn't arise, mean that they had not received any benefits from that agreement? 
    A lot of us carry insurance all our lives and -- and we were happy that we -- that we haven't received any benefits from them but that is monetary benefits. 
    But certainly, it's been a benefit to us to have that protection, isn't it?

speaker="richard_c_dinkelspiel" startTime="3117.981" stopTime="3164.937">
    Mr. Richard C. Dinkelspiel 
    That would be the same. 
    Of course, the same reasoning that we have in the Workmen's Compensation Act. 
    In other words, the -- the protection of a workman's compensation policy is a condition of employment. 
    That is a protection to the employee. 
    And yet, the surety under a Miller Act bond is not liable for the payment of a -- of a workmen's compensation premium under the cases that we have cited. 
    Now, I mean -- what I'm trying to say is that there is a limited obligation of the surety regardless of the fact that all of these matters may have been -- be of indirect benefit to the employee.

    Now, I think some issue has been made of the fact that these payments may have constituted wages or into the -- or consideration for labor. 
    I think the -- actually, the agreement itself provides otherwise and it very carefully provides otherwise. 
    As a matter of fact, petitioners had conceded that in their brief that they had to very carefully provide that the employer contributions would not be deemed to be wages because of the difficulties they would run into under the California Labor Code and into California Insurance Code and the anti-kickback law.

    Mr. Richard C. Dinkelspiel 
    The contribution is based on the hours worked by the employee. 
    But again, the -- if any contribution or if any benefit be received by the employee, it has no relation to the government job on which he may have worked here. 
    His eligibility is determined by the rules of the trustee which at this time I happened to be that he worked for 400 hours. 
    If he worked for 399 hours, he had no -- no right in the fund. 
    Now -- but assuming -- assuming without conceding that this was consideration for labor were somewhat in the position of the cases involved in the withholding taxes where there were actual deductions from wages which the contractor did not in turn pay over the Government. 
    Now, the Courts there held that the test was whether or not -- had the employer -- employee himself had been pay it in full. 
    That was the ultimate test had the employee himself had been paid in full. 
    If he had, the condition of the Miller Act had been satisfied and the surety was not liable for the contributions or the deductions from wages which the contractor has not paid over into the Government.

    The difference here is that in the case we have at the present case, he has no vested interest in the $10. 
    He has no right to sue for the $10. 
    He agrees. 
    Now, he can't sue for the $10. 
    He has no right, title or interest in the $10. 
    And whereas I think in the case that you posed, the money would be held expressly in trust for him.

    But that is an entirely different -- it's an entirely different state of facts than there are present here. 
    And further than that, the -- in the present case, his entitlement to benefits is not measured by the amount of the employer's contributions but by the number of hours worked, whether or not he complies with the requirements that are set up by the trustees of the fund. 
    He has no vested interest in the -- or no interest at all in those contributions.

    He is interested to the extent that provided, he comply with the requirements and rules set up by the trustees. 
    He may then participate in certain benefits but he has no interest in the moneys that are contributed into the fund.

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    What he's done realistically, I suppose, is to agree that the agreement made that in addition to his wages while he's there, that's covered and will pay a certain amount into a fund which he hopes he will get something out of in the future.

    Mr. Richard C. Dinkelspiel 
    That's about it realistically. 
    Thank you, Your Honors.
