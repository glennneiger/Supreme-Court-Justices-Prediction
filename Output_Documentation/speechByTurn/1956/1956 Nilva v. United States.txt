    Mr. Richard J. Blanchard 
    May it please the Court. 
    With the Court's permission, I would like to make a brief review of the facts of this case. 
    In 1953, petitioner, Mr. Christianson and Mr. Paster were indicted and tried for the crime of conspiring to violate the Johnson Act, which prohibits the interstate shipment of gambling devices. 
    As a result of that trial, petitioner was acquitted. 
    The jury disagreed as to Mr. Christianson and Mr. Paster. 
    The following year, the Government retried the case against Mr. Christianson and Mr. Paster. 
    In preparing for the retrial of the Christianson case, the Government procured the issuance of subpoena duces tecum No. 160. 
    That subpoena was issued on March the 25th, returnable March the 29th, the date set for the beginning of the Christianson retrial. 
    On March the 29th, Mr. Paster moved to quash the subpoena. 
    The motion was denied and the District Judge Vogel issued an order compelling the Mayflower Distributing Company to whom the subpoena had been directed to forthwith comply. 
    On April the 1st, Mayflower Distributing Company purported to comply with the subpoena through petitioner, the vice president of Mayflower. 
    At a hearing in judge's chambers on the return of subpoena 160, petitioner was put under oath and testified concerning the return. 
    The Court, dissatisfied with his testimony, issued an impounding order directing the Marshal of North Dakota to impound the records of Mayflower Distributing Company in St. Paul. 
    That order was issued and the records were impounded. 
    The Christianson retrial proceeded to a conclusion. 
    A determination of the Christianson retrial, the Court sua sponte issued an order to show cause why petitioner should not be cited for contempt and set forth three specifications. 
    Specification 1, charged him with contempt for false and evasive testimony. 
    Specification 2, charged him with contempt in disobedience of another subpoena, subpoena 78 and specification 3, charged contempt in disobedience of subpoena No. 160. 
    The show cause order was issued April 23rd. 
    It was set down for a hearing on April 27th. 
    On the morning of April 27th, petitioner asked for an extension of time which was granted until 3 o'clock that afternoon. 
    At termination of the afternoon hearing, the Court found petitioner guilty of contempt on all three specifications and sentenced him to one year and a day. 
    Petitioner took an appeal to the Eighth Circuit. 
    While the case was pending in the Eighth Circuit, the Government filed a supplemental record. 
    That supplemental record was discussed at great length last Thursday. 
    The supplemental record is the last half of the record now before this Court. 
    It consists of 68 pages. 
    Page 69 in the supplemental record, the last half of the record before this Court, is a motion of appellant to strike certain portions of the supplementary record. 
    Now, this supplementary record involves the indictment.

speaker="richard_j_blanchard" startTime="289.377" stopTime="414.644">
    Mr. Richard J. Blanchard 
    It's the last half of the record, Your Honor. 
    The pagination begins with one at the beginning and repeats with one in the middle. 
    This supplemental record involves the indictment against Christianson, Paster, and petitioner. 
    It involves a modified indictment, carries the motion to quash the subpoenas filed by Paster at the beginning of the Christianson retrial. 
    It carries excerpts of some of the testimony given in the Christianson retrial. 
    It has also the -- the Marshal's receipt given to Mayflower Distributing Company for the documents impounded from Mayflower Distributing Company. 
    It involves the memorandum opinion of the trial court on the contempt hearing, and it involves a list of the witnesses or -- correction, Your Honor. 
    It involves a list of the exhibits introduced by petitioner at the contempt hearing. 
    Petitioner in his motion to strike certain portions of this supplementary record before the Court of Appeals took no objection to the inclusion of the memorandum opinion of Judge Vogel nor did he take objection to the list of exhibits which he had introduced during the contempt hearing. 
    The Government does not undertake to support the other elements in the supplemental record and does not believe they are germane to this case. 
    The Government doesn't care to support specification No.1, that is the specification charging contempt in that petitioner --

    Yes, Your Honor.

    Mr. Richard J. Blanchard 
    That's right, Your Honor. 
    In specification No.1, charging contempt in that petitioner gave false and evasive testimony the obstructing the administration of justice, the Government believes that this specification is controlled by In re Michael decided by this Court, 326 U.S.224. 
    There is nothing in the record as it appears before this Court to indicate that the obstruction of justice arose from the false and evasive testimony rather it appears that it arose from the non-production. 
    Even if it did arise from the false and evasive testimony, the Government doesn't believe that the testimony of petitioner was adequately falsified or proved to be false by reliance upon the testimony of F.B.I. Agent Peterson, who testified during the Christianson retrial.

speaker="richard_j_blanchard" startTime="528.306" stopTime="571.639">
    Mr. Richard J. Blanchard 
    The Government doesn't believe that -- the testimony of petitioner which is alleged to be false is proved to be false either by the presentation of the impounded records in Court or by the testimony of F.B.I. Agent Peterson who testified in the Christianson retrial. 
    To use Agent Peterson's testimony, to establish the falsity of petitioner's testimony, would deprive petitioner of an opportunity to cross-examine the F.B.I. agent on the issue of the truth or falsity of his testimony. 
    For that reason, the Government doesn't care to support specification No.1. 
    Specification --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="571.639" stopTime="574.045">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    And that -- that doesn't flow into 3.

speaker="richard_j_blanchard" startTime="582.143" stopTime="620.674">
    Mr. Richard J. Blanchard 
    It doesn't flow over 3 for this reason. 
    Judge Vogel, who tried the contempt proceeding, heard the Christianson retrial. 
    Now, as Your Honor mentioned in Thursday, he does have the advantage of knowing all of the facts.He had heard Peterson's testimony in the original. 
    The introduction of Peterson's testimony during the contempt proceeding was nothing new to the judge. 
    It could not have prejudiced him in his view of the case. 
    At least we don't feel that it could.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="620.674" stopTime="624.848">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    How can we know?
speaker="richard_j_blanchard" startTime="624.848" stopTime="625.214">
    Mr. Richard J. Blanchard 
    Only --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="625.214" stopTime="630.965">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    It's by (Inaudible) to the judge, the highest relevance, as I suppose, (Inaudible) to judge, isn't that it?
speaker="richard_j_blanchard" startTime="630.965" stopTime="934.753">
    Mr. Richard J. Blanchard 
    Yes, Your Honor. 
    Now, the only judges who may have been influenced by Peterson's testimony were the Court of Appeals who saw it for the first time. 
    But the Court of Appeals, in its opinion, set forth from the supplemental record on page 76 viewed the testimony of Agent Peterson as indicating the falsity of Nilva's testimony, which would indicate that they correlated the F.B.I. agent's testimony to specification No.1. 
    There's no reference made to correlating it to specification 3 other than the broad statement on page 79 of the supplemental record in which they say that there is no reason why, under the circumstances here presented, Peterson's testimony was not equally admissible as a summarization of voluminous records in both the Christianson case and the contempt proceedings. 
    Well, the Government doesn't support that allegation -- that statement, Your Honor.Specification No.2 charged petitioner with contempt and that he was disobedient of subpoena 78. 
    This subpoena 78 was directed to the Mayflower Distributing Company and required the production of records pertaining to 16 different accounts that the Mayflower Distributing Company had with its customers. 
    Specification No.2 charges petitioner in failing to produce five specific items, two ledger sheets and three invoices pertaining to accounts with Mr. Sandy and Mr. Bater. 
    In order to establish a contempt against petitioner, it would be incumbent upon the Government to prove the issuance and service of the subpoena the failure to comply and the existence of the documents at the time the subpoena was served. 
    There is nothing in this record which would indicate that the records called for or mentioned in specification No.2 were actually in existence at the time subpoena 78 was served. 
    But if we may revert to -- advert to the supplemental record for one moment, it appears from the supplemental record that the testimony of James Christianson, a bookkeeper for the Mayflower Distributing Company indicates clearly there is a strong possibility that those records were actually destroyed and were nonexistence when subpoena 78 was served. 
    For that reason, the Government does not care to support the conviction on specification 2. 
    The Government does believe that the specification 3 charges a contempt and a conviction can be supported on that specification alone. 
    Subpoena 160, which underlies specification 3, is set forth in the record on page 24 and 25. 
    It clearly -- it is addressed to the Mayflower Distributing Company. 
    It clearly calls for invoices, bills, checks, slips, papers, records, letters, and ledger sheets among others. 
    It is limited to a period from July the 1st, 1950 through April 30th, 1951. 
    It reflects -- those papers are the reflect purchases, sales and trades of slot machines, flat-top or console, coin-operated device, whether new or used. 
    It is the used records that gave rise to this contempt proceeding. 
    Subpoena 160 was served upon Mayflower Distributing Company in March the 25th. 
    It was delivered to the Secretary Walter Johnson. 
    It called for a return March the 29th, the day the Christianson retrial began. 
    On that day, Mr. Paster, president of Mayflower move to quash. 
    The motion was overruled. 
    The Court issued a forthwith order to comply with the subpoena and compliance was had or purported to be had on April the 1st in the judges' chambers. 
    The proceedings relative to the April 1st hearing are set forth on page 28 and 4 of the record, correction, Your Honor, page 5 of the record.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Yes.

    Mr. Richard J. Blanchard 
    Government counsel pointed out to the Court that the only records petitioner had turned over in compliance with the subpoena were records dealing with the purchase of new machines. 
    Petitioner's counsel said there were other records. 
    This is on page 6 of the record, "With relation to the use of secondhand machines, inventories were made of those machines and were furnished to the Attorney General." 
    Now, the inventories of used slot machines furnished to the Attorney General were made under the Johnson Act. 
    The Johnson Act became effective January 2nd, 1951 and returns, commenced in July the 1st, 1951. 
    Government counsel pointed out that the inventories which were furnished to the Attorney General would be inventories of used machines as of July. 
    That is on page 7 of the record. 
    Petitioner said that they had only compiled records of used slot machines. 
    There are no records of any other kind. 
    This is on page 7. 
    I brought them all down. 
    I got everything we had. 
    On page 8, he again repeated. 
    He brought all of the records that he has of the compiled nature of used machines. 
    When Government counsel questioned the use of the word “compiled”, petitioner said, "There was nothing other than what appears in the records that you have at the present time before this Court." 
    Government counsel dissatisfied with this return asked the petitioner be put under oath, which was done. 
    On page 9 of the record, government counsel asked petitioner if the records of the Mayflower Distributing Company Incorporated showed the purchase of secondhand slot machines during the month of January 1951, to which petitioner answered, "The records with reference to that matter have all been subpoenaed and are in evidence in the appellate court." 
    Now, that has reference -- that reference of the appellate court pertains to another case, Nilva versus United States, a Samuel Nilva. 
    Petitioner here is Allen Nilva. 
    That case is reported at 212 F.2d 115. 
    When government counsel again repeated the same question concerning the records of Mayflower reflecting slot machines, petitioner answered, "Well, I don't know. 
    I can't state whether they do or do not. 
    If there were any records, I know that the records were subpoenaed." 
    That raises a doubt as to whether it remained subpoenaed in this case or that they were subpoenaed in the original Nilva. 
    I think it's quite --
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="1186.711" stopTime="1187.809">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Where are you reading this at?
speaker="richard_j_blanchard" startTime="1187.809" stopTime="1444.705">
    Mr. Richard J. Blanchard 
    On page 10, Your Honor, the eighth line from the bottom. 
    I think it's quite plausible to interpret that as meaning that petitioner knew that records of secondhand slot machines purchased in January were called for by subpoena No.160, issued in this case, although there's still room to view it as pertaining to the other Nilva situation. 
    Following a colloquy between counsel and attorneys and the Court, Mr. Dibble, the government counsel again repeated the question, “Is there any record in the Mayflower Distributing Incorporation today?" 
    This is on page 15. 
    In their possession today, which would reflect the purchase of secondhand coin machines, slot machines during a month of February 1951 to which petitioner answered, "I have made a thorough search to the best of my ability.” 
    And he concluded, "Had been unable to find any records of any purchase in the month of March or when corrected, in the month of February.” 
    When asked specifically about the records of March 1951, he said, "There are no records." 
    On page 16, when pushed further he said, “I have been unable to find the records you refer to. 
    There are no records, whatsoever.” 
    Government counsel then interrogated him, "Did you examine your daily ledger sheet for the months of January, February, March, April of 1951?" 
    To which petitioner answered "The daily ledger? 
    I am not sure whether we examined the daily ledger," which would appear to be the basic book of any corporate enterprise. 
    In the middle of page 17, he states that he checked all incoming invoices, all outgoing invoices that we had, all our checks, all. 
    Well, everything that had anything to do with the purchase as well as anything that had anything to do with the sales, and they're still speaking of used slot machines. 
    Now, on page 20, when government counsel rephrased his question and instead of speaking of the records of Mayflower as showing the purchases, he put it in terms of money. 
    He said, "If I had sold you five machines during the month of January in 1951 and came to you and told you that you hadn't paid me for all of those, do you have any records that will show to the contrary in the Mayflower Distributing Company?" 
    To which petitioner answered, "I believe that we'd have that record on your account just like Bally. 
    Bally sold those machines, that's why it was easy to find any matter relating to Bally or United because we dealt with them consistently. 
    We have the records of their running accounts and it's easy to find out. 
    I presume that would be easy." 
    It was then the government counsel announced that those were the records the subpoena called for. 
    On page 28 of the record is a transcript to the proceedings before the Court in a contempt proceeding. 
    The show cause order has discharged in specification 3 that petitioner had failed to produce a long series of items. 
    I will focus my attention only on items A, B, C and D, the general ledger of 1950, the general ledger of 1951, the journal of 1950 and 1951, and the check register of 1950 and 1951. 
    This show cause order issued April 23rd came on for hearing April 27th. 
    The Court opened by saying that the burden was upon petitioner to proceed. 
    That we understand to mean the burden of going forward with the case.

    I believe that took him three days to examine all of the records of Mayflower with the assistance of an agent, make the selection they needed, give a receipt to Mayflower, and transport the required documents back to Bismarck, North Dakota. 
    Those records, which were in Court, as I understand it, occupied one of these mail hand trucks, that many of them but we're concerned only with the first four items in specification 3. 
    Government counsel, on page 33, was careful to point out at this time that this entire contempt proceeding was instituted by the Court on its own motion and not by the Government filing an application. 
    When the proceeding began that afternoon, Mr. -- the petitioner took the stand, examined by his own counsel and on page 46 and 47 of the record, it's indicated that petitioner's counsel handed him Exhibit 1, which was the general ledger of the Mayflower Distributing Company. 
    The petitioner identified it. 
    He handed him Exhibit 2, which was the general ledger for 1951 of the Mayflower Distributing Company and he identified it. 
    When he got to -- to Exhibit No. 3 and asked whether he had examined Exhibit No. 3, petitioner answered, "Yes, sir, I have examined this record." 
    Now, this is on page 47. 
    "Yes, sir, I have examined this record as well as the others and from my examination -- no, let me say, I examined those two records -- those other two records previously and was unable to find any evidence of slot machines." 
    The other two records refer to Exhibits 1 and 2, the general ledgers for 1950 and 1951. 
    The word previously taken in the context involved petitioner's testimony as it appears on page 48, 49, 50, and 51 indicates that he is referring to April 1st, 1954. 
    He examined general ledgers for 1950 and 1951 prior to April the 1st, prior to the return date on the subpoena. 
    It is his failure to produce these four items, particular items of the general ledgers, the journal and the check register on April the 1st which he admits handling that is the gist of this contempt citation. 
    We believe the record shows that petitioner acted willfully, both from his testimony at the April 1st hearing and from his testimony during the contempt hearing. 
    In a contempt citation for noncompliance with a subpoena duces tecum, the burden is upon the defendant, the respondent to the subpoena to establish an adequate excuse for noncompliance. 
    It must be a legally sufficient excuse. 
    Mere statements that he looked and couldn't find the records demanded that he didn't know there were such records are not compelling upon any court. 
    In Lopiparo versus United States, the Eighth Circuit refused to accept those statements. 
    It put the burden squarely upon the Court to prove the adequacy of the excuse for non-production.

    On the April 1 return date, the Court was dissatisfied with the return made and then issued the impounding order. 
    The impounding order was executed by the United States Marshal following April the 1st. 
    I think it was the second or third that they put him on. 
    The petitioner --

    Petitioner before this Court last Thursday stated that there was no objection imposed in this case at this time to the breadth of the subpoena. 
    I think it's significant to know that petitioner, during April the 1st testimony, stated that he did not examine the daily ledger.

    It would in pointing out the fact that Peterson's testimony was not germane to specification 3. 
    It didn't prejudice the trial court unless we wouldn't assume that it would prejudice the trial court who had heard the testimony in its original forms. 
    Petitioner made an argument that he should not be held in contempt because he was only vice president and not familiar with the accounting principles of the Mayflower Distributing Company. 
    We believe that that answer, that contention has been adequately answered by this Court in the White, the Fleischman, and the Wilson cases in which it is held proper to address a subpoena duces tecum to a corporation and impose a burden upon the officers to make a return thereof. 
    In this instance, petitioner, however knowledgeable he was of accounting or corporate procedures, did submit himself to the Court, did assume the responsibility of making this return.If he is not held fully accountable -- accountable for compliance with this subpoena which he has attempted to answer, it would be open a door to easy evasion to any subpoena. 
    Take the least informed man in the corporation and have him make the return, he also makes the objection that there was not adequate time given to him to prepare his defense. 
    Subpoena No. 160 was issued March the 22nd and served March the 25th. 
    He testifies that he examined it shortly after it was served upon the Secretary, Walter Johnson, of the Mayflower Distributing Company. 
    He conducted a search for the documents. 
    Walter Johnson then went on to North Dakota to testify to be present on March the 29th when the argument was held upon the motion to quash and then he called the petitioner to collect the documents and bring them on to North Dakota.

    The best you can do in this circumstance is that there was one general transaction of petitioner in relation to the Court, a general disobedience or noncompliance with the subpoenas.

    Mr. Richard J. Blanchard 
    Yes but, if I may be permitted to add on this point, Your Honor's position is that at the dicta in the Gompers case that when a general verdict is returned upon several counts, it is presumed that some of the sentence is imposed upon each count. 
    However, position of this Court in Whitfield versus Ohio where a general sentence was imposed upon two counts and the Court questioned the validity of one count and threw it out, they still did not disturb the basic sentence. 
    And on the Whitfield case, that was tried to the Court.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2595.594" stopTime="2598.266">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Is that a state case?

    Mr. Richard J. Blanchard 
    That was Whitfield versus Ohio involved prison-made goods, prohibition -- Ohio's prohibition of sale of prison-made goods. 
    The cases relied upon petitioner Stromberg and Williams are inapposite here because in that situation, the case was submitted to the jury upon two general theories, one of which was valid and the other, invalid. 
    It was impossible to tell from the general verdict as distinguishing the general sentence upon which theory of the case the verdict rested. 
    Therefore, the Court properly remanded the case for retrial, but here, we have a valid conviction on specification 3. 
    We had a general sentence of the year and a day and we believe that it can be sustained.However, if the Court deems otherwise, we further contend that the only relief petitioner is entitled to is a remand for resentencing and not for retrial on specification 3.

    Mr. Eugene Gressman 
    I would just like to add a few comments to what I had in my remarks last Thursday. 
    It seems that the Government has now retreated even further from the position it took in its briefs and has orally announced that it no longer seeks to support any part of the third specification, except as to the two or possibly four. 
    I wasn't exactly clear with the number of items, the first -- few items in specification No. 3, thereby abandoning some 18 or more of the items which are set forth in specification No. 3. 
    Considering that there was no adequate proof apparently that -- that those items were in existence. 
    Now, I would also add one other item.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    May I ask you before you move on? 
    I can see no legal difficulty involved. 
    I'm not talking about this one. 
    I can see no legal difficulty in sustaining a specification which lists 10 or 12 items, 12 items that can make proof of only three of the 12. 
    I see no difficulty in concluding that there was less specification sustained. 
    In other words, the Government must have sustained every subdivision in specification 3 --

    I'm not clear about that, Your Honor, if -- if it is true, it must be in the record but I'm not -- at the moment, I'm not familiar with that fact. 
    But at least, Your Honor, it seems to me that these list of exhibits in page 51 of the supplemental record, if taken as true or stipulated to, does not confirm the fact that the items mentioned in those ledgers were what -- were relevant under subpoena No. 160. 
    Now, you have these conflicting statements by the defendant himself during the testimony that they did not name any evidence of slot machines. 
    And so, if -- if you have -- it seems to me a clear conflict there between his statements and this itemization in the listing and that -- that clearly put into issue this very question of the relevance of these exhibits, of these two or three exhibits to subpoena No. 160. 
    And if you're going to refer to the basic standard of proof in these cases, namely, that you prove guilt beyond all reasonable doubt, it seems to me that you cannot affirm a conviction which is based upon such a conflicting testimony on the basic question of contempt.

    Mr. Eugene Gressman

    Well, now, Your Honor, of course it's -- it's still a question as to what is meant by slot machines. 
    I mean, that's a -- not a term of art particularly. 
    It's -- it's a generic term which may require some elaborations as to what is meant by that in relation to whether the -- the matters in this exhibit were really slot machines or exactly what they were. 
    I think it's -- the matter was put into issue by the defendant and I think it requires elaboration and it points up what I think is the basic issue in this case and that is the reliance on the knowledge of Judge Vogel in -- as a substitute for proof of contempt beyond a reasonable doubt. 
    And you have not only this, but you have an entire absence in this record of the order of March 29 issued by Judge Vogel, which is also one of the basic elements of this third specification which never appears in the record. 
    I have searched from beginning to end of both the supplemental and the regular record, and I have never found any identification or indication of what that March 29 order reads or provides. 
    And yet, that is one of the reasons upon which this petitioner was found guilty of contempt under the third specification. 
    And that this is entire general approach to the case which I believe requires condemnation, this reliance upon the judge's knowledge of the case rather than insisting.

    Mr. Eugene Gressman 
    That's right, but it's knowledge about these -- these particular items that he may have acquired during the course of the previous trial or during the -- which knowledge was not thrust upon the defendant in the nature of proper testimony or evidence so that he could refute or rebut or examine as he saw fit and to take these particular items to -- so he could know what the Government's contention or the Court's contention was as to their existence or more particularly as to their relevance under the -- under the case, under the subpoena.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="4032.336" stopTime="4055.443">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    I don't understand that. 
    The subpoena gave them the scope of the area within which he was asked to produce things. 
    The specification gives him bill of particulars as to the failure to produce, either than that, give him more of a notice and all of these connections that he wants to which the director's testimony.
speaker="eugene_gressman" startTime="4055.443" stopTime="4104.658">
    Mr. Eugene Gressman 
    Well, Your Honor, it was a very broad -- a very exhaustive specification to begin with. 
    And there were thousands of documents to be examined and to relate to -- to attempt to relate to the subpoena and more particularly the ones in the specifications. 
    And it seems to me that upon such short notice and I deny the Government's contention that he had from April 1 to prepare for this case. 
    It wasn't until April 23rd that he knew for the first time what the specifications of contempt that the judge was citing him for, and he had only that short weekend within a new attorney coming in on the case. 
    He never had a fulltime attorney previously to that to familiarize himself with this case.

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Mr. Gressman, may I ask you this? 
    Are you suggesting something like this that the judge knew because he presided at the second Christianson trial? 
    That after the subpoena did not produce certain documents, when the -- all documents were impounded, documents were found among Mayflowers records which where in fact used by the Government in its case against Christianson and that from that fact, the judge may well have concluded that there had been a disobedience of the subpoena because the records did exist because he had seen them. 
    They were produced to trial against Christianson.
speaker="eugene_gressman" startTime="4150.287" stopTime="4150.692">
    Mr. Eugene Gressman

    Is that what you're getting at?

    Mr. Eugene Gressman

speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="4152.337" stopTime="4170.522">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    And that he -- he reached this conclusion of disobedience from his knowledge of the fact that the records existed and not from any other, or at least not based solely upon the evidence which was offered against Nilva at the trial for contempt, is that it?
speaker="eugene_gressman" startTime="4170.522" stopTime="4211.737">
    Mr. Eugene Gressman 
    I think that's the key to this whole case, Your Honor, is the failure -- not so much perhaps of the Government but of the trial judge since he initiated this contempt proceeding to take steps to see that all the basic elements of contempt were presented at the trial and that the petitioner was there confronted with the evidence and given a chance to explain our rebut at that point, rather than relying upon the supplemental records and all the other errors that I think the Government has conceded in this case which the trial judge used to sustain the conviction.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="4211.737" stopTime="4221.368">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter

    Well --

    Mr. Eugene Gressman 
    I say, Your Honor, there's no -- there's no proof in this record that there -- the -- there was an identity between what was introduced at the Christianson case and what he failed to produce here, No. 
    That is -- now, even that is not clear, Your Honor.

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    As I understand what you saying now, I want to see if I get it clearly. 
    You're saying that if you assume that there was enough evidence in the criminal case to identify documents for being the kind accorded (Inaudible) and being the kind that the defendant knew about and failed to produce even if there was such evidence in the criminal trial, there was no evidence and so forth to prove that in the contempt case.

    Mr. Gressman, as I understood you this organization, this Mayflower Corporation is both a sales organization and a service organization.

    Mr. Eugene Gressman 
    That is my understanding, yes.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Now, do they sell anything other than slot machines?
speaker="eugene_gressman" startTime="4452.744" stopTime="4471.311">
    Mr. Eugene Gressman 
    Well, as I understand it they also -- within the terminology coin operated devices also sell such things as cigarette dispensing machines, soft drink, coffee dispensers and the like.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="4471.311" stopTime="4472.138">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    They do that too.
speaker="eugene_gressman" startTime="4472.138" stopTime="4483.860">
    Mr. Eugene Gressman 
    Oh, yes, Your Honor, they're not confined to the -- the ordinary slot machine or the one-armed bandit type of thing, it's all these in which you insert a coin into the machine and --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="4483.860" stopTime="4484.335">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Yes, I see.
speaker="eugene_gressman" startTime="4484.335" stopTime="4484.726">
    Mr. Eugene Gressman 
    -- for one purpose or another.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="4484.726" stopTime="4486.384">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Or coin operated machines.
speaker="eugene_gressman" startTime="4486.384" stopTime="4487.071">
    Mr. Eugene Gressman 
    Yes, sir.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="4487.071" stopTime="4490.720">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Tell me how -- how big was this business?
speaker="eugene_gressman" startTime="4490.720" stopTime="4492.748">
    Mr. Eugene Gressman 
    I am afraid I'm not that familiar with it to know.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="4492.748" stopTime="4496.221">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Do you know how many employees they have?
speaker="eugene_gressman" startTime="4496.221" stopTime="4504.086">
    Mr. Eugene Gressman 
    They have apparently, half dozen office employees which I think was indicated somewhere in this record.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="4504.086" stopTime="4518.756">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    The point I'm getting at is would it be an insuperable task to distinguish between the items of service and the items of sale in that -- in a business of that size?
speaker="eugene_gressman" startTime="4518.756" stopTime="4522.461">
    Mr. Eugene Gressman 
    Not to -- to one who was familiar with the -- the records you mean?
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="4522.461" stopTime="4526.220">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Yes.
speaker="eugene_gressman" startTime="4526.220" stopTime="4534.257">
    Mr. Eugene Gressman 
    Possibly not to one who is familiar and who is with the records and who has accounting and bookkeeping experience, no, which --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="4534.257" stopTime="4546.886">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well, would it be difficult, do you think, to -- was it so large that it'd be difficult to segregate the slot machines from the sales of cigarette machines, gum machines and things of that kind?
speaker="eugene_gressman" startTime="4546.886" stopTime="4588.176">
    Mr. Eugene Gressman 
    Well, it -- it's possible that it was difficult particularly to this petitioner as evidenced by the fact that when the government agent ceased the entire records in the impounding orders, they ceased literally thousands upon thousands. 
    We took a whole truck full of records out of there, and I don't know whether that reflects upon the -- the competency of their filing system, but there were literally tens of thousands of various ledgers, bookkeeping items, files and the like which required a -- a corp of F.B.I. agents and accountants to go through. 
    It took them three or four days to go through.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="4588.176" stopTime="4605.008">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    They might -- it might take them that time to go through but should it take anyone who knows the bookkeeping system of the company who was an officer of the company and -- and who is the one that the -- that the company selected to -- to make this return on the subpoena?
speaker="eugene_gressman" startTime="4605.008" stopTime="4610.794">
    Mr. Eugene Gressman 
    Well, presumably not the one who is familiar and who is the custodian of those records and the record --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="4610.794" stopTime="4616.565">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well, he's the one -- he's the one that the corporation chose to make this return before it, isn't he?
speaker="eugene_gressman" startTime="4616.565" stopTime="4657.788">
    Mr. Eugene Gressman 
    Only as a last measure because everybody else in official status there was tied up with the trial, which was beginning on -- practically on the return date of this subpoena and the Secretary of Treasure was out on that business. 
    The president was away from there and this petitioner who did nothing but legal business for the corporation was called in at the last minute on the phone and asked, “Would you please try to make a return on this subpoena?” 
    And despite the fact that he had no knowledge of the records and had no business or accounting experience, he did make what is an unchallenged good faith effort to go through these thousands of records.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="4657.788" stopTime="4658.773">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Is that all in the record?
speaker="eugene_gressman" startTime="4658.773" stopTime="4660.591">
    Mr. Eugene Gressman 
    That is all in -- and explained in the testimony.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="4660.591" stopTime="4674.272">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    The -- does the corporation or -- or does the -- the petitioner here claimed that he was not the proper person, that someone else should have -- should have done that?
speaker="eugene_gressman" startTime="4674.272" stopTime="4679.023">
    Mr. Eugene Gressman 
    We -- we claimed and it's set forth at length in our brief, Your Honor, that under these --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="4679.023" stopTime="4683.941">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    No, is it claimed in the -- in the trial court when these proceedings are going along?
speaker="eugene_gressman" startTime="4683.941" stopTime="4717.623">
    Mr. Eugene Gressman 
    I don't think the claim was made at that point, Your Honor, No. 
    But we claim that under this unique circumstances that a good faith effort on the part of one who is not officially responsible for the records, which is the terminology used in the Wilson case that that is an adequate excuse for failure to produce records and unless -- if there is some proof of bad faith on his part that he should not be held in contempt for failing to produce particular items as to which he made a good faith effort to find.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="4717.623" stopTime="4769.363">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    But one of the things that -- that bothers me here is that if -- if the Court issues a subpoena duces tecum to -- to a corporation and the corporation chooses anyone at once to respond to the -- to the subpoena, it chooses the vice president of the -- of the company and he doesn't produce the records and he's committed for contempt, should it be open to him or to the corporation to say, “Well, we didn't -- we didn't have the proper person return this. 
    You can't hold this man accountable because he really didn't -- he really didn't know anything about what we should have done was to have our -- our controller or head bookkeeper or somebody else who knows the record to this but this man didn't so -- so there's no way of enforcing a subpoena.”
speaker="eugene_gressman" startTime="4769.363" stopTime="4831.722">
    Mr. Eugene Gressman 
    Well, I wouldn't say there's no way of enforcing it, Your Honor. 
    They did secure through the impounding order but more directly to your question under the unique circumstances of this case were here, all the responsible officers were tied up by the pendency of this criminal trial and where this individual who is described by the trial judge himself as merely a nominal officer, a nominal vice president of this company whose duties were so illegal in nature, where he voluntary attempts to comply. 
    It seems to me that you should not hold him to the high uncompromising standard that a responsible officer, let's say the president or the Secretary of Treasure would have in responding to that, that you will recognize a good faith effort in this -- on this petitioner's part where you might not say that was enough on the part of a person who is primarily responsible for the -- for those records and the keeping of those records.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    May I take into account the totality of the situation that this was a lawyer?
speaker="eugene_gressman" startTime="4838.074" stopTime="4844.778">
    Mr. Eugene Gressman 
    Well, Your Honor, that raises the question as to how much of a lawyer he was. 
    He was --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="4844.778" stopTime="4846.198">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    How can we decide that here?
speaker="eugene_gressman" startTime="4846.198" stopTime="4850.896">
    Mr. Eugene Gressman 
    Not -- certainty, he was not a lawyer in relation to this criminal case.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="4850.896" stopTime="4856.555">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    You said he at one -- the record shows that he said he's a good enough lawyer, not to need any lawyer to defend him.
speaker="eugene_gressman" startTime="4856.555" stopTime="4874.343">
    Mr. Eugene Gressman 
    And it's also -- it -- it seems to me impossible as far the sentence is concerned to -- and the fact that he was a lawyer to dissociate the fact that what really concerned the trial judge apparently and what obviously concerned the Court of Appeals was the first specification.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="4874.343" stopTime="4875.392">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    I'm with you on that.
speaker="eugene_gressman" startTime="4875.392" stopTime="4883.645">
    Mr. Eugene Gressman 
    On -- and I think that's reflected in the sentencing and -- and I think that the fact that he was a lawyer, he's probably primary in that.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="4883.645" stopTime="4885.966">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    I'm with you on the sentencing part.
speaker="eugene_gressman" startTime="4885.966" stopTime="4895.275">
    Mr. Eugene Gressman 
    And the fact that he was a lawyer, I don't think distinguishes him here though insofar as his obedience or his attempt to make the good faith search.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="4895.275" stopTime="4908.584">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    But it bears on all these things of what he knows, what's its citation and whether he has time and all of the business that makes difference between a lawyer and a layman who comes into court even he's very bright and distinguished, he had to be (Inaudible) by court proceedings.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="4908.584" stopTime="4919.088">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    But he was pretty closely connected with this whole subject matter, wasn't he, he was an original defendant in a criminal conspiracy that the others were convicted of, he happened to be acquitted.
speaker="eugene_gressman" startTime="4919.088" stopTime="4919.340">
    Mr. Eugene Gressman 
    That's right.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="4919.340" stopTime="4920.823">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    And that was all before --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="4920.823" stopTime="4920.972">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Yes.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="4920.972" stopTime="4933.657">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    -- he was asked to do this and I assume we can infer that he was apparently -- he was very familiar with the records of his company in the trial in which he was acquitted.
speaker="eugene_gressman" startTime="4933.657" stopTime="4958.707">
    Mr. Eugene Gressman 
    The same time the Government had one attempt, one chance to find out what these records were and what were necessary to the trial, the second trial. 
    And yet, we come along the second trial and they have yet -- they're unable to specify exactly what they want and they engaged in this sort of a fishing expedition to bring in all these categories without specifying at that point what it is they need for this second trial. 
    It seems to --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="4958.707" stopTime="4961.700">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Then, we have to find out what kind of a lawyer he was on both sides.
speaker="eugene_gressman" startTime="4961.700" stopTime="4963.676">
    Mr. Eugene Gressman 
    I think that's a fair conclusion.

    Justice Harold Burton 
    Mr. Gressman, I just want to make sure of your answer to Justice Harlan. 
    You said after these books were presented to the Court and the FBI men testified about them, didn't it appear that some of these records did relate to used slot machine? 
    Was -- wasn't that clear in the testimony there were some interest in them?
speaker="eugene_gressman" startTime="4984.461" stopTime="4985.636">
    Mr. Eugene Gressman 
    Of the FBI agents you mean?

    Justice Harold Burton 
    Yes.
speaker="eugene_gressman" startTime="4986.305" stopTime="5001.408">
    Mr. Eugene Gressman 
    Well, it's quite true, Your Honor, but there is no evidence that what the basis of what that FBI agent was stating were the items which were specified in this order to show cause in the third specification particular.
speaker="harold_burton" startTime="5001.408" stopTime="5003.633">
    Justice Harold Burton 
    They were in these books though, weren't they?
speaker="eugene_gressman" startTime="5003.633" stopTime="5022.557">
    Mr. Eugene Gressman 
    Well, we don't know. 
    He didn't set forth in his testimony what was the basis. 
    He was testifying from general summaries he had made from this entire mass of documents and without specifying what particular items he based his conclusions on as to slot machines and other items.
speaker="harold_burton" startTime="5022.557" stopTime="5027.336">
    Justice Harold Burton 
    But he did find a substantial number of used sales, sales of used machines.

    Mr. Eugene Gressman 
    From some unidentified source, Your Honor, yes, as far as this record shows. 
    I -- I assume -- I -- of course, there are other -- some other matters in my briefs which I know Your Honors --

    Yes.
