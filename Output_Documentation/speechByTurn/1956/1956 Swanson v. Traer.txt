    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Baker you may proceed.
speaker="james_e_s_baker" startTime="10.051" stopTime="161.946">
    Mr. James E. S. Baker 
    Thank you, sir. 
    I think that it might be a good point of departure for this after recess just to briefly state what the Court of Appeals said if the rule was that they were applying. 
    And they said that the test is whether there's a collision between the personal interest of those in control of the corporation and the interest of the corporation itself in the subject matter in the suit. 
    Such antagonism may appear from the relationship of those in control of the corporation to the defendants or by the words or acts of those in control, which as a matter of fact, proven attitude antagonistic to the suit. 
    That's on the last page practically of the record. 
    That's the test the Court of Appeals said they were applying. 
    Now, this -- this corporation doesn't fall within either of those circumstances, controlled by the real defendants is not alleged and sometimes referred to in a case as domination or in antagonistic hands. 
    And it is in a case where the corporation has taken sides with the real defendant, become partners in litigation with the real defendants, actively participating in the defense in such manner that the Court can conclude that the corporation is in antagonistic hands with respect to the basic controversy. 
    Now, in the Court of Appeals, in its opinion and I believe our brief also amply demonstrate that no hostility or antagonism was alleged or shown. 
    The complaint doesn't allege facts which charge that the people were in control. 
    Now, referring to the complaint here, he referred -- Mr. Doyle did on his argument to the fact that there was a statement about hostile hands. 
    I'd like to read just a very short excerpt from the complaint. 
    It's from paragraph 4 (a). 
    It starts at the bottom of page 6 of the record, the last sentence, “A stockholder's resolution directing the bringing of suit would be futile, since the control of such action would be in hostile hands for the reason that the officers and directors and counsel for the Railway Company have indicated as plaintiffs are informed and believed that they do not believe this suit should be brought and they would refuse to bring it.” 
    In other words, the complaint says that the action be in hostile hands because the directors have indicated they'd refused to bring a suit. 
    All that --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="161.946" stopTime="164.756">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well, what is wrong with that, if you please?
speaker="james_e_s_baker" startTime="164.756" stopTime="172.479">
    Mr. James E. S. Baker 
    Well, the Court of Appeals treated this as a -- a mere conclusory allegation --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="172.479" stopTime="172.499">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    All right.
speaker="james_e_s_baker" startTime="172.499" stopTime="181.399">
    Mr. James E. S. Baker 
    -- and it said that the plaintiffs must state facts in their complaint, which lend credence to the statement that the action would be in hostile hands.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="181.399" stopTime="195.569">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Suppose there had been affidavit attached, three affidavits attached about people who said they knew it. 
    They talked to them and they had said they would not file a suit that should not be filed, would that be enough?
speaker="james_e_s_baker" startTime="195.569" stopTime="222.975">
    Mr. James E. S. Baker 
    Well we didn't -- we had precisely that, sir. 
    We had an affidavit of Mr. Busch that -- the general counsel of the corporation. 
    He made a statement in the District Court and he filed an affidavit. 
    He -- and he made a statement in the Court of Appeals, which were cited at great length, the reasons why the corporation had refused to commence the suit. 
    Those are the reasons that the plaintiff should have put in its complaint but didn't and Mr. Busch supplied those by affidavit. 
    Now --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="222.975" stopTime="235.550">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    You would -- you would say that that affidavit wouldn't be sufficient then because it failed to show sufficient facts to indicate that the directors were not exercising an honest judgment?
speaker="james_e_s_baker" startTime="235.550" stopTime="235.750">
    Mr. James E. S. Baker 
    That's correct.

speaker="james_e_s_baker" startTime="236.820" stopTime="246.461">
    Mr. James E. S. Baker 
    As a matter of fact, it showed just the opposite. 
    It showed that the directors were exercising an honest judgment based on legal advice and investigation of the action.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="246.461" stopTime="253.240">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren

    Mr. James E. S. Baker 
    I think he said that.

    The affidavit is in the record, I think that's a fair summary of what he said.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Does that make him neutral?
speaker="james_e_s_baker" startTime="260.952" stopTime="267.413">
    Mr. James E. S. Baker 
    Yes sir, I think so. 
    He expressed his legal opinion to the board of directors to the effect that the fact --

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well, insofar as the suit is concerned, that --
speaker="james_e_s_baker" startTime="270.223" stopTime="270.393">
    Mr. James E. S. Baker 
    Well, yes.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="270.393" stopTime="288.322">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    -- in the alignment of parties, the question is whether they're -- whether the corporation is friendly or -- or unfriendly or as you say neutral to the -- to the litigation. 
    But if he says, “We have -- we have judged it and -- and we find that there is no merit to it, we believe that" --
speaker="james_e_s_baker" startTime="288.322" stopTime="288.672">
    Mr. James E. S. Baker 
    Well, he didn't say to the Court upon --

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    -- the suit should -- well, I know but I'm --

    Yes, sir.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="290.872" stopTime="291.402">

    -- putting a little gloss --

    Mr. James E. S. Baker 
    All right.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="292.802" stopTime="308.925">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    -- and he says, "We don't think that the lawsuit should be maintained." 
    How is that consistent with your theory that because the corporation is neutral that it should be in lined as a plaintiff rather than as a defendant --
speaker="james_e_s_baker" startTime="308.925" stopTime="309.485">
    Mr. James E. S. Baker 
    Well, I suggest --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="309.485" stopTime="313.875">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    -- because as I understand, you concede that if -- if it was antagonistic --

    Mr. James E. S. Baker 
    Yes, sir.

    -- to the litigation and it should be a defendant.
speaker="james_e_s_baker" startTime="319.425" stopTime="326.775">
    Mr. James E. S. Baker 
    And your -- your question is, if he said that he thought that -- the corporation thought that the suit was ill-founded, would that --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="326.775" stopTime="327.355">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Yes.
speaker="james_e_s_baker" startTime="327.355" stopTime="356.086">
    Mr. James E. S. Baker 
    Well, as I said before, he didn't quite say that but I think that the neutral corporation -- the corporation, it's not throwing stumbling blocks in the way. 
    In whose refusal to bring the suit is not based upon a control by the real defendants or by an attitude toward the basic controversy that is opposed to that of the plaintiffs that that corporation should be aligned where its real interest lies. 
    It's not disabled from protecting itself.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="356.086" stopTime="370.216">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well, how would you know whether -- what influence there was behind it unless you tried the case out from the merits and found out what they -- what the interest and what the motives were of the corporation in not acting?
speaker="james_e_s_baker" startTime="370.216" stopTime="387.437">
    Mr. James E. S. Baker 
    Well, it's up to -- that may be true, sir. 
    But in order to try, in order to have something to try, there must be allegations of fact in the complaint. 
    There must be an issue of fact raised to be tried. 
    And that's what the Court of Appeals did, it did two things.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="387.437" stopTime="408.280">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    But as the issue, is it -- do they have to prove wrong doing on the part of the corporation or do they have to prove merely wrong doing on the part of the individuals who have -- who are indebted to the corporation and then show that the corporation just didn't act.
speaker="james_e_s_baker" startTime="408.280" stopTime="416.720">
    Mr. James E. S. Baker 
    No, sir. 
    They have to prove that the refusal of the corporation to act, to bring the litigation was wrongful.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="416.720" stopTime="418.157">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Now, wrongful in what sense?
speaker="james_e_s_baker" startTime="418.157" stopTime="419.377">
    Mr. James E. S. Baker 
    Wrongful to the plaintiff.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="419.377" stopTime="425.296">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    But they didn't bring it -- but they didn't bring it in the facts, justified it or because they had improper motives in not doing it.
speaker="james_e_s_baker" startTime="425.296" stopTime="426.956">
    Mr. James E. S. Baker 
    Improper motives, yes sir.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="426.956" stopTime="453.999">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    In other words, it's your position that if -- if the -- these other people had actually committed the wrongful acts, that were complained of in the complaint, and that was an established fact. 
    And the board of directors, just without any particular malicious reasoning, just didn't want to bring the action. 
    Would you say that that -- that would defeat the action?
speaker="james_e_s_baker" startTime="453.999" stopTime="489.159">
    Mr. James E. S. Baker 
    Yes, sir. 
    The -- in other words, whether a corporation is -- this is really getting over to the point that was decided in the Distinct Court but I'd be glad to answer your question. 
    It -- a corporation doesn't have to bring every lawsuit that it -- it can -- has or can have. 
    There's a discretion vested in the board of directors as to initiating litigation as well as to doing any other corporate act. 
    And if you're going to permit a stockholder, however misguided to bring litigation on behalf of the corporation just because the corporation refuses to do it without that refusal being wrongful.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="489.159" stopTime="490.569">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    No. 
    Well, I'm not --

    Yes, sir.

    You -- you give us a converse of what I'm asking, not a misguided stockholder.
speaker="james_e_s_baker" startTime="497.223" stopTime="497.343">
    Mr. James E. S. Baker 
    Well, all right.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="497.343" stopTime="510.253">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    But a -- but a stockholder who -- who shows, who establishes that certain people did a wrong to the corporation that resulted in -- in a severe loss to the corporation.

    Mr. James E. S. Baker 
    Yes, sir.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="510.803" stopTime="545.333">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    We -- we accept that as -- as a proven fact. 
    But the board of director says, "Well, true, amounted to a million dollars maybe but we don't choose to do anything about it." 
    Do you -- and you don't have -- you're not in the position to prove that it was an immoral act if they did or unconscionable act because of personal interest. 
    Do you still think that that's within the discretion of the -- of the board of directors and that they should in that posture be a party plaintiff instead of a party defendant.
speaker="james_e_s_baker" startTime="545.333" stopTime="574.263">
    Mr. James E. S. Baker 
    Yes, sir, if there's a -- this is -- disinterested majority of the board that makes that decision. 
    Yes, sir. 
    If that -- if that decision is based without control, now of the corporation or the board by the real defendants, if that based on what is for the best interest of the corporation, that decision of the board of directors should control the binding. 
    But I take it, that's not exactly the question we have here that --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="574.263" stopTime="597.273">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well, let me -- let me ask just one other question. 
    It might not be determinative but I'm interested in it anyway. 
    You said that there must be control, take your nine men board of directors that you spoke of a little while ago. 
    Suppose they could establish that nine or that four out of the nine had improper influence --

    Mr. James E. S. Baker 
    Yes sir.

    -- that was controlled?
speaker="james_e_s_baker" startTime="611.030" stopTime="613.340">
    Mr. James E. S. Baker 
    Sir, there's a disinterested majority there.

    Yes?

    Mr. James E. S. Baker 
    -- in this case and it's apparent in the various minutes insofar that we have, there were two interlocking directors so to speak. 
    That is two directors of the corporation from which these properties were purchased were also directors of North Shore. 
    At the time the decision was made not to sue those two directors upon advice of the corporate counsel, refrained from voting and the vote was unanimous, seven to nothing. 
    And those facts were brought out in the pre-trial controversy.

    Mr. James E. S. Baker 
    Those allegations can simply prove the relationships among the defendants. 
    That's one of the points they make is that they charge that -- that all of the defendants are related to the three dominant defendant. 
    They don't charge that the dominant defendant directors are related to the three dominant if I may say.

    There wasn't a proper case of equity that therefore, since the Court of Appeals didn't reach that question even assuming won't agree with Judge Knoch or would agree, this isn't the place to determine that, but that can be sent back to the Court of Appeals.

    Mr. Baker, I'm going to take one more interruption and this one might not be unwelcome. 
    We've -- we've all taken a lot of your time as we did of Mr. Doyle's. 
    I will -- I'm going give you 10 minutes more to cite if you -- in order that you might be able to complete your argument.
speaker="james_e_s_baker" startTime="1077.984" stopTime="1344.599">
    Mr. James E. S. Baker 
    All right, thank you sir. 
    Well, I'm going to skip around a little bit so I'll be sure not to overlook this. 
    They have argued that Mr. Doyle has argued that the Court of Appeals made findings of fact. 
    That's his second question that he raises. 
    Now, I think all you need to do to weigh that clause is to read exactly what the Court of Appeals says it's doing. 
    It said that accepting the petitioner's contention that the -- only the allegations of the complaint are to be considered, then it examined the -- several allegations of the complaint. 
    And it said that that complaint failed to charge that the corporation or those in control of it were hostile to the prosecution of this suit. 
    Then, it said, “Secondly, the named plaintiffs say that if matters beyond the complaint are to be looked to, the decisive fact is that the answer filed by the Railway Company controverts the complaint and important particulars referring specifically to paragraph 16 of the answer.” 
    Then, the Court examined that paragraph of the answer and held that that didn't -- that that answer did not show antagonism to the suit. 
    Then they examined some other conduct, the conduct that Mr. Busch, the counsel for the corporation in -- which is recited at great length. 
    Here, is his statements to the Court and they found that each of those statements showed that there was no antagonism towards this suit. 
    They didn't make any findings of fact there. 
    Then they -- they make -- they make the final statement in the opinion that's on the very last page of the opinion. 
    It says, “Situations readily suggest themselves in which plaintiffs might be impeded in preparing in prosecuting a case such as a refusal of the corporation's permit to access to its files and records, or the corporation is giving aid to the defendants in opposing the suit.” 
    It says, “No such relationship, words, or acts are charged by the plaintiffs in this case.” 
    Well, that's my full point on that finding of fact. 
    The Court of Appeals made no findings of fact. 
    It said we -- if we accept the plaintiff's contention that this is to be determined on the complaint alone, the complaint is inadequate. 
    The plaintiffs in their reply brief that pointed the certain facts which they say are decisive that antagonism exists with -- the Court of Appeals examined each one of those alleged facts. 
    Really, they were the answer in the conduct of counsel, that's all. 
    They weren't all this matter in the depositions of any and said, “We don't find that in any of those.” 
    There is evidence of antagonism toward this suit. 
    Then they went on they said, “We -- we can conceive of situations for there might be antagonism shown by corporate conduct. 
    No such conduct is charged.” 
    Now, that's prior from the finding of fact. 
    And clearly of a failure to charge essential facts is to be differentiated from a making a findings of fact. 
    Now, we contended in the Court of Appeals that in -- Mr. Doyle talked about this summary judgment. 
    One of the things we contended in the Court of Appeals was on the state of the record. 
    Summary judgment was justified. 
    We've submitted affidavits and we've submitted depositions and these people had had a year or two years to submit countervailing material and they didn't do it. 
    Now, if they thought there was anything in the facts that would show that there was antagonism, it was up to them either to amend their complaint as Mr. justice Black suggested to charge such conduct or at least to show by an affidavit or deposition or some other way to point out a fact which showed that there was antagonism. 
    And the -- the facts that they pointed out to the Court of Appeals, the Court of Appeals held it didn't show any such conduct. 
    It didn't charged it and the burden is on them to charge it.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1344.599" stopTime="1361.286">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    What about the statement of Mr. Doyle, to the effect that the Court of Appeals used the great many of these things that were not legitimately a part of the record? 
    I -- I so understood him to -- to say that. 
    What about the use of those --
speaker="james_e_s_baker" startTime="1361.286" stopTime="1438.859">
    Mr. James E. S. Baker 
    Well I -- I thought -- I mean I was attempting to answer that, sir. 
    That's not so. 
    I mean, they -- the only things that -- that the Court of Appeals referred to in its opinion that were matters beyond the complaint, were the answer of the Railway Company. 
    In other words, what is the attitude that this corporation has expressed in its answer? 
    Has it joined with the real defendants? 
    Is it neutral? 
    Has it joined with the plaintiff? 
    And they said that -- that nothing in the answer in certain specific allegations were referred to shows that there's antagonism towards the suit. 
    Then, Mr. Busch made an argument in the District Court at the time Mr. Marshall proposed that his -- in the pre-trial conference, proposed to file a motion to dismiss. 
    Mr. Busch said in effect, “On the corporation, this litigation is going to cost us a lot of money. 
    Here's a -- here is a motion that if it is right -- and I don't say it's right or wrong. 
    But if it's right, it will determine this litigation. 
    I urge the Court to listen to it.” 
    That's about what he said. 
    Now, the Court of Appeals examined that statement and quoted from it at length and said that --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1438.859" stopTime="1445.379">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well, is that appropriate on hearing on the demurrer?
speaker="james_e_s_baker" startTime="1445.379" stopTime="1501.332">
    Mr. James E. S. Baker 
    Well, yes sir, I think it would be. 
    But this -- you have to realize the context in which the Court did then. 
    The Court of Appeals said, “We accept their contention that -- that only the complaint is to be looked to know. 
    We can't find anything in the complaint to charge the antagonism.” 
    But the plaintiff say, “Even if you're going to look beyond the complaint, here are some decisive facts that appear in the record and it looked at those facts and said, “We don't think they show any evidence of antagonism.” 
    You've got to realize -- I should perhaps say it that way but I mean -- I call to the Court's attention that when this matter was decided by Judge Knoch, it was an extensive pre-trial conference. 
    There had been complaints, motions, answers. 
    There had been three requests for admissions of fact and answers thereto. 
    There'd been half a dozen or a dozen depositions and there were a couple of affidavits.

    We rely on Doctor versus Harrington and Koster versus Lumbermens and I think we adequately covered in the brief the case of Chicago versus Mill. 
    Now, on this distinction between Rule 23 (b) and this rule of jurisdiction alignment that's here before the Court, that also has been covered in the brief and in the case of Venner against Great Northern which referred to many times there, that distinction has made abundantly clear that 23 (b) is a rule of equity and the decision is to whether complaint comprise with that as an exercise of jurisdiction, whereas this jurisdiction of alignment rule is not.

   Argument of Marland Gale
speaker="marland_gale" startTime="1817.158" stopTime="1878.107">
    Mr. Marland Gale 
    If it please the Court. 
    I think in essence, a derivative stockholder bringing an action must allege in the words of Mr. Justice Whittaker that the defendant corporation is captive in the hands of the Miller factors and I think that is not alleged in substance here. 
    There was a confusion between -- in the language between the allegations among defendants who are not directors. 
    My client never was a director, never had any interest, neither had a one who represent him on the board. 
    He knew no part about what happened at the board meeting when this action was declined by the board. 
    I'd like to make one comment to -- in reply to a question of Mr. Justice Frankfurter. 
    When Judge Knoch heard these motions, he also renewed and heard the motions on realignment. 
    So that was before the Court --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1878.107" stopTime="1880.685">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Did he pass on it, Mr. Gale?
speaker="marland_gale" startTime="1880.685" stopTime="1975.348">
    Mr. Marland Gale 
    He heard them. 
    He reheard them at the same time and he had before him all the material. 
    And then, in response to Mr. Justice Black's question of why didn't they amend? 
    They didn't amend because they couldn't. 
    At the hearing before Judge Knoch, we challenged them to amend and to make good allegations and they couldn't do it because by that time as they knew and we had established from their own admissions over the course of depositions and a year and a half of pretrial. 
    Now, these may be non-satisfactory records here, but it's a record in which their great deal of work and effort has been done and a great many hearings have been held before the pretrial court. 
    And the kind of facts which I -- I am now going to address myself with the power of the Court to listen or look at the facts in the record. 
    Where do they come from? 
    Not from my client's statements, not from these gentlemen's client's statements. 
    They come from the plaintiff, unless that the word extraordinary case on the facts, on admissions. 
    Now, I submit that if a man admits himself out of Court, you don't have to have a trial after that to see whether what the facts argue, no. 
    It's just as if he had put it in the pleading. 
    Now, the defect of his pleading which is unamendable was shown by the concessions of the plaintiff and his own personal counsel that was on the board, and the executive vice president of the company, and the man who dominated the board was the plaintiff's man. 
    The plaintiff himself plainly came into the case --

    Pardon me, Judge Knoch.
speaker="marland_gale" startTime="2016.579" stopTime="2124.611">
    Mr. Marland Gale 
    Judge Knoch, yes. 
    We did a lot of sifting down. 
    Now, I submit that if that kind of a long procedure is disregarded as you're just rendering nugatory, all the discovery and pretrial proceedings or one who would be doing that which have been so carefully developed to help simplify issues and reduce a trial. 
    I don't think that pretrial procedures necessarily must follow -- must result on a trial. 
    Every single fact on -- from pages 10 to 15 of the brief of National City Lines is documented in this record and it comes from Mr. Crummer. 
    Mr. Crummer claimed before the directors in as far as stockholders' meeting, two months before the first demand was claimed, he claimed and I quote from page 176 that he had around 100,000 shares he could deliver of this company that had 500 hundred shares. 
    "Here is a derivative stockholder's suit by the biggest stockholder.” 
    And before that, he wanted to have representation on the board. 
    He went to Mr. Francis B. Whitehair who for the 20 years as they both testified and sworn that there's notice read about this with Mr. Crummer's personal attorney. 
    Mr. Whitehair made arrangements to go around. 
    He got on the board with another man. 
    He's elected. 
    In the short time, he became an Executive Committee. 
    Within about a year, he was the Executive Vice President and every single motion that was made to decline to bring suit was made by Mr. Crummer's personal attorney. 
    That's why that the plaintiff was never amended. 
    He made the motion. 
    Someone else seconded it. 
    Another big thing that Mr. Crummer did right away was to reorganize the legal department.

    Now, may I say to you that I don't have to give an argument with my brother on advance. 
    I'm fully familiar with that rule. 
    I've heard that before. 
    What you have here is a diversity if the complaint alleges to that to show there is hostility between them and, or if it would have shown the same thing or that it is whatever it takes, or it -- it would be the same thing if they'd gone through what Judge Barnes said in heard evidence and had a fact of finding of such things. 
    Now, where do you have here anything that compels us to say to what Judge Knoch said or anybody else said that a judge could not rule on anything except that the complaint wasn't enough. 
    Now, if it be true that there's enough in their complaint to show the kind of -- of fighting between the -- the plaintiffs and the directors to make them have adverse interest and of course there's no diversity applied, there is no difference to the party.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Yes, sir. 
    Yes sir, you have 20 minutes.

    Mr. James E. Doyle 
    And Your Honor, I would like to devote just a few moments in this portion of my argument to the matters, which the Court had just been -- about which the Court has just been questioning counsel about what happened procedurally in this case. 
    And then, if I may, I'd like to move on to state our position about what the rule of alignment should be in -- that governs in this diversity cases but still speaking now about the procedural history of the case. 
    I wish first to call the Court's attention to the record, page 261. 
    261 of the record is the motion by Bernard J. Fallon by his attorneys and that's the motion on which Judge Knoch ruled. 
    No other motion, not motions that were made and overruled by Judge Barnes two and a half or almost two and half years earlier, but this motion --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2660.816" stopTime="2678.402">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Is it your view, Mr. Doyle that we are restricted on this review in the ascertainment of whether or not they were proper aligned -- proper, -- there was diversity jurisdiction. 
    Is it your view that we are restricted here to review in what Judge Knoch did?

    Mr. James E. Doyle 
    No, sir. 
    The point I just made was in response to what I believe was in the accurate statement made to the Court by counsel that there was something more before Judge Knoch than a motion to dismiss which the moving party conceded was a demurrer. 
    That's what he considered he was doing, was demurring and that's what Judge Knoch passed on. 
    Now, Your Honor, if I may respond next to the suggestion which -- with which I agree that at any time at any Court, District Court, Court of Appeals or Supreme Court of the United States discovers on the phase of the record that there is a jurisdiction --

    Have you have heard any disagreement between people about that? 
    I thought the disagreement here was the argument or you claimed that it's enough to show from this record that there is an adverse interest between these parties and they claim there's not. 
    That's basic isn't it to determining whether there's diversity of jurisdiction. 
    Of course, you look at the whole records.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2748.804" stopTime="2765.212">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    But you're not restricted to the complaint that we heard a minute ago, and you're not restricted to what Judge Knoch found. 
    You work -- you worked -- the whole record is open and if that record discloses, I want a diversity in this Court without jurisdiction because the law called it without jurisdiction.
speaker="james_e_doyle" startTime="2765.212" stopTime="2781.352">
    Mr. James E. Doyle 
    Well, I would concede that that's the fact that any Court, or this Court, the Court of Appeals or the District Court might look at the complaint alone and decide that the allegations of the complaint are insufficient for jurisdictional purposes, that either they are insufficient or they're not sufficient.

    Mr. James E. Doyle 
    I believe that this Court or any court may examine any proper record and find out whether there is some jurisdictional defect. 
    And I -- and now, I want to say though Mr. Justice Frankfurter and Mr. Justice Black and the whole Court that what has happened here is, and this is the literal truth about this record, a brief, -- let's go back to 1951. 
    This is the motion to dismiss before Judge Barnes which Judge Barnes overruled way back there. 
    A brief was filed by the defendants who Mr. Baker's firm represents. 
    Attached to that brief was an affidavit by counsel, Mr. Baker, to the affect that he had examined the depositions taken up to that point and he selected and I'm not suggesting anything improper about this. 
    And for the purpose, he selected from those depositions certain portion of the deposition. 
    That's what's in this printed record in this Court and nothing else, nothing else. 
    No -- no -- they're not all a deposition. 
    And -- and Your Honor, it isn't as if what suggested here jurisdictionally is that suddenly here in the Supreme Court, the Court itself notices that -- that one of these plaintiffs is not a citizen of Nevada but it's actually a citizen of Illinois or some gross jurisdiction defect of that kind. 
    What's suggested here is that on the rules of alignment, whether or not there is this sufficient antagonism as between the plaintiffs and those in control of the corporation, that -- that's the jurisdictional defect that's suggested. 
    And it's -- with respect to that question, that counsel here now seeks just to page through excerpts of depositions, which they themselves pick and find things which they suggest our admissions with respect to whether or not this hostility occur.

    We designated portions of the record of -- with our view that this was a demurrer. 
    Counsel designated additional portions and then in the Court of Appeals, they raised that -- in the Court of Appeals, they took the position that in order to dismiss the complaint can be sustained on any one of a number of -- of questions, and one that Judge Knoch or the jurisdictional question or will attack on a processes of the bankruptcy court which is another thing in the background here.

    I believe that the respondents were entirely free in the Court of Appeals to contend as they did, that any one of a number of grounds would sustain the order of dismissal below. 
    I believe that's good law including this fact that there was improper alignment. 
    That was a proper thing for them to raise there. 
    But if that was what disturbed the Court of Appeals, then the Court of Appeals should have said, “There are factual questions underlying this alignment thing. 
    We'll send it back for the District Court and let the District Court -- let everybody square off here on the factual questions that -- that underline the alignment problem and let the District Court have a hearing and let people produce what they will on that point and let the District Court make its findings.”

speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3312.256" stopTime="3313.506">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    If you please.
speaker="james_e_doyle" startTime="3313.506" stopTime="3444.152">
    Mr. James E. Doyle 
    Everything that has been said in connection with this argument about what happened procedurally in the case, in everything that we have said here as to whether the complaint is sufficient. 
    In all of that, we have proceeded on the -- we have accepted for that purpose the assumption that there is a requirement for alignment purposes that there must be some wrongful -- something wrongful about the refusal to sue that as counsel here conceded that there -- that there must -- that the plaintiffs must show some improper motives on the part of those who refused the suit, and we‘ve conceded that. 
    I say we assumed that for purposes of this discussion up to here and we have contended that our complaint needs that requirement if there is such a requirement, that the -- that is that there was a sufficient hostility and that there is domination and so on and we refer to things in the complaint which we think carried that out. 
    We do in our brief contend and I want to state the contention here that it is not the law as decided by this Court in its decisions or by this Court through the rule making power or in any other way. 
    It is not the law that the plaintiffs for purposes of jurisdiction, for purposes of alignment, proper alignment of the corporation must either allege or prove improper motives on the part of the directors in their refusal to sue. 
    We do -- now, I want to say at this point that we do not concede that that's the law, and we believe that the law is -- and the only requirement for purposes of alignment and jurisdictional diversity purposes, the only requirement is that the refusal on the part of the directors to sue must be real, not feign. 
    Real, not feign and we quote that language several times in our briefs. 
    It comes from Doctor and Harrington quoting it I believe from Dodge and Woolsey which is the -- the beginning leading case reading in point of time in this whole series of cases.
speaker="harold_burton" startTime="3444.152" stopTime="3449.062">
    Justice Harold Burton 
    And that satisfies the test of hostility to make it real and not feign?
speaker="james_e_doyle" startTime="3449.062" stopTime="3617.918">
    Mr. James E. Doyle 
    Yes, sir, but the word “hostility” or “antagonism”, we -- we would suggest there's a better word that there is in truth a conflict, not a -- not a collusive one. 
    They're not a collusive situation but that there is in truth a conflict between these plaintiff's stockholders and the management of the corporation as to whether or not this suit should be brought. 
    Now, I don't suggest, Your Honor, it is the moment I don't suggest that I'm talking now about the equitable basis for a stockholder suit once you're in Court. 
    That's a separate question on which we would like some time to be heard in this case, but -- but I'm saying that for purposes of alignment and for the application of the rule of the Indianapolis case or for any of the cases that I've held that there must be a genuine difference that separates this plaintiff's stockholders from the corporation. 
    For those purposes, I say that the question must be whether the refusal was real and not feign, Your Honor. 
    Now, we cite as one authority for that proposition a case decided by this Court, Chicago against Mills in 204 U.S.two years after Doctor and Harrington which we believe is a wholly, and which we believe it was necessary to a holding in a case and it was a jurisdictional case that this proposition be recognized. 
    In other words, in Chicago against Mills, the directors had refused -- the directors of a utility company in Chicago had refused to bring a suit to enjoin the enforcement of a certain rate regulation of the City of Chicago and it was admitted. 
    I shouldn't say admitted. 
    It was in the pleadings that the reason they refused to bring the suit was they thought that if they brought such a suit, they'd get in trouble with the city council of Chicago and that the Mayor would get after him and that they'd have a of political trouble in Chicago. 
    So, they decided for what the Court called prudential reasons, not to -- not to bring the action. 
    The plaintiff's stockholder from another state then brought the action. 
    There was a long and it involves procedural history of that case too. 
    Ultimately, it came to this Court on the question of jurisdiction and you'll understand there's no suggestion of hostility on the part of the directors who refused the suit toward the plaintiff who brought it, but only a genuine disagreement, and -- and it was also suggested of course by the defense that this was collusive. 
    The collusion question was -- was explored below and also explored in the Supreme Court, and they held there was no collusion, and then the Court held that there was federal jurisdiction.
speaker="william_o_douglas" startTime="3617.918" stopTime="3632.378">
    Justice William O. Douglas 
    Another way stating that then Mr. Doyle in your position is that if there's a bona fide, honest refusal on the part of the corporation to bring the action, no matter what the motivation may be, that's suffices doing that to establish diversity.

speaker="james_e_doyle" startTime="3680.641" stopTime="3691.591">
    Mr. James E. Doyle 
    Your Honor, the problem in this case arises from the fact that the composition of the board of directors changed somewhat between the time that the wrongs were complained of and the time when the demand was made.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="3691.591" stopTime="3718.371">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Well, that -- that still -- that still gives -- still gives corporate discretion to those who are in charge of the corporation to determine in good faith the opposite of faithlessness to determine in good faith in the first place whether there is a reasonable cause of action. 
    In the second place, whether as a matter of policy, lots of people have causes of action which is a matter of policy. 
    They do not pursue without being faithless.
speaker="james_e_doyle" startTime="3718.371" stopTime="3731.582">
    Mr. James E. Doyle 
    Yes, sir. 
    Justice Jackson surely meant in the context of that opinion that the stockholder suit is a device to redress wrongs by faithless directors who commit frauds against the corporation, and that's what this lawsuit is all about if we ever get to it.

    I meant merely -- merely because the board of directors, either they committed the act to the -- to the -- a sale or the board of directors in charge of the corporation after the directors have committed them are gone.

    Well, Mr. Doyle, do you mean this for example?

    Why waste the money of the corporation prosecuting the suit in the time of its officers and directors, which will be taken up from the prosecution, and that's the reason. 
    Now, it's an entirely bona fide honest refusal on that ground. 
    Are you suggesting to us that that's enough to establish the right of a plaintiff to have a corporate align -- the corporation aligned as a defendant?

    What I cannot in the face of what's been said particularly by Mr. Gale stopped my argument without just making this statement which I'll term a sort of an offer of proof. 
    If we ever have the opportunity to try the jurisdictional facts that underline the alignment question, we believe that we can show that a majority of the directors as of 1949 when the refusal to sue occurred. 
    On the basis of the complaint, we can link that up and show that five of nine were involved in the conspiracy alleged.
