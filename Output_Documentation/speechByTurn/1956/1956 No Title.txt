    You may proceed Mr. Sand.
speaker="leonard_b_sand" startTime="5.442" stopTime="221.522">
    Mr. Sand 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    I would like to avert, if I may, to the question of double jeopardy and attempt to clarify the answers which I gave to the question asked by you Mr. Chief Justice and by Mr. Justices Frankfurter and -- and Black. 
    I stated that there was no difference between the case where the verdict returned if one of guilt at second degree murder and the case where the verdict which the jury returned to one count and in -- and in an indictment of not guilty of first degree murder, guilty of second degree murder. 
    There is no difference in legal consequence between those two cases under the view of the Trono case and under the view of the American Law Institute. 
    But if we want to put to one side these cases, one could have cause distinguish between the cases where the jury is absolutely silent and the case where there is a specific finding of acquittal, where there is silence on the part of the jury, for example, that silence may be the result of disagreement. 
    The jury -- there maybe a hung jury with respect to a particular degree of a crime and of course a hung jury has never in -- in recent times consort to be tantamount to an acquittal. 
    The jury may never have considered the -- that degree of the crime to which it returned no verdict. 
    The Government therefore went to some lengths in its brief to show that in no respect may this verdict of the jury at the first trial explicitly or implicitly be read as a finding of acquittal of first degree murder. 
    There was of course no such statement by the jury. 
    The jury merely returned a verdict of guilt in -- in the second degree. 
    We do know however from the other findings of the verdict -- of the jury with respect awesome count and with respect to the fact that the petitioner did cause the death of the victim that the jury found that in fact all the elements of the crime of first degree murder under the felony murder statute was satisfied. 
    Therefore if -- if the rule which were to be adapted were one which were to distinguish between the case where the jury returned an explicit verdict of not guilty or acquittal and the case where it nearly returned a verdict of-- of a lesser included offense. 
    This -- whether to be that distinction drawn, then this case clearly would not violate double jeopardy.

    Justice Black 
    Have you looked up the cases (Inaudible)
speaker="leonard_b_sand" startTime="257.041" stopTime="275.763">
    Mr. Sand 
    I'm -- I'm aware that in some states, the practice is -- is to require that the various degrees be set forth in different counts, in which case there is a verdict returned in -- on each count. 
    That of course is -- is not the -- the federal fact --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="275.763" stopTime="302.654">
    Justice Black 
    -- states that they charged murder in the first degree and they permit conviction all the way down to assault and battery. 
    Is there anything in your brief that could give us information on what is practically stated with reference to pleading the silence of the upper benches as exactly equivalent of a federal?
speaker="leonard_b_sand" startTime="302.654" stopTime="346.132">
    Mr. Sand 
    Not in no terms Mr. Justice Black, but the question arises when there is an attempt to retry the defendant for the greater offense and of course it is clear that where there is a conviction for the less or an acquittal, for the lesser offense then retrial for the greater offense is precluded. 
    The reason for that is that when there is the second trial for the greater offense, the defendant is in jeopardy on the lesser count. 
    Therefore, he is being placed twice in jeopardy for the lesser offense, the offense for which he was found guilty at -- at the first trial.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="346.132" stopTime="355.963">
    Justice Black 
    Have you -- have you had any cases in your brief that indicates that that is rationalization to -- to call it jeopardy for the lesser offence? 
    I had supposed.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="355.963" stopTime="367.077">
    Justice Black 
    Maybe I'm wrong, the reason why that he had been acquitted of a greater offense and he could not again be tried to that offense.
speaker="leonard_b_sand" startTime="367.077" stopTime="540.389">
    Mr. Sand 
    The -- the -- that would be the rationale in -- in a limited way of a state, in a state which said that the effect of the conviction for the lesser included offense is -- is the effect of the reversal of such a conviction. 
    It's not to eradicate the entire judgment. 
    That was -- is for example the reasoning of the -- of the state court in People against Stallings, recently specifically rejected by this Court in -- in the Trono decision. 
    My point and if I may state it again is that under the holdings of this case and -- and Trono and -- and then Brantley and under the view of the American Law Institute, it would make no difference whether the jury, with respect to a single count of the indictment, and that is the only situation we have here. 
    We're not faced with the problem of multiple counts where of course this Court has said that different counts of an indictment are as if they were separate indictments. 
    Where in response to the one count, the jury returns a verdict of -- in so many words, not guilty of first degree murder, guilty of second degree murder, but under the Trono case and the American Law Institute view, that would make no difference. 
    Retrial for first degree murder would be permissible that the facts in Trono are -- are exactly that. 
    Where a distinction to be made between the two types of cases on the theory perhaps that where the jury is absolutely silent, we do not know whether they ever considered the count, whether they considered the count and did not agree or for any other reason, did not in fact pass upon the defendant's guilt of that degree of crime. 
    And if the -- the rule to be annunciated by this Court in a case which presented such a problem where that such a finding would preclude retrial and under the facts of this case, it is clear that retrial for the greater offense would not be precluded because here, not only was there no finding by the jury of acquittal of the greater offense. 
    But by looking at the -- at the facts of -- of the -- the necessary implications of the verdicts returned at the first trial, we know that the jury found that the defendant was guilty of arson. 
    We know that the jury found that the victim died as a result of that arson.

    Chief Justice Warren 
    Well, Mr. Sand, when does -- when does jeopardy attached in a -- in a felony case? 
    Isn't it when the jury sworn and they proceed to try the case and unless -- unless the case is interrupted in the middle of it because of some unusual circumstance that -- that would bring about injustice, the man has been placed in jeopardy? 
    Now, if that is true, if that is the law, what has happened? 
    What did happen in this case to get around that question of jeopardy when the jury sworn and the evidence was taken?
speaker="leonard_b_sand" startTime="584.582" stopTime="593.652">
    Mr. Sand 
    The verdict was reversed, Mr. Chief Justice, at the petitioner's behest, where if not to be held -- this was a problem which the founding (Voice Overlap) --

    But was there -- there was no verdict reversed as to first degree murder on which he was put in jeopardy.
speaker="leonard_b_sand" startTime="611.813" stopTime="690.422">
    Mr. Sand 
    Well, there was, Your Honor, under the -- under the federal law. 
    A reverse of not only of so much of the -- of the error. 
    It is one error here of permitting the jury to return a verdict to second degree murder. 
    It was not the reversal only of so much of the error has -- has prejudiced the petitioner, but the perpetuation of so much of the error as operated to his benefit. 
    Here, were the error not -- had the error not been committed. 
    We do not know what that first jury would have done, but we have -- we have a good idea by virtue of the fact that there was a retrial with the same evidence and in the absence of that error there was a verdict of guilty of first degree murder. 
    This error prejudiced both -- both the -- both the defendant and the governor -- and the Government in the words of -- of Mr. Justice Douglas in the safer case, it tainted the entire verdict. 
    In no sense therefore can that verdict a part from the error which was the very error which caused the reverse he said to represent an acquittal of -- of the defendant.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="690.422" stopTime="701.932">
    Justice Black 
    Suppose he's been indicted for larceny, burglary and arson? 
    You found him guilty of arson and he said nothing about it, the other two. 
    He appealed his arson case. 
    Could they try him for the others?

    Justice Black 
    Three charges in the indictment, one burglary, one grand larceny, one arson. 
    The jury brings in the verdict and finds him guilty of arson. 
    The court charged him and they can find him guilty of all three. 
    He appeals the argument. 
    What happens with the other two cases?
speaker="leonard_b_sand" startTime="724.300" stopTime="743.447">
    Mr. Sand 
    Well, this -- this was a problem which the Court did not decide in the -- in the Burton case, but this Court has said that separate counts of -- of an indictment are as if they were separate indictments.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="743.447" stopTime="748.754">
    Justice Black 
    But is it not true of that separate charges where they had one count?
speaker="leonard_b_sand" startTime="748.754" stopTime="757.085">
    Mr. Sand 
    No, Mr. Justice Black. 
    It -- it is not true because the jury returned but one finding on that one count.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="757.085" stopTime="779.972">
    Justice Black 
    What case holds if that's not the case? 
    If that's not -- that that is what she said. 
    What case holds that if one count charges three offenses that reversal of conviction on one to be treated differently on a case where they charge it in three separate counts?
speaker="leonard_b_sand" startTime="779.972" stopTime="977.696">
    Mr. Sand 
    Well, it's not one case but -- but it's a comparison of the holdings in -- in the Harding, the Trono and the Brantley cases and -- and which states that -- that rare convicted for the lesser offense, the defendant can be tried for the -- for the greater and the holding of this Court and I believe it's Dunn against the United States that separate counts of an indictment are -- are as if they were separate -- as if they were separate indictments. 
    The -- the Government emphasizes now as it emphasized in its brief that this case is in many respects an a fortiori case as I have said from Trono, the broad implications of the Trono decision and whether in all of the -- of the hypothetical situations, some of which have been presented in -- in questions by the justices. 
    Retrial would violate double jeopardy on that now before this Court. 
    The facts in this case are very peculiar because the theory of the reversal was that there could only be -- this could only be the greater offense because we know from the verdict of the jury at the first trial that they found in fact all the elements of felony and murder because the nature of the error which was a single error tainted the entire verdict. 
    One might have for instance, the case where a defendant is on trial for a first degree murder and is convicted of man -- manslaughter or it is convicted of second degree murder and there was an error at the trial with respect to the difference between second degree murder and manslaughter where the nature of the error did not in any way touch the greater offense. 
    It is conceivable there that the court would hold that where the error was of such a nature, so that it obviously do not affect the jury's deliberation with respect to the first degree murder count, that they would then be found an implicit acquittal of first degree murder. 
    I'm not urging that rule on this Court. 
    I'm saying that it -- it is a rational rule. 
    It would be a rational rule, but that is not this case, because here, the very error which led to the reversal was the error which -- which prejudiced both the Government the defendant and lead to the juries returning a verdict on second degree murder.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="977.696" stopTime="1013.573">
    Chief Justice Warren 
    Mr. Sand, may I ask one more question please. 
    Suppose in this case, the Court instructed them on both first and second degree murder and arson, the jury brought back two blank verdicts on the murder, convicted him of arson and the appeal is arson conviction, and it was reversed. 
    Would -- would you then be in the same position he has here legally?
speaker="leonard_b_sand" startTime="1013.573" stopTime="1022.788">
    Mr. Sand 
    Yes, Mr. Justice Warren, if there were no verdict returned on the murder count, then -- then there is -- then there is a hung jury.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1022.788" stopTime="1064.867">
    Chief Justice Warren 
    No, no, no. 
    It's just -- they -- they weren't discharged because the jury didn't agree. 
    He didn't ask them any such thing. 
    He just -- he just accepted the verdict and as he did in this case. 
    He accepted that blank verdict on first degree murder, a verdict of guilty on the second degree murder and a -- and a verdict of guilty on arson. 
    Now, suppose instead of there being a verdict of guilty on that second degree murder charge, suppose they just found him guilty of the arson and let the other two blank, would -- would you be the -- in a different position than you are now, if they tried him and give him a death penalty?
speaker="leonard_b_sand" startTime="1064.867" stopTime="1110.533">
    Mr. Sand 
    He -- he can be retried for -- for murder and I would like to emphasize this. 
    There were two counts in this indictment, one was a murder count the other was an arson count. 
    When the jury returned its verdict, they were asked whether there was verdict on -- on the murder count in -- in the hypothetical which you suggested Mr. Chief Justice. 
    The -- the jury would be silent. 
    They'd be asked -- the foreman would be asked, “Have you reached the verdict on the -- on count two of the indictment?” 
    And there would be no answer. 
    At that point, I would supposed that the -- that the trial judge would -- would inquire whether the jury was -- was divided. 
    And if it was divided, they would -- they send the jury back for further deliberation --

    Chief Justice Warren 
    Well, it's been my experience that if you have three verdicts and one of them is not filled out, return to the jury, the judge will do the same thing. 
    And why didn't -- why didn't they do it here?
speaker="leonard_b_sand" startTime="1127.679" stopTime="1172.519">
    Mr. Sand 
    I -- I think that that would be the case where arson, a lesser included offense of murder were these all one crime or lesser degrees of a crime, but these were two separate crimes. 
    Arson is not a lesser included offense of murder. 
    Therefore, had -- had there been complete silence on the part of the jury with respect to the -- that count. 
    Under -- under federal practice, the jury would have either been sent back or would have been discharged and under no sense would -- would the defendant have been -- have been precluded with retrial, be precluded because --

    Justice Frankfurter 
    Let's -- let's see if I understand you. 
    Do you mean to say if -- if the indictment, count one for arson, count two for burglary, count three for murder and the jury brings in a verdict, we find the defendant guilty of count one. 
    The count find the defendant guilty of burglary count one. 
    I think that's count one. 
    Say nothing about the other two that Chief Justice called blank and the judge accepts that verdict. 
    It held the clerk to answer that verdict and then thanks to jury for the devoted services that caters me and they go away and then enforces the sentence of X years for burglar, did I -- do you say or suggest that the Government could have a -- a trial, another trial for murder and arson? 
    I'm not suggesting an appeal. 
    The defendant does nothing. 
    His -- he and his counsel are very happy over this result and they do nothing, could the U.S. Attorney of the District here move a new trial for arson and murder?

    Then, would not the jeopardy necessarily continue under that situation until the completion of the trial, which could and only this, the judgement of the Supreme Court?

    Mr. Sand 
    It -- it could and if that were the basis for the -- this Court's decision in the Trono case. 
    We -- we would have an entirely different situation, but the Court went at great pain. 
    It was a great pain and it was very explicit, both -- both the majority opinion in Trono and the dissenting opinion -- and the opinion of the Court in Kepner in stating that because the language which was being construed was the language which was taken word for word from the Fifth Amendment and from the Bill of Rights that -- that the question was before the Court was, as the Court put it, as if the case arose in one of the Federal Courts of the United States. 
    On the facts, that distinction could be drawn. 
    The court did not draw that distinction in -- in Trono, explicitly based its holding as if it were construing the Fifth Amendment and of course in later cases, as -- as in Brantley, the situation was not of a case arising from this peculiar Spanish background which was a case arising in the United States with the trial by a jury.

    Mr. Justice McKenna and Mr. Justice White in Kepner agreed with Justice Holmes' dissent on the continued -- continue on the proceedings theory.

    He opened up the whole thing. 
    That's the point and that was the essence of Holmes' dissent in Kepner which the court didn't take, but in effect, they took it in Trono.

speaker="charles_e_whittaker" startTime="1910.191" stopTime="1945.439">
    Justice Whittaker 
    But my question a while ago was that if a trial under the existing law at that time, the Philippine Islands consisted on. 
    Both this preliminary hearing and for the first instance and a de novo trial on review upon both the law and the facts in the Supreme Court then wouldn't necessarily jeopardy have to continue until there had been an end of the trial which concluded with the judgment of the Supreme Court of the Islands.
speaker="leonard_b_sand" startTime="1945.439" stopTime="1998.595">
    Mr. Sand 
    And my -- my answer is -- is yes that under the practice in the Philippine Court, the -- the appellate court could sua sponte have imposed the greater sentence, but had it done so in the light of the provision which -- which was applicable in the Philippine Islands and which was verbatim from the Fifth Amendment. 
    Had it done so and had this Court thought that it was a violation of double jeopardy which were done so. 
    The Court would not have decided Trono as it did. 
    In other words, in fact, the practice in the Philippine Islands was such as to permit the reviewing court to impose a greater sentence to subject the defendant if -- if you will to continuing jeopardy.

    Justice Whittaker 
    I -- I wonder what it is to be said or the possible confusion that Justice Holmes' dissent in the Trono case is to be read against that background of the preliminary trial and the final trial in the Supreme Court as a continuing jeopardy?
speaker="leonard_b_sand" startTime="2023.968" stopTime="2124.231">
    Mr. Sand 
    I -- I -- I believe that one must read the Holmes concurrence in Trono in the light of the dissenting opinion which is quoted at -- at great length in the Government's brief in Kepner because in that opinion, Mr. Justice Holmes specifically directed himself to the question of limited waiver, to the -- to the question which is now before this Court and specifically rejected the state court rule and -- and stated that under his view, there is not a limited way but there can be a retrial for the greater offense. 
    Therefore, I think that -- that it's entirely logical and -- and reasonable to say as -- as Mr. Justice Frankfurter has suggested that the basis for Holmes' concurrence in Trono was not because of any quantitative result because of course the concurrence with the majority, but because the majority was not clear and explicit enough in accepting the view which -- which he had suggested in Kepner, which is that it is -- there is but one jeopardy in one proceeding, a continuing jeopardy notion. 
    Holmes -- it cannot be said that because Holmes merely concur, there were not four justices of the Supreme Court which rejected the limited waiver doctrine, because one would then have to completely ignore Holmes' view of -- of double jeopardy and expressed --

    It is equally, I think clear, that at the time the Trono decision was rendered by this Court, five justices made known their view. 
    When one view -- when one takes Trono in the light of Kepner that the -- the law in the federal courts was the law which rejected the limited waiver view -- doctrine. 
    And in Trono specifically, in the majority opinion, the Court pointed to the state court decisions such as People against Darling in New York, not Philippine Island decisions, not the decisions of the territorial court.

    Rublee.
speaker="george_rublee" startTime="2613.321" stopTime="2997.931">
    Mr. Rublee 
    The Government's position that this case is analogous to the Stroud case, their argument that it is essentially unfair for petitioner here to claimed that an acquittal survived to the appeal, their argument to dismiss the murder charge absolutely here would make the Court a place for a game rather than a place for the -- to the justice that this was a tricky thing. 
    All of these arguments rest on their assumption as to what went wrong in the minds of the jurors at the first trial. 
    They are speculating about the jurors when Mr. Sand says that the jury found that Mr. Green has killed Ms. Brown at the -- in the perpetration of the arson, he is speculating and his speculation was not shared by the Court of Appeals when it reversed that second degree of conviction. 
    If the Court of Appeals had shared Mr. Sand's certainty as to what went wrong in the minds of the jury, they would have been reversing solely for the benefit of the Government. 
    Mr. Sand's argument that Green claiming his course of conduct, constituted first degree murder and that his second degree of conviction should be set aside because of that. 
    Ignores what the Court of Appeals held. 
    They held that the second degree charge was not an invitation to the jury to compromise so much as it was an invitation for the jury to convict Mr. Green of a crime which he hadn't committed, a crime for which there was no evidence in that record. 
    Now, that is perhaps a delicate question. 
    Just what exactly was on this charge? 
    What could it signify? 
    I should like to read to the Court, part of the charge given at the first trial. 
    The statute means that if a person kills another in the perpetration of an arson or attempting to perpetrate an arson, the killing is murder in the first degree. 
    Under such circumstances, it doesn't make any difference whether the killing was committed with or without purpose so to do. 
    Any killing even if committed without any purpose so to do, even if it is accidental and it is committed in perpetrating an arson is murder in the first degree under the law. 
    That charge -- then there was a second degree charge which just said if you find that he killed her without premeditation, he may return a verdict to second degree. 
    But, there had been a serious challenge to the manner of Ms. Brown's death raised by defense counsel at the first trial. 
    The Government has not produced the doctor who made the test of Ms. Brown's blood and upon that blood test, rested the Government's point that Ms. Brown had died as a result of the fire. 
    The prosecuting attorney took this attack on their testimony at the first trial, seriously enough to call this witness at the second trial. 
    He believed that he should proceed against Green with this witness. 
    If we -- if this Court is to speculate about what went on in the minds of the jurors, we think it is not to be disregarded that they might have felt. 
    We don't know how Green killed Ms. Brown. 
    We can't tell. 
    The defense attorney certainly made a fuss about whether or not the Government can prove she inhaled smoke and died. 
    And the judge told us if we thought she died in the fire that we had to return first degree, but there were the two of them in that house and one of them was dead and the other one we feel committed arson and we feel he told us a lie about an intruder coming in and stabbing him with an ice pick. 
    So -- and also, he is on trial for killing her. 
    There must be something in that. 
    We don't know how he did it, but we can just find him guilty of second degree. 
    The judge told us if we thought he killed her and didn't mean to do it, it wasn't premeditated, that's second degree. 
    Well, that's the speculation that's possible. 
    We're getting to a great deal of trouble when we start to speculate. 
    I should like to also comment a bit about the idea that this charge was very unfair to the Government. 
    The prosecuting attorney sat on his hands when the second degree charge went to the jury. 
    In fact, in his summation to jury, he told them that second degree charge will be given. 
    Now, if this Court holds that by appealing that erroneous lesser conviction, Green's subjected himself properly to retrial on the greater charge. 
    You are creating a lovely situation for prosecutors in difficult cases. 
    We submit the prosecutor let the second degree charge go to the jury because he was afraid that jury might not convict on first degree. 
    This was a rather sympathetic defendant. 
    And we submit that if you hold the way the Government wishes you to hold in this case, you will leave prosecutors in the driver seat. 
    They can let the lesser erroneous charge go to the jury securing a knowledge that they will get a conviction or they have a better chance of getting a conviction, otherwise, they wouldn't let it go. 
    And if they -- if the defendant is rush enough to appeal that conviction, the Government will have another chance adding on the greater charge which they couldn't prove for which they had enough doubt about so that they let the lesser go to the jury. 
    Now, sure there was a benefit to Green in a way from the second degree charge, we don't deny that. 
    It is possible that the Government's speculation maybe true in fact although improper as a matter of procedure. 
    But who is to bear the burden in a situation like this, the defendant or the state? 
    You are faced to that choice.

    Mr. Rublee 
    Well, we do think that this is a difficult situation. 
    It's not one that it's frequently going to come up, but what I have said about other cases applies and enforced here. 
    Now, there was another policy argument by the Government that Green argued his cause. 
    They -- they mentioned the ALI recommendation and the ALI recommendation contained some remarkable language. 
    It says when a defendant procures a reversal of the lesser conviction because his course of conduct constituted the greater. 
    Well, that is extraordinary. 
    That is though as I've said earlier Green had gone into the Court of Appeals and said, “You haven't punished me enough and I'm curious and I want a new trial,” of which he did not do. 
    It assumes that the jury must have interpreted the charge to be an invitation to return as trial verdict.

    Justice Frankfurter 
    What did you ask to the Court of Appeals out of the --
speaker="george_rublee" startTime="3075.402" stopTime="3108.943">
    Mr. Rublee 
    The Court of Appeals was urged to reverse by Mr. Blow because there was insufficient evidence to sustain the second degree conviction and also because the second degree instruction prejudiced Green and let the jury abandon their inquiry as to how Ms. Brown died. 
    The jury was invited not to worry about the manner of Ms. Brown's death by the second degree charge and that is essentially what the Court of Appeals held. 
    They held that without a second degree charge, Green might have been entirely free.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="3108.943" stopTime="3122.887">
    Justice Frankfurter 
    I suggest to Mr. Blow. 
    I don't make this argumentatively. 
    I think your position really necessitate -- could have -- should have necessitated the Court of Appeals in dismissing this case.
speaker="george_rublee" startTime="3122.887" stopTime="3146.079">
    Mr. Rublee 
    We agree with you, Mr. Justice Frankfurter, but there was this possibility and I don't know what the law on this would be because it is not exactly our case, but had the Government had good evidence of second degree which they didn't put in. 
    It is not absolutely clear in my mind that they might not have been able to prosecute on second degree.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="3146.079" stopTime="3169.967">
    Justice Frankfurter 
    Could it only be said for the English human -- a great deal of sympathy if presumably the Government put in as -- as part of the case, at least I should like to -- I think it's desirable to indulge in -- in substance so far as it's relevant that the prosecutor isn't putting on a preview that they should be put to his utmost proof at the first chance?

    We agree.

    Justice Frankfurter 
    Except when the Court of Appeals -- except in appellate tribunal makes the ruling of law. 
    I mean it could not have been anticipated or the Government state its evidence on this rule of law rather than that whether it would be conscientious and able, my mind as a prosecutor, may I say I don't think this is the theory of the case. 
    But the appellate court thinks otherwise and he reshapes his evidence?

    Mr. Rublee 
    That is not this case. 
    This case, the prosecutor was insufficiently sure that he had put on enough so that he allow the second degree charge to go to the jury.

    Mr. Rublee 
    The record does not show any discussion about the second degree charge, Mr. Justice Clark. 
    It just shows that both counsel for the Government, the prosecutor and the counsel for Green held the jury in their summations that the judge would be charging the jury on second degree as well as on first degree. 
    And the judge did so.

    The record does not (Voice Overlap) does not show that and neither Mr. Blow or myself presenting the case and we do not know this Your Honor, as to who initiated the idea of second degree. 
    One more thing about the Stroud case, there you do have a specific brief of guilty of a capital crime and an express recommendation of less than capital punishment. 
    But you're not there required to interpret as silenced on the capital charge and a specific verdict of less than the capital crime with a verdict of guilty of the capital charge.

    Justice Frankfurter 
    But I put it to you that something which is done by a statute would have violated the Constitution as being an ex post facto law is a pretty serious business when man is convicted in with a recommendation of life and the denial of a death that he can then get the death sentence. 
    That's not something legalistic as it's called, is it?

    No, Mr. Justice Frankfurter. 
    It's not -- but there, you're not tampering with what the jury found.

    You are --

    Justice Frankfurter 
    No, but -- but the jury is entrusted as it is with determining his sentence and in some states as -- on those recent in California, there's a regular hearing before the jury, a separate hearing on what kind of statute they should bring in. 
    And I can't imagine a bigger difference than being sentenced to death and not being sentenced to death.

    That's the Stroud case.

    Justice Frankfurter 
    But those are the words Mr. Rublee, the fact is that a fellow was sentenced for life and therefore he was negatively as possible sentenced not to die and then he takes the case up and they say on any theory of waiver, I should -- I don't see how one can escape on any theory or waiver and say we waive no more than as necessary. 
    It is to have a new trial. 
    He is not to have a fatal punishment, that isn't a waiver. 
    I don't what it is in the waiver. 
    I agree with Justice Holmes that waiver is nonsense in this matter.
