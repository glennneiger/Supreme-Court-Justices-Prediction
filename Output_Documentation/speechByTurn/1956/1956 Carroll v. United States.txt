Carroll v. United States
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="0.000" stopTime="22.962">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Number 571, Leon F. Carroll and Daniel J. Stewart, Petitioners, versus United States of America. 
    Mr. Mitchell you may proceed.
speaker="curtis_p_mitchell" startTime="22.962" stopTime="302.409">
    Mr. Curtis P. Mitchell 
    Honorable Chief Justice and Associate Justices of the Court. 
    Petitioner has come before this Court and complain that the Government does not have a right of appeal in the instance where the District Court has granted a motion to suppress evidence after indictment and pending trial. 
    In this case, if it please the Court, the petitioners has filed a motion to suppress evidence. 
    There is indication in the respondent's brief that there was also a motion to return property. 
    I might say to the Court that the two other defendants that is below, the motions having been denied as to them, the Government for some reason or other chose to dismiss. 
    There was no appeal taken from the granting of one of the motions in the lower court not respecting these petitioners here with respect to the return of property ceased from some premise. 
    So, as will be seen from a reading of the decision of the Court of Appeals, at page 31 of the record, that this case comes before this Court clearly on the question of the supression of evidence ceased from the person of the two petitioners here. 
    The Government, however, claims that under section 1291 of Title 28, they have a right of appeal. 
    Our contention is clear, we think, that there is no statutory right granted to the Government in the instance of the interlocutory order. 
    We claim that the order in this instance is interlocutory and we rely up on our proposition for the opinion rendered by this Honorable Court in the case of Cogen versus United States, the Cobbledick case and of the recent case in 1955 of Bodinger versus United States. 
    The Government also urges in their brief that a local statute which is Title 23, section 105 of the District of Columbia Code entitles them to proceed. 
    I respectfully submit to the Court on behalf of the petitioners that that grants them no relief because, first of all, Title 23, section 105 was passed upon by this Court in the case of United States versus Evans. 
    And I think that's to be found at 213 U.S.reports. 
    In addition, there is the section 17 -- Title 17, section 102 of the D.C.Code of which limits in the same fashion as section 1292 of Title 28 limits the right to appeal from interlocutory orders. 
    Moreover, the United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit did not rely upon the local statute, that is either Title 23 or Title 17 of the D.C.Code to justify their decision. 
    They squarely state that the decision of this case rests upon a prior decision of Cefaratti versus United States. 
    We sought a certiorari to this Court, but because of the matter of time, the petition not having been filed in time, it was denied. 
    Now, in that case, they state that they rely squarely upon the decisions of this Court in the Stack, Cohen and Swift cases. 
    I respectfully submit to the Court that the Stack case, the Cohen case and the Swift cases, all of them dealt with a civil matter and dealt with matters that were entirely independent of the issue in trial. 
    For instance, the Stack case as this Court will recall dealt with the matter of bond pending of person's appeal, a bail bond. 
    In the other case, it was a matter of the attachment dealing with the -- an admiralty manner. 
    And in the third, it was a matter of the posting of security of cause during the course of an appeal where there was a stock, a derivative action stockholder suit.

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    On the interpretation of the Court of Appeals that has given its local statute here, the only question, that the issue on this case is whether it's a final order or not.
speaker="curtis_p_mitchell" startTime="315.247" stopTime="315.680">
    Mr. Curtis P. Mitchell 
    Yes.

    That's the only thing (Inaudible)
speaker="curtis_p_mitchell" startTime="316.634" stopTime="449.385">
    Mr. Curtis P. Mitchell 
    That's the only thing. 
    Now, the Government as we see it and we urge upon this Court is in a rather anomalous position. 
    In order to rely upon finality as was set forth that is the -- the several bases on which finality might rest as determined in the Stack or of the Swift cases. 
    There is the fourth one which was not mentioned in the Cefaratti case. 
    And that is the one urging that the matter must be independent of the issue and trial. 
    Now, the Government attempts, I think rather feebly to straddle that issue by suggesting that this is independent of the trial. 
    However, on the other hand, they urge upon this Court as they did in the court below, that without this particular evidence, they are unable to go forward successfully. 
    We state that the failure or that is the paucity of their evidence is of no moment and we believe as the courts have held in the decisions I indicated to the Court like the Cohen case for instance, the Bodinger case and the Cobbledick case. 
    Now, incidentally, I did not cite -- I did not cite the Cobbledick case in our brief but the Cobbledick case is to be found at 309 U.S.beginning at page 323. 
    I might suggest that that was an opinion, I believe written by his Honor Judge Frank -- Justice Frankfurter. 
    So, as we see the case on the facts as they are at issue here, and as Mr. Justice Harlan has indicated, now the sole issue then is one of finality. 
    We say that there is no finality here that this evidence which has been suppressed by the Court is necessary by the Government's own confession and intercourses a necessary part in the whole trial procedure.

speaker="curtis_p_mitchell" startTime="504.827" stopTime="642.452">
    Mr. Curtis P. Mitchell 
    Mr. Justice Harlan I would have to answer you the same. 
    That does not go to the question of finality. 
    As a matter of fact, I think that lends more to the suggestion that it is an integral part of the trial proceeding itself. 
    And it seems to me that is therefore entirely consistent with the pronouncement of this Court in the Bodinger case against the honorable decisions for instance on the one hand and the allowance of piecemeal mere litigation on the other. 
    And there would fundamentally be the constitutional issue involved. 
    For instance as of this case, as you will notice from the record, we have been over three years. 
    So, therefore, the trial, the right of the speedy trial, the constitutional right to a speedy trial is necessarily involved in this issue because at any moment, in further answer to your question, that the Government felt and this is a conclusion left up entirely to the Government that they felt that they would be incapable of proceeding further successfully, than they would on -- on the occasion of an adverse ruling than they would want to appeal. 
    Certainly, this Court can appreciate the confusion that would reign in our appellate courts under such circumstances. 
    And also the confusion inhabited would prevail in the instance of the matter of trial, of litigation. 
    It would, as it has been done here, this trial -- the trial of these people has been held up for approximately three years. 
    I don't think that is consistent with the pronouncements of this Court. 
    We say that the Government in this instance does not come within the purview of the -- the statute, of the statute which regulates the matter of appeal on behalf of the Government and coming further to your question that it must come within the area of finality, that this being an integral part of the trial proceeding itself does not come properly as a final order or decree. 
    It's interlocutory therefore in the character and that the Government may not appeal from it. 
   
   
   
   Argument of Harold H. Greene
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="642.452" stopTime="643.546">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Greene.
speaker="harold_h_greene" startTime="643.546" stopTime="711.424">
    Mr. Harold H. Greene 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    In the context of this case there are two prerequisites to the appealability of the decision. 
    In the first place, there must be an existence of statute which confers appellate jurisdiction on the Court of Appeals. 
    Secondly, the decision from which the appeal is sought must be -- must qualify that final order. 
    And so far as the statutory jurisdiction is concerned, we rely primarily on the District of Columbia statute to which I will come in a moment. 
    We also rely on the section of the United States Code that is the general appeal section of the United States Code. 
    But both of those statutes require as a prerequisite to the operation that there be a final order, the final decision as distinguished from interlocutory decision. 
    And so, I'd like to address myself to that question first as to whether we have a final order in a decision which supresses the Government's evidence. 
    Now, basically, there are two criteria which are found in the decisions for determining, and for measuring whether a decision measures up to the test of finality.

    Mr. Harold H. Greene 
    That's at page 6 of the Government's brief. 
    That Title 23, section 105, District of Columbia Code provides, in all the criminal prosecutions, the United States for the District of Columbia as the case may be, can have the same right of appeal that is given to the defendant, including the right to a bill of exceptions, provided that if on such appeal it shall be found that there was error in the rulings of the Court during a trial, a verdict in favor of the defendant shall not be set aside.

speaker="harold_h_greene" startTime="1093.486" stopTime="1135.965">
    Mr. Harold H. Greene 
    Yes, but in the Cogen case, of course, we did have the problem of -- of a -- of an order denying a motion to suppress. 
    And the Court said it wasn't final there because the defendant had the right to renew his motion at trial. 
    It was interlocutory as to him. 
    But as to the Government, the rule specifically makes that precludes the Government from renewing the motion at the trial because it either provides for the return of the property to the defendant or if it's contraband then it provides that -- that problem shall be unavailable at any trial or hearing. 
    For the Cogen case, the very reasoning of the Cogen case cannot apply to an order which grants the motion to suppress. 
    But --

    Justice William O. Douglas 
    Well, that' the argument against Judge Stevens that was in.
speaker="harold_h_greene" startTime="1138.654" stopTime="1164.777">
    Mr. Harold H. Greene 
    Yes, Your Honor. 
    I might say that in the Cefaratti case in which Judge Stevens dissented, the petitioners here tried to obtain a hearing en banc in the instant case to overrule Cefaratti and that hearing en banc was denied unanimously by the -- by the Court of Appeals. 
    So, I take it at least the inference might be drawn at the present time, the Court of Appeals would adhere to the majority of the Cefaratti decision. 
    Now --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1164.777" stopTime="1188.197">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    If I may suggest, or at least for me, your great stumbling block is to get all of the facts that on the whole, the Government in the criminal case where there are no reasons, there's no right of appeal unless made very clearly that it has, even as to questions of law. 
    That's a very deep-rooted principle in our law. 
    In the Sanges case, in 144, made it abundantly clear.
speaker="harold_h_greene" startTime="1188.197" stopTime="1200.844">
    Mr. Harold H. Greene 
    Well this -- this statute that -- that the District of Columbia Code followed the Sanges case. 
    And Congress, I'd take it made clear its intention there to depart from the rule of the Sanges case by giving the Government the right to --

    Mr. Harold H. Greene 
    Well, may I say this on -- on the point as to why the -- why the construction shouldn't be adopted that the Government can only appeal if the defendant has the right to appeal at the same stage. 
    I suggest that then the statute would be -- utterly meaningless because the only stage at which -- at which the defendant can appeal is the stage of the judgment of conviction. 
    And obviously the Government cannot appeal at the same stage, namely, at -- at the stage of the Government -- of the judgment of acquittal.

    Justice Charles E. Whittaker 
    Well, couldn't that be changed by statute and does the statute do so?

    Mr. Harold H. Greene 
    The statute, yes. 
    That's --
speaker="charles_e_whittaker" startTime="1242.299" stopTime="1281.073">
    Justice Charles E. Whittaker 
    Now, is it within the power of Congress to permit the Government to appeal an adverse judgment in the criminal case -- in the criminal case. 
    And if so, does this statute do it? 
    I noticed it says that the United States shall have the same right of appeal. 
    Now, then if they are the same rights to appeal, they must be identical rights of appeal. 
    Will they be? 
    And each would then come after a judgment of finality because is there anything to that?
speaker="harold_h_greene" startTime="1281.073" stopTime="1299.208">
    Mr. Harold H. Greene 
    Well, that can't -- because it's impossible because of the Double Jeopardy Clause because the Government could obviously not appeal from the judgment of acquittal. 
    And this exception in the statute that provides or has been construed to preclude the Government from -- through appeal from the judgment of acquittal. 
    So, that's --
speaker="charles_e_whittaker" startTime="1299.208" stopTime="1311.913">
    Justice Charles E. Whittaker 
    Among the doctrine that is nearest maybe, you have to allow the Government to appeal now in -- in order to make the appeal equal with that of the defendant if there is to be one. 
    Is that your argument?
speaker="harold_h_greene" startTime="1311.913" stopTime="1341.504">
    Mr. Harold H. Greene 
    That's -- that's our position. 
    And the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia has construed the statute in that manner and this Court has said a number of times that in respect of matters of local law, the construction given by the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia should not be upset unless it's plainly unreasonable. 
    And I suggest that isn't plainly unreasonable here. 
   
   
   
   Rebuttal of Curtis P. Mitchell
speaker="curtis_p_mitchell" startTime="1341.504" stopTime="1342.407">
    Mr. Curtis P. Mitchell 
    May I?
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1342.407" stopTime="1346.871">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Yes you may go -- go ahead for a few minutes, sir.
speaker="curtis_p_mitchell" startTime="1346.871" stopTime="1392.813">
    Mr. Curtis P. Mitchell 
    First, if it please the Court. 
    In answer to Mr. Justice Whittaker's question, the answer to your question is similar -- somewhat similar to your own state (Inaudible) 
    It was originally the intention of Congress to give the District of Columbia and the United States Government in the District of Columbia the right of appeal in order that they would get what was in the nature of advisory opinions. 
    So the word same in there means that. 
    However, that issue came before this Court. 
    In the case of Evans, the United States versus Evans in which this Court held that they did not have the -- Congress could not grant them that authority. 
    Now, while that --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1392.813" stopTime="1398.162">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    May I interrupt you. 
    Is what was -- is the legislation that was in Evans, the same?
speaker="curtis_p_mitchell" startTime="1398.162" stopTime="1399.045">
    Mr. Curtis P. Mitchell 
    Yes, sir.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1399.045" stopTime="1400.091">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    And has remained the same?
speaker="curtis_p_mitchell" startTime="1400.091" stopTime="1457.666">
    Mr. Curtis P. Mitchell 
    Yes, sir. 
    Why it was not taken off the books, I'm unable to tell the Court. 
    Now, the criminal -- the Criminal Appeals Act was passed on 1948, subsequent of course to the enactment of Title 23, section 105. 
    And so obviously -- obviously, I would say that Congress must have had in contemplation of the preceding legislation and whatever rights and limitations they want to place upon the Government in that respect. 
    Now, the other thing that I wish to call to the Court's attention and which is contained in the brief in a brief fashion and that is, that the Government is now before this Court. 
    In effect, asking this Court to extend or to broaden the right of the Government's appeal. 
    And at the same time, the very same gentleman who is urging this before the Court was before Congress, asking Congress specifically to give him the authority to do what they say they now have the right to do under this so-called Rule now.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1457.666" stopTime="1475.467">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    You even have to answer the suggestion made by Mr. Greene that if you don't give a (Inaudible) application -- it's -- it's (Inaudible) it'd meaningless. 
    It doesn't -- has no function.
speaker="curtis_p_mitchell" startTime="1475.467" stopTime="1475.781">
    Mr. Curtis P. Mitchell 
    Well, Your Honor --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1475.781" stopTime="1486.273">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Do you see any -- do you see any situation in which this provision can become operative, if it doesn't do this one?
speaker="curtis_p_mitchell" startTime="1486.273" stopTime="1570.878">
    Mr. Curtis P. Mitchell 
    I don't -- I -- I say this. 
    That the establishment of the federal courts of the United States presuppose the -- the integrity of the members of the bank and I think that the District Courts are certainly capable of protecting the rights and interests of the United States in this regard. 
    I must also go back and look as Your Honor, Justice Frankfurter, has to the historical background. 
    Originally in common law, there was no right of appeal at all. 
    So now, that the Government is saying that they find themselves spoiled by the paucity of their own evidence. 
    Now, in the record, beginning at page 27, you'll find there, I think, seven type-written pages of what the Government contended below constituted evidence. 
    So, here they find themselves barred not because they don't have any evidence at all but because they say the -- the failure or the refusal on the part of the Court because of the constitutional prohibition to allow them to engage the use of the things that they seized from the person enables them to -- to proceed further successfully. 
    Now, as the Court said in the Rosenwasser case and in more recently in the Janitz case, that doesn't make a bit of difference. 
    And I think that that same sort of thing is really re-announced in this Court's opinion in the Bodinger case.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1570.878" stopTime="1577.200">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    But this -- but this -- the problem before it, there's the attached question of constitutionality at all, right?
speaker="curtis_p_mitchell" startTime="1577.200" stopTime="1578.808">
    Mr. Curtis P. Mitchell 
    I think it does, Your Honor.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1578.808" stopTime="1633.742">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    It's perfectly clear that the -- that the Government cannot get, double jeopardy precludes the Government from reviewing a finding on the merits in the criminal case in favor of the defendant. 
    On the other hand, as the Criminal Appeals Act, shows us again and again the Government can come up here from an adverse decision in a criminal case before it reaches the state of double of jeopardy on the question of law. 
    The District Court knocks out a statute as a matter of construction of constitutionality. 
    And ever since 1907, you can come up here. 
    Now, I don't think this would offend anything constitutionally for Congress to say that a question of law which determines a motion to suppress. 
    It adversely -- it decides to be determined by the District Court can be renewed by the Court of Appeals. 
    I do not think there's any constitutional obstacle.
