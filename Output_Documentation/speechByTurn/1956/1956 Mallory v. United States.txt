    In reference particularly to the admission of the evidence which was obtained pursuant to the so-called consent to service. 
    I believe that that evidence was illegally seized for this reason if Your Honor, please.I believe that the petitioner with his particular characteristics, his lack of training, some grave question as to what his mentality was, whether not even psychotic, no question about him being psychopathic, need of background, his youth, strangeness to the city, being incarcerated at the time that the so-called consent was given to him, I think that in this area that the -- and voluntariness within the contemplation of the federal rule that consents to search must be voluntary cannot be arrived at so that I have a two-pronged attack on the consent to search. 
    One is that it was a fruit of illegal detention and I think that the McNabb (Inaudible) certainly or logically would apply to anything gained as a result of illegal detention. 
    And then the other side of the coin that it was not voluntary in the -- according to the standard adopted by this jurisdiction. 
    Inasmuch as that's so, I think that the evidence admitted depends -- the trial wasn't -- the defendant -- that the petitioner who should not have been admitted and that their introduction was error which should cause the case to be reversed.

   Argument of Edward L. Barrett, Jr.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="136.912" stopTime="140.502">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Barrett.
speaker="edward_l_barrett_jr" startTime="140.502" stopTime="363.518">
    Mr. Edward L. Barrett, Jr. 
    May it please the Court. 
    I should like to address myself first to the McNabb question and reserving the other two questions for later consideration. 
    It's noteworthy that in this case; petitioner makes no claim that his confession was a result of coercion, physical or psychological. 
    The petitioner himself testified in this case that he had been treated kindly and made no complaint with respect to actual coercion. 
    The petitioner's claim on the McNabb point is essentially that Rule 5 (a) must be interpreted as forbidding any delay in taking a person before the committing magistrate, other than that physically necessary for locating a magistrate and transporting the prisoner there. 
    We then argued that under the McNabb rule, any confession obtained during a period of delay and beyond that must be excluded. 
    Now, the Government concedes, of course, that the police could have found a committing magistrate and brought the petitioner before him within a relatively short time after his arrest at 2:30 on a Thursday afternoon. 
    It is the Government's petition -- position, the Rule 5 (a) must be given a broader interpretation. 
    That delay may be necessary within the meaning of the Rule beyond the time physically necessary to take an arrested person before a magistrate. 
    That the delay in this case was necessary on a reasonable interpretation of the Rule and that hence from McNabb rule does not apply to exclude this confession. 
    The facts in this case, we think, are an excellent example of the reason why a mechanical interpretation of Rule 5 (a) as applying only to the time actually necessary to find a magistrate to take a man before him, would be an undesirable interpretation. 
    Consider what you have here. 
    A rape was committed in the basement of an apartment house. 
    The facts are that this basement may be reached by a set of wooden stairs or through a door, into a janitor's apartment. 
    The courts investing the right of the victim, tells the police that after she came down to this basement to do her washing, she heard nobody come down these set of wooden stairs. 
    That's conceded. 
    And the petitioner himself conceded that he had been in the room shortly before the rape and to help the victim with a hose. 
    The inference at this point was that -- probability was that the person who committed the crime came from the janitor's apartment. 
    The description given by the victim would have fitted generally, apparently, the petitioner and his two nephews. 
    A tall, Negro with bright eyes, with a white hat, was about as much as the victim was able to say at this stage of the game. 
    So, hereafter, preliminary investigation, the police were faced with the fact that on the physical evidence there was a reasonable suspicion at least that one of these three people committed the rape. 
    Further investigation apparently disclosed that the petitioner and one of his nephews had disappeared. 
    The next morning, at some point, it's not clear from the record. 
    The police picked up the two nephews, brought them into the police station and questioned them. 
    That record doesn't disclose how long or under what circumstances with respect to the crime. 
    They finally found the petitioner at 2:30 in the afternoon.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="363.518" stopTime="366.238">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Would you mind finishing what they did with the nephews?
speaker="edward_l_barrett_jr" startTime="366.238" stopTime="404.993">
    Mr. Edward L. Barrett, Jr. 
    The nephews stayed and I'll deal with that. 
    The nephews were at the police station when the petitioner was brought in. 
    They brought the petitioner in and they questioned him. 
    Now, several officers were apparently present during the questioning though the record doesn't tell us much about this. 
    And, it's well to remember that this case was tried well over a year after the arrest. 
    So that everybody's memories with respect to the details were undoubtedly fuzzy. 
    He was questioned -- it's probable, though the record is not entirely clear that he was questioned in the presence of his two nephews. 
    He said that they --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="404.993" stopTime="407.943">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    They picked up without a warrant?
speaker="edward_l_barrett_jr" startTime="407.943" stopTime="436.696">
    Mr. Edward L. Barrett, Jr. 
    Insofar as I know, the record doesn't disclose anything on that but I assume he was picked up without a warrant. 
    Apparently he testified. 
    The petitioner testified that his nephews and his brother were questioned -- were present when he was questioned at this initial period. 
    Officer (Inaudible) testified that the nephews were present, part of the time. 
    One of the nephews testified that he didn't think the petitioner was questioned in his presence. 
    That's about the state of the record on that point. 
    After a period of questioning which was --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="436.696" stopTime="442.026">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    But would that help -- would that help any if other suspects were in at the questioning?
speaker="edward_l_barrett_jr" startTime="442.026" stopTime="445.596">
    Mr. Edward L. Barrett, Jr. 
    Well, there were other suspects, plus his brother who apparently was not a suspect --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="445.596" stopTime="445.856">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Oh, I thought --
speaker="edward_l_barrett_jr" startTime="445.856" stopTime="446.206">

    -- within this case.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="446.206" stopTime="449.076">

speaker="edward_l_barrett_jr" startTime="449.076" stopTime="466.629">
    Mr. Edward L. Barrett, Jr. 
    There's -- I'm not -- this record isn't clear but my assumption from the record is the brother who was an older man evidently were -- was never suspected here. 
    It was the two nephews and that record only shows interrogation of the defendant and the two nephew -- the petitioner and the two nephews. 
    Nothing would respect to his brother.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="466.629" stopTime="470.889">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    They've been interrogating in the morning of the two nephews?
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="470.889" stopTime="612.602">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    The record just doesn't disclose. 
    Part -- there's nothing in the printed record, the original record that's on file with the court shows that the other nephews were brought in at some point during the morning -- they testified that they were brought in to the police station during the morning. 
    But that -- that we assume they were questioned. 
    But the record isn't clear. 
    This wasn't brought into focus in the trial. 
    Now the petitioner was brought in and he was questioned, the officer said 15 to 30 minutes, he said 30 to 45 minutes. 
    After this questioning he was taken, this had been -- taken place apparently in the Identification Bureau. 
    He was then taken to the Sex Squad office where in the presence, he testified of his brother and his two nephews, the police asked them if the three of them would consent to take a lie detector test to determine apparently who was telling the truth. 
    Petitioner in his testimony doesn't question the voluntariness of his consent to take a lie detector test. 
    And the nephews testified that -- that they were asked. 
    And they all agreed to take the lie detector test. 
    Now, all of the delay after this time was consumed in waiting for the officer to arrive, who gave lie detector test and in giving the test first to the two nephews and finally to the petitioner. 
    The brothers alone -- fuzziness on this issue, the -- the record seems to bear out statement that from about 4 o'clock in the afternoon until 8 o'clock when the petitioner was taken in for the lie detector test, he sat on a chair in the Sex Squad office with one or both of his nephews. 
    It's not clear whether his brother was there all or part of the time. 
    He was apparently there at the beginning of this period. 
    They were given food and drink. 
    They received no other guarding. 
    And that was implied in sitting in the back of an office where police were coming and going. 
    We don't contend, of course, they were free to leave. 
    There's no question about that. 
    And while there's a little conflict on this, most of the evidence suggests that they weren't questioned during this time. 
    Petitioner himself said that he didn't remember any questioning during this period. 
    They just sat in the office and waited.

    Let me ask you one more question. 
    Suppose he had declined to subject himself to the lie detector or suppose he had a lawyer and the lawyer said, "Don't you submit to that," and he -- that would have been clearly within his rights wouldn't it?

    Suppose the lawyer had said, "Don't you do it. 
    The lie detector is not yet established as a wonderful scientific instrument. 
    There are doubts and worries about the conditions under which it's given, et cetera. 
    All the things that you and I know." 
    That will be all right, wouldn't it?

    He wasn't isolated from family and friends at least in the sense of being secreted in the back room. 
    He was held in an office, his brother was evidently in and out. 
    And the -- the situation is -- is different but not, I suggest, perhaps materially, different than if he'd been asked the question in his home when you come down to the police station and take the lie detector test.

    Now, this particular psychiatrist also said the patient appeared to be dull and apathetic and mildly confused. 
    No former psychological test were given but the estimate of his intelligence, is that of a moron.

    He -- he had come up to the -- from -- he had come here not -- two or three months before the event from Greenville, South Carolina for six or seven weeks. 
    And as I remember in the transcript it shows that he'd been taken some trips in the moving van and in fact the day that -- when he'd gone out somewhere in Maryland to look for a job and -- but no permanent fixed occupation.

    Mr. Edward L. Barrett, Jr. 
    Well, at -- at 2:30 or 3 o'clock he was somewhere between 15 and 45 minutes, the longest estimate is 45. 
    The petitioner says 30 to 45 and then it was an hour and a half that he was with Officer McCarthy in the room with the polygraph at which apparently about 20 to 25 minutes was consumed with asking questions while he was hooked up to the machine. 
    He was asked the questions ahead of this and after. 
    Then after that hour and a half when he had confessed to Officer McCarthy, then other officers were brought in and he repeated his confession to them. 
    Now, the record doesn't disclose quite how long that took, apparently 10 or 15 minutes.

    Well, our -- our contention on the McNabb point here then is that under these circumstances, a serious crime of violence had been committed. 
    The police had reasonable grounds for suspecting one or three persons, either the nephews or the petitioner had committed this crime. 
    The police, upon arresting the petitioner could not very well have taken him immediately before a magistrate and singled him out to file a complaint that he was the person who had done it.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Wasn't suspected?
speaker="edward_l_barrett_jr" startTime="1489.295" stopTime="1719.417">
    Mr. Edward L. Barrett, Jr. 
    Maybe he didn't -- maybe he didn't met -- meet the general physical description. 
    That I don't know. 
    It was the two nephews and his two sons, in other words and the defendant, petitioner here who were the suspects. 
    Now, under these circumstances, to say to the police that you have to either not take these people in and question them or you have to pick one out and taking, and file a charge, a complaint against them before a Commissioner. 
    They weren't in the position to do this. 
    Now, this is not like Upshaw. 
    In the Upshaw case, you had a different situation. 
    You had the police suspecting an individual, had the policeman of the court know or was testifying that the reason they held this individual is to get a confession from him. 
    Here you have a different situation. 
    You have three logical suspects. 
    The reason the police did what they did here was to try to eliminate. 
    There, about the only investigative technique left to the police in this case at this time was to question the suspects. 
    They weren't going to get physical evidence that would pick anybody out. 
    They were going to be no eyewitnesses. 
    And so they were questioning these three people who logically might have committed the crime under these circumstances. 
    I assume that the petitioner never confessed. 
    That -- that on -- as a result of the questioning the police have then let loose the two nephews and charged him with the crime. 
    That there wouldn't be as much feeling about illegality as there is here because he ultimately did -- he ultimately did confess. 
    There are lots of other situations which are just similar to this one. 
    The police for example, a man is shot in the street. 
    Officers rushing to the scene may see two or three people running away. 
    Maybe somebody in the crowd says, "He shot him, he shot him." 
    Under the circumstances they have to make an arrest. 
    And they have to make some inquiry before they take the step of filing a formal charge against one of these individuals with the crime. 
    It seems to be generally conceded by most of the authorities that -- that there is a necessity for some amount of investigation in this kind of a situation. 
    Now, there may be serious questions as to how best it should be done. 
    The Government, of course, is sympathetic with the -- with the underlying purpose of the McNabb rule. 
    We recognize the evils of secret interrogation, the evils of the -- of the third degree. 
    But we suggest however, to apply the McNabb rule, purely mechanically, is only a question of time. 
    It goes too far and rules out, confessions that are -- or rules out, it's not just that it rules out confessions but brand this illegal, perfectly reasonable police practices which have nothing to do with beating up the man in the back room. 
    This case is -- is a good example. 
    It could not be said that the petitioner here was held incommunicado. 
    That he was secreted in the back room. 
    He was held out in the -- with his nephews, apparently with his brother in the offices of the police. 
    The only time in which he could be said to have been taken off into the back room is the hour and a half that he spent with the polygraph operator and where the -- he was questioned in this -- this small room.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1719.417" stopTime="1743.066">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Mr. Barrett, as you well know, McNabb isn't merely concerned, wasn't concern merely with a fellow being beaten up in the back room. 
    It was concerned primarily that occasion be made out against the defendant to his -- to himself. 
    Now, of course, if you got beating up from the back room that night, everybody is used to that. 
    But --
speaker="edward_l_barrett_jr" startTime="1743.066" stopTime="1756.113">
    Mr. Edward L. Barrett, Jr. 
    Well -- well, the Government are -- The Government's position here is that it would certainly be a -- a drastic change in law enforcement practices and we suggest it's nothing --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1756.113" stopTime="1766.285">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    The McNabb rule was intended very considerably to change conventional methods of law enforcement. 
    That's the point of the rule.
speaker="edward_l_barrett_jr" startTime="1766.285" stopTime="1774.295">
    Mr. Edward L. Barrett, Jr. 
    There's nothing in what was said or decided in McNabb or Upshaw which carries it as far as the contention made in this case.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1774.295" stopTime="1776.035">

    That maybe.

    And --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1776.285" stopTime="1808.528">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    But it wasn't merely a rule designed to prevent physical violence as a mode of extorting confession. 
    That was precisely indicated that that was not the reason for it or even for it and it didn't want to create circumstances as I indicated in which you get stuff out of the defendant and have -- instead of having the Government, the prosecutor generally go about the business in establishing through resourceful energy and imagination and enterprise, a case other than out of the mouth of the defendant.
speaker="edward_l_barrett_jr" startTime="1808.528" stopTime="1841.960">
    Mr. Edward L. Barrett, Jr. 
    This case I think, Your Honor, is a good example of the situation in which if you don't permit police interrogation of the suspects, you don't convict people. 
    You get often, these cases where the resources of the physical evidence of eye witnesses are exhausted and -- and what you have left is the need for some names under which the police can interrogate these people. 
    They -- they had to talk to these three people in the interest of the society.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1841.960" stopTime="1858.656">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    I saw it here. 
    The fellow had a lawyer who told him, you don't open your mouth. 
    You -- the police wouldn't have (Inaudible) up their head and said, "We can file about this case." 
    Wouldn't they? 
    I shouldn't imagine that responsible police would do that. 
    They will -- if he can't get it out of his own mouth, therefore we stop doing anything.
speaker="edward_l_barrett_jr" startTime="1858.656" stopTime="1872.830">
    Mr. Edward L. Barrett, Jr. 
    But presumably if -- if only his lawyer told him that, the police would still have the evidence that they received from the statements of the people who were not guilty, in this case, the two nephews.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Well, that wouldn't be -- you could put that in a proof in the trial.

    Now, the police were in the position of having gotten each -- each man's story. 
    And it was at that point that the suggestion was made that, will you be willing to take the lie detector test?

    Mr. Edward L. Barrett, Jr. 
    Actually the problem here it seems to me stems from the fact that we haven't had an exercise of either statutory or rule making power to spell out precisely what it is the police ought to be able to do. 
    Many authorities have contended over the years that there should be some regularized procedure for questioning suspects. 
    That maybe it should be done, some suggestions have been made that it should be done by the Commissioner. 
    Other suggestions, the Uniform Arrest Act, for example, suggested that the police should -- that the police should be able to take the man before the Commissioner and the Commissioner should have discretion to release him to the custody of the police for up to 48 hours for reasonable investigation before the police would have the necessity to file a -- a complaint. 
    We haven't had either to rule making or to the legislature a careful spelling out of what ought to be done. 
    Now -- now we suggest that the -- that the position of society is not just the police who're suspecting here. 
    Obviously the interests in society are that we ought to apprehend people who commit rape, other serious crimes. 
    Obviously the privacy of the victim here was very severely debated and perhaps there was a risk of the privacy of other women, would -- would be invaded. 
    And that we have to balance in all of these cases the public interest in reducing private, illegal invasion to privacy among the public. 
    Now, I recognize that public officers are obviously held to a higher standard, but we suggest that what was done here doesn't offend the moral sense and that it was certainly not clear to -- to the police here, for example, that what they were doing was a violation of law. 
    As we point in our brief, almost without exception, the Courts of Appeals since McNabb and Upshaw have recognized in the cases the necessity for some detention other than that absolutely necessary to take the man before a magistrate. 
    And there's a whole string of cases in this circuit and other circuits where the police have -- where the courts have not applied the McNabb rule in that literal mechanical sense that -- that the only thing is relevant. 
    Such an application has certain curious circumstances, too, unrelated to the policy. 
    If you couldn't find a magistrate the 24 hours, presumably then the police could question a man for 24 hours as long they didn't interfere with the voluntary rule. 
    But in another case where you could find one in five minutes, you couldn't question him at all. 
    And this doesn't seem to be the -- the correct solution to -- to the problem that's involved here.

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Well, Mr. Barrett, is there any background to the phraseology of this rule to indicate that unnecessary delay contemplated the circumstances under which the delay was incident to an investigation after an arrest?
speaker="edward_l_barrett_jr" startTime="2302.337" stopTime="2348.469">
    Mr. Edward L. Barrett, Jr. 
    Well, really all we know, I suppose is that the previous statutes that you set out in a footnote on page 22 of the Government's brief talked in terms of taking him forthwith before some judicial officer or the person arrested shall be immediately taken before a committing officer. 
    Now, the -- the other people have out that the legislative history here originally was more in terms of cutting down on the expense money that the commission -- that the police got by taking them long distance is to arraignment rather than in the problem we're dealing with here but that's beside the point. 
    When the Rule 5 (a) was promulgated, it didn't use forthwith It didn't use immediately. 
    It used unnecessary delay.

    Mr. Edward L. Barrett, Jr.

    Essentially our position here is that the consequences to law enforcement the -- are -- are the mechanical interpretation would be such that we don't think that the court should take that step. 
    That if you have suggestion of coercion for the whole or psychological course, the confession goes on. 
    That if you have the -- the McNabb kind of a -- I mean the Upshaw kind of situation where the police pulled a man in and questioned him for 30 hours as they say for the sole purpose of getting a confession. 
    We can see that the McNabb rule applies. 
    But though we say that there are other cases of which this is an illustration where this shouldn't be applied that --- that it should be said that it's reasonable for the police to engage in brief periods of investigation which resulted in this case in bringing two suspects and holding one.

    They had self-consciousness of doing right. 
    (Inaudible) is true but that leaves it open to the police authorities to hold on without presenting him, that without arraignment so long as they're satisfied, they're doing something conscientious if you please.

    Not merely -- not merely in fixing guilt on the suspect, but in establishing whether he is guilty lest they hold an innocent man.

    But what was -- what was the criteria that it was a reasonable thing for police to do in order to ascertain whether this fellow was there or he wasn't there? 
    That leaves out of the count a whole -- maybe for myself. 
    The central concept of our prosecutorial system and the central concept that arraignment intervened in order to have the magistrate tell the fellow, "You can keep your mouth shut.

    This Court decided where it was only after the defendant had confessed to the crime so that he had made his confession to the crime that he then having confessed the crime said, "Now, I let you search." 
    And he signed a written consent So, it was explicit. 
    There wasn't any problem to that to search. 
    So, we -- we say that the -- the search stands or falls really on the confession. 
    That -- that had once having voluntarily made a confession of the crime, this was essentially what happened in the Mitchell case, he confessed and then he said, "You can go and -- and get this evidence." 
    Now, on the question of the jury, position of the Government here that the judge did probably the only thing he could have done -- once the jury had asked a question. 
    Now, we say you can't say, petitioner said that the jury was not concerned with this issue. 
    Congress in its wisdom had seen fit to -- to create the situation where the penalty for the crime is either an indeterminate sentence for 10 to 30 years or death. 
    The jury decides whether or not it shall be death. 
    The judge then decides if they don't say death, what -- what it shall be up to a maximum of 10 to 30. 
    Well, of course, the jury is sentencing here. 
    The jury is deciding, "Shall this man die?" 
    But it seems to us that the jury could not rationally decide that issue without knowing the alternatives. 
    And once the jury asked the question that they did here, it's clear that they were speculating on the alternatives. 
    What's going to happen to this man if we don't give him the death penalty? 
    And can be it said that it's more of a prejudice to defendant to have speculation without fact or -- or to give them the fact. 
    Now, as we find out in the footnote in our brief on page 39, Crow against United States which this Court, it was up on certiorari on another point. 
    This Court provided certiorari. 
    You have the situation come up and -- and the judge points us the other way. 
    He refused to ask -- answer the jury's questions about probation. 
    The jury wouldn't have him against the for death penalty anyway. 
    Now, this is not the kind of a case where we can see that you do work the kind of a case where the instruction is apt to (Inaudible) the issue of reasonable doubt. 
    That is where the jury is interested in -- is in seeing well if we find him guilty, he maybe able to get off in five years. 
    And well we're not really sure whether he did but it's only five years, so we'll find him guilty. 
    This -- this one is that kind of a case. 
    The petitioner under the circumstances of this case what the jury said was clear. 
    They have no question about guilt. 
    This wasn't a question about being reasonable doubt as to guilt. 
    Their ultimate finding I suppose was that. 
    That what they were concerned with is, "Do we give him the death penalty?" 
    And on the Winston case, the Court said they could consider the broad spectrum and -- and the Government's position is that -- that most certainly that they've asked the question. 
    That they have raised the issue that they have come into the Court and said, "Will he be held for his natural life only?" 
    The judge did here, the only reasonable thing to do.We suggested that if he's -- if he had refused to do this and the death penalty had been convicted, the counsel for the petitioner could with as much reason perhaps have argued that that was prejudicial to the defendant under the circumstances. 
    Arguing then that well, maybe they thought he would only get two years or five years. 
    So, you wouldn't know what they thought his -- his ultimate period of incarceration would be. 
    So, our contention essentially then is that -- that once they made the issue was certainly irrelevant that the issue they would decide, should the man die? 
    And this can't be decided solely in terms of the -- of the crime and the nature and the circumstances as the jury is bound to want to know if there's evidence here, what's the alternative? 
    Now, it may be that the unfortunate thing here is that Congress fixed these alternatives so far apart and that -- and that the -- perhaps that is the -- maybe if the alternatives had been life and death, the Court would have found that the jury would not have found death. 
    But that's that fault of -- of the statute, not with what the judge did here.

    We assume that -- that if this case is -- would -- were reversed on the issue of the charge here, it would have to be retried. 
    But the statute confers upon the jury the discretion of deciding whether or not that shall be given. 
    And it certainly cannot be said here as a matter of law the jury was wrong in giving the death penalty. 
    And that if the case goes back, presumably, it will have to be retried before another jury and give them an opportunity to exercise the -- the discretion that's involved here because there seems to be -- it seems -- it seems to be a difficult case and needs to separate these two things out since under the statute, the jury has the discretion to decide. 
    And it's not the kind of a case in which an appellate court can say as a matter of law they should have decided it the other way. 
    It's just like any other case where there was an error committed and it -- it's found to be prejudicial, it would then go back.

    That's right, sir. 
    Our case is a little different. 
    Now, just on the McNabb, I want to say one final word on the McNabb point. 
    That it seems that the history of the committing -- committing the legislation indicates the language without unnecessary delay would certainly be interpreted to -- to permit delay or procrastination only because of the unavailability of committing authorities. 
    And I say that for this reason. 
    In the District of Columbia Circuit, over a period of time, they have -- there's been some interpretation of this rule and one of the judges or -- or two of them has seen fit to concur especially in some of those cases for this reason. 
    They have determined that the delay was not -- was not unnecessary by virtue of late evening arrest or Sunday arrest or holiday arrest. 
    In other words, the question of necessary is still determined by the availability of the Commissioner and the element of choice.
