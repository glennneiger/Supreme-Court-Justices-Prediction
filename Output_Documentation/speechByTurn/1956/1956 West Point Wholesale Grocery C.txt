West Point Wholesale Grocery Company v. City of Opelika

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Number 478, West Point Wholesale Grocery Company, Appellant, versus City of Opelika, Alabama. 
    Mr. Schlesinger.
speaker="m_r_schlesinger" startTime="41.105" stopTime="417.202">
    Mr. M. R. Schlesinger 
    Mr. Chief Justice, members of the Court, may it please the Court. 
    In the case at bar, the City of Opelika, Alabama has imposed a flatsum license tax upon local merchants -- upon non-local merchants entering its jurisdiction from the outside. 
    A tax necessarily discriminatory in its operation and indeed a tax which is discriminatory and in regard merely to the face of the ordinance itself in view of a contrasting rate structure applied to local merchants. 
    This controversy reaches this Court upon appeal from a fine judgment by an Alabama Court of Appeals. 
    That Court of Appeals in turn affirmed an Alabama trial court's action in sustaining the defendant city's demurrer to the plaintiff's complaint for refund of tax. 
    The Alabama Supreme Court having denied certiorari, the appeal has been taken from the judgment of the appellate court. 
    Since this appeal calls into action -- calls into question the state courts' action upon the defendant's demurrer, the fact as set out in the plaintiff's compliant are of critical importance. 
    May I therefore review those facts in a rather brief fashion. 
    Section 82 of the Opelika City license schedule for the year 1953 imposed an annual license or privilege tax upon wholesale merchants. 
    That tax was according to certain graduated amounts depending upon the bracket of gross business, annual gross business into which the merchant happened to fall. 
    By way of example, Your Honors will observe that the lowest bracket requiring a tax of $35 was where the merchant did less than 100,000 of business a year, the top amount of $250 was reached when the merchant's business exceeded to a million dollars per year. 
    And in addition, Section 82 imposed a tax at a very small fraction of 1% upon the gross business done by the merchant. 
    Now, that, if the Court please, is Section 82 but Section 82 applies only to wholesalers delivering wares in the City of Opelika from a point within Opelika. 
    For merchants delivering goods from outside Opelika into the City of Opelika, two special sections are applicable. 
    The first of those special sections is Section 130. 
    It imposes on merchants -- on persons and firms et cetera bringing goods in from outside and delivering them in Opelika, an annual tax of $100. 
    That, however, is inapplicable to wholesale grocers who bring goods in from outside the City. 
    And that brings me to the second special section if I may say a special, special section, Section 130 (a), which is the Section with which this Court is primarily concerned. 
    Section 130 (a) imposes an annual flatsum license tax of $250 upon wholesale grocers who deliver in the City of Opelika wares which they have brought in -- grocers -- groceries which they have brought in from outside of the City. 
    May I therefore review in very bird's eye fashion the three taxing patterns that we have here. 
    We have here Section 130 (a), imposing an annual license tax of $250 on wholesale grocers who bring in to Opelika from outside the City groceries. 
    Secondly, we have a $100 annual license tax, not of primary concern here which applies to others bringing in merchandise from outside the City and delivering in the City. 
    Finally, we have under Section 82 a favorable rate structure, a structure geared to gross receipts but applicable only to merchants delivering goods in Opelika from a point within the City of Opelika. 
    Now, as to the plaintiff in this action, the plaintiff is a wholesale grocer who delivered from his business over in Georgia groceries to his retail merchant customers in the City of Opelika. 
    Those deliveries were pursuant to orders taken by its salesmen which orders were transmitted over to the plaintiff in Georgia and accepted by it in Georgia. 
    The shipments, made pursuant to those orders, were in a continuous movement in the interstate commerce from Georgia into Alabama. 
    The plaintiff is a Georgia corporation. 
    Its only place of business is in Georgia. 
    It has no inventory stock of goods or office in the State of Alabama.

    Mr. M. R. Schlesinger 
    Yes, sir. 
    That is quite right, Mr. Justice Douglas. 
    And that would prompt me to observe that the fact that this tax is, you might say, more rather than less discriminatory or more rather than less burdensome on non-local business does not make it any of the less discriminatory or burdensome against interstate business. 
    But Your Honor is quite right, the discrimination involved here was not merely against Georgia business let us say but could very well have applied to Birmingham shippers as well. 
    The plaintiff paid the $250 pursuant to Section 130 (a), required of it to enter this Opelika market and it then brought this suit for refund, filing a complaint for refund of tax based upon constitutional grounds and particularly upon the principle that Section 130 (a) involving a $250 flatsum license tax violates the Commerce Clause as being an undue burden upon interstate commerce and as being discriminatory against interstate commerce.

    Mr. M. R. Schlesinger 
    Yes, sir. 
    I -- I would still be here, if Your Honor please. 
    That's one of our two points as Your Honor's question suggest and I should like to dwell on that at a little greater length in a moment if I may. 
    I was adverting to the plaintiff's complaint and as I've already indicated, the defendant's demurrer to that complaint was sustained so we're here on the facts as set out in that complaint. 
    Now, it is our position that this tax constituted an unconstitutional burden on interstate commerce for two reasons. 
    And before adverting to the point made by Mr. Chief Justice Warren, may I first observe that our first ground for complaint here is that the statute is unconstitutional on its face in view of the more favorable fair tax structure which was applied to local merchants. 
    And I refer in particular in that case and in this connection it becomes necessary to look at Section 82 of the city license schedule. 
    Section 82 imposes a graduated tax approximately proportionate to gross receipts on local merchants. 
    Section 130 (a) by contrast imposes upon wholesale grocers delivering groceries from a point outside Opelika the flatsum tax of $250. 
    And I think it is of some interest to this Court surely in connection with this first proposition that in order for our plaintiff taxpayer over in Georgia, required to pay this $250 tax, to bring his rate of taxation down to the rate paid by local wholesale grocers. 
    It would be necessary for him to ship in and sell in this community of something less than 13,000 soaps in amount of groceries at wholesale prices in excess in one single year, in excess of a quarter of a million dollars.

    Mr. M. R. Schlesinger 
    Yes, sir. 
    What I attempted to do, Mr. Justice Black, is to take Section 82 and compute at what point a local merchant would have paid $250 under that graduated schedule and it happens to break at $280,000.

    The point being that in view of the contrasting treatment between Section 82 on the one hand and Section 130 (a) on the other hand, we submit to this Court that a more flagrant attempt by local merchants, by local wholesale grocers to thwart out-of-state non-local business in competition with them can scarcely be imagined.

    That's right. 
    That's right, sir. 
    Now, may I advert to the second proposition which was suggested by Mr. Chief Justice Warren, the statute is unconstitutional for a second reason and in this connection, it is unnecessary to look to Section 82, it is unnecessary at any rate to dwell on the treatment, the favorable treatment, the fair treatment which is accorded to the local merchants pursuant to that graduated gross receipts tax. 
    Suffice to say in this connection that wholesale grocers dealing in interstate commerce are subject under Section 130 (a) to a flatsum license tax. 
    A flatsum tax which they must pay, as Mr. Justice Frankfurter has suggested, before they enter the market and a flatsum tax which must be paid regardless of the amount of business done. 
    In Nippert against City of Richmond in 1946, the Supreme Court carefully delineated the discriminatory nature of the flatsum taxes as applied against any incident of the interstate commerce. 
    And in the course of its opinion, it reaffirmed and reemphasized its position respecting these flatsum license taxes as are brought out in the long line of cases, the so-called drummer cases starting with Robbins against Shelby County Taxing District back in 1887.

    I don't recall which wrote the dissenting opinion there, expressed some contradictory views based on the fact that local merchants having a place of business in the jurisdiction, the tax to which they were subject was not indicated in the record which was before the Court. 
    But if the Court please, the essence of the distinction taken by this Court in its Berwind-White opinion between flatsum license taxes on the one hand and in that case a sales tax on the other hand was equality of rate structure. 
    Now, this local municipality can provide for equality of rate structure, it hasn't done that though. 
    So --

    Mr. M. R. Schlesinger 
    I should think they could do it, if Your Honor please, either by a compensating use or property tax or if they want to follow what is perhaps the invitation suggested by this Court in -- in its Berwind-White opinion by a sales tax on the sales in the jurisdiction even though they'd be interstate sales. 
    And may I dwell on that point for just a moment since Your Honor has asked the question. 
    The Court will recall in the Berwind-White opinion, this Court held that a tax on an interstate sale by the point of destination, in that case it was New York City, is constitutional their being equality of rate with local sales and the seller incidentally having a local sales office. 
    Now, as the Court is more aware than I am amongst those outside of the Court, the debate rages as to whether this Court will eventually hold that the state of destination may always impose a sales tax whether or not there is a sales office. 
    But my point is that the Berwind-White case is thought to have gone a long way in permitting equality of rate structure but we're not even at that point here. 
    We're on the flatsum license tax.

    Now, this is -- this is not -- not quite either of those, is it, for the simple -- this also would be bad if no outside or no -- if -- if there weren't equality between the Georgia and the Birmingham? 
    That's a complicating factor, isn't it?
speaker="m_r_schlesinger" startTime="1202.923" stopTime="1343.955">
    Mr. M. R. Schlesinger 
    No, these flatsum taxes had never -- I don't think ever been in terms of the discrimination between state and interstate commerce. 
    I believe let's take Nippert against City of Richmond or one of the alternative grounds under Memphis Steam Laundry there was a -- no, I'll strike that, Memphis Steam Laundry was a Tennessee tax but in Nippert, at any rate, it was a local tax. 
    Now, the defendant seeks to distinguish of all these Supreme Court cases, respecting the invalidity of a flatsum license tax as such and particularly the Nippert, the Memphis Steam Laundry and the old Robbins case on the grounds that a tax and I quote from its brief at page 4 from the defendants brief at page 4, “On the ground that the tax in those cases was levied upon the solicitation, the Court will bear in mind that the tax here is on delivery, was levied on the solicitation of sales to be later consummated by delivering in interstate commerce." 
    Furthermore at the foot at page 4, the defendant in it's brief to leave no doubts about that distinction which the defendant is seeking to have this Court adopt says, "This Court has never said that there is any impropriety in the levy of a flatsum license on the incident of delivery." 
    Now, in point of fact and at least two of the drummer cases which recited in Berwind-White, Caldwell against North Carolina which appears and I -- we have not had the opportunity of filing a reply brief, Mr. Chief Justice, which appears in 187 U.S.622 and in Crenshaw against Arkansas 227 U.S.389. 
    This Court did hold that a flatsum license tax on delivery was bad. 
    I must concede however that most of the questions which have arisen before this Court have involved the problem of whether a tax on solicitation is as bad as a tax on delivery. 
    The Court however has indicated that it is but suffice to say they were concerned with delivery, we're concerned with the worst -- worst leg of the question as it were in this particular controversy.

    Mr. M. R. Schlesinger 
    Well -- now, in furtherance of this proposition that although a tax on delivery is -- although a tax on solicitation is good, a tax on delivery as in this case is all right. 
    The defendant in its brief relies upon this Court's opinion in its Berwind-White case. 
    Now, let's just look at that case very briefly, it dealt as already indicated with a sale tax on an interstate sale. 
    In the course of its opinion, the Supreme Court reaffirmed at great length its flatsum decisions. 
    The defendant at page 4 quotes from a sentence from the remarks of that Court, and may I indicate that the quotation is from a part of a sentence from the remarks of this Court and omitted are the -- is a phrase at the beginning of the sentence in the clause of the conclusion of that sentence. 
    Be that as it may however, a reading of that complete sentence from which the defendant has excised the part and a reading of the complete paragraph from which it has been brawn would indicate the Supreme Court's thinking, respecting the invalidity of a flatsum tax not being confined to solicitation before commerce and therefore all right on delivery itself. 
    If there is to be any distinction and it is the defendant who suggest a distinction between a tax on delivery and a tax on solicitation. 
    Surely, the case wherein validity is no -- is the case wherein validity is clearer when the tax is on the delivery in interstate commerce then it -- is it in the case of a tax on solicitation to be followed by interstate commerce which is not to say however that the appellant suggests that any distinction be made on that ground of Tweedledee and Tweedledum. 
    Now, may I just withdraw from the trees for a moment and look at the forest. 
    Look at the forest in terms of local physical demands as contrasted with the desirability and the constitutional mandate that interstate commerce should not be unduly impeded. 
    It might very well be that a local taxing jurisdiction should look to interstate commerce to pay a fair rate of tax when it enters the local taxing jurisdiction.But that's a far cry from what we have in this case. 
    We have, first of all, a flatsum license tax invalid on its face in contrast with a tax -- a fair apportioned rate against local business. 
    And we have in the second place the fact that there is probably no need to look to that local taxing rate in view of the fact that this Court has repeatedly held that a flatsum tax which must be paid as a prerequisite to coming into the jurisdiction, which must be paid regardless of the amount of business done is by virtue of being a flatsum tax invalid as applied to intestate commerce. 
   
   
   
   Argument of R. E. L. Cope
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1676.329" stopTime="1678.023">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Cope.
speaker="r_e_l_cope" startTime="1678.023" stopTime="2200.009">
    Mr. R. E. L. Cope 
    I may -- may it please the Court. 
    The appellant in this case has raised two questions. 
    First, he says that this is a delivery at the end of a continuous journey on interstate commerce and hence it is not subject to a tax. 
    Second, that it is discriminatory. 
    First, we would like to deal with the two propositions which you asserted in the jurisdiction -- the jurisdictional statement separately. 
    There have been numerous cases by this Court over a period of many, many years dealing with the question of municipal licenses and state licenses on matters involving interstate commerce in the conflict with the Commerce Clause. 
    Our time is too short to discuss all of those cases in detail but I would like to say briefly that in early history of those cases the decisions were very narrow in their scope. 
    The decisions almost universal -- universally held that anything which in any amount touched interstate commerce constituted an imposition on interstate commerce and was an improper burden. 
    Now, at the time that the Berwind-White case opinion was delivered, it was held by municipal authorities as a very liberal construction on the part of this Court. 
    It was interpreted as having -- actually announced new law as having perhaps overcome the previous narrow decisions which had been written during a period of 100 years before. 
    Now, briefly the Berwind-White case and its rather amazing that both counsel rely upon the same opinion. 
    Briefly, the Berwind-White case announces three propositions that we are primarily interested in. 
    The first proposition it firmly establishes that a local tax may be levied at the point of delivery. 
    I believe that in the Berwind-White case that it said that the taxable thing was the passing of title. 
    But in the case which was decided a short time later, I believe it's known as the Fuel Corporation case. 
    That is Fuel Corporation versus Taylor. 
    They said it was not necessarily the passing of title which determined it but it was the passing of possession which was the taxable event. 
    Now, we say that under the Berwind-White decision, the Fuel Corporation case, there is no question but that a municipality may tax the incident of change in possession. 
    That is the incident of local delivery that we think is very, very clearly established. 
    Now, the Opelika ordinance simply says that any person who unloads or delivers wholesale groceries is subject to this tax. 
    Now, that is certainly a tax directly levied upon the change in possession and under the Berwind-White case, it is certainly entirely justified. 
    The next proposition which the Berwind-White case laid down affirmatively, I believe it had been touched upon probably in the Western Livestock case prior to that time, but it -- it asserted in so many terms that there was no reason why interstate commerce should not bear its fair share of the local tax burden. 
    Prior to do that time, interstate commerce had been a sacred cow, insofar as bearing any share of the local tax burden was concerned, but by that decision and subsequent decisions it has been conclusively established that interstate commerce at the point of delivery should bear its fair and just and reasonable part of the local tax power. 
    The third proposition which was asserted and asserted affirmatively was that the case of Nippert versus the City of Richmond and some Robbins versus Shelby County Taxing District and the other so-called drummer cases are cases which are very, very narrow in their scope. 
    The decision explicitly says that this -- that we do not overrule these decisions, but that we limit them in their scope to the solicitation of business, though as they say that you cannot levy a tax upon solicitation. 
    Now, the next question is, does that bar a flat license sum tax? 
    In this case a flat tax is levied of -- of $250. 
    As suggested by Mr. Justice Frankfurter, perhaps by Mr. Justice Black, if the City of Opelika had levied a flatsum tax on all local wholesalers of $250 and a flatsum tax of $250, would there be any discrimination? 
    We most respectively submit that under the Berwind-White case there is absolutely nothing which precludes a flatsum license. 
    We know as a matter of practice that it is virtually impossible for a municipality that is a small municipality of some $12,000 or $13,000 to attempt to levy and collect from a non-resident corporation doing business in that city anything other than a flatsum license tax. 
    Those simple reason that the records of the company are not available, there is no means by which the tax can be enforced unless you resort to perhaps the States of Georgia or the States of Tennessee, and so as a matter of practical application the municipalities have found and that is a especially small municipalities that a flatsum license tax is necessarily levied. 
    So we submit there is nothing unconstitutional in a flatsum license tax levied on the incident of delivery. 
    Now, the question -- he says you pay this before you do business. 
    The license tax as it reads says that upon the -- that any person unloading or delivering goods shall pay this tax. 
    It is a tax on the transfer of possession which was the tax expressly approved by the Court in the Fuel Corporation case.

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Suppose the railroad delivered?
speaker="r_e_l_cope" startTime="2409.087" stopTime="2888.891">
    Mr. R. E. L. Cope 
    Now, I believe, Mr. Justice Black, that they have held in one of the cases and I -- and I think it was sales tax case and I -- I admit that I do not recall. 
    But there -- there was a scheme device in -- in just such a manner whereby if one delivered by the railroad, but what they did was in an attempt to get around the Berwind case they shipped the property F.O.B. from the -- from the adjoining state. 
    And that was when they said that while the title might have passed or might have changed in the adjoining state at the point of the F.O.B. shipment that still the possession was the taxable act and was subject to it. 
    There -- there are a great many old cases which as I say are very difficult to -- to reconcile because in the -- in the many, many years which preceded the Berwind-White case there was very little if anything that you could do toward making interstate commerce bear any part of the burden. 
    The delivery view has come, I believe there was the Covington case which immediately preceded that and -- and which was fairly liberal in its view. 
    It has only been recent that this Court has recognized that interstate commerce should bear a part of the municipal burden. 
    Now, with the Court's permission I -- I'll proceed to the second part of my argument because I know that my time is beginning to run just a little short. 
    The next is assistance by counsel is that the tax which is here levied is discriminatory. 
    Now, he says that it is discriminatory on its face. 
    We'd like to call the Court's attention to this fact that first all municipal taxes in the State of Alabama and I assume in other states are levied by virtue of -- of legislative authority. 
    The legislature authorizes the -- the levy of the tax. 
    In this particular case the -- the Code of Alabama provides that a tax may be levied by municipalities for the purpose of raising revenue and also in the exercise of its police powers either or both. 
    We think that the -- the significant part of that statute of course is the portion which gives the municipality the privilege of levying a license in the exercise of its police powers. 
    Now, in the -- in levying a license in the exercise of police powers, it necessarily follows that the municipality must have the right to classify. 
    And actually, (Inaudible) being one classification, retail grocery store might be at another classification. 
    Therefore without question your municipal authority has the right to classify various types of businesses in connection with the exercise of that police power. 
    Now, in this particular case they have classified merchants who operate places of business within the city in one category. 
    They have classified merchants who bring wholesale groceries in from other points and from without in levy category. 
    The question therefore with which we are presented is whether or not that is a valid classification. 
    Now, I'd like to just view a brief with my manner in which this case arose. 
    They filed a complaint which in substance alleges that they were doing the business and sets forth these various municipal ordinances which are involved. 
    They alleged in their complaint that these -- these two ordinances constituted a discrimination. 
    Now, the -- the Supreme Court of Alabama has held repeatedly that a business may be classified under the police powers where it operates from a given place of business within the municipality and where goods are brought in from without the municipality and that such a classification is presumptively a valid classification. 
    It is recognized that in the exercise of your police powers, your municipal police powers are that you have -- you exercise a certain control over your local merchant, they are subject to your jurisdiction. 
    You are confronted with an entirely different problem when you have itinerant merchant bringing goods in from other states or elsewhere and -- and selling those goods. 
    Therefore, the Court has said that a classification of a local store as contrasted with the classification of a store which is beyond the city is presumptively, and I use the word presumptively advisably, is presumptively a valid classification. 
    Now, the corollary to that is that if it is presumptively a valid classification then the allegations which are contained in the complaint constitute a conclusion of law. 
    When he says that this ordinance is discriminate against me, he isn't alleging nothing more or less than a conclusion of law. 
    Our end was upon that theory that the trial court sustained the demurrer. 
    It was upon that theory that the Supreme Court of Alabama sustained the demurrers of the lower court. 
    They say and the rule of practice and procedure has always been in the State of Alabama that if you allege in order to allege a discrimination, you must allege the facts which constitute the discrimination. 
    The same thing is true of fraud and deceit in many other actions. 
    And the Court in substance says that we have what is prima facie, a valid classification, it is not inherently bad on its face. 
    Therefore the burden rests upon the appellant in this case to allege facts showing that this does actually discriminate against me.

    Mr. R. E. L. Cope 
    We are arguing that it -- that it is not apparent on the face of the complaint that it is insufficient and that's the only ground in which they could possibly stand. 
    Thank you.

    Mr. M. R. Schlesinger 
    I'd like to dwell on that procedural aspect which was discussed by Mr. Justice Black just a moment ago.

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Well, I just -- I thought that what he was talking about is trying to be sure that was it?

    Mr. M. R. Schlesinger 
    [Laughs] Well, you've had the experience, if Your Honor please. 
    But may I just point out to Your Honor, to the Court. 
    That I don't think that a ruling -- a reading of the opinion by the Court of Appeals discloses that it went off on the grounds that sufficient facts under Alabama procedure weren't alleged. 
    I think that some distortion of the emphasis if I may -- if I may say but rather that sufficient facts were not alleged to bring the federal constitution into operation. 
    That is to say, assuming the facts were as stated then there wasn't a burden or discrimination against interstate commerce. 
    And I believe, if Court pleases, the cases cited by Court themselves would bear out that proposition, this long fight in the Alabama courts. 
    And the Alabama courts, if I may say to this Court, had not been reconciled to the -- pardon me, Mr. Justice Black, have not been --
