    Mr. Jack Greenberg 
    As I stated before lunch, the only evidence against the petitioner to establish that he had committed this crime was his confession. 
    The prosecutrix had testified that she had awakened to find a man sitting on her chest and he's had a towel draped over his head and they've had a lengthy struggle throughout this apartment that traveled over a distance more than 40 feet and she grabbed the knife from him and (Inaudible) from the apartment but she was never able to identify him. 
    And consequently, the only -- and she so testified at the trial. 
    The only evidence against the petitioner was his confession with this exception. 
    As I stated, petitioner was indicted for at least six crimes and he had been tried for another one prior to this. 
    The one which he had been tried was an actual case of rape, not attempted rape, but this one was. 
    And he had been convicted but he was sentenced merely to 99 years and not to death. 
    In this case, the prosecutrix who had testified in the first case testified in this case to the effect that she has been raped as evidence of the fact that this was a kind of man who would commit rapes and therefore, the burglary was with intent to rape. 
    The petitioner in this case is a Negro, 27 years of age. 
    He was a service station attendant. 
    He had entered the first grade when he was eight years of age and had graduated from the third grade when he was 16. 
    There was testimony, if I may quote, that he was "thickheaded" and three psychiatrists testified that he was severely, mentally ill and had been for some time and they diagnosed the illness as something in the nature of schizophrenia. 
    He was arrested by a civilian, not a police officer, while walking in an alley in a so-called White section of Selma which in fact is about a block or so from the so-called Negro section. 
    And while, apparently doing nothing illegal whatsoever, a civilian grabbed him and with three other White men stuck him in an automobile to awake the police whom they -- whom they called. 
    The police took him, arrested him on suspicion, and they did not as is required by Alabama law for the extraordinary case of a civilian arrest, they did not take him before a magistrate and indeed, this is not only required by the Alabama law, but this is the custom, the record shows, of the City of Selma when a man is arrested within the city. 
    There are some evidence that if a man is arrested outside of a city, a different type of warrant is used and he is not necessarily taken for magistrate. 
    But for someone in the shoes of petitioner, not only the law but the custom was to take him immediately before the recorder. 
    He was arrested on a few minutes after midnight on a Sunday and although shortly after his arrest, the day after, he saw the Sheriff of another County and his employer, for what purpose is not stated. 
    He was -- the following day, taken to Kilby state prison, a distance of 50 miles from Selma where he was kept as the Warden of Kilby testified a “safe keeper.” 
    And as a “safe keeper,” the warden testified, he is not our prisoner, so we never feel like we can let anyone see him without getting an okay from the man who was charged of him. 
    If a man does identify himself as a lawyer, we will do it. 
    We will go that far. 
    But the record shows that when a lawyer came to see the petitioner during the period he was at Kilby, he was not permitted to see him. 
    The lawyer came there, there's no evidence that he's been retained. 
    He said he'd heard of the case and he wanted to see petitioner because he didn't believe he was guilty. 
    The warden testified at first that he didn't know he was a lawyer and then he admitted that he did know he was a lawyer. 
    Then he said, “Well, he hadn't given me his address.” 
    And then when finally asked --
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="255.235" stopTime="256.146">
    Unknown Speaker 
    He hadn't what?
speaker="jack_greenberg" startTime="256.146" stopTime="358.492">
    Mr. Jack Greenberg 
    Given me his address. 
    The lawyer hadn't given his address. 
    He did testify that he did know him and know of him. 
    And then finally, he said that -- when asked why after the confession a lawyer was admitted without anymore identification or anymore question and during this period of time, he said that -- that -- he was our prisoner then and we can let him see anybody we like. 
    The reason for taking him to Kilby was allegedly for protection, for safe keeping. 
    But the record shows that there were other people in the Selma Jail who were suspected of similar crimes and there were no more reason for the public to be incensed against one prisoner than against another. 
    There were -- and in fact, there was a -- there were no threats. 
    There was no basis for believing that either anybody outside of the jail or anyone inside the jail was going to do any harm to the petitioner. 
    When he was taken to Kilby, he was kept in solitary. 
    The word was "segregation" but at any rate, he was kept in solitude and he was kept there for at least a period of 10 days during which 10 days he rendered the two confessions that are at issue here. 
    During the first five days, he was questioned intermittently, some of the periods of questioning, being as long as three and a half hours. 
    On one of the days, he was not questioned. 
    He was just permitted to be by himself in his solitary cell. 
    At the end of five days, by the States' own testimony and its own admission, he was questioned a minimum of 20 hours.

    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Is there any evidence of brutality?
speaker="jack_greenberg" startTime="360.810" stopTime="745.957">
    Mr. Jack Greenberg 
    There is no evidence of brutality, Your Honor, and in fact, the Police Chief who questioned him stated that prior to commencing each question in session, he advised the prisoner of his constitutional rights and so forth. 
    The -- when I say a minimum of 20 hours, the States' testimony is in such term, well we questioned him for several hours. 
    I have interpreted several as two. 
    It could -- certainly more than one and it could readily be in -- well, in excess of two, certainly three or four, but I have made the minimum interpretation of the word "several." 
    The -- this is the uncontradicted testimony. 
    In addition, there is some conflicting testimony that one questioning session was at least nine hours. 
    This testimony was in a newspaper story in the Selma newspaper. 
    And when the newspaper left and took the stand, he testified that he got the information from the police officers. 
    However, later on in the trial when he was interrogated by the State on this, he testified that he had just made the figure of nine hours up out of the year. 
    But the non-conflicting testimony is at least 20 hours during this period of time. 
    The end of 10 days -- at the end of five days, one confession was obtained and it was tape-recorded. 
    At the end of 10 days, another confession was obtained and this second confession was obtained again on the basis of the States' testimony following at least 27 hours. 
    That is not 27 hours since the fifth day, but from the first day. 
    A minimum, at least 27 hours of interrogation, he was in the state prison at that point, 10 days. 
    On Thursday, the day he rendered the tape-recorded confession, his father drove 50 miles to Kilby to see him, but his father was unable to see him on Thursday and finally did get in to see him on Sunday after the first confession but before the second confession. 
    The State appears to find some significance in the fact that he was told of his rights before each session or at least so the -- so the police officer testified. 
    Petitioner's position that a mere pro forma recitation of constitutional rights to a petitioner such as this is not the adequate procedural protection that the constitution requires. 
    I believe it was in Haley versus Ohio that the opinion of the Court referred to such a merely pro forma recitations of your right to counsel and your right to remain silent and so forth, and noting that in the absence of some more tangible evidence of actual protection of petitioner's right, such as taking him before a magistrate and so forth as required by law. 
    Well, that was -- did not remove the evidence, the conclusion of coercion. 
    In addition to which, this petitioner, a graduate of the third grade at age 16 and at least severely mentally ill, is not a person who could be deemed to be adequately protected by a recitation to him by a police officer what his constitutional rights were. 
    In summary, on this particular point of the confession issue, we have a case in which the prosecutrix was the daughter of a very important person in the community, the mayor's daughter. 
    The police testified that they were under unusual pressure to solve the crimes. 
    The petitioner is a Negro. 
    He was obviously terrified by the civilian arrest. 
    If one is frightened by an arrest by the police, at least there is the thought that perhaps he'll be brought to a police station and things will then start running there in normal and proper course but I -- a civilian arrest that petitioner submits is a far more terrifying experience. 
    He was arrested originally on suspicion. 
    Either there was no compliance with the Alabama law or in indeed the custom of the City of Selma. 
    He was driven out to the state penitentiary, where -- were not being interrogated. 
    He was kept in solitary and he was questioned from 20 to 27 hours prior to the first and second confessions respect -- respectively. 
    And as -- not mute, but really articulate evidence of the -- the nature of this confession, we can really turn to the confession itself. 
    And on page 233 of the record, there is -- commencing on 232, there is the tape-recorded confession taken at Kilby, the first one after the fifth day. 
    And there's the captain of the police force interrogating the petitioner. 
    And at about the eighth or ninth line down, the captain says, “Now, how did you get into that house, William?” 
    And William says, “Er, I went around to the side window and took a piece of wire and open the screen and come through that. 
    And the captain says, “In what kind of room were you in then?” 
    And he hesitates and says, “I was in a -- er. 
    “At this point, if I may interpolate, it's essential to the State's case to show he came into the bedroom window because the bedroom window is the window through which the prosecutrix testified the entry was made. 
    And so he says -- repeats again after the petitioner hesitates, “What kind of room was it, William? 
    Do you remember?” 
    And he begins to say, “I was in the kitchen.” 
    He says a part of the word kitchen, but he doesn't get the word out entirely. 
    And the police officer says, “In a bedroom with a child?” 
    And the petitioner queries bedroom and then the captain of police goes on as if it were a bedroom saying, “Now, who was in that bedroom, William?” 
    And then William repeats, “The baby,” and so forth and the confession goes on. 
    Petitioner submits that in the light of all the circumstances that have been related that is persuasive evidence of the coerciveness of the confession.

    Mr. Jack Greenberg 
    -- they were -- he was asked this -- police officer was asked that and he just said he thought he'd better get another confession. 
    The second confession, just merely assumes bedroom. 
    He doesn't ask him where he went into. 
    The second confession is on page 259 -- on 261, about halfway down the page. 
    Page -- on folio, towards this folio 612, there's some ambiguity as to how he got into the house but it appears that he's trying to say he went in through a kitchen and about two lines beneath the numeral 612, he says, “Now Williams, the window you went into the house, was it a bedroom?” 
    And he said, “Yes, sir.” 
    And I might add that the entire confessions in both cases, this is only some evidence, coerced, and consist of answers to leading questions, yes or no sir, yes or no sir. 
    Apart from, I'd say, about a fifth of them consist of -- of just recitations. 
    Now, I told you your rights and I haven't been questioning you for very long and you've been treated nicely and so forth. 
    But the first confession of course is quite explicit. 
    It's the way the words were literally put in the man's mouth. 
    Now, respondent cites a number of cases in its brief in an effort to distinguish this case from the rules that had been laid down by this Court and I believe we have shown in our reply brief that those cases really are in apposite. 
    I may mention them just briefly. 
    There's the Gallegos case in which the Nebraska confession was given instantaneously upon coming into the custody of Nebraska and the Texas confession, which some members of this Court thought wasn't inapplicable was rendered after, I think, four days of questioning. 
    After four days of imprisonment, there was questioning on two days of an hour to each. 
    Stein case, there was a questioning span, 32 hours. 
    In the Stein case, the defendants were -- this Court held hardened criminals who during the give and take of the confession gave very adequate evidence of their ability to take care of their rights as a reference to the -- the bargain they were driving to -- before they agree to confess.

    Mr. Jack Greenberg 
    This-- in Stroble against California, the confession also was given in stentor. 
    In Brown versus Allen, there was no evidence of prolonged interrogation. 
    And in the Lisenba case, it was noted that the defendant was a man of business experience. 
    Again, these people are -- who are either not questioned to a great an extent or certainly not as terrified and incapable of taking care of their rights as you would assume this petitioner here would be. 
    Petitioner recognizes that in these cases, this Court does not add up a calculation of days and hours or -- and qualifications and so forth. 
    It's not merely quantitative but it's a qualitative evaluation. 
    But there is a case which just so happens involves a -- a similar defendant and a similar number of hours and similar number of days and that's cited in our brief, it's Turner versus Pennsylvania. 
    There was five days in about 20 some odd hours. 
    In the companion case of Johnson, which this Court reversed the next term, summarily involved, I think only six hours during that same period of five days.

    Could I -- you said something earlier in the -- in your argument that I may have gotten completely wrong that -- I thought you said something about this prosecutrix having testified that this man raped her, it's an attempt -- or attempted to rape her pro forma?
speaker="jack_greenberg" startTime="1014.071" stopTime="1128.969">
    Mr. Jack Greenberg 
    Well, I -- I perhaps wasn't clear. 
    He was picked up on where -- at least six different crimes. 
    He was tried for one of them before he was tried for this case. 
    In that first case, the prosecutrix testified that she had been raped and he was convicted and he was sentenced not to death as had been requested by the State but to 99 years. 
    Now in this case, which involves burglary with attempt to rape, there's no charge of rape in this case. 
    The only other testimony apart from the confession is the testimony of the prosecutrix in the first case, now being used here to get the death penalty they couldn't get in the first case. 
    To the effect that this is the kind of man who commits rapes and therefore, when he invaded the house then he did it with intent to rape and therefore, it's burglary in the first degree. 
    That's what I -- just trying to place the case in its setting. 
    Now, petitioner submits that the confession in this case is a confession that on the States' own uncontradicted testimony. 
    It's a matter of law has -- has been and should be held coerced by this Court. 
    But we have more in this case. 
    There, the petitioner offered to take the stand on page 230 of the record to testify as to the admissibility, the admissibility of the confession into evidence and his counsel said, "We would like to make an offer to put this defendant on the stand for the purpose of refuting certain allegations by the State with reference to the voluntary nature of what purports to be certain extrajudicial admissions and for no other purpose.”

    Mr. Jack Greenberg 
    To which the States -- to which the solicitor say, if the defendant takes the stand, I insist that he be subject to cross-examination on any and every item that is in evidence. 
    I am not willing to make any agreement of limitation. 
    And the Court asked a question as to the purpose of the offer and the Court then said, "I sustain the State if the State is not willing to reach a stipulation or agreement on that.But insist that you open defendant for cross-examination of any and every nature, I overrule the motion." 
    Now, the Supreme Court of Alabama on this point held on page 350 of the record. 
    If he proposed to testify to facts showing that the confession was unduly influenced, he certainly ought to respond to questions as to his guilt in fact and to any matter relevant thereto. 
    Two judges of the Supreme Court of Alabama disagreed on this point. 
    They stated that I cannot agree with that part of the opinion holding that the defendant was not entitled to testify as to the facts and circumstances concerning an alleged confession without thereby subjecting himself to cross-examination as to matters pertaining to his guilt or innocence, sanity or insanity. 
    And there is -- therefore, no question as to what the offer was and to what the ruling of the trial court was and to what the interpretation of it was in the Supreme Court of Alabama as there has been in some other cases in which this issue has arisen but has been held not to have been sufficiently mature to be decided. 
    The Alabama Supreme Court also pointed out that notwithstanding a state statute which relieves counsel of the necessity of informing the Court in detail of what testimony would be. 
    In addition to the reason for this not being error was that counsel did not inform the Court in detail of what the testimony would be. 
    Of course there was no doubt in the mind of the solicitor when he objected as to what its nature would be and there was no doubt in the mind of the trial judge or the Supreme Court of the State and there was no objection on this ground. 
    And in fact, the Supreme Court of Alabama went on to adjudicate the merits of the point. 
    But petitioner submits that if this procedure should be held to prevail that is if when petitioner takes the stand to testify as to the admissibility and I emphasize admissibility as distinguished from -- in another portion of the case as to perhaps the credibility of the confession. 
    The petitioner takes the stand to testify as to the admissibility of a confession. 
    He must then open himself up to as the Supreme Court said, as to his questions, as to his guilt in fact or as the concurrent justices said, "Matters pertaining to his guilt or innocence, sanity or insanity."

speaker="jack_greenberg" startTime="1345.790" stopTime="1357.579">
    Mr. Jack Greenberg 
    Well, Your Honor, the usual practice is to take it out of the presence of the jury. 
    In this case, it was in -- and it's an acceptable practice in Alabama. 
    In this case, it was taken in the presence of the jury and that --
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="1357.579" stopTime="1359.724">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    That objection on the part of it?
speaker="jack_greenberg" startTime="1359.724" stopTime="1440.656">
    Mr. Jack Greenberg 
    Well, that takes a little explanation. 
    There was an objection to the presence of the jury. 
    At that point, the judge called a recess and asked the jury to leave and there was a conference between counsel and the Court. 
    Then the conference -- recess ended, and the jury came back in and there is no further discussion as to why or how or for what reason the jury came back in at that point. 
    However, it's clear that counsel wanted the jury excluded because on two subsequent occasions during the trial, not at this point but during testimony of other witnesses on the voir dire or the preliminary hearing. 
    There was motion for the jury to be excluded and the jury was not excluded, an objection was taken thereto. 
    But it's petitioner's position in this case that as to this point, it doesn't matter whether jury was in or the jury was out. 
    Because if the jury's in as it was here, it's, of course, highly prejudicial for them to get this evidence as to his guilt or innocence when he's taken the stand for the purpose of protecting himself from the introduction in evidence of -- the only evidence that could convict him and it was unconstitutionally obtained. 
    But even if the jury were out, then the State could obtain evidence from petitioner's lips at that point which it could introduce later in its case.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="1440.656" stopTime="1452.581">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Well, do I gather from what you said that Alabama practice does not permit the defendant as of right to insist upon the exclusion of the jury when evidence was taken to -- on the question of admissibility?
speaker="jack_greenberg" startTime="1452.581" stopTime="1932.135">
    Mr. Jack Greenberg 
    I don't know that there's a ruling in Alabama that talks about it as of right. 
    But the Alabama case that I have read occasionally refer to the fact that the jury was out and I'm familiar with at least one other Alabama case since the jury was out. 
    It's the -- petitioner submits that if this practice were permitted to -- were -- were upheld, then especially in this case where there's no other evidence against the petitioner, he is trapped into having to take the stand to keep out of evidence. 
    The only thing that can convict him, that was unconstitutionally obtained, then by this, the State can obtain the only evidence which -- by which they can later convict him and even if the confession is admitted into evidence and later, the Court would hold that it were erroneously admitted into evidence. 
    Under the ruling of Stein versus New York, the State could then come here and say that sure there was an illegal confession admitted into evidence but we have other evidence whereby we can convict him, and consequently, the decision below should not be reversed. 
    A number of state courts have considered this question. 
    It hasn't been canvassed through any tremendous extent, but it has been considered by a number of state courts and the Supreme Court of Louisiana has expressed itself most clearly on it and the -- the reason for the rule on -- quoted on page 17 of our brief. 
    Louisiana has held that it would be a simple matter for an unconscionable person to extort from the accused while alone, a confession. 
    And thereafter falsely testify that it was given freely and voluntarily, whereupon the accused would be compelled to take the stand to contradict the witness thereby subjecting himself to cross-examination on the whole case. 
    Or he would have to let the extorted confession go unchallenged. 
    Either of these alternatives would do violence, at least the spirit of the Louisiana Constitution.And petitioner submits that that is the consideration that should govern here. 
    Now there are some cases -- this case Wheat against United States, I believe in the Ninth Circuit cited by the respondent. 
    But that case really points up petitioner's contention in this case because in the Wheat case, the petitioner sought to take the stand on -- after the confession was admitted into evidence. 
    And on the issue of -- to the weight that should be given to it. 
    And of course when he takes the stand as to a matter of weight and credibility, it could be argued that -- then he's testifying as to the merits of the case, not in the preliminary hearing addressed only to the Court. 
    And then he should be subject to general rules of cross-examination. 
    And then of course, in Stein versus New York where the Court held that the question was not reached because it was not sufficiently definite as it is here that he would be subjected to such general cross-examination. 
    In the Stein case, the respondent's quotation from the Stein case in its brief is, again, makes the very point that we insist upon here. 
    On page 22, the quotation from the Stein case was, "In trial of a coercion issue as of every other issue when the prosecution has made a case to go to the jury." 
    It's not this case because there was no case to go to the jury until that confession got into evidence in this case. 
    An accused must choose between the disadvantage from silence and that from testifying. 
    Of course as I said, it doesn't apply here. 
    There is an additional point in this case and that of the jury exclusion and I shall address myself with -- only for a moment. 
    In this case until the time of petitioner's indictment, there had never been any grow -- any grand jury in Dallas County, Alabama. 
    When petitioner was first indicted, there was a motion to quash made on that ground. 
    And the motion to quash was granted although it is not clear whether it was granted on that ground or not whereupon the jury commissioners went about selecting a new jury list. 
    They -- in using this list and in selecting this list, they selected from among persons whom they knew or from persons -- they asked persons whom they knew to give them names. 
    And they also consulted a number of what might be called "impersonal" sources such as the telephone book and the city directory, and I don't recall whether it was the voting list or the tax list but it might have been something of that sort. 
    But they used this only in a sense to refresh their recollection. 
    They went down and they -- they saw someone whom they knew on the list then they might have put him into the jury box. 
    They also made a practice which is not required by Alabama Law of excluding exempt persons. 
    That is a -- like for example, a lawyer or a doctor or a teacher or a railroad engineer might be called for jury service and under the statute, would be given an exemption. 
    He could get out of it if he wanted to, but he was not excluded from jury service. 
    They also made a practice of excluding exempt persons. 
    At least so they stated because the record did show that whereas there was no evidence of any exempt Negroes in the box. 
    There was evidence of a small but substantial number of exempt White persons and -- well, at any rate, they ended up with about the names of about 300 Negroes in the box. 
    Now, that may sound like a very large number but in view of the fact that it was 300 out of in excess of 1700, and a view of the fact that there are more Negroes than Whites in this particular county. 
    The number of Negroes in the box really was not in excess of those found in the Cassell case, for example, where 1 out of 12 was held to be token representation. 
    This case, that comes out to be somewhat more than I believe 1 out of 7. 
    They attempt to justify the small number of Negroes on the box -- in the box in their brief by stating that -- page 13 in their brief, that it was also shown that approximately 90% of the criminal cases in the courts of Dallas Country involved Negroes. 
    Of course that's meaningless because that 20 Negroes in Dallas County can constitute 90% of all the crimes. 
    That does not mean that any substantial number of Negroes in Dallas County are criminals and that a great many of them live in adultery. 
    There's no evidence of a systematic application of this standard to the selection of jurors. 
    But at any rate, the evidence to which it refers indicates that a very large number of Negroes in Dallas County were married by common law marriage, which as I understand it, a perfectly legal and valid form of marriage in the State of Alabama. 
    Petitioner submits that this built-in factor into the jury selection system that of selecting people whom you know and the fact of putting Negroes or knowing they're Negroes for the purpose of getting some Negroes into the jury box when, as in this case, it turns out to be under all the circumstance and really a token, violates the standards of this Court it set down in a number of cases and more exhaustively canvassed in the case of Cassell versus Texas.

    The purposeful discrimination was using this method of selection at the point at which the personal knowledge was used, that's the -- personal knowledge was used at the point of initial selection, not at a -- see, the Alabama statute proscribes a perfectly -- a good method of selecting jurors. 
    It says you shall place in the box name of every person in the county with the following qualifications, and these are unexceptionable qualifications.

    Mr. Jack Greenberg 
    Well, if he saw the name of -- someone suggested the name of a Negro to him or if he saw the name of a Negro in the city directory, and the race is placed after your name in a city directory as to whether you're Negro or White, he would say, “Well, I don't know him,” and therefore, he didn't even consider him. 
    Whereas if he saw a White person whom he knew or a Negro whom he knew, he would say, “Well, I know him and he has good moral character," or "he has bad moral character.” 
    Now, he did not say, “Let's take the name of every White person over 21 years of age and then -- or every person over 21 years of age and then find out whether he has good moral character or not. 
    We'll make some investigations no matter how cursory. 
    If he didn't know a Negro, he didn't consider him any further to find out whether he had it or not, and of course, he can't be expected to know many Negroes under those -- under the circumstance.

    You may. 
    Mr. Straub.
speaker="robert_straub" startTime="2698.914" stopTime="2787.250">
    Mr. Robert Straub 
    If it please the Court, the record here before us deals with a great number of facts which we think are pertinent to an understanding of the applicable rules of law and I would like briefly to go through the facts first of all leading up to the confessions which were before the Court and which deal directly with whether or not the confessions were coerced and the question, whether or not he was denied his rights and not being able to testify as to the voluntariness of those confessions without further cross-examination. 
    Now, as has been stated, the petitioner was picked up wondering around an alley about -- about midnight of Saturday night or early Sunday morning. 
    And he was taken to the police station were he was booked on an open charge of investigation. 
    Now, the next morning -- he wasn't questioned any that night, it doesn't appear. 
    The next morning, beginning about 10 o'clock, he was questioned for about two hours by the captain of police. 
    Now, the captain testified that that was intermittent questioning. 
    It -- the routine business of the police station was being carried on at the same time and they would stop and see these folks and those folks and get a drink of water and so on and so forth for about two hours. 
    It wasn't a constant grueling questioning according to the testimony.

    Mr. Robert Straub 
    In the police captain's office as I recall. 
    It was in the station itself, somewhere there. 
    Now, in the afternoon or some time during this questioning period, the petitioner apparently asked to have the sheriff of his home county. 
    Now, he was not a native of that particular county. 
    He was from a neighboring country some 28 miles away.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="2818.288" stopTime="2819.286">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    What county?
speaker="robert_straub" startTime="2819.286" stopTime="2865.667">
    Mr. Robert Straub 
    Marion County -- Perry County, excuse me, Marion, Alabama in Perry County. 
    And he requested to that sheriff to be notified of his predicament and he also requested the people to notify his employer over in Marion and the police officers did so. 
    And the sheriff of Marion County whom he had requested to see came to see him at Perry County, came to see him that Sunday afternoon to see what was -- what was wrong. 
    And during the course of the questioning in the afternoon, the sheriff of Perry County together with police officers and the petitioner rode around town for about 20 minutes, I think, in between the questioning periods of that afternoon. 
    Now, on Monday --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2865.667" stopTime="2869.964">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    How long was that questioning period according to your accounting?

    According to my accounting and to the testimony, Your Honor, for two and one-half or three hours on Sunday afternoon.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter

    Mr. Robert Straub 
    They visited -- they drove around some of the houses. 
    They did not stop apparently and then go in or go around back or anything like that, but they did drive around town during this time. 
    Now, on Monday morning --

    (Inaudible) or not?
speaker="robert_straub" startTime="2902.264" stopTime="2966.103">
    Mr. Robert Straub 
    It does not appear. 
    On Monday, the petitioner's employer then, also in response to his request, came to see him. 
    And at that time, a warrant was made out against the petitioner and served on him. 
    Now, they questioned him on Monday for about one and a half or two hours in the morning beginning about 9 o'clock. 
    Now, he had been permitted to sleep, eat during Sunday evening then about 9 o'clock in the morning, they -- they questioned him again. 
    Now in the afternoon, about 3 o'clock, they took him to Kilby Prison. 
    Now, Kilby Prison is about 50 or 55, perhaps 60 miles. 
    It's distance from Selma to Montgomery. 
    Now, this testimony is that they took him there for his own protection and has been brought out that there was no threat and violence, nobody had actually attacked the petitioner and no demonstrations had come about.

    But in cases where they don't request a preliminary hearing or they're not going to appear before the city recorder, they're not put on the docket, not taken.

    They did enumerate them, but in response to -- when they were dealing with -- in the questioning in the case with whether or not he was taken to a magistrate, one of the police officers, or perhaps both of them testified that they did explain his rights to him, but he did not ask for a preliminary hearing.

    He was taken there and entered under the order of a circuit judge of the Selma Circuit. 
    He was questioned some that afternoon and for a little while after supper. 
    Now, it doesn't appear how much. 
    It says he was questioned for several hours that afternoon while he left Selma at 3 o'clock and so it was a matter of driving 50 to 60 miles before they could question him again and then it said we didn't question him too late in the evening and it doesn't appear how much at that time.

    There was some sort of judicial intervention there to that extent, that limited extent. 
    Now, he was placed in what the prison officials at Kilby Prison called segregation during his stay. 
    Now, this is not solitary confinement in the sense that he is placed in a dark cell and not allowed to see anybody or talk or anything else. 
    It's customary with prisoners who are being held for other authorities to segregate them from the general run of prisoners there at Kilby Prison and excel itself according to the testimony has a comfortable bed and all of the conveniences. 
    He's just not allowed to mingle with the prisoners who are there serving a term. 
    That apparently is customary not only in case of prisoners held or other authorities but in new prisoners coming in for a short period of time. 
    Now, he got there on Monday and he was not questioned again until Wednesday. 
    It doesn't appear how long he was questioned on Wednesday except for the fact they had several conservations with him. 
    Then on Thursday, no questioning in the morning but in the afternoon, they had two conversations with him, one lasting two hours and one, one and a half hours.

    So the lawyer didn't come before the first confession if he came on the Saturday between. 
    It isn't quite clear when he did come, but Warren Burford says it could have been at one right between confessions.

    The lawyer did not come and testify, no sir.

    And this particular attorney stated that he didn't represent the petitioner when he came out. 
    As I said, his father visited him on Sunday and then on Tuesday after lunch during about an hour's conversation, he confessed again. 
    Now, this time -- I don't believe it was taken down on a recorder. 
    That might have been adjacent to it, but it was taped, dictated to a stenographer, took it down in shorthand and transcribed it. 
    One of Your Honors asked what the difference in the two confessions. 
    Well, there is one difference and maybe the reason for getting the second one was that the first was taken on a tape recorder. 
    They decided they wanted something in writing signed by the petitioner so they got the second confession. 
    Now, at no time, and this appears in the record, both by just reading it and by actual testimony that no time during his stay was he denied food or water or rest or abused in any way. 
    There's absolutely no question, no testimony concerning any physical abuse. 
    And the longest period of questioning was not more than three and half hours. 
    Unless, you take a newspaper article, which says it was nine hours and then on cross-examination or during testimony by the newspaper reporter, he said that he assumed that number, made an assumption of nine.

    Does it appear -- going back in your chronology, does it appear why -- what the circumstance -- what these -- why the civilians arrested him in the first instance, what was he doing? 
    Was he --
speaker="robert_straub" startTime="3862.872" stopTime="3943.336">
    Mr. Robert Straub 
    He was, according to the testimony, wandering around at midnight in an alley in a White neighborhood. 
    That is all it appears in the testimony. 
    Whether there was more to it or not, it doesn't appear. 
    That's -- that's it. 
    He was picked up by one man and taken to a filling station where they called the police. 
    Now, we contend, first of all, that under Alabama statutes -- on Alabama cases exemplified by Ingram against the State which we've cited in our brief that the failure of an officer to comply with our statute that requires him to take to a magistrate immediately or forthwith, does not render involuntary a confession obtained under those circumstances. 
    And we call the Court's attention first of all to Stein against New York where admittedly the questioning was not as long as here. 
    But in Stein, he was not taken. 
    The -- the prisoner was not taken before a magistrate forthwith as is required by New York law and this Court in considering the overall picture of the voluntariness of the confession held that that of itself didn't require the exclusion even though they went contra to a New York statute. 
    Turning then --

    Can I ask you this --

    Mr. Robert Straub 
    Yes, sir.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3944.654" stopTime="3953.112">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Does -- does a private citizen have the right to arrest another one on suspicion in your State?
speaker="robert_straub" startTime="3953.112" stopTime="4088.006">
    Mr. Robert Straub 
    If I recall the statutes correctly, a private citizen may arrest for a felony committed in his presence or when he has reasonable grounds to believe a felony has been committed and that the person he arrest has committed it or is connected with it. 
    I believe that's it. 
    He may arrest for a misdemeanor committed in his presence, I believe. 
    I -- I'm not too clear on that but there is a distinction between felony and misdemeanor. 
    I think that it is. 
    In Brown against Allen, the accused was illiterate. 
    He was held for five days before being charged and he was given no preliminary hearing for 18 days. 
    After his arrest -- and no counsel was provided either. 
    The confession in that case was obtained prior to the appointment of counsel and prior to any preliminary hearing. 
    Now, the Court in that case, you -- you all did point out that there was no evidence of physical coercion which we have no evidence here and there was no evidence of prolonged questioning. 
    Now, we have questioning here of only at the most three and half hours. 
    And I think this Court, as many other courts have recognized that interrogation is one way to get information and the interrogation itself is not prohibited. 
    And we feel that three and a half hours at a time with ample time in between for rest include sleep is not prolonged questioning. 
    Now also, you've pointed out in Brown and Allen -- against Allen, there were no promises of reward and he was not denied counsel of his choice, the same applies here, we believe, where testimony before each confession that they didn't promise him anything, didn't offer any reward so forth and that he apparently didn't ask the counsel because none was denied and he wasn't, if he did, he didn't appear. 
    The Court held in Brown against Allen of course that the mere detention by police officers, which we have here, didn't render the statement that he made involuntary. 
    Turning then to Gallegos against Nebraska, there we had a -- a 38-year-old Mexican --

speaker="robert_straub" startTime="4093.629" stopTime="4096.718">
    Mr. Robert Straub 
    He was illiterate, yes. 
    I don't recall whether --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="4096.718" stopTime="4099.326">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Wasn't there more -- there's more than that in this case, isn't it?
speaker="robert_straub" startTime="4099.326" stopTime="4227.294">
    Mr. Robert Straub 
    Yes, sir, but I'd like to call the Court's attention to this feature of -- of our case. 
    He had his mother testify that he was thickheaded or -- perhaps it was his father. 
    You have the fact that he was somewhere around 16 when he left the third grade.You have a testimony by three psychiatrists that he is a schizophrenic or some sort of -- of character. 
    However, those three psychiatrists examined him for two hours. 
    They had no background from which to draw the conclusions other than what they asked the petitioner himself and what he told them and as one of them said a brief conversation with the father. 
    You get the background. 
    Now, it may be that a person could be so insane that a psychiatrist can look at him and talk to him for two hours and definitely make up his mind, but this man was holding a job in the service station and worked there for a number of years, worked there all day, servicing cars, greasing and cleaning oil and so forth. 
    And further as evidence we think of -- or perhaps the cursory nature of their investigation of the defendant or petitioner, it was brought out that he had stolen some automobile tires a year or so or several years ago shortly after the war. 
    The psychiatrist rather than even apparently considering the fact that that might be some indication of criminal bent on the part of the petitioner, just assumed that that was the time he broke this behavior pattern and that he was crazy from that time on. 
    And so, we think that the -- although the state put on no countering testimony as to whether or not he was sane or insane, that the evidence doesn't show that he was completely insane as is alleged and assumed here.

    And he was held for a number of days with questioning until he finally confessed. 
    He was held from September 19th until the 23rd in fact. 
    And during this time, he was not brought before a magistrate and in fact, he was held in under much more severe circumstances than our petitioner here. 
    There was testimony that one of the cells he was kept in had no bed, another one had no light, and he was given maybe one meal a day and also that he was threatened with violence. 
    And then after he had confessed in Texas, he was sent to Nebraska and where he confessed shortly, a day or two after he arrived and then about 12 or 13 days later, was finally taken before a magistrate after he had confessed twice on each state.

    Mr. Robert Straub 
    It all depends in Alabama, Your Honor, on where the Circuit is sitting at a particular time. 
    Now, the Selma Circuit -- I've forgotten how many counties are in there, but it is a -- several counties. 
    If it happens to be that it's sitting in that county at that time then it's quick. 
    If it's not, it waits until it gets around until the proper time. 
    Also in Lisenba against California, there of course we had the businessman who attempted or who did or hired of some sort the procured murder of his wife. 
    Now there, he wasn't questioned for many -- very many days at the time, but he was questioned beginning one day and questioned all that day, all that night, and all the following day and the following night until 3 o'clock in the morning when he either fainted or fell asleep and they dropped him for a while. 
    And after an accomplice had confessed, they took him back again and questioned him all day and into about the middle of the night, in fact, took him away from the -- from the jail, took him away from prison back to his home to question him. 
    And then in the middle of the night, he said if they'd give him something to eat, he would talk and he was provided with food and he did talk. 
    Now we contend that in Turner against Commonwealth, which is relied upon by the petitioners here to a great extent that the differentiating quality here is that in Turner, you had the relay technique employed. 
    They kept the man right there where the officers were working and every time anyone of them had any free time, he called in the petitioner, the defendant in that case in question, and they kept that up. 
    Now here, the officers had to drive about 50 miles to go -- to see the petitioner, to question him. 
    Now, turning now to the question of his testimony whether or not he should have been permitted to testify on voir dire without submitting himself to cross-examination. 
    Now, first of all, as Your Honors know, this Court has often held that the first eight amendments are not to be protect -- are not protected by the Fourteenth in the -- in the action by the State, unless, you get to that lack of fundamental justice. 
    In fact, in Twining against New Jersey which went into the -- the question of the right to remain silent or the right to testify, the Court held that the inference is irresistible that it has been the opinion of Constitution makers that the privilege if fundamental in any sense is not fundamental in due process of law nor essential part of it.

    The State made its offer of the confession and without any further objection to the jury being there, the objection was raised, the offer was made to put the defendant on.

    Attorney Hall on cross-examination says, “That is all.” 
    He's cross-examining one of the police officers about to introduce the confession and the -- the Court solicitor here says the State offers an evidence, a recording. 
    And if the Court please, the defendant objects to what purpose to be the recording made by this witness on the ground that sufficient predicate had not been laid and they overrule the objection. 
    And then they -- they go through this colloquy which we testified about it. 
    Apparently, it doesn't appear here that the -- the jury did go out at one time but I think it appears in the -- on 190 as counsel has so helpfully provided here. 
    I knew it was either here or in the preliminary or the full record, which is not before this Court. 
    When was that particular recording made? 
    Talking about the one which was subsequently introduced. 
    If Your Honor please, we're going to ask the Court to exclude the jury at this time.

    The defendant would like to take an objection to this particular line of questioning and objected to the manner in which the witness is being questioned.

    But never to where he has asked in this particular instant. 
    But we have the line of cases and I think this Court has also laid down such a line of cases that when a defendant takes the stand, even though he has a constitutional right not to be called upon to testify against himself, that once he takes the stand, he does so as any other defendant.

    But do you know of any authority for extending that rule to what's involved here?
speaker="robert_straub" startTime="5203.303" stopTime="5365.717">
    Mr. Robert Straub 
    I should like, Your Honor, to present some what we consider authority on that point at least. 
    Turning first to Adamson against California, now there, you had the California statute involved which permitted a comment on the failure to testify. 
    And the Court brought up this -- this particular statement. 
    We're talking about the -- the choice that any defendant has to make between testifying and remaining silent. 
    And they say that it's a dilemma which any defendant might be faced with. 
    If facts adversed to the defendant are proven by the prosecution, there may be -- don't know a way to explain them favorably to the accused except by a witness who may be vulnerable to impeachment on cross-examination. 
    The defendant must then decide whether or not to use such as a witness. 
    The fact that the witness may also be the defendant makes the choice more difficult, but a denial of due process does not emerge from the circumstances. 
    Now there, we are talking about perhaps merits, probably merits, but turning to Witt against United States, a Circuit Court of Appeals case, there, the trial judge heard evidence concerning admissibility in the absence of the -- of the jury and they came back in and they had the same testimony over again. 
    And a -- at the -- after the second attempt of his testimony, the -- the judge at first of course had ruled his confession was voluntary then they came back in and the witness for the government testified again. 
    On appeal, the defendant claimed that he wasn't permitted to testify to the voluntary aspect of his conversation. 
    That was his basis of appeal. 
    He said, “I wasn't allowed to testify.” 
    And the Court after reading the record said this, “We don't read it that way.” 
    He was permitted to testify all right if he wanted to, but the Court went no further than to suggest that if appellant testified, he would have subject himself to cross-examination. 
    And the Court goes further to say that the appellant was obviously afraid to take the stand and speak concerning anything material matter inquired of him by his counsel. 
    He could not well ask that the Court guarantee him in advance that he would be asked no embarrassing questions on cross-examination if he did do -- did so. 
    If he had taken the stand and the Court had permitted undue latitude in his cross examination, he would have had something to complain about and that's what we -- position we take here, that he can't --

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    What did it say about the raffle?
speaker="robert_straub" startTime="5368.455" stopTime="5496.534">
    Mr. Robert Straub 
    The raffle? 
    Well there, the federal agent testified to certain admissions of the defendant on a trial and the defendant didn't testify at all, and the trial resulted in a hung jury. 
    There was no verdict. 
    So they go into trial again and the agent gave the same testimony and the defendant in that trial took the stand and denied the statements. 
    And so they began to cross-examine him and Court itself just asking why he -- why he didn't testify on the trial before. 
    And then the Court and -- came to this Court and you -- this -- this Court stated the question as follow. 
    Was it error to require the defendant wrap it, offering himself as a witness upon the second trial to dispose that he had not testified as a witness in his own behalf upon the first trial. 
    And you, Your Honors came to this conclusion that a waiver of his right not to testify is not partial. 
    Having once cast aside the cloak of immunity, he may not resume it at will whenever cross-examination may be inconvenient or embarrassed. 
    We may not -- we need not close our eyes to the fact that every person accused of crime is under some pressure to testify less the jury despite his carefully framed instructions drawn on favorable inference and so forth. 
    When he does take the stand, he is under the same pressure to testify fully rather than avail himself on a partial immunity. 
    And goes on to state that the protection is not to be now and then drop and then pick up again throughout the trial. 
    This was a trial of course in the federal court involving the federal constitution and the right not to be required to testify against yourself.

    Suppose during a middle of a trial a defendant claims that he's ill and asked for a continuance and the officers take the stand and testify this man isn't ill, he's a malingerer. 
    And the witness say -- the defendant says, "Well, I want to take the stand and testify that I'm not malingering, that I'm -- I'm a sick man, that I'm in great pain and I can't continue with the trial." 
    The judge should say to him, "Well, now if you take the stand, testify to that and throw yourself wide open to -- to cross-examination on your guilt or innocence."

    Mr. Robert Straub 
    Sir, I think the difference is this. 
    In the question that you put has nothing to do with anything that has been placed in evidence. 
    Now here we have testimony. 
    We don't have the confession placed in evidence yet.

    But you have testimony that during his incarceration, a tape recording was obtained. 
    Now, he wants to come in and say, "Wait a minute. 
    This was obtained under such and such circumstances." 
    Now in a trial of a coercion issue, even though it's the judge who has to make the determination, we contend that the credibility if nothing else of the petitioner is something that the judge wants to know about. 
    It's going to be his word against the officer's word and as this Court in some case rather said that coercion is as often falsely asserted as it is falsely denied. 
    Now we feel that -- let's -- let him get at the credibility at least then if they step outside the bounds of something that hasn't been put in evidence yet. 
    And there was some of the main case which wasn't put in evidence yet this time. 
    You had the testimony of the prosecutrix. 
    He did not have the testimony of the other two women who testified they found him in their apartment those other times, so they couldn't question him on that. 
    But what I'm saying is certainly the judge himself should be permitted to get at least the testimony concerning the credibility of the defendant.

    Mr. Robert Straub 
    Sir, I don't know. 
    Stein against New York, the defendants complain that they weren't allowed to take the stand and to testify the coercion because they would submit themselves to cross-examination. 
    Now, this Court in discussing the Stein case said we're not -- it didn't properly preserve. 
    It didn't -- they didn't make any offer to testify, but went on further to discuss the matter. 
    You thought enough of it to discuss it in this light that if they had given such testimony, it would have been in direct conflict with that of the police and the decision would depend on which was believable. 
    Certainly, the Constitution does not prohibit test of credibility which American law uniformly applies to witnesses. 
    If an open court, free from violence or threat of it, defendants who'd been obliged to admit incriminating facts, it might bear on the credibility of their claim that the same facts were admitted to the police only in response to a beating. 
    In the trial and skipping then on down, in trial of a coercion issue as of every other issue on the prosecution has made a case to go to the jury, an accused must choose between the disadvantage from silence and that to testify. 
    The Constitution safeguards the right of the defendant to remain silent. 
    It does not assure in the -- may remain silent and still enjoy the advantages that might result of them testifying and that's what we're saying here, Your Honors, that he's trying -- trying to take advantage of two constitutional safeguards. 
    He's trying to take advantage of the right to remain silent so he won't be cross examined. 
    At the same time, he's trying to take advantage of the right to be heard and we feel that this Court in the cases which it has decided and the Constitution itself does not guarantee to any individual those two safeguards at the same time.

    Mr. Robert Straub 
    Turning now to the -- shortly to the motion to quash, it's true and it's recognized in the opinion of the Supreme Court of Alabama that for many years there were no Negroes that ever served on a grand jury or a petit jury in Alabama. 
    But we have the proposition where in response to a motion to quash, an indictment was quashed and the entire jury box thrown out and the jury commissioners instructed to refill the box, which they did. 
    The testimony shows that prior to this time, it might have been 30 names and it goes in the box in about 1200 or so White people. 
    Now we have testimony concerning that it contains about 250 to 300 names of Negroes and about 1500 -- excuse me -- White people. 
    Now, I'd like to call the Court's attention to the fact that in drawing the grand jury for this particular case, it's the first time that we have drawn a grand jury or petit jury in Dallas County, Alabama, where they had 250 or 300 names in the box. 
    So you don't have a pattern to go by with this box and this jury and this indictment. 
    The other testimony we feel should -- to be disregarded other than to shed light on what used to be the practice down there. 
    I bring that out because in Akins against Texas, one of the cases upon which we rely where this Court held, again that numerical and mathematical precision is not necessary. 
    The Court remarked several times that after this Court and the Supreme Court of Texas had reversed a number of cases because of the exclusion -- systematic exclusion of Negroes that the commissioners were obviously trying to follow the mandate of this Court and the Supreme Court of Texas in refilling the box and trying to do what the law of the United States and that the State required. 
    Now, we don't contend that mere trying is enough. 
    But we do say this that this effort being made and shown to have been made by the jury commissioners of Dallas County certainly shows that now, there is no planned and systematic exclusion of Negroes on the jury -- in the jury box of Dallas County. 
    Now, this Court has held that in examining the record that you're going to give some great weight or some respect to the findings of the lower court in respect to issues such as this unless there's no evidence to support the findings of the lower court and we submit that when our Supreme Court of Alabama states that there is no evidence of systematic exclusion apparent in the record, that there is ample evidence to back that statement up. 
    Now, in Thomas against Texas, we find the same reflection by this Court that it may be that they don't have the full pro rata with the White race in the selection of grand and petit juries in this case. 
    Still it wouldn't be evidence of discrimination if they fairly and honestly endeavored to discharge their duty and did not in fact discriminate then no right has been denied. 
    And we feel that by looking at the testimony of all the jury commissioners and the clerk of the jury commission that were before the trial court, the Court can't help but see that there is no discrimination being practiced now. 
    Now, something was said about whether or not the qualifications of the Negroes would explain the disproportionate -- proportion in the jury box. 
    Well now, we feel that under Fay against New York, that burden rests upon the petitioner to show when he realized on figures showing that there are so many Negroes and so many Whites and then tries to say that because of that, you --

    Mr. Jack Greenberg 
    May it please the Court. 
    As to the question of the request to exclude the jury from the courtroom during the preliminary hearing on admissibility, there was the request on page 190, which was followed by a recess and the jury came in with no elucidation of that. 
    But to make clear that it was petitioner's obvious, quite clear desire to have the jury out during this on page 254 of the record as the voir dire proceeds there's another demand that the jury be excluded, and to the middle of the page, the Court overrules it. 
    And then during another witness on page 312 of the record, there was another demand that the jury be excluded and that was denied and overruled. 
    Well, it's petitioner's position that whether the jury was in or the jury was out, makes no difference in this aspect of the case because when the jury was in, it's clear that there would be prejudice and that the jury could hear from the petitioner's own lips facts that he would otherwise be privileged to be silent about. 
    But even if the jury were out and the State could obtain from the petitioner's own lips evidence that it could introduce later in the trial and the -- just the same amount of harm could be -- would be done under the circumstance.

    Yes. 
    Well, the comment on failure to testify of course that this Court has ruled upon and has also noted that this is something the jury would almost naturally consider anyway.

    Mr. Greenberg, may I ask this. 
    Suppose this was a case involving a shooting, the State might offer as in evidence of the gun allegedly used by the accused to kill the deceased and evidence was offered but this was the gun. 
    Could the defendant be able to take the stand and insist on the right delimiting his testimony on the question whether or not the gun was his?
speaker="jack_greenberg" startTime="6565.167" stopTime="6566.677">
    Mr. Jack Greenberg 
    I wouldn't think so. 
    No, Your Honor.

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Well now, that's just a bit of evidence that's offered, isn't it?
speaker="jack_greenberg" startTime="6569.263" stopTime="6572.468">
    Mr. Jack Greenberg 
    And it is not tied up with the constitutional right. 
    That's how I --
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="6572.468" stopTime="6587.584">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    I'll accept that. 
    It's an offer in evidence and his effort is to keep it out of evidence on the ground that there ought to be a determination that it doesn't belong to him. 
    What I'm trying to get at is the confession after all is a piece of State's evidence, isn't it?
speaker="jack_greenberg" startTime="6587.584" stopTime="6588.708">
    Mr. Jack Greenberg 
    Yes it is, Your Honor.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="6588.708" stopTime="6609.478">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Well, if it's not -- if the defendant can't resist in the right to limit his testimony in the hypothetical case I put to you that it's not his gun, why is he in a different position here as you suggest that he ought to be able to limit his testimony to the question whether in fact it was his voluntary confession.
speaker="jack_greenberg" startTime="6609.478" stopTime="6647.611">
    Mr. Jack Greenberg 
    Because the question of the admissibility of the confession is the question of whether or not it has been obtained in violation of the United States Constitution. 
    If there was such a question tied up with the admissibility of the gun, my answer would be the same. 
    Admittedly, in some cases, there might be a line to draw but I don't believe this case calls for the drawing of such a line, but clearly, where the only way that a constitutional right can be preserved is by such testimony then its petition is -- contention that the integrity of the whole constitutional defense depends upon this preliminary determination.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="6647.611" stopTime="6706.236">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well, to raise Justice Brennan's question to a constitutional level, suppose this revolver that he's speaking about was -- was to be introduced in evidence and the claim was by the defense that the home had been burglarized, suppose this was a federal case and defendant claim that his home had been burglarized by a federal officer and this -- this gun had been -- been taken and that preliminary -- preliminary question was being tried by the Court. 
    I presume the defendant could take the stand and testify that -- that he saw the federal officer come -- come in there and burglarize his home without -- without subjecting himself to cross-examination on -- on the guilt or innocence on the charge against him, couldn't he?
speaker="jack_greenberg" startTime="6706.236" stopTime="6713.975">
    Mr. Jack Greenberg 
    I would say that yes, Your Honor, because his defense against being convicted by means of an unreasonable search and seizure --

speaker="earl_warren" startTime="6718.402" stopTime="6724.281">

    So, that isn't -- that is different from the one Justice Brennan made --
speaker="jack_greenberg" startTime="6724.281" stopTime="6724.516">
    Mr. Jack Greenberg 
    Yes, Your Honor.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="6724.516" stopTime="6725.457">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    -- it seemed to me.
speaker="jack_greenberg" startTime="6725.457" stopTime="6901.157">
    Mr. Jack Greenberg 
    Yes. 
    I would like to stress that on this confession point, again, there have been many cases cited in both briefs and in the argument in terms of how many hours this petitioner was interrogated and how many hours that petitioner was interrogated. 
    It's not merely a quantitative but a qualitative determination that the Court must make. 
    And I think the key thing in this case is just who this petitioner is. 
    Now, there has been some attempt to discredit the testimony of the psychiatrist who were on the staff of the Veteran's administration on the basis that they didn't examine him sufficiently. 
    And that at any rate, the jury found he was not insane but the jury determination of course though it may indicate he was not legally insane, that he did not know the difference between right and wrong, still does not indicate that he was a person capable of understanding his rights and adequately defending himself before these police officers who interrogated him, at least it must be admitted 20 hours during this period of time during which a person in such circumstances obviously must have been terrified. 
    In fact, at the outset of this case, the typewritten record indicates there was a request for sanity, a lunacy board to be convened and test his insanity and the State denied this. 
    There were some questions as to when he was denied the right to see the lawyer who came to see him on a Saturday as to this as pointed out in our reply brief, the warden testifies, and this is the States' witness, this is the warden who has possession of all the records of the prison. 
    It was on one Saturday but I don't remember the date. 
    Question:"Was that before the confession?" 
    Answer:"Yes. 
    I believe it was. 
    I couldn't say that for sure." 
    Well, this is a matter upon which the State had -- was attempting to sustain the burden. 
    It was -- it was its own witness and it was in possession of all the facts. 
    And I don't think the State can rely upon the possibility of a conflicting inference in its own testimony to deprive petitioner of something that's reasonably clear on the record. 
    There was another question by the Court as to just what kind of an order this was by which he was transmitted from the local jail to the state prison on page 201 of the record. 
    It is indicated by a police officer. 
    I just don't know he was committed to Kilby Prison on an order or request or something of the Circuit judge. 
    That's what it -- apparently was administered of order for some sort of a transfer. 
    I had earlier stated that the Negroes on the panel, petit jury were excluded by agreement of counsel. 
    I was somewhat in error in that. 
    Counsel agreed that both sides had struck some Negroes on the petit jury panel but there was no agreement of counsel to strike them.

    I gather they would. 
    It doesn't indicate but on page 180 of the record, the Court says it is further stipulated by and between counsel for the defendant and the solicitors that the members of the colored race who were on the venire were stricken by counsel to both sides. 
    That's not an exact quote.

    You're trying to answer the Attorney General's suggestion that neither has practiced -- that it has practiced -- in any event.

speaker="jack_greenberg" startTime="6933.360" stopTime="6944.619">
    Mr. Jack Greenberg 
    Well, my answer to that would be that 250 sounds like a lot but when looked at in terms of the population in the county, you would -- it does come out to something like 1 in 7 and in Cassell 1 in 12 was held a token.

    Mr. Jack Greenberg 
    We are the -- this is quite a lengthy record and it's only part of the typewritten record. 
    There was a tremendous amount of testimony in the qualification of jurors and I would say that at least 50 Negroes were put on the stand, graduates of Brown University and there were some Phi Beta Kappas and university presidents and doctors and dentists and so forth who had never been called for jury service. 
    There are a tremendous number of them and I think the -- there are citations to the record, in the original record in our brief. 
    Of course, we couldn't show out of the population of 6000 or 7000 that -- how many hundreds, but certainly, there was a very substantial number. 
    Now, a partial answer to that was that they were exempt but exempt is not excluded. 
    The exemption was for them to claim, not for the State to assume that they would claim and if they -- but there was no evidence that they would call, even given the opportunity to claim their exemption.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="7007.410" stopTime="7010.171">

    That's right. 
    There's a distinction and there's certainly a substantial number of Negroes there. 
    I'd say 20 or 30 or 50. 
    It is the -- the record is tremendous on this that were able to serve but were not called and given the opportunity to claim an exemption if they so desired.
