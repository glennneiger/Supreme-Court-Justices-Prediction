    Mr. Leonard B. Sand 
    May it please the Court. 
    This is a direct appeal from an order of the District Court of the Southern District of Florida dismissing an information which was brought under Title 16, Section 852, commonly known as the Black Bass Act, although that statute now applies to all fish. 
    The information set forth on pages 1 and 2 of the record charged that when Ludenia Howard trading as the Stokes Fish Company delivered to the Railway Express Agency in the State of Florida for transportation to the State of Georgia, 150 pounds of freshwater bream, freshwater crappie and freshwater black bass. 
    And that such transportation was then contrary to the laws of the State of Florida and in violations of the Black Bass Act. 
    The Black Bass Act, set forth at page 39 of the Government's brief, provides that it should be unlawful for any person to deliver for transportation from one State to another any black bass or other fish if such transportation is contrary to -- to the law of the State from which the black bass or other fish is or is to be transported. 
    The defendant moved in the lower court to dismiss the information on the grounds that it failed to state the cause of action and this motion was granted. 
    The order dismissing the information appears on page 3 of the record and the judge there said that the only prohibition against the out-of-state transportation of the fish, set forth in the information, was found in the regulations of the Game and Fresh Water Fish Commission of the State of Florida. 
    And being of the opinion that the rules and regulations of this Commission do not constitute the law of Florida as described by and contemplated by the Black Bass Act, the information was dismissed.

    He meant that you have to have a statute, yes, Your Honor. 
    As this was a decision dismissing an information based on the construction of the statute upon which the information was founded, the Government took a direct appeal and this Court noted probable jurisdiction. 
    We -- we look then at the outset to the status of these rules and regulations as they exist in the State of Florida. 
    In the 1942, general election, Florida amended its constitution by enacting Article IV, Section 30, set forth at page 43 of the Government's brief. 
    This constitutional amendment created the fresh water fish commissions and conferred upon it, the power to regulate the manner and method of taking, transporting, storing and using fresh water fish among other things. 
    It was also provided in this constitutional amendment, Section 7 on page 44 of the Government's brief that the legislature may enact any laws in the aid of but not inconsistent with the provisions of this amendment and all existing laws inconsistent herewith shall no longer remain in force and effect. 
    All laws fixing penalties for the violation of the provisions of this amendment --

speaker="leonard_b_sand" startTime="256.250" stopTime="326.065">
    Mr. Leonard B. Sand 
    I'm on page 44 of the Government's brief. 
    All laws fixing penalties for the violation of the provisions of this amendment and all laws imposing license taxes shall be enacted by the legislature from time to time. 
    In other words, Florida by constitutional amendment vested in this Commission supreme authority over the regulation of fresh water fish and left to the legislature only the power to act -- to enact consistent laws and laws fixing penalties and license taxes. 
    The Florida Game Commission pursuant to this constitutional authority enacted a rule, Rule 1401, cited at page 48 of the Government's brief. 
    And that rule provided that no person should transport out of the State Florida any black bass, bringing some fish and other enumerated fishes. 
    The --

    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Imposed in the Constitution by (Inaudible)
speaker="leonard_b_sand" startTime="328.940" stopTime="491.929">
    Mr. Leonard B. Sand 
    Yes, Your Honor. 
    The Florida legislature enacted Section 372.83, cited at page 46 of the Government's brief, and that statute provides that any person who violates any rule or regulation of the Commission adopted pursuant to the constitutional amendment shall be guilty of a misdemeanor. 
    Therefore, there existed in Florida at the time of the alleged defense, a rule promulgated by the Commission acting pursuant to constitutional authority prohibiting this transportation and a Florida statute enacted by the legislature providing that any violation of that rule would be a misdemeanor. 
    There is no question in this case as to the validity of the rules or regulations in the State of Florida. 
    The Florida Supreme Court has held that they have the effect of law in that State and indeed, appellee concedes this. 
    On page 12 of appellee's brief, the following language appears.We frankly and fully concede that the Florida Commission is a legally constituted commission. 
    We also concede without argument that its rules are enforced in the State of Florida so long as these rules are within the scope of the amendment creating it, and I may state parenthetically, there is no question here but the rules are within the scope of the amendment. 
    For this purpose, appellee concedes. 
    In the State of Florida, they are given the force and effect of law. 
    However, this does not make them the law of Florida as contemplated by the Black Bass Act. 
    It is with this last statement the Government takes issue. 
    For it is the Government's position that when Congress in the Black Bass Act said contrary to the law of any State, it meant contrary to such law as that State should probably consider binding upon its citizens. 
    Since there is no question but the Florida considers these rules and regulations valid and enforces them, there's no question but that they should be the laws of the State within the meaning of the Black Bass Act. 
    The Black Bass Act was originally enacted in 1926. 
    Prior to that time, this Court had on many occasions construed phrases such as state statute, more restrictive phrases than law of the State to include administrate regulations as well as states statutes.

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    At the bottom of page 13, it says even if the rules and regulations of a Commission under some conditions could be the law of a State, it does not follow that these are the laws applied. 
    We take position that they are not the law applied.
speaker="leonard_b_sand" startTime="527.217" stopTime="662.495">
    Mr. Leonard B. Sand 
    Not the law of the fact but believe, appellee there means, not the law of Florida within the meaning of the Black Bass Act even though they are the law of Florida within the State of Florida itself. 
    The -- nothing in the legislative history of the Black Bass Act indicates that it was intended to apply only to administrative regulations. 
    Indeed, in the Senate bill, accompanying the 1947 amendments of the Black Bass Act cited that, at the bottom page of 29 and 30 of the Government's brief, it is said that if we are protecting fish, an important natural resource, the Federal Government must collaborate in the enforcement of protective laws and regulations at the point where state jurisdiction ends. 
    And it must also be remembered that we are acting here in the context of conservation, an area in which both the Federal Government and the States, have traditionally proceeded through administrative regulation. 
    Indeed, this is recognized in other provisions of Title 16. 
    Thus, in Section 669 of Title 16, cited at pages 24 and 25 of the Government's brief, it is provided that the Secretary of the Interior is authorized to cooperate with the States through their respective State Fish and Game Departments. 
    And then skipping, it says, “But no money apportioned under said sections to any State shall be expended therein until its legislature or other state agency authorized by the state constitution to make laws governing the conservation of wildlife shall have assented to the provisions of said sections. 
    Congress there specifically has recognized that state agencies may be authorized by the state constitution to enact laws governing conservation and then --

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Mr. Sand, is there anything to the point that apparently this Commission may make regulations as one county or one section and not for other sections of the State may adopt them tonight and change them tomorrow. 
    I gather that's the argument.
speaker="leonard_b_sand" startTime="681.645" stopTime="769.839">
    Mr. Leonard B. Sand 
    We -- we think not, Mr. Justice Brennan. 
    With respect to the local nature of some regulations, indeed, before the constitutional amendment was passed, that's precisely what the state legislature did. 
    So, there's no inherent difference between the regulations of the Commission and the -- and the state legislature. 
    In Sylvester against Tindall, cited at page 19 of the Government's brief, the Florida Supreme Court reviewed the past history of conservation and legislation in that State and noted that -- that for many years, the legislature had tried in vain to adequately deal with the subject matter of this amendment by local or special acts. 
    And -- and so we feel that that distinction is without merit. 
    With respect to the changeable nature of these regulations, I might say that it has been the law of Florida consistently since 1927 that out-of-state transportation of black bass was illegal, besides which the Florida Legislature has provided rules for the promulgation of the Commission's regulations. 
    These rules provide for publication in a newspaper for --

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    These are a register of some kind?

    Yes. 
    They -- they must be filed with the -- a certified copy must be filed with the secretary of state and the rules of statewide application as this particular rule is -- cannot be effective until 30 days thereafter. 
    I -- I deal with that question on the merits although since that was not the basis of the decision of the District Court, it is a question not for this Court in this -- at this stage of -- of this case. 
    So the -- the construction placed upon the Black Bass Act by the court below would nullify that Act in all but six States of the Union for -- in all but six States. 
    The subject matter with which we are here concerned is dealt with by administrative agencies. 
    In 42 other States rules and regulations the law of the State with respect to fresh water fishing, are promulgated by fish commissions.

    They are available in a -- in a handbook which is available to anybody, writing to the Commission for it and also on file with the local judge. 
    I think the claim is that a regulation cannot be the law because it -- it may be changed from day to day. 
    As a matter of fact, these regulations cannot be changed from day to day. 
    They can go into effect only 30 days after they have been filed with the Secretary of State of Florida. 
    And as I have said, and in -- in fact, there has been no change in this particular law of Florida since 1927.

speaker="clarence_l_thacker" startTime="1307.761" stopTime="1462.745">
    Mr. Clarence L. Thacker 
    If it please the Court. 
    I might say that at the outset here that if Ludenia Howard, a citizen of the State of Florida had known that she was to be charged on a game or on a fish violation case and that then mind of the United States Governor -- Governor would put her in this Supreme Court prior to a time that her innocence whereas was still presumed to be there and before she had been convicted, I dare say gentlemen, that she would have been much better off had she been not guilty but plead guilty in the lower court. 
    And I say that advisedly and very sincerely, and I say it for this reason, that all of us know that more and more today that administrative agencies and commissioners are governing our very lives and it's very important that when we consider the rules and regulations that are made with these agencies and the statutes that are passed by the Congress in a criminal nature that our individual citizens do not -- do not -- not -- do not lose their liberty through actions of these boards and commissions to an insidious process. 
    Now, I want to change my argument a little bit today from what I have planned to do by virtue of certain of the questions that came up here. 
    We don't contend in any respect that the rules and regulations of the Game and Fish Commission of Florida are not enforceable in Florida if they were within the scope of the constitutional amendment was created. 
    But we do say, and very sincere to this Court, that even though that rule is enforceable in Florida, it was not within the contemplation of the Black Bass Act which was passed in 1926 that those rules and regulations should be the law of Florida. 
    And I think one reason is very obvious on the face of it and that is in 1926, when that Black Bass Act was passed which prohibited the transportation of black bass within the States or without the States, if it was against the law of that State, that the constitutional amendment creating the game and fish -- Fresh Water Fish Commission in Florida did not come into being until some 20 years later, almost 20 years later. 
    So, I think it's observed on the face of it to say that Congress meant at that time that the law of authority was going to apply to the rules and regulations that came into effect in the State of Florida almost 20 years later.

    Mr. Clarence L. Thacker 
    That may be true, sir, here and that -- that's -- the Government take some solace in this position, Your Honor. 
    And that is they say that that Black Bass Act has been amended twice, since its inception in 1926 for the very fact that when that Act was -- was amended that the Congress did not change the wording with respect to the law of the State is the best evidence that the Congress did not even consider the rules and regulations of the Commission. 
    And the only amendments that took part in that -- in that Black Bass Act was to name different types of fish other than black bass upon which it's illegal to transport back and forth.We seriously contend, Your Honors, that the main difference that the Government and Ludenia Howard in this case is the fact that the Government refused to believe that this is a criminal statute and it affects the liberty of our citizens. 
    And add as a criminal statute as this Court has held many times, the statute must be strictly construed. 
    If there's any ambiguity in the statute, that ambiguity must be resolved in favor of the accused. 
    If the statute is perceptible of two interpretations on a criminal basis, the interpretation which favors the accused must be used. 
    There can be no steps, there can be no constructive federal offenses, no constructive offenses. 
    And we believe, Your Honors, that when we read into that Black Bass Act today, that was passed in 1926, that it implied to the rules and regulations of the Game Commission which came in many years later that we thereby make a constructive offense which this Court from time immemorial says we cannot do any criminal case. 
    I would like to address my remarks a little bit to the little pamphlet here which the Government has seen fit to introduce before this Court in its brief and that's called the Wildlife Code of the State of Florida. 
    Now, actually we're not here falling with the Game and Fish Commission of Florida, but I think that we -- we're only falling with a little bit with respect to a federal criminal -- criminal action attaching to any arbitrary rule that that Board of four or five members might -- might pass. 
    Now, it's impossible to codify the rules and regulations of this Game and Fish Commission. 
    For example, our legislature meets every two years and -- and the laws of -- that are passed without legislature become the laws of the State and they are -- they are codified by the Secretary of State of Florida statutes and then those laws are published by the West Publishing Company and Harrison Publishing Company as Florida statutes annotated. 
    Because of the nature of these rules and the changeableness of these rules, it is impossible to codify with our statutes in a rule of this fresh and game fish -- Fish Commission. 
    And I submit, Your Honor, that that was not the intention of the Congress when it gave it -- gave that power to the -- when it talked about the law of the State that it did not consider that a citizen or a -- a board of three or four citizens could automatically invoke the long arm of the Federal Government because of some arbitrary change in rule that that Commission makes which are not codified among our statutes in which it cannot be codified among our statutes.

    Mr. Clarence L. Thacker 
    I would like to address my remarks to that in one second. 
    The legislature has come along whether it had the power to do so or not and as we locate in this pamphlet, you will find the section of the statute which says, that if this -- if the law has a statewide application, then a certified copy of that the rule for this Commission must be filed with the Secretary of State for a period of 30 days. 
    But if the -- if the Commission passes a rule which is of a reasonable nature, of a local nature, then it must be -- the certified copy must be on file with the Secretary of State for a period of 20 days. 
    Then the legislature comes along and says that the above provisions are directly only and not mandatory. 
    So we contend, Your Honors, that under such set of circumstances of that that Congress could not have intended, in fact, that a -- that a criminal -- federal criminal penalties should attach to a rule or regulation of four or five members which members would change as it will.

    Mr. Clarence L. Thacker 
    I dare say, Your Honor, that there are probably some necessity for that. 
    And I say again that these rules and regulations do have the force and effect of law in the State of Florida and they are enforced as long as the rule or regulation comes within the amendment itself.

    While that case was before the Supreme Court and before the Court had rendered its decision the Game and Fish Commission had changed this rule and says it was against the law to catch alligators less than 6-feet in length.

    -- phrase law of the State, rules of administrative parties, any due process objections which might relate to the manner of promulgation or the giving of notice would awake some other stage of these proceedings.

speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2982.599" stopTime="3081.528">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well, I -- I think -- I think Mr. Sand, that you overlooked the fact that -- that these commissions are -- are all relatively new in our state systems. 
    And many of them started out few years ago without any procedures at all. 
    They would change a regulation overnight and people just wouldn't -- wouldn't know what the regulation was and I know in my State and I have no doubt in other States that -- that recently and only comparatively, recently have we tightened up the laws so that that can't be done. 
    And so that they must give notice of a change of a -- a regulation of this kind if it's to be considered law. 
    They must -- they must have it -- do it at a public hearing. 
    The public must have a right to be heard on it and -- and so forth. 
    Now, my point is this. 
    Would Congress in 1926, when it -- when this Act was enacted have in mind recognizing such regulations as law? 
    Now, you're taking the most favorable part of it. 
    It seems to me the way the thing is at the present time. 
    I'm saying, well, Congress must admit that, but I don't know whether the Congress would have admit that in 1926 when there was no -- there was no real stability to -- to such rules or no procedural requirements in changing them.
speaker="leonard_b_sand" startTime="3081.528" stopTime="3126.905">
    Mr. Leonard B. Sand 
    If -- if Congress did not mean it in 1926, it certainly meant it in 1947 where the Senate Bill which accompanied the amendments of the Black Bass Act specifically stated that the Federal Government must collaborate in the enforcement of protective laws and regulations at a point where state jurisdiction ends. 
    I think, Your Honor, that it's valid for the Government to look to the practice as it existed in 1947 and in 1952 when the Act was amended because it was not merely a mechanical amendment. 
    There -- there's a -- a legislative history in connection with those amendments indicative of the congressional intent.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3126.905" stopTime="3137.238">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well, in Fish and Game matters, the Government collaborates with States but they don't always accept their regulations as laws in other instances.
speaker="leonard_b_sand" startTime="3137.238" stopTime="3203.339">
    Mr. Leonard B. Sand 
    No, but here Congress, in using the phrase "law of the State", did look to -- to the -- whatever law that -- that State felt properly binds its citizens and there's no question here as to the validity of these rules and regulations within the State of Florida. 
    With respect to the -- to the question of -- of notice, I would like also to state that the facts alleged in the information indicate that the defendant here is a -- a fish dealer and as such would have to get a -- a fish license. 
    And it says very plainly on that license that it is unlawful for any wholesaler or retail fish dealer knowingly to have or allow, would permit any that any black bass to be stored on the premises. 
    So that certainly, this defendant must have had knowledge of -- of the prohibitions with respect to black bass that existed in the State of Florida.
