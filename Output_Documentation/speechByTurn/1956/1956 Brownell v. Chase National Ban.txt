    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Number 24, Herbert Brownell, Jr., Attorney General, Petitioner versus The Chase National Bank of the City of New York. 
    Mr. O'Leary, you may proceed.
speaker="arthur_j_oleary" startTime="19.144" stopTime="45.051">
    Mr. Arthur J. O'Leary 
    If the Court pleases, one of the important questions on this appeal is that question of res judicata, and I would like to address myself to that phase of this case. 
    And in doing so, I'll refer again briefly to those findings of fact that were made in the prior action, which I've been referred to before, concerning the disposition of income. 
    In that prior action, in the --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="45.051" stopTime="46.500">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Where do -- where do we find those?
speaker="arthur_j_oleary" startTime="46.500" stopTime="381.148">
    Mr. Arthur J. O'Leary 
    You'll find those, Your Honor, at page 222 of the record. 
    Those findings with respect to income, read in part of many -- some of the words, which I don't think is significant here. 
    But so, we'll have the substance of them that the Attorney General is not entitled to receive the income of the said trust which had been accumulated as of the date of the making of the vesting order, referring to the original vesting order. 
    In number 10, the Attorney General is not entitled to receive any part of the accumulated income held by the trustee, which has been collected since the date of the original vesting order. 
    And then, Number 11, that the Attorney General as Alien Property Custodian is not entitled to receive any income, which may be collected during the lifetime of Bruno Reinicke, his set law and said trust. 
    Now, I would like to show in a practical way how that prior judgment will be circumvented, and I think in part destroyed, if the Attorney General gets the relief that he seeks in this action. 
    And I can demonstrate that by asking Your Honor to look or to take my description of it at the schedule of the account at page 260 of the record. 
    Unmet schedule is listed in a few items. 
    What happened to the accumulated income and the amount of it? 
    At page 260 of the record, it shows that there has been accumulated in these trusts and headed to the corpus, the total sum of $116,576.75. 
    That is the income that had been accumulated in that accumulated cents. 
    That is the income which those findings of fact that I referred to, refer to. 
    That income was adjudged to be in the possession and -- and it should remain a possession of the trustee. 
    Now, it's the Attorney General who gets the relief that he asks for here. 
    That income will be turned over to the Attorney General, and to that extent, that prior judgment would be circumvented and in part, destroyed. 
    Now, in arguing at the prior action, I had nothing to do with either possession or the vesting of the race. 
    It certainly would seem to be the correct fact that the prior judgment did have something to do with possession. 
    Certainly, plainly so, with respect to that accumulated income which I have just described, the possession of that was litigated in past time. 
    And furthermore, I think the vesting of the race itself was a matter which was the subject of the litigation in the prior action. 
    And I say that basing it upon the language of the original vesting order, that original vesting order which is printed at -- beginning at page 67 of the record. 
    In the opening part of it, it refers to property described as, “all right title and interest” of Bruno Reinicke and others as being property payable to enemy nationals. 
    Because I might say though, that such property, is in the process of administration by the Chase National Bank as trustee of its trust dated so and so, under the judicial supervision of the Supreme Court. 
    Now, when I say that in that original order, they refer to something in addition to the right title and interest of the aliens, they are vesting also the very property itself. 
    When they use the words “property” in the process of administration, I don't think the man who wrote that intended to say or imply that they were -- that they were administrating rights and interest. 
    He meant, the securities would be in, and the trustee itself was being administered. 
    And that I think is evident by what follows was that paragraph, beginning at the top of page 71, which reads, “Hereby vest in the Alien Property Custodian, the property described above to be held used, administered, liquidated, sold or otherwise dealt with.” 
    Now, we don't liquidate and sell rights and interest. 
    At language, it's only fitted to me the securities, the funds that comprise the purpose of this trust. 
    Now, the Attorney General labels this original vesting order that I have just quoted as a right title and interest order. 
    And he said, “That was all up before the Court in the prior action.” 
    But that -- that original order contain that language that I referred to referring to properties that can be bought and sold which I say refers to the purpose of the trust. 
    Now, if we look at the so-called raised vesting order, which, however, in this preparation by the Alien Property Custodian was labelled as an amendment to the original vesting order, the language of that is not legally different from the language of the original order. 
    There, the same nationals I referred to --

    Justice Harold Burton 
    Where is Enemy next to at?
speaker="arthur_j_oleary" startTime="382.359" stopTime="439.235">
    Mr. Arthur J. O'Leary 
    That -- that begins at page 72 of the record. 
    The opening part of it, they referred to enemy nationals. 
    And then, on page 74, in paragraph 2, they say, “All property in the custody of the Chase Bank, its trustee, et cetera.” 
    And then, in the last paragraph, page 75, that property just referred to was vested. 
    That, I say is the same property that would describe and referred to in the original vesting order, and I don't think there's any illegal significance or any legal difference in the need of either document, and the first document was before the Court. 
    Now, there is one other phase of this case that I want to refer to. 
    The Attorney General wants to relegate the ultimate beneficiary of this fund.
speaker="harold_burton" startTime="439.235" stopTime="445.646">
    Justice Harold Burton 
    What -- what did the Attorney General ask for the -- the intervention? 
    What did he infer in this petition?
speaker="arthur_j_oleary" startTime="445.646" stopTime="447.055">
    Mr. Arthur J. O'Leary 
    In the prior action?
speaker="harold_burton" startTime="447.055" stopTime="447.567">
    Justice Harold Burton 
    Yes.
speaker="arthur_j_oleary" startTime="447.567" stopTime="476.393">
    Mr. Arthur J. O'Leary 
    He -- he demanded that the entire purpose of the trustee turned over to him upon termination of the trust. 
    He plainly demanded that. 
    Because Bruno Reinicke -- because the trust agreement itself provided that all income shall be added to principles and -- unless Bruno Reinicke directed it to go otherwise. 
    The Attorney General demanded. 
    He said he had seized that right and he demanded the income. 
    Now, also, in the Court of Appeals, and that part of it --
speaker="stanley_reed" startTime="476.393" stopTime="478.196">
    Justice Stanley Reed 
    He demanded the right and the income.
speaker="arthur_j_oleary" startTime="478.196" stopTime="580.145">
    Mr. Arthur J. O'Leary 
    The right and the income. 
    Now, and he also -- there's a dispute about this part of it. 
    The appellants claim the Attorney General and his -- and the Court of Appeals demanded the entire purpose, but the petitioner puts a different construction on that and he says, “He did only by way of argument.” 
    He says, “If he can't get it.” 
    He said, “He argued there, but he couldn't get despite to direct income.” 
    Then, the trust had terminated, and therefore, he went to the entire principle. 
    Now, I want to say a few words about that Section 9 (a). 
    If the Attorney General gets the relief that he wants in this action, then the ultimate remainder of the trust, if it turns out to be this American citizen. 
    So, the Attorney General says, “He has a right to come in under Section 9 (a), and bring a suit for recovery.” 
    But, we must bear in mind that there's a statute of limitations on claims. 
    Anybody who claims to be entitled a property that's taken over by the Alien Property Custodian must bring a suit no later than two years from the date of vesting all seizure as statute of limitations of the 50 U.S.C. Section 33. 
    Now, this trust, as we already know, will not terminate until the two lives are being expired. 
    Now, that may be ex number of years. 
    If it's 10, 11, or 20 by that time, the rights of the argument remained in them with a long sense of vanished under that statute of limitations.
speaker="stanley_reed" startTime="580.145" stopTime="583.414">
    Justice Stanley Reed 
    What -- why would that come? 
    Would that answer the problem?
speaker="arthur_j_oleary" startTime="583.414" stopTime="600.947">
    Mr. Arthur J. O'Leary 
    Well, I would Your Honor, because the statute of limitation says, “Any right to recover property that has been seized or vested in the Attorney -- in the Alien Property Custodian, such an action must be commenced in the words of the statute.” 
    These are the words --
speaker="stanley_reed" startTime="600.947" stopTime="602.890">
    Justice Stanley Reed 
    That's a right to recover.
speaker="arthur_j_oleary" startTime="602.890" stopTime="603.389">
    Mr. Arthur J. O'Leary 
    No suit --

    I understand you.
speaker="arthur_j_oleary" startTime="604.218" stopTime="634.418">
    Mr. Arthur J. O'Leary 
    -- no suit pursuant to -- pursuant to Section 9. 
    That's the Section he refers to. 
    No suit pursuant to Section 9 may be instituted after April 30th, 1949, or after the expiration of two years from the date of seizure by or vesting in the Alien Property Custodian, as the case may be, of the property or interest in respect of which relief is sought, whichever is later.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="634.418" stopTime="644.819">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Would that apply to a person whose rights did not accrue until after the two-year statute of limitation?
speaker="arthur_j_oleary" startTime="644.819" stopTime="716.844">
    Mr. Arthur J. O'Leary 
    Well, I'm -- I'm afraid it would because it -- it doesn't say that you bring the action within two years after your cause of action accrues. 
    It says, “No action can be brought later than two years after the date of seizure or date of vesting.” 
    Now, I don't think that you have any other reason for construction of that as I read it. 
    And there was one case where a man was unavoidably absent, Your Honor. 
    In the Circuit Court here, passed against McGrath, he was out of the country. 
    And when he got here, his two years had expired and he was denied of recovery. 
    Now, and then, in closing, I think the Alien Property Custodian had been fully protected here, no respondent questions or fact that whatever the rights of these aliens are, they have been seized. 
    And when the trust terminates, the Chase Bank can't pay that money, except to the persons legally entitled to it, if it turns out that their -- that this group of enemy aliens, that's where the money would go. 
    He turns out to be an American citizen, the American citizen will get.

speaker="george_b_searls" startTime="929.899" stopTime="1084.804">
    Mr. George B. Searls 
    Well, I think he'd have the same rights. 
    He wanted the property to be taken by an imminent domain. 
    I mean, if he's protected in the one case, he's protected now. 
    Now, let's go back to Section 33 for a moment. 
    In this case, claims have been filed and are pending with the office of Alien Property by three remainder men, Bruno Kyle Reinicke, Robert Hans Reinicke and Hans Dietrich Schaefer, and those claims were all filed within two years to the day of the 1953 vesting. 
    So that as far as timely filing of claims are concerned, it appears that they have protected their rights. 
    I'd like to speak briefly of a matter that was mentioned yesterday several times, the agreements that have been made with Germany. 
    I'm not going -- go into it extensively, but I'd like to call the Court's attention to Senate Document Number 11, 84th Congress 1st session, which sets out the most of the agreements. 
    There was an agreement in 1952 as mentioned by Mr. Lourie, which was ratified by the Senate, but never became effective because it was not ratified by all the parties to it. 
    However, that agreement did become effective in 1954 by virtue of another agreement made in that year with certain amendments. 
    Mr. Ryan suggested yesterday that the result of turning a property over would be that it would be sold. 
    The trust fund would be -- become merely a figure on the books of the Treasury. 
    That is not so if a Section 9 (a) suit is brought. 
    If a Section 9 (a) suit is brought, we are required by the statute to retain the property in kind and unchanged. 
    So, there's the property returned over. 
    The dividends would continue to be collected on the stocks, the interest on the box. 
    And if there were a return to any claimant, he got the interest and the dividend as well as whatever share of principle he's entitled to.

    Mr. George B. Searls 
    Not that Your Honor, because they're not being paid anything now if this -- the income is being accumulated by the bank. 
    What I meant was that if he had shares and say, American or U.S. still and no shares pay dividends, those shares would be retained intact, and the dividends would be collected that took fund would not be sold and dissipated if 9 (a) suit is brought.

    Well, in the War Claims Act of 1948, that was addressed primarily to the claims of American prisoners of war who had been mistreated, to the claims of civilian internees who had been interned by the enemy during the war. 
    And there was also, I believe, a provision in that Act that Congress might later add other claim of other types of claims to that list.

    Starting, I think in 1923, there were serious of amendments to the Act providing for returns of property to various types of claimants.

    Mr. George B. Searls 
    -- to secure the United States against the default in the reparations payment Germany had agreed to make. 
    There was a default, and by the Harrison Resolution in 1934, further payments to Germans were stopped. 
    However, by that time, the 80% had been returned, so the Germans got 80% of their property back.

    Mr. George B. Searls 
    There was a legislation, there have been legislation on several recent session of Congress but none of it has passed. 
    There was a proposal at the last session by the administration of what was called a $10,000 bill that each claimant would be returned up to $10,000. 
    But there's also Section 32 in the Act, which provides for the return of property to people who may not recover under Section 9 (a) because they are enemies. 
    And that includes the German views who were persecuted because of their race or religion. 
    There have been very substantial returns under that section, although, I have no figures.

    Do you read the Act itself and then -- as providing for confiscation of the property of the alien by this country?

    Mr. George B. Searls 
    No, I don't think so, Your Honor. 
    I -- I always have trouble with the word confiscation, because the last word is with Congress. 
    And Section 12, which I think is still effective, it says that “After the war" and I take it that refers to probably any war. 
    “The property shall be disposed of as Congress shall direct.”

    There haven't been many actually litigated cases. 
    I think I can recall a hand about three of these, the cohort case, which I mentioned yesterday. 
    And there was a case of United States Trust Company against Hicks, which is cited by one of the respondents, I forget which one. 
    In 16 Fd.2d in which a remainder interest was returned. 
    I don't know whether it was vested or contingent -- to -- the respondent says to ancillary administrator, “I don't.”
