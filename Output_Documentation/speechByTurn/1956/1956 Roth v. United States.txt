    Mr. David von G. Albrecht 
    The complement in any events, I would like to reserve 10 minutes of my time for conclusion for my able associate, Mr. Rogge for rebuttal. 
    You Honors, I rise now to the defense of Samuel Roth, an unconventional publisher who publishes what people reject today and perhaps accept tomorrow. 
    The Government -- the Government here concedes that the petitioner's publications are as they say borderline entertainment area and do not contain commercial black market pornography, which is said by them to be the principal objective of the enforcers of the Act 1461 which we shall refer to instead of to its general title. 
    But that, Your Honors, is little service to my petitioner who is under the harsh sentence of five years in jail and a $5000 fine. 
    And I contend that it is of no aid to the Court who is confronted -- which is confronted with a statute about obscenity if we discuss pornography. 
    Your Honors, this prosecution arose in the Southern District of New York.

    Mr. David von G. Albrecht 
    Your -- Your Honors, a federal statute could be made I believe so narrow in construction that it might be all right, but our contention in this case is that under the First Amendment as in conjunction with the Ninth and Tenth Amendment, the Congress has no power at all to do anything in relation to speech as speech itself that that power resides exclusively with the State and with the local government. 
    Once Congress attempts to interfere with it, it goes beyond the sacred area which is prohibited to Congress by the First Amendment and which is reserved to the States by the Ninth and Tenth Amendments.

    Your Honor, I am not here to defend the question of pornography because I don't really know what pornography here is.

    Mr. David von G. Albrecht 
    That is my contention, Your Honor, that the Federal Government under the Ninth and Tenth Amendments has absolutely no right to do that and the Government says, "Well, we were -- we are going to have 48 different and distinct rules and regulations here. 
    We will have 47 because New Mexico has no obscene statute.” 
    Now, that is -- that is all right, but we did the same thing in other cases in the past. 
    In 1835, when we have the abolitionist and its erection, abolitionist movements, Congress provided for punishment at that time and then they provided and the Postmaster General instructed each postmaster in each state not to deliver the mail to any state which had a rule prohibiting the delivery of such mail.

    Mr. David von G. Albrecht 
    If I -- if I may indicate about this prosecution that was started in the Federal District Court in New York. 
    It consisted of an indictment which contained 26 counts, which charged this defendant with wrongfully depositing for mailing several articles in violation of Section 1461. 
    The case came up in -- on January 3rd, 1956 and was concluded nine days later. 
    Out of those 26 counts, three were either dismissed with the consent or of the Government or upon motion. 
    And of the 23 that went to the jury, they found this defendant guilty of only four. 
    And of the four counts, there were only seven witnesses as against the 36 that had originally been called to the stand and there were numerous exhibits.

    Mr. David von G. Albrecht 
    Which Your Honors have here. 
    And one of the books upon which this defendant was found guilty, consisted of over 200 pages. 
    This book was never read to the jury. 
    Only isolated parts were read to the jury. 
    There was only one copy that went into the jury room and this length of time that the jury deliberated, it was a physical impossibility for the jury to have read that book in the jury room. 
    It is our contention that -- that if they had read the book, they would not have found the book obscene. 
    If Your Honors decide to read it, I have it here and we'll produce it. 
    The book taken as a whole consisted of literary works of (Inaudible), historical works and a short story by Aubrey Beardsley. 
    And the thing that was important to the jury I believe in that case was that they took this book, this little -- I should say 20 pages by Aubrey Beardsley and inserted and they had a book which is a criticism of Aubrey Beardsley by a man Haldane MacFall, who I believe was not even alive at the time that Aubrey Beardsley died and they introduced this book in to evidence to show that Beardsley believed that this book was obscene.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Mr. Albrecht, may I ask you whether the thing you've said latterly the last about -- the jury didn't read it, couldn't have read it, et cetera? 
    Are any of those questions open here? 
    I just looked at the order allowing certiorari and that was very nearly restricted to the point you've already made, namely the obscenity statute by freedom of speech in the First Amendment by Due Process Clause, the obscenity statute and it violated the First, Ninth and Tenth Amendment reserved to the States, but no question as to charged adequacy of evidence, submission to the jury, not one of these questions is opened. 
    There are three very specific questions taken from your petition on the basis of which the Court granted certiorari and therefore restricted argument to it.
speaker="david_von_g_albrecht" startTime="797.399" stopTime="809.535">
    Mr. David von G. Albrecht 
    Well, Your Honor, the -- in -- in the brief supplied by the Government, they too admit that I have this right and I refer to --

    Mr. David von G. Albrecht 
    Yes, Your Honor.

speaker="david_von_g_albrecht" startTime="914.383" stopTime="1073.864">
    Mr. David von G. Albrecht 
    If -- if we may Your Honor, and in the short time allowed to go on and I would like to quote a statement made by perhaps the greatest living and most respected writer on the subject today. 
    A man who wrote the amicus brief here, Mr. Morris Ernst and he says in his works that the Federal Government has no authority of the local morals. 
    There is no federal power to control marriage, divorce, adultery, or bigamy. 
    These matters concerned local government and the Ninth and Tenth Amendments affirm the state power over those matters and no power as delegated to Congress. 
    Now, as I see the question for the first time, this Court is being asked to determine whether a federal criminal statute can punish speech as speech, even though that speech has no connection with any action of conduct over which the Federal Government has power or control. 
    And if I may pose this question, how can you have a single federal criminal statute which has the inherent potential of having different results in different states that upon the same state of facts? 
    How can you have a publication found to have been violated by -- in New York and not to have been violated in New Mexico? 
    If you have one federal criminal statute, we can have a jury in New York, trying Roth and convict him and a jury in New Mexico tries Roth and acquits him. 
    Now you have the same statutes and you have -- you -- you're just going to get the whole theory of Erie against Tompkins involved in a criminal law. 
    And I submit that such potential for this harmony and the enforcement of a federal obscenity statute is compelling evidence that obscenity is a proper subject for the State and not for the federal power. 
    Thank you. 
   
   
   
   Argument of Roger D. Fisher
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1073.864" stopTime="1079.938">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Fisher.
speaker="roger_d_fisher" startTime="1079.938" stopTime="1184.020">
    Mr. Roger D. Fisher 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    I will too go and start out by saying what is involved in this case that distinguish other cases and what is not involved in this case. 
    First, there is no question of whether the exhibits in this case are obscene. 
    That issue was question (a) in the petition for certiorari, it was denied. 
    There as in the -- the California case, there are questions of whether or not the matter was obscene, entitled to find that that issue was not here. 
    There is no question of prior restraint in the New York case. 
    Petitioner Roth got everything that the appellant, Kingsley is asking for, grand jury, jury trial, criminal burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. 
    There is no question of administrative discretion as is involved in pending Post Office cases in other Courts, the Court of Appeals here where the Post Office has to consider whether a matter is mailable or not to be eligible for second class privileges. 
    The sole question on a limited review is the constitutionality of Section 1461 as applied to the criminal statute to the mailing of obscene material in United States mails. 
    The matter -- this is the application of an obscenity statute to matter which is concededly obscene, concededly for the purposes of this appeal.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="1184.020" stopTime="1189.859">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Do we have to assume that that it's concededly obscene? 
    Is the question of vagueness out of the case?
speaker="roger_d_fisher" startTime="1189.859" stopTime="1203.325">
    Mr. Roger D. Fisher 
    No, the question -- it is concededly obscene within obscene, the standard of statutory standard. 
    You still have before you whether a statutory standard is vague on its face, whether the language is --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="1203.325" stopTime="1205.012">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Where the obscene means?
speaker="roger_d_fisher" startTime="1205.012" stopTime="1253.622">
    Mr. Roger D. Fisher 
    And enough to be a criminal statute.If it means anything, these -- these advertising circulars in this one book are obscene.You still have the question whether it means or not. 
    Then, the -- there are two issues besides the Ninth and Tenth Amendment that they're the -- they form the basis of this problem. 
    First, it's on the First Amendment, can anything be restrained from a ground that it is obscene? 
    Heretofore has been unanimous agreement on that subject. 
    This Court is now reconsidering I should say that question. 
    In Doubleday, the Hecate Country case, counsel for Doubleday did not even suggest that the statute was unconstitutional on its face, but only as applied to that particular --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1253.622" stopTime="1255.218">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    But that wasn't this statute at least.
speaker="roger_d_fisher" startTime="1255.218" stopTime="1262.026">
    Mr. Roger D. Fisher 
    No, but the standard, the New York standard of obscenity did not challenge the constitutional validity of an obscenity statute.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1262.026" stopTime="1269.463">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    And do you think that you're discussing this thing as though this isn't a statute by the Congress for the regulations of mails, is it?

    Mr. Roger D. Fisher

    Mr. Roger D. Fisher 
    Well, the -- the argument that is made here is that -- that no obscenity statute can be acted. 
    No restraint you put on speech unless of course it's conduct. 
    Now --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1285.886" stopTime="1298.468">

    But this is a -- I -- this is a particular statute and not at large, general obscenity, the area of obscenity. 
    That isn't what this case is about, necessarily is it?
speaker="roger_d_fisher" startTime="1365.894" stopTime="1366.922">
    Mr. Roger D. Fisher 
    No, this case is not.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1366.922" stopTime="1373.539">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Well, we didn't ask the Government just to discuss all alternative statutes.
speaker="roger_d_fisher" startTime="1373.539" stopTime="1809.462">
    Mr. Roger D. Fisher 
    We did not discuss all obscenity statutes, although some of the issues go far beyond issue in this case. 
    The Fifth Amendment attack, which is levied, is that the statute is too broad and too vague. 
    Now, these I say are Fifth Amendment questions, although of course in the area of First Amendment rights, there may be tighter standards of broadness or tighter standards that's definite than elsewhere. 
    When you are considering a statute which imposes a restraint in the name of social interest, a -- which maybe freedom of the press and the side who's interesting serve by that restraint, we thought the Court entitled to know the best of our ability, what the interests are that are involved. 
    Now, you've had -- cited to you in the briefs the Bible, Shakespeare, Freud, other great writers as being the sort of material that maybe called obscene. 
    That is not the sort of material that falls within the statute as applied and traditionally is -- is not what falls within it. 
    We have cited to you a number of tales whether they were hot stuff or she knew what she wanted. 
    You would not know what those books were. 
    We've made available a library of materials that came to the Government's possession and the Post Office which can illustrate more clearly than I. 
    Depending if the Courts should wish to look at it, that material which is a kind of stuff involved basically and which is the -- which divides the interests between free speech, ideas and the damage to the persons that are involved. 
    Of the 175 convictions, fiscal 1956 under the Post Office statute, 166 pleaded guilty. 
    The issue was primarily, this case is not one of whether the matter is obscene. 
    The issue -- both parties know what's involved. 
    The usual case the person believes it's obscene, he gets caught. 
    The attack in the reply brief filed this morning by petitioner in this case says that, “We justify pornography statute, not an obscenity statute.” 
    I'd like to -- to clarify what we may have said in the brief, bring a little focus on that. 
    Wherever a line is drawn at any point in this area, there will be three kinds of material that will fall below the line. 
    There will be a few people who are expressing themselves as they see fit and that form of expression happens to be so concentrated and so vile in the eyes of motion that it's taken as a whole, both are below that line. 
    There will be some more people who are catering to the interests that are barred by the statute, catering to the erotic, catering to those interests which the statute is designed to protect from interference and who are skating as close to the line as they can. 
    This is what we define the petitioner here, Roth is in the borderline area. 
    He is trying to produce material, has been producing material which if confronted, he would not concede as obscene. 
    He would hope that a jury of 12 would not unanimously agree beyond a reasonable doubt if it fell within that class. 
    The third category are those who don't care about the line or rather they know about the line and are deliberately trying to produce material which they know to be illegal, comparable to bootleg whiskey, there's no question about it. 
    They're not trying to follow. 
    They're trying to produce the material that's prohibited by the statute. 
    Now, we -- in running through the convictions which figures were available here in the Post Office Department of the published material, pressed, reproduced photo, commercially reproduced material which is involved in this litigation. 
    About 90% of that kind of -- of published material falls into the black market, hardcore pornography sort. 
    Now, that is not a reliable statistic which anyone -- you need to put much -- put much weight on. 
    That's our judgment. 
    Whether it's 90% now, I don't know. 
    If the statute is declared unconstitutional, I believe it will play the volume of material going through the mails to be substantially larger. 
    This commercial material is unpleasant to talk about, unpleasant to think about. 
    The-- the briefs, amicus curia filed in this Court indicate that people prefer to talk about civil liberties, the borderline between a great novel and a what might be considered obscene, the issues where censorship may trespass on vital scientific works of art. 
    Those are much more interesting issues than the ones we have here. 
    This matter is concededly obscene if anything is obscene and the statute question is, "Can Congress bar that stuff from the mail?" 
    I think that risk of trespassing in the Court. 
    I like to just briefly what is involved. 
    A large part is photographs, photographs of all sorts of person, people, generally without any clothes on in all cultures, groups, individuals. 
    They're engaged in activity, perversion of every kind. 
    These, if you read the briefs indicate that this is a vital freedom of -- these are the ideas which must be communicated. 
    The idea of content within the First Amendment terms of any such material is negative.Second category of materials, a little booklet of series of sex episodes, one after the other usually illustrated these photographs or drawings. 
    Third category, are comic books, especially drawn for the pornographic trade. 
    Fourth category is motion picture films. 
    We did not make any of those available to the Court. 
    If they should want to see them, it could be arranged. 
    They are the worst, most vile, any form of pornography in my estimation. 
    This material has no idea of content. 
    If there is any idea, it can easily be said by other means. 
    The Kingsley Books and other books illustrate that you can discuss this -- this subject to sexual morality and conduct without being obscene. 
    You do not have to offend and be as shocking as explicit, as vulgar, as debasing at the material which falls within the current concept of criminal obscenity.

    Mr. Roger D. Fisher 
    Eight and 16 millimeter films are produced in, I guess about a 300 foot roll. 
    It has a short plot to it. 
    It starts off with characters and ends up with all forms of perverted conduct. 
    They -- this is currently the price range of these films, I'm told runs about $75 to a $100. 
    There is no copyright of course. 
    So, they sell them the first time to get enough to protect themselves from people who are black marketing around. 
    They're frequently not transferred to the mail. 
    The mail gets it open to the advertising, letting him know through the mail if they are available. 
    They try to do it through railway express where the package is not so easily noticed as sending films by first class mail, which is the way to keep it from being inspected. 
    If you see a moving film, picture films going by first class mail, you -- the Post Office Department has to be suspicious and generally investigate.

    With two difference, Your Honor, as I read the cases there, there's another set that deals with where one interest of society is being impinged upon by an excessive use of free speech as an allowed and ruckus soundtrack. 
    It is not by speaking very loudly, they will lead people to action. 
    It's that the loudness of the soundtrack of -- disturbs the privacy of the home and offends the peace and quiet people in it to have the speech exercise at that pitch. 
    The peddler who comes to the door selling magazines, talking about magazines maybe restrained even though he's though he's taking about it. 
    And particularly, if he's talking pots, aluminum kitchenware, even the members of -- a citizen in Breard indicated that if the content of the speech was about pot, he would have even a lower order of priority in that which the Court agreed could be restrained in that case.

    The person can seize photographs of -- of sexual perversion, moving pictures of -- of perverted conduct taking place or booklets and think only that's to the experiment myself. 
    We think there's a serious risk of that one which the legislature could properly act upon. 
    Second, is long range conduct induced by a breaking down of morals? 
    This -- the -- that you read the books, it's not that you're immediately aroused to do something but to gradually fill your mind with a thought that every seems to be doing it.

    Is the validity of a charge before us in this case?

    Mr. Roger D. Fisher 
    I believe you have to take the statute as it has been generally construed and you can take it as -- in -- as construed in -- I think in this case. 
    I think if the charge were in gross error and they have said any book contains the dirty sentence you don't like, you can convict. 
    I believe this Court would be within its -- then, the limited question to reverse and say, “The statute is so construed,” was invalid. 
    The -- if I may trespass on your -- your generous question is --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="2948.066" stopTime="2950.861">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    What do you think about that order?
speaker="roger_d_fisher" startTime="2950.861" stopTime="3120.074">
    Mr. Roger D. Fisher 
    The -- the -- I don't think that the edge of the First Amendment is razor sharp. 
    But if we took a -- the motion picture film which take the kind of series of pictures taken at one-sixteenth of a second apart running from a legitimate photograph of a couple into yet an engagement, perverted conduct if anything obscene that is. 
    I don't think you can say the First Amendment is right between these two pictures. 
    I think that the -- the -- well, the pictures obscene depends on the whole balancing process of what the idea is. 
    You have to consider if it's a dirty picture, partly dirty, somewhat dirty and this is not the First Amendment. 
    I don't think my analysis, our analysis here is that speech raises constitutional questions. 
    Now, a billboard being put back from a highway, it's speech. 
    They want to have a safety slogan they put up on a new highway. 
    The county says, “No billboards on this highway.” 
    Now, that to say this is not -- doesn't raise First Amendment questions, I think is not candid and there was an effort to be candid with this Court that we went at such length to say that, speech which is obscene raises First Amendment questions. 
    And the Court in finding out whether the restraint, the violation of First Amendment must consider the extent to which that speech partakes of the ideas, opinions, political-economic social which is the basis of the First Amendment in an extent to which it causes the injuries which society has properly entitled to protect. 
    Here, the protection, it's limited to declining, to carry the stuff, carry these pictures through the United States mail. 
    We believe that whether other statutes are valid, whether a public, a prohibition on publication is valid. 
    The United States and its power to mail can properly say, “We do not choose to carry such worthless material.” 
    They can decide as to circle of a catalogue. 
    They -- they can certainly decide it -- I say, they could decide as this catalogue. 
    They can decide as to billboards, large signs, we don't want to carry those things. 
    They don't have enough ideas per pound. 
    They're not worth a terra. 
    This material is strongly objected to by society, not even majority, almost unanimous group of society. 
    This -- this matter is vile and considered so. 
    In this case, you must assume it to be obscene. 
    United States Government submits the statute which has been valid so long, considered valid so long which is not been deemed to raise constitutional questions. 
    Heretofore, on its face, is a valid exercise, postal power invade the Federal Government by the Constitution.

speaker="o_john_rogge" startTime="3164.413" stopTime="3426.026">
    Mr. O. John Rogge 
    Now, the next point I'd like to make is to be sure that we're talking about this case. 
    Government counsel fought a great deal about pornography and in their brief they talked about hardcore pornography, whatever that may mean. 
    And Mr. Justice Harlan, you asked about pictures and I think you did too, Mr. Justice Douglas. 
    I think the Government will concede that they're not talking about the evidence in this case. 
    If there's any doubt on that, I'd like to have it cleared up now. 
    The Government is talking about material in another case than this one. 
    I'd also like to spend the moment on the scope of review. 
    The review was very specifically set out here in three questions, relating to the constitutionality of this statute on its face and as applied under the First, the Fifth, the Ninth and Tenth Amendments. 
    Now, the Government in its brief at Page 56 suggests, under the limited grant of certiorari, it is to be taken as given that the material to which the statute was construed to apply is likely to corrupt the morals of the average members of the community. 
    So, we challenge this statement, because if getting to -- getting past the point, I first say that when the First Amendment says, “Congress shall pass no law,” that's just what it meant. 
    But, when we get beyond that, if we get to the clear and present danger test, we are in such questions as what is the substantive evil and did these publications have a probability of causing it. 
    That is also involved within the scope of review here. 
    Now, Mr. Justice Frankfurter, I'd like to begin with your question as to whether the Post Office has to carry the material. 
    And here I began with -- begin with the statement by Mr. Justice Holmes in a dissenting opinion in which Mr. Justice Brandeis concurred in the Burleson case, a dissenting opinion which was approved by this Court in Hannegan against Esquire. 
    Mr. Justice Holmes said, “The United States may give up the Post Office when it sees fit, but while it carries it on the use of the mails is almost as much a part of free speech as the right to use our tongues.” 
    And if we're going to have a Post Office Department, it has to carry the material. 
    And if I have to refer to an analogy where you had a comparable situation in the corner of the century before the civil war broke up, there was on the statute books, an Act of 1836, which specifically made it a penal offense, if any Postmaster should unlawfully detain in his office any letter, package, pamphlet or newspaper with intent to prevent the arrival and delivery of the same to the person or persons to whom such letter, package, pamphlet or newspaper maybe addressed or directed. 
    That's an Act which Congress passed after it had refused to enact a measure for which President Jackson called in December 1835, for barring the use of the mails incendiary publications. 
    And pursuant to that statute, you had rulings both by the Attorney General and also by the Postmaster General that state laws obtain supremacy when it came to a question of incendiary publications. 
    In 1857, the United States Attorney General Cushing ruled that a Mississippi statute, forbidding delivery of incendiary matter was not in conflict with the federal law of 1836 and no Postmaster was required to deliver material, the design and pendency of which you're to promote insurrection. 
    Now, I would say to Your Honor, that the Postmaster General has to carry the material because the First Amendment said, “Congress shall make no law.”

    Mr. O. John Rogge 
    I submit to Your Honor that the constitutionality of this statute on the points in which we raise in this brief has not been squarely argued and considered by this Court and I think you should do so now.

    What do you do with Ex parte Jackson, a very history to which you refer the abolitionist debate in the Senate and the vote against President Jackson's proposals?

    He prodded out as though it was a novelty, something new that we've heard.

    Mr. O. John Rogge 
    Well, if I'm not mistaken, that case dealt with a lottery and it was in the course of that that the Court makes the point and quotes the Congressional history on the defeat of President Jackson's proposal for prohibiting the use of the mails, the so-called incendiary literature.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    And draws the conclusion that despite the evidence of the men who made those feature in the Senate, both the Statesmen and jurors had rejected them.

    Mr. O. John Rogge 
    I submit, if the Court please, that on the first two major occasions, which involved statutes aimed at speech, namely at the time of the Sedition Act of 1798 and again in 1835 and 1836, when the Congress was considering the passage of the law that President Jackson asked for against what in old days were called incendiary publications. 
    When we are dealing with periods of time, where we're involved with the framers of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights and we are involved with their first descendants, men who were in their youth at the time of the Bill of Rights would passed on those first two great occasions, when the question arose as to whether the United States could -- whether the Congress could pass a law involving speech, they stood up and said, “No.” 
    And to come to Your Honor's question as to libel, I submit that the United -- that the Congress does not have the power to pass a law relating to libel. 
    This was specifically what was involved in the Sedition Act of 1798, and both Madison and Jefferson.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="3708.810" stopTime="3721.425">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Well, of course it doesn't have as to libel. 
    I said as to libeling the District of Columbia and the Alien and Sedition Laws had provisions about a different from this statute as night from day.

    They're in the First Amendment area, if Your Honor please.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Everything that's in an area isn't the same.
speaker="o_john_rogge" startTime="3727.931" stopTime="3827.639">
    Mr. O. John Rogge 
    Now, I want to address myself for a moment to the point that Mr. Justice Douglas raised. 
    And in this connection, I want to draw distinction between the Dennis case and this case. 
    At least in the Dennis case, you had a statute namely the Smith Act, which made it a crime to advocate the overthrow of the Government by force and violence. 
    Where is there any statute in this case defining the substantive evil? 
    Where is their in this case any statute which says that anyone who uses the mail for the purpose of inciting people to immorality? 
    I doubt whether it would be constitutional, but where is there the very basis for beginning in this case? 
    You have no statute here as in the Dennis case which defines the substantive evil. 
    And beyond that, you have no proof that the defendant's publications could bring about any such substantive evil. 
    Now, lacking those two things, I had assumed that originally that the question which in a shorthand wary of -- referred to as the clear and present danger test, was the question for the jury under the Pierce case, but under the Dennis case, the Court passes on that. 
    But there wasn't even any basis on that approach for the Court to allow this case to go to the jury. 
    Now, the Government referred to various cases such as taking, falls off in the park and various other things which I submit were nothing more --

    Mr. Rogge, you may -- you may have five minutes more if you wish to with your argument.
speaker="roger_d_fisher" startTime="3834.505" stopTime="3835.833">
    Mr. Roger D. Fisher 
    I just wanted to make this last point -- 
   
   
   
   Rebuttal of O. John Rogge
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3835.833" stopTime="3836.266">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Yes, you may.
speaker="o_john_rogge" startTime="3836.266" stopTime="4042.390">
    Mr. O. John Rogge 
    -- Mr. Chief Justice. 
    These references by the Government to such incidence relate to local breaches of the peace and would be handled in that way. 
    In other words, if a man gets up in the public park and takes his clothes off and people gather, I assume this would be a breach of the peace and would be handled in that way. 
    It wouldn't involve a First Amendment question. 
    I -- since I -- since Mr. Chief Justice, you gave me five more minutes, I will take another minute to make another point. 
    We assume in these whole area that somehow or other, publications are going to cause sexual or other delinquency. 
    The truth of the matter is, we don't know. 
    As Judge Fuld in the Court of Appeals in Kingsley Books against Brown pointed out in a footnote, he said it is noteworthy that studies are for the first time being made through such scientific skills does exist concerning the impact of the obscene in riding some other mass media on the minds and behavior of men, women and children. 
    We haven't had them up to this point. 
    And for Professor Walter Gellhorn suggests on the contrary that rather than publications leading to such kind of conduct, he suggests the Aristotelian theory that maybe it acts as a catharsis and will keep people from engaging in the kind of conduct that society is afraid of. 
    I submit where we're in an area in the first place where we really don't know about the impact of publications. 
    And where on the contrary, there is substantial psychological authority to the effect that maybe it's on the good side rather that on the bad, which is also born out by the study of the book, namely, delinquents don't read. 
    On the contrary they have reading difficulties. 
    When you take all these up, even if you are going into the clear and present danger area and I submit that the First Amendment means just what it says and was so held, namely, Congress will make no law, but if we get in to that area, you at least should have some basis somewhere for saying this is the substantive evil and these publications have the probability for bringing them about and you don't even have that. 
    Thank you.
