    Leslie Miller, Incorporated, Appellant, versus State of Arkansas. 
    Mr. Smith.

    Mr. William J. Smith 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    In considering the application of Hill against Florida to the present case, it should be noted that the issue there was one of the supremacy of federal law under the Commerce Clause with a conflicting state law rather than strictly one of sovereign immunity. 
    Here, we have the same issue of the supremacy of federal law over state law but it is reenforced in this case by the doctrine of sovereign immunity. 
    I think what I say can be made clear by referring to two other cases. 
    I think the closest case to our present one on its facts is Johnson against Maryland in 254 United States 51. 
    There, the specific question was whether or not the Post Office Department was limited in hiring drivers to deliver mail in Maryland to individuals who had been licensed by the State of Maryland to drive motor vehicles in that State. 
    And Mr. Justice Holmes speaking for the Court found that the Post Office Department should not be limited in its choice of drivers of its mail trucks to those who had been licensed by the State of Maryland. 
    Now on the other hand the -- the case which really gives us the -- the greatest difficulty is the Penn Dairies case. 
    There, the question was the application of the Pennsylvania law which imposed a minimum price on the sale of milk in Pennsylvania, the application of this law, the transactions between a Pennsylvania dairy and the United States which was buying milk for use in -- in army camp. 
    The Court held that the minimum price requirement of the State of Pennsylvania was applicable. 
    It did so by treating this case in the same light as it would have treated a case of a non-discriminatory tax which is imposed upon an agency of the United States and where there is quite a line of cases now holding that as long as the -- as the tax is non-discriminatory, it may be imposed even though there is an additional economic burden on the United States by reason of the tax. 
    Reasoning from this basis the Court said, that this did not interfere in effect, it didn't really interfere with the United States procurement of milk. 
    It added an economic burden to it. 
    It made -- it may have caused the United States more to buy its milk but it didn't really interfere, it wasn't inconsistent with it. 
    And that the additional economic burden was well merely one of those burdens which is the price of paying that we have to pay by having a dual sovereignty.

speaker="william_j_smith" startTime="221.392" stopTime="571.534">
    Mr. William J. Smith 
    Now, in this -- in the Penn Dairies case, there is -- there is another distinction between this and the Penn Dairies case. 
    In that case, it was specifically recognized that if Congress had desired to remove this activity from the field of state regulation, Congress would have had the power to have said so and that if it had its law would have been supreme that it would have removed it from -- from the state law. 
    Now, that's important in this case because it comes down to the second leg of our argument namely, that here, Congress, through the Armed Services Procurement Act and the regulations which have been adopted pursuant to it, Congress has legislated with respect to this type of procurement in a way which excludes the State from regulating it at the same time. 
    I -- I don't mean by this that Congress has said, "The State shall not regulate procurement." 
    I don't think that Penn Dairies means that there should be a -- a necessarily an outright statement to that but what -- what appears here is that the legislation which has been enacted by Congress is so inclusive, so pervasive that it would be inconsistent to believe that Congress could believe that the States could regulate it at the same time. 
    The Armed Services Procurement Act or pertinent portions of it are set forth in -- in our brief beginning in -- in the appendix, beginning at page 46. 
    And that with respect to this type of -- with respect to this type of contract, which is a contract which is placed by advertising, it is provided and I'm reading from page 49 of our brief, Section 3 (b), "All bids shall be publicly opened at the time and place stated in the advertisement. 
    Awards shall be made with reasonable promptness by written notice to that responsible bidder whose bid conforming to the invitations of bids shall be found most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.” 
    This vest in the contracting officers in this case the Corps of Engineers, the discretion to determine which bid is most advantageous to the Government and they in turn are guided by the regulations which are set forth in the pages which follow as to what consideration shall be given -- shall be taken into consideration in determining which is the most advantageous bid. 
    The Act itself gives -- gives some guidance. 
    For example in the first -- in Section 2 of the Act, there's a provision that in entering into such contracts, consideration shall be given to protecting small business. 
    This then would be one of the considerations which would have to be considered in determining which bid should be accepted. 
    Now in order to make concrete for this Court to be -- the type of -- the way these two laws would conflict, I think it be interesting to -- to note the application in this particular case. 
    In this case, bids were invited from 126 firms and bids were received from 16 bidders and Mr. Justice Brennan, there was only one of those that was located in -- in Arkansas. 
    Of the 16 bidders, seven only were licensed by Arkansas and nine were non-licensed. 
    The engineers in going over the bids determined that Leslie Miller was the best, most advantageous, responsible bidder. 
    It was not licensed. 
    If -- if the Corps of the Engineers had been governed by the Arkansas statute, it would have been necessary to sift through these 16 bidders and to -- to take first the one that was most advantageous, Leslie Miller wasn't licensed and go down through the list until it found one that was licensed. 
    Now obviously, this is substituting for the discretion of the -- of the Corp of Engineers as governed by the law and the regulations. 
    It's -- it's substituting a judgment of the State of Arkansas as to who should be licensed and who is licensed. 
    And that I believe is a direct conflict which -- which shows that the two laws cannot in -- in effect live together and that in that case the federal law should be given the supremacy which is required by Article 6 of the Constitution. 
    I would like, if I may, to -- and go on amicus curiae, I would like, if I may, to reserve time for -- for rebuttal if this would be agreeable to Mr. Davis.

    Mr. John F. Davis 
    There is that language in the statute. 
    I -- I -- it does not sound reasonable. 
    That -- that sounds presumptuous. 
    I mean, I could -- I could criticize the reasoning that it doesn't affect the United States because it applies only to the other parties of the contract. 
    I think it apply -- that it does affect both the United States and the contracting party.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="660.004" stopTime="684.292">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    I'm referring more particularly at all to the Penn Dairies unlike this case, it wasn't required that the agents, officials of the United States were restricted or rather impliedly, it was argued that they were allowed, that they were free and not subject to such restriction that Pennsylvania invoked.
speaker="john_f_davis" startTime="684.292" stopTime="706.076">
    Mr. John F. Davis 
    Yes. 
    Both -- there's a very real difference in the factual situation because there, they can get their milk from these people that they choose. 
    There is an economic burden on the United States to be sure. 
    It costs more money to buy the milk but they can buy the milk from whomever they choose, and the Court treated the restriction as this -- in the same way that it would treat a non-discriminatory tax as --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="706.076" stopTime="730.175">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    In other words the -- one of the considerations you'd allow it on, a different type of those cases like what are the considerations. 
    I think, the importance was that there wasn't a description. 
    But you didn't have to get the cheapest milk and therefore it's fair to argue that Uncle Sam wanting to get particularly this purchase of milk as well as the other one.
speaker="john_f_davis" startTime="730.175" stopTime="737.683">
    Mr. John F. Davis 
    That's -- that is right.

speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="737.683" stopTime="756.758">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    No conflict would arise if a man is treated a supply (Inaudible) then it doesn't restrict him to say it's free to buy -- you must buy from -- that there's an advantage, a public advantage in buying from (Inaudible) the more certified regulated milk, is that right?
speaker="john_f_davis" startTime="756.758" stopTime="772.008">
    Mr. John F. Davis 
    That is right. 
    I may say with respect to Pacific Coast Dairies that if there were exclusive jurisdiction of this -- if the Government had taken jurisdiction so the state law no longer applied to this air field, it might well strengthen our case. 
    It might -- it might make it --

   Rebuttal of William J. Smith
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="794.183" stopTime="797.683">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Smith.
speaker="william_j_smith" startTime="797.683" stopTime="987.421">
    Mr. William J. Smith 
    May it please the Court. 
    I don't recall what the issue in this case at all. 
    I think the issue is clear. 
    I think the issue can be taken from Penn Dairies as cited by or as stated by this Court in its opinion in Penn Dairies. 
    There he said since the Constitution had left Congress free to set aside local taxation and regulation of Government contractors which burdened the national government, we see no basis for implying from the constitutional alone a restriction of all certain regulations which Congress has not seen fit to impose unless the regulations are shown to be inconsistent with congressional policy citing cases and continuing. 
    Our inquiry here therefore must be whether the state regulation of this contract in a matter of local concern, conflicts with congressional legislation or with any desirable congressional policy. 
    I agree 100% that that's the issue in this case. 
    We think that Congress has created a framework of legislation for the letting of these contracts, these construction contracts and other types of contracts but -- but particularly a construction contract within the framework of these state regulatory laws and the reason I say these state because approximately one half of the states have a similar law. 
    Now, before proceeding further with the -- with the issues on the law, I would like to give some background in view of the argument yesterday as to the purpose of this law or certainly to say that these laws have only for their purpose the protection of the owner who deals with the contractor as a fallacious argument. 
    These laws seek to protect the -- the state assets, the people assets, the welfare and the health of the people. 
    The construction industry is one of the most important segments of the industry of any state or the economy of any state and to stabilize the construction and receive one of the purposes of this law and now the states have followed the same procedure in enacting similar laws. 
    This law has been on the statute books in Arkansas since 1939. 
    There's never been one case cited to you or one instance where this board has tried to be arbitrary or tried to keep outsiders out of the State of Arkansas or tried to use it for any improper motive elements and to accomplish the purposes of the law and that's to stabilize the construction industry within the borders of Arkansas.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="987.421" stopTime="988.401">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Is the question before it?
speaker="william_j_smith" startTime="988.401" stopTime="989.641">

    Yes.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="989.641" stopTime="1003.465">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    We're not to confront it with the problem of striking down this law, the problem before us is this restriction on Uncle Sam himself is concerned. 
    With the -- merely in the words.
speaker="william_j_smith" startTime="1003.465" stopTime="1029.201">
    Mr. William J. Smith 
    I quite agree with you Mr. Justice Frankfurter and unless Congress has specifically prohibited such regulation such as it has done in the Atomic Energy Act passed upon by this Court in Carson v. Roane-Anderson, cited in our brief, then that restriction has not been laid upon the states.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1029.201" stopTime="1053.001">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    So that is -- they're not offering that as applied position of the law, then Congress would say in (Inaudible) 
    Well this Court I suppose is, I don't know why. 
    Probably a hundred cases certainly at the beginning of time, I can say that they started in which this Court has stricken down state legislation because of the implied contract with some overriding federal authority.
speaker="william_j_smith" startTime="1053.001" stopTime="1140.999">
    Mr. William J. Smith 
    I -- I quite agree with that purpose, yes. 
    And if there the implied conflict here with congressional enactment or congressional policy then the state law must follow. 
    It should be my purpose to show that there's no conflict for instance there has no standard form of contract adopted for construction contracts cited in our brief at page 10, United States standard form contract on Title 41 in the appendix, 41, Section 54413 provided in part, Article 10, "Permits and responsibility for work, the contractor shall, without additional expense to the Government obtain all required licenses and permits." 
    Now Congress in other instances and I think that it's fair to assume that that is an -- is one way to get at the intention of Congress. 
    It has provided for special immunity of its contractors and of course this Court has held that contractors do not or not close with the immunity of the Government by reason of the relationship between the Government and the contractors. 
    Now --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1140.999" stopTime="1146.174">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    I think you can tax the contractors where their money it makes out of Uncle Sam.
speaker="william_j_smith" startTime="1146.174" stopTime="1147.726">
    Mr. William J. Smith 
    Yes, sir.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1147.726" stopTime="1151.950">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    That's a very different problem.
speaker="william_j_smith" startTime="1151.950" stopTime="1238.694">
    Mr. William J. Smith 
    We read the cases to state taxation and regulations as to that. 
    If we're in error in that connection, we might be. 
    We think that this Article 10 in the standard form must mean something. 
    It specifically provides for the obtaining of permits and licenses. 
    What else does it mean? 
    In -- in the Morgan case cited in our brief, Morgan versus the State of Arkansas for the use of benefit of Philips County, appeal was dismissed by this case citing the -- the Stewart case which an out-of-state contractor came in, did not comply with the laws regulating corporations. 
    They're doing their business by corporations, perform the contract for the Government and the White River Levee District, suit was brought, a penalty was laid. 
    It was appealed to this Court and the appeal was dismissed. 
    On the ground, there was no substantial federal question. 
    Here, there has been no interference with the work. 
    A penalty has been laid on this contractor for violating the state law. 
    The appeal is here. 
    Frankly, we don't distinguish the cases.

speaker="william_j_smith" startTime="1303.182" stopTime="1350.861">
    Mr. William J. Smith 
    I -- I think that the distinction is that in those cases, those professional cases, the Government only is affected. 
    Now in the case of the Johnson v. Maryland, it was cited a few moments ago, there is a government employee. 
    And the Government is responsible in that case for its employee. 
    Our state statute specifically exempts under Section 15 and that may be found in appellant brief at page 28, I believe. 
    Our state statute specifically exempts authorized representatives of the Government.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Yes, but it might -- might not be an employee of the Government, it might make that contract with an architect to draft -- to design a building. 
    They might make a contract with a health service to perform services for the Indians or for veterans or for some -- or for some other group from the State.

    There are ways to accomplish what the Government seeks to accomplish without striking down the state law. 
    Now in the case of an architect, it may be different and we find nothing in the regulations that shows that that problem has been considered and any provision has been made for where here we didn't find a specific regulation providing for permits and licenses and that's the only distinction I can find.

    Mr. William J. Smith 
    Oh, yes, Mr. Justice Clark. 
    We have any number of local and state regulations affecting the building industry. 
    I -- I'd speak for Arkansas alone because I've studied those. 
    We know that they're uniform throughout the State usually. 
    We have a general contractor's license. 
    We have a master plumber's license on the state level, a local plumber license on the local level. 
    We have electrician's licenses required. 
    All of these are laid in the police power to the State for the health and welfare and they involved important functions so far as society is concern. 
    Now, I would like to reach the argument made yesterday that this law could not have been intended to affect workmen, the safety of employees or it would not have been the $20,000 requirement put in. 
    Well again, I -- I don't agree with that premise at all because the magnitude of the work to be regulated is one of the important things we all know that our workmen's compensation law of course at some states they have three employees, some five, some eight. 
    One State I remember Kentucky as high as 14 under certain industries. 
    It's the overall impact upon the community and there why -- if a general contractor or contractor has a contract of less than $20,000, the State has decided and when the law was originally written, it was $10,000. 
    It was amended to go to $20,000 in view of inflation because a project costing less then that and it maybe a building downtown as well as out on an air field, there are passersby, there -- there are citizens going and coming on the sidewalks, on the streets near, there are employees on the job, there are material men dealing with the contractors, there are subcontractors dealing with it. 
    An argument may be there that we have the Miller Act on federal projects. 
    It may be argued that we have the MiIler Act but we all agree that the Miller Act doesn't protect everybody in every sense, we don't even had an argument before this Court yesterday that it was not reaching one of the problems of the workmen on their welfare fund. 
    So we say that Congress has not specifically legislated in this field and has not legislated in the field to such an extent as to imply that this law is in conflict with congressional enactments.

    We know that many times they were drawn very loosely. 
    That's an emergency clause in order that the Act may go into effect consigned by the Government otherwise it would have been 120 days after the Government signed it. 
    And the emergency clause is not usually digested. 
    In this case, I would look in back to see the emergency clause to the original Act and if you look on page 30, there is an emergency clause there. 
    Section 22 to the original Act and it's accustomed to track this emergency clauses on to legislation in order to put them into effect and we -- we've had many emergency clauses of course attacked and in that case they fall unless they measure up to the requirements of an emergency clause. 
    We don't think that this emergency clause can be taken to fairly state the scope of the law.

    Mr. Smith, there was one thing that -- that bothered me here and that is that your -- your law apparently not only requires them to have this license in order to transact in the contracting business but it also requires them to have the license at the time they bid.

    Yes.
speaker="william_j_smith" startTime="1868.978" stopTime="2050.438">
    Mr. William J. Smith 
    We think that that is some burden. 
    We also think that Congress can remove that burden anytime it wants to just as it did in the Atomic Energy Act. 
    Now, the mere fact that there is some burden as been held by this Court is not sufficient to strike the law down. 
    Now -- now what is that burden in this particular case? 
    The Government has agreed that the Board meets on an average of 18 times a year even though the loan it requires to meet in February and August, there is no showing that anyone has a difficulty in getting an audience with the Board or getting the application passed upon. 
    Now, in addition to that and that's been the long time history and certainly this appellant here represented by a corporate counsel, I believe they would erase every defense they could have. 
    But there'd been no showing of any abuse of discretion or any attempt to restrict in that manner. 
    Now, one of these government projects, this particular airport for instance to give a background and I'm going outside the record but I'm sure there'll be no objection. 
    The people of that community raised money over a period of six or eight months and brought this property and gave it to the Government. 
    We were anxious to get the Government in there and contrary to some remarks in the brief with my opposing counsel we're not trying to keep the Government out of Arkansas a construction now.We are happy to have all the construction they'll give us. 
    But these contractors knew that this project was coming up.Six of the seven that were licensed came in there and qualified. 
    There is no showing it could not -- not have qualified or there was any unreasonable requirements or any attempt to keep him from qualifying. 
    Now of course when you say -- and -- and the very fact that 136 invitations were sent out to show that it's not highly specialized. 
    I think the Government will consider itself fortunate anytime it gets seven qualified business and there's nothing here to show that there was anything more than an economic burden. 
    They said they had seven licensed. 
    Now, I don't know what the difference was in the bids. 
    The Government hasn't set it out. 
    It might have been $5. 
    I don't know. 
    But I still go back to the proposition which this Court has said over and over that Congress is able to strike down these state laws when it feels as a matter of congressional policy, that the state law imposes too great a burden on the federal government and that's our case. 
    If this Court determines that it does that it impliedly conflict or specifically conflicts then we realize a state law of United States. 
    We recognize the supremacy of the federal law in this field.

    They would not here provided.

    Now, he may or may not subpart of it but if the general contractor under the laws of Arkansas, and I'm sure you'll find the same in other states. 
    A general contractor has no right to perform plumbing unless he has a license to perform plumbing, yet he contracts with the Government to install that plumber. 
    The same thing with the electricians and the other licensees -- licensing laws pertaining to the building industry. 
    The building industry has grown to be complex. 
    We all know that. 
    It's probably the largest industry, income wise, and -- and employee payroll wise, and materials and everything in our entire country.

    I'm suggesting that you're not -- if Congress really told that it's mine, that's why I gave up trying to find out what the intention of Congress is. 
    If Congress tells it's mine in English then there's no problem. 
    The problem is when it doesn't tell us, it doesn't know exactly because it has any problem.

    Mr. William J. Smith 
    I quite agree with you. 
    We have a problem in this case. 
    I -- I do not say if Congress had specifically legislated, we would not be here.

    Mr. William J. Smith 
    Yes, sir, yes.

    I put the fact there's a general -- and I think this is relevant in my defense. 
    I'm sure on the showing that this describes a general problem, that's a different story from what I understand and when Uncle Sam didn't reach the choice that he's -- that he would be doing direct government work by what the State wants.

    Mr. William J. Smith 
    I'd say they cannot be restricted if Congress speaks. 
    We don't think Congress has spoken to that extent in this case. 
    We say that in line with the Penn Dairies case and other cases decided by this Court that Congress always has the ability to relieve the burden whereas if there is any damage done or any harm resulting from an opinion of this Court, the State is parallel to remove that harm.

    Let me suggest another question of -- to this problem. 
    It has been suggested that this presents you -- I noticed (Inaudible) often exclusively the civilization of the industry (Inaudible) 
    This may be also protective of the employee to a certain deal after -- you're holding of the people (Inaudible) government could interpret speculations, I suggest that Uncle Sam may be aware of the facts that sometimes licensing agencies in different states are not (Inaudible) but licensing agencies have been known to play favorites. 
    That's not unknown in the history of licensing.

    I quite agree, yes.

    The Government speculate as to what mischief maybe done, somewhat evil or (Inaudible) 
    And Uncle Sam ought to be subject to that kind of favorite play licensing.
speaker="william_j_smith" startTime="3012.245" stopTime="3018.171">
    Mr. William J. Smith 
    And Congress could always act to remove any burden that maybe shown to exist.

    Well Mr. Smith, one of the things that bothers me is apparently Congress has picked some standards for the award of bids to responsible bidders. 
    It was determined what a responsible bidder is and this character, reputation, ability and experience and so forth. 
    Now, when it -- when it determines to do that, is it not in so doing excluding the right of the State to determine who is qualified by reason of experience, character and -- and so forth?
speaker="william_j_smith" startTime="3063.749" stopTime="3095.102">
    Mr. William J. Smith 
    We feel that if these regulations had been sound on permits and licenses that could have been implied. 
    Yes, sir. 
    But we feel that in the announcement of the formed contract that they must get permits and licenses that must have meant something and we don't know of any other kind of permits and licenses that would have to get except licenses.
