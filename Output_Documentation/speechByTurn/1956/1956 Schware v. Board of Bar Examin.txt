    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Number 92, Rudolph Schware versus Board of Bar Examiners of the State of New Mexico. 
    Mr. Levy, you may continue.
speaker="herbert_monte_levy" startTime="10.386" stopTime="328.145">
    Mr. Herbert Monte Levy 
    Thank you, Your Honor. 
    Yesterday, in the four minutes that I had to argue, I attempted to establish that there was no question here actually of burden of proof in terms of the petitioner's showing of his good moral character that he made below. 
    I would like to begin today by stressing the affirmative proof in relation to the petitioner that was given by him. 
    The first and perhaps the most cogent point is that this man was a dupe of the Communist Party, who is duped into joining the Party in 1934 and left it in 1940 when he began to learn what it was all about. 
    I think a special stress must be laid upon the fact that he testified without contradiction, without any doubt manifested anywhere else, that after he left the Party, he went to the FBI to be of assistance to them in the fight against communism. 
    In other words, we have the picture of a man who has been an anti-Communist for at least a decade who is now barred from admission to the bar of a court. 
    Among other reasons, I would say mainly, because of his past membership in the Communist Party. 
    I think it also deserves note that this man voluntarily admitted that he had once been a member of the Communist Party, going to the dean of the law school, admitting it to him in the very beginning without any request therefore. 
    I think it should also be noted that he led an honorable life in the Army of the United States and received an honorable discharge. 
    I think it should further be noted in regard to what the respondent in terms of discrepancy in a number of arrests that he had undergone in California, that this man made a trip halfway across the country to California to find out exactly what the situation was as shown by the records in California. 
    I think it is also worthy of note that this man presented not merely testimonials and affidavits and letters, but also presented live witnesses including the Rabbi of this Orthodox Jewish Synagogue, who testified as to his very high opinion of the petitioner. 
    He presented the dean's secretary, who knew him fairly intimately, she said. 
    And she testified too as to her very high opinion. 
    And the blind student, whom Schware had helped in law school over and above the call of duty, also testified as to his fine moral character. 
    This is in addition to the other point such as his conversion to religion, his establishing an anonymous scholarship for indigent students at the law school, letters of recommendation from virtually everybody there, etcetera, etcetera. 
    In terms, again, of the letters that he presented showing his high moral character, the respondent has raised some questions as to the lack of enthusiasm, so-called lack of enthusiasm in some of the letters which was submitted. 
    However, in other letters, which he of course does not advert to, I'm referring now to page 85 of the record, we find one person, Mr. Martinez testifying that, “Schware's moral character in my opinion is far and beyond the highest standard of any person I have ever come in contact with.” 
    And then, on the next page 86 at the bottom, another person testifies that Schware is a person of the highest and best moral character. 
    And at the bottom of 87, another person testifies, “That I know Mr. Schware to be open-handed charitable towards others and scrupulously honest in every situation. 
    Were he to represent me, I should have every confidence in his integrity.” 
    And again, on page 88, another person says in the center of the page, “That I find him trustworthy, honest and his character to my estimation is above reproach.” 
    So that I think we have here a case where whatever burden of proof there may have been as to his good moral character, Mr. Schware has sustained it more than admirably if ever there was a -- shall I call it a super prima facie case, I think this was it. 
    The record also shows that Mr. Schware had been an idealist all his life, that he joined the party for idealistic reasons. 
    But when he found that this god had failed him, so many others had found in the past, he left the Party. 
    He himself was the person who furnished all the derogatory information against him. 
    He concealed nothing. 
    He refused to answer no question. 
    I think it's also worthy of note that exactly the same decision in regard to his case was made by the Board of Bar Examiners before and after Mr. Schware introduced his affirmative evidence. 
    In other words, the affirmative evidence apparently had no effect. 
    There is nothing in this record at all to show that anywhere in his whole life had Mr. Schware ever done anything indicating bad moral character. 
    From my examination of the record, I think I can state that he had never violated the code of honesty, the code of morality, or the code of good social conduct.

    Justice John M. Harlan 
    That's right.
speaker="herbert_monte_levy" startTime="356.507" stopTime="694.603">
    Mr. Herbert Monte Levy 
    -- they have received about Schware. 
    Actually, the burden of proof question is not really in the case. 
    It's really a question of the standards they used. 
    The Court said at page 109 that its standard was of good moral character and I quote now from the top of the page. 
    “They must consider two kinds of indirect evidence. 
    First, the pattern of conduct an individual follows. 
    And second, the consideration of the regard his fellows and associates have for him.” 
    As to the pattern of conduct an individual follows, using the present tense, there is nothing which anyone could and I am sure there is nothing that the respondents contend, which had been reprehensible during the 15 years prior to the application for admission. 
    The Court actually just adverted very briefly in one-half of a page to this very fine record that Mr. Schware have had and they nowhere has related it to his present moral character. 
    In regard to the second standard that they used, the consideration of the regard his fellows and associates have for him, at page 125, the Court said and I quote from the last paragraph. 
    “The record on which this -- second sentence, “The record on which this decision is based came from the petitioner himself, who presently enjoys good repute among his teachers, his fellow students, and associates and in his synagogue.” 
    So that is to the second criterion that the court used below, they obviously -- Schware had sustained that burden of proof. 
    As to the pattern of conduct he follows, the Court nowhere has considered the conduct of the past 15 years and rested its decision entirely upon the basis of pre-1940 conduct. 
    The burden of proof, by the way, is mentioned aside from that -- the use of the word on page 190 -- 109, comes up again only at pages 126, which is the tail end of the first opinion. 
    And again, in page 150, in both of those cases, they took the question of good moral character is related solely to the question of past membership in the Communist Party and use of aliases, and the fact that there had been arrest. 
    There is no question raised anywhere as in the opinion as to good moral character in any other way, shape, or form. 
    The testimony, I think I showed yesterday of the petitioner and his witnesses was all accepted. 
    There was no question raised. 
    The only discrepancies that were mentioned at all was the fact that he had given an additional reason for using an alias at one particular point, plus the fact that Schware could not account for his addresses and employments during a particular period about 20 years previously. 
    And though the Court adverted to that, they did not rely upon that at all. 
    They said that were it not -- they said that this would be devoid of explanation where it not for the fact that Schware led such a peripatetic existence. 
    But having led that existence, they felt there was certainly a reason explaining why he could not account for these particular times. 
    I might also add that -- or reiterate perhaps that the failure, the inability to account for certain periods of time with regard to employment and addresses was mentioned in Schware's application blank. 
    And again, to mention again what I said yesterday, the respondent said that at no time had they ever raised the contention that Schware's answers were anything but full, true and complete. 
    As they say, to quote it again on page 90, “Respondent has not made any claim. 
    The petitioner answered any questions in his applications other than fully and accurately, nor is the respondent's decision in the petitioner's case based upon any such claim, nor was the decision below based on any such claim," I might add. 
    The only question before this Court then, I think, is quite clearly, the three standards that were used. 
    As to the first standard, the question of membership in the Communist Party, this I think is central. 
    I think it must be remembered that the use of aliases and the fact of arrest had been disclosed in the application to take the bar examination. 
    Despite that disclosure, we find that the petitioner was advised that he was entitled to take the bar examination.That is alleged in paragraph (4) on page 1 of this record in the petition to review. 
    And that paragraph is specifically admitted on page 90, paragraph (5) of the response to the petition, that he had been advised that he was entitled to take the bar examination. 
    My opponent -- opponents say that he had merely been told to report for an examination, but again, the record stands very clear here that he was entitled to take the bar examination, that he had been so advised. 
    And --

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    What's the relevance of that? 
    Is that an estoppel?
speaker="herbert_monte_levy" startTime="697.608" stopTime="701.731">
    Mr. Herbert Monte Levy 
    No, I'm not saying that there is an estoppel, Mr. Justice Frankfurter.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="701.731" stopTime="702.830">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Then what is -- what is the point of that?
speaker="herbert_monte_levy" startTime="702.830" stopTime="717.942">
    Mr. Herbert Monte Levy 
    I think the point of that is to show the centrality of this issue that the case rested upon that. 
    And that -- but for the past Communist Party membership, this man would have clearly been admitted to the bar, which I think may be of assistance to the Court in framing its order.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="717.942" stopTime="726.780">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    That's my difficulty, the statement that a man was allowed to take an examination. 
    I can hardly reach the conclusion, the contempt that he was to be admitted.
speaker="herbert_monte_levy" startTime="726.780" stopTime="733.242">
    Mr. Herbert Monte Levy 
    No, but that he would be entitled to take it. 
    I shouldn't have said that he would -- that he should have been admitted.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    You're going to be in New York, after you testify you have to go through the casual (Inaudible)
speaker="herbert_monte_levy" startTime="737.699" stopTime="811.767">
    Mr. Herbert Monte Levy 
    That's right, just the reversal here. 
    Now, again, the court below here specifically conceded that membership in the Communist Party at the time of Schware's membership was legal, nor do I know myself of any illegality of the Communist Party in any other states during which Schware was in the period from 1934 to 1940. 
    The court never below quite spelled out precisely what it was, about the Communist Party that made membership in it something that that was revolting. 
    They, in effect, dealt with some vague generalized immorality that they felt existed in the Communist Party without referring at all to any illegality. 
    Now, of course, there might have been some immorality in the Party but what they are doing essentially below, I think, is to make a political judgment in saying that this Party was bad. 
    They also failed to take into account the nature of the Party in the period during which respondent was a member of it.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="811.767" stopTime="816.695">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Could they deny admission to the bar because a man is a member of the clan?
speaker="herbert_monte_levy" startTime="816.695" stopTime="817.966">
    Mr. Herbert Monte Levy 
    Today?
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="817.966" stopTime="819.016">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Yes.
speaker="herbert_monte_levy" startTime="819.016" stopTime="847.480">
    Mr. Herbert Monte Levy 
    I would say that if a present member of the clan comes up before them today, I would say that the mere membership would not be a sufficient ground that they would have to show either that this man participate -- would have to show where the man might have to demonstrate either that there was no participation in illegal activities, or that he didn't know of them, or that he was a dupe of the clan. 
    That's a little harder to imagine than a dupe of the Communist Party. 
    But again, I think that there would be a requirement or some proof of that sort.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="847.480" stopTime="852.693">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Whether he was a dupe or not, will we reexamine that claim?

    Mr. Herbert Monte Levy 
    No, I don't think you could not. 
    I don't think you could, sir. 
    But again, here, I'm not asking that because here, the facts were uncontradicted and there was no question raised as to whether he had been into the -- been brought into the Party as a matter of idealism. 
    He testified after --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="869.080" stopTime="872.265">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Idealism doesn't mean a dupe, does it?
speaker="herbert_monte_levy" startTime="872.265" stopTime="872.340">
    Mr. Herbert Monte Levy 
    Well --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="872.340" stopTime="875.279">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Being a dupe means having idealistic motives?
speaker="herbert_monte_levy" startTime="875.279" stopTime="876.304">
    Mr. Herbert Monte Levy 
    No, being a dupe means having --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="876.304" stopTime="878.806">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    That was taking a lot of it very far, I must say.
speaker="herbert_monte_levy" startTime="878.806" stopTime="910.820">
    Mr. Herbert Monte Levy 
    No, being dupe means having idealistic motives and being persuaded to take the wrong methods of expressing those motives and those ideas here by joining the Communist Party. 
    I say he was duped into it because he thought that it was a fine thing, which of course was quite untrue as he later came to learn. 
    But his essential reason, the thing that permitted him to be duped was that he was an idealist. 
    As to again, I think it quite clear --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="910.820" stopTime="918.746">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Are they any different than your argument whether he's duped or not duped on your constitutional points?
speaker="herbert_monte_levy" startTime="918.746" stopTime="961.446">
    Mr. Herbert Monte Levy 
    I think the fact that he was duped makes the argument perhaps more a little stronger, but I think essentially, there is no difference. 
    I think even if he had joined the Party, knowing what it was, which he didn't. 
    And even if he had remained a member of it until 1940 or even 1944 knowing what it was, I still think the decision below is constitutionally incorrect, because it gave no attention to the period of time after the membership and judged entirely on the basis of the past. 
    It judged present moral characters as if it was judging past moral character, which I think again falls afoul of the rule of this Court in Cole v. Arkansas.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="961.446" stopTime="974.830">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    But if -- if you argue to find some words or some strength to the fact that he was duped, how can any committee of any court find out that a man was duped just by examining his mind out of something?
speaker="herbert_monte_levy" startTime="974.830" stopTime="976.930">
    Mr. Herbert Monte Levy 
    That's the only way they could find out, sir.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="976.930" stopTime="987.027">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    So, if this is relevant at all and we got to -- then we have to within a court or bar examiners and they open him up inquiring to what he thought, why he thought it, when thought it, is that right?
speaker="herbert_monte_levy" startTime="987.027" stopTime="989.153">
    Mr. Herbert Monte Levy 
    Yes, sir, I would say they could inquire into it. 
    And they did here below.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="989.153" stopTime="992.725">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    If that so, was legal territory because that isn't your problem.

    Mr. Herbert Monte Levy 
    That's right. 
    That's yesterday's problem. 
    [Laughs] The respondent -- well, again, here our problem isn't even a question of whether a knowing member of the Communist Party from 1934 to 1940 could be excluded from admission to the bar because there wasn't any knowledge of any evil parts of the Communist Party.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1025.398" stopTime="1046.133">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Was there any cross-examination of him or examination inquiry of him as to the bona fide, the fidelity, the complete realization that -- that he still doesn't have attachment to the things to which he was attached?
speaker="herbert_monte_levy" startTime="1046.133" stopTime="1052.025">
    Mr. Herbert Monte Levy 
    Yes, there was cross-examination on that. 
    For example, at --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1052.025" stopTime="1056.501">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    That's why it's against -- all you talk about dupe, it gets into difficulty of all sort.
speaker="herbert_monte_levy" startTime="1056.501" stopTime="1057.175">
    Mr. Herbert Monte Levy 
    Yes, it may, sir.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1057.175" stopTime="1060.260">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    They'll get you to a great difficulty before you get through with it.
speaker="herbert_monte_levy" startTime="1060.260" stopTime="1133.990">
    Mr. Herbert Monte Levy 
    It may. 
    We have at the bottom on page 46, where he was questioned. 
    “Suppose the ruler of Russia today would to be overthrown to the -- to be overthrown into the eyes of the Communist, the control of the Communist Party was restored to sincere Communist, those that believe in principles of communism, that condition existed. 
    Do you still believe in those principles to the extent that you would again join the Communist Party?” 
    Answer, “Never. 
    Never.” 
    And then, a bit below, “I am saying, judge, that for myself, I would never join the Communist Party. 
    I would never join the Communist Party.” 
    But there was a question as to when he had ceased believing in all Communist principles, which by the way was never quite clearly defined whether some of the innocent names of the Party were included in this, whether this what Schware meant, one can't quite tell from the record. 
    And he does frankly admit that his disillusionment with all the principles of communism, which I'll call principles, took a few more years to bring about, which is of course, the history of almost every person who has ever been in and left the Communist Party.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1133.990" stopTime="1144.406">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Your'e -- you're not suggesting. 
    Isn't it a part of your argument that an ex-Communist becomes the most -- becomes especially virtue of that then finds out he was wrong?
speaker="herbert_monte_levy" startTime="1144.406" stopTime="1144.659">
    Mr. Herbert Monte Levy 
    No, sir.

    Mr. Herbert Monte Levy 
    Yes. 
    I suppose if that doctrine had had sway in New Mexico, we never have been here, but I don't think that he becomes the most power of the persons. 
    I think that -- by the way, there are statistics now available, which I quote in some of the footnotes in terms of what happens to the ex-communist and actually the -- well, perhaps, some of them may be very valuable fighters against communism. 
    The ones who are in the public eye all the time because of perhaps excessive ways or all means of fighting communism are generally the -- or not generally, are actually a very small minority of the number of ex-communists. 
    We have 700,000 ex-communists about. 
    We have about 30 -- 30,000 members of the Communist Party today, which means that about 25 times as many people have been in, learned what the Party was about and left as are in the Party today.

    Supposing the Committee had articulated its grounds in this fashion, point one, we agree that past membership in a Communist Party does not foreclose this man from certification but on the basis of the record and the impression that he has made on us, etcetera.

speaker="herbert_monte_levy" startTime="1284.991" stopTime="1402.002">
    Mr. Herbert Monte Levy 
    I see. 
    Well, if they said that they were not satisfied that he had -- that he did not believe in the forcible overthrow of the Government. 
    And there was a record from which they could have made such an inference. 
    And if that were a requirement of admission to the bar, I would say that it was a perfectly reasonable requirement. 
    But again, that situation isn't present here. 
    Again, his uncontradicted testimony and the accepted testimony all throughout was that he had left the Communist Party. 
    Again, even if they had said what they did, what -- what you say they might have said, what they said here was no such thing. 
    Here, they rested entirely upon the past membership. 
    This -- this was the basis of their decision. 
    They said that very clearly, “Past membership in the Communist Party”. 
    They said nothing otherwise. 
    That I think is at page 150. 
    Petitioner is also dissatisfied because we did not rule where the former membership in the Communist Party alone establishes a lack or absence of good moral character. 
    The answer to this is that the question was not and is not now before us. 
    We stated in our opinion and we reiterate here, we believe one who was knowingly and again they have nothing in the record to support that. 
    We believe one who has knowingly given his loyalties to such a program and belief for six to seven years during a period of responsible adulthood is a person of questionable character. 
    This conduct of petitioner, together with his other former actions in the use of aliases and record of arrests, and his present attitude toward these matters and were the considerations upon which the application was denied. 
    So that the hypothetical case you mentioned, Your Honor, which is a difficult one of course, is not the one that is actually present before this Court. 
    Threads of it is present of course in the -- yesterday's case, Kingsburg case.

    And the statute of the Constitution of the States further go around and say, "No court shall review the action," whatever they call the bar examiners (Inaudible)

    Mr. Herbert Monte Levy 
    I'm not sure it would be unconstitutional on its phase, but I'm sure that in many situations it would be unconstitutional as applied.

    I'm sure that --

    Mr. Herbert Monte Levy 
    No, I think it goes one-step further because here, the questions are the standards that they used.

    Mr. Herbert Monte Levy 
    That's right. 
    Now, let's -- let's suppose we have that situation and the judge made a ruling that there is no evidence here to support the plaintiff because the plaintiff -- we find the plaintiff to be of bad moral character since he's a Jew or a Catholic, then you have this case.
speaker="harold_burton" startTime="2012.783" stopTime="2016.473">
    Justice Harold Burton 
    What -- what they're determining is whether it's moral character.
speaker="herbert_monte_levy" startTime="2016.473" stopTime="2016.864">
    Mr. Herbert Monte Levy 
    That's right.
speaker="harold_burton" startTime="2016.864" stopTime="2021.286">

speaker="herbert_monte_levy" startTime="2021.286" stopTime="2027.294">
    Mr. Herbert Monte Levy 
    It's a question of whether there's a reasonable relationship to -- of what -- of the standard that they are using to the question that they applied.
speaker="harold_burton" startTime="2027.294" stopTime="2031.751">
    Justice Harold Burton 
    But a part of evidence put in that wouldn't be evidence of negligence.

    Mr. Herbert Monte Levy 
    Yes, sir.

    Mr. Herbert Monte Levy 
    Again, in that particular case, there is no real constitutional issue that's raised. 
    Here, the whole question is the standard that is being used to determine whether this man has bad moral character. 
    These standards all trespass upon the Fourteenth Amendments -- Fourteenth Amendment, the question of due process, reasonable relationship, shocking the conscience and all of that. 
    The --
speaker="harold_burton" startTime="2064.146" stopTime="2066.319">

    Because they tell us, sir. 
    They say that in the language that I quoted from before, that this -- on page 150, "This conduct of petitioner, referring to the past membership in the Communist Party, this conduct of petitioner together with his other former actions and the use of aliases, and record of arrest, and his present attitude towards those matters, which there isn't any indication of, were the considerations upon which application was denied."

    Mr. Herbert Monte Levy 
    That's right. 
    This is purely a question of the standards that they used.

    Purely --

    Mr. Herbert Monte Levy 
    Very definitely, sir. 
    That's why in response to Mr. Justice Harlan before, I began to indicate that if the Court had attempted to avoid the constitutional question by changing the facts or making a factual determination, which was obviously completely unsupported by the record, that put in your terms, the constitutional -- what they determine would be judged by this Court on the basis of what they did or put in the way I had formulated and previously, the court below could not circumvent this Court's constitutional jurisdiction by such method.

    I suppose you would say that the standard there would be pretty clearly shown by the evidence that was introduced in the finding of the jury.

    Mr. Herbert Monte Levy 
    Yes, I think it has somewhat more than a mere something to do with it because in the Ex parte Garland case, the Court did hold. 
    This Court did hold there that the past acts of a person, even in supporting the revolution or the civil war against the North, bore no reasonable relationship to his qualification to practice law or following ministry.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="2247.707" stopTime="2254.249">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    In that case, as I recall it, the theory was not that he believed in revolution but that he engaged in it.
speaker="herbert_monte_levy" startTime="2254.249" stopTime="2268.233">
    Mr. Herbert Monte Levy 
    Yes, that's right. 
    He had actually acted and participated in it. 
    We would have the same case here if this man had been knowingly a member of the Party and had participated in its illegal activities, which he didn't even do.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="2268.233" stopTime="2269.739">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Is there any evidence that he did?
speaker="herbert_monte_levy" startTime="2269.739" stopTime="2328.709">
    Mr. Herbert Monte Levy 
    No. 
    The only evidence that there is in regard to his Communist Party activities, is what he tells us and what he tells us who -- and his word being accepted all the way through, is that he was active in the labor movement. 
    That in fact, when he organized the union he was so knowledgeable of the Communist methods that he even delivered the union that he organized right into the lap of the AF of L. 
    And his organizing of the unions was for the purpose of advancing the course of the working men. 
    So that I think it is quite clear here that this is one-step worse than the Garland case. 
    In the Garland case, it was depriving a man of a right or privilege of practicing law or following ministry because of his past acts which were concededly illegal. 
    Here, this man would be deprived of his right or privilege to practice law because of a past affiliation which was perfectly legal and without scienter.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="2328.709" stopTime="2347.246">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Would there have been any difference you suppose, the holding in the Garland case if instead of saying they were -- disbarred him because he did engaged in a rebellion. 
    They had found that because he did engage in the rebellion, that made him have a bad character, a mark bad moral character?
speaker="herbert_monte_levy" startTime="2347.246" stopTime="2348.122">
    Mr. Herbert Monte Levy 
    I'm sure that would mean no difference at all.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="2348.122" stopTime="2358.841">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Is there any indication in the opinion that the result could have been changed by putting it on the standard of good moral character, rather than the fact that he was engaged in rebellion?
speaker="herbert_monte_levy" startTime="2358.841" stopTime="2364.245">
    Mr. Herbert Monte Levy 
    Not the least indication, sir. 
    I might say, well, we're on the --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="2364.245" stopTime="2402.625">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Well, if that -- if it'd be -- if you accept the premise -- I don't know whether it should be or not, I'm not saying it should, but if the premise be accepted that a man could not be barred from the practice of law, wholly because he engaged in rebellion because that was not the rule at the time he engaged in the rebellion, do you accept that? 
    Can the effect that he did engage in a rebellion or didn't believe in a rebellion be used as a partial support for disbarring him on the ground that he had bear part to?
speaker="herbert_monte_levy" startTime="2402.625" stopTime="2426.795">
    Mr. Herbert Monte Levy 
    No, I don't think that any inference could be drawn of bad moral character or as a part of the evidence to be used against him, because again, there was nothing in what that man did to indicate bad moral character. 
    The acts that he committed were perfectly consistent with good moral character.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="2426.795" stopTime="2451.106">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Well, I suppose there are millions of people in the United States that thought that a man who engaged in rebellion, because of rebellion, some people have a mindset they could think of, if whatever it was, I suppose there were millions who did think that all the people who engaged in that were of bad moral character.
speaker="herbert_monte_levy" startTime="2451.106" stopTime="2501.280">
    Mr. Herbert Monte Levy 
    And there were millions who thought that what the people on the North did showed that they were bad moral character too. 
    I think the conclusion to be drawn from that, sir, is that the Court -- no court can make a political judgment. 
    And from a political judgment of morality, and from that draw an inference as to a person's good or bad moral character, I would not, for example, say that a person who believed in what Senator Joseph McCarthy was doing could be by virtue of that, said to be a person of bad moral character or that this was an evidence of his bad moral character for the reason that I think that no court should trespass upon the political area of thought in determining bad moral character.

    There were full pardon in those cases that really could draw out a very important fact that's set forth because it's irrelevant.

speaker="herbert_monte_levy" startTime="2629.802" stopTime="2657.891">
    Mr. Herbert Monte Levy 
    Well, even if it were irrelevant, let's assume that for the purposes of argument, I think that if you could say it was relevant, you had in effect the same situation here where there was no illegality at all in the Communist Party during this man's period of membership. 
    There was nothing, even to pardon. 
    It's an even better case. 
    And this was in the popular front period too. 
    Also, of course, this --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2657.891" stopTime="2660.558">

    Is that term of art, a popular front?

speaker="herbert_monte_levy" startTime="2687.130" stopTime="2787.188">
    Mr. Herbert Monte Levy 
    Well, I think you're quite right, sir. 
    I think also that what the court did below is to fail to take into account the change in this man and the various opinions that have been handed down by members of this Court. 
    In the Garner case, for example, the -- one of the reasons this Court upheld the oath was that it had no reason to suppose that the oath would affect adversely those persons who, during their affiliation with the prescribed organization, were innocent of its purpose as Schware, or those who severed their relations with any such organization when its character became apparent, as did Schware. 
    And again, Mr. Justice Burton in that case construed the oath differently than did the majority of the Court and voted to thrust it down. 
    He said as follows, “The oath is so framed as to operate retrospectively as a perpetual bar to those employees who held certain views at any time since the date five years preceding the effective date of the ordinance, at least no room for a change of heart.” 
    The court below do not consider the change of heart. 
    It calls for more than a profession of present loyalty or promise of future attachment, so did the court below. 
    It is not limited in retrospect to any period, measured by reasonable relation to the present did owe for the court below. 
    It took actions from 15 to 25 years before and rested entirely on that basis. 
    In time, this ordinance will amount to the requirement of an oath to be defined that has never done any of the prescribed acts. 
    And this of course is precisely what the court below really required.

    Mr. Herbert Monte Levy

    In the Garland case, you -- if I remember my dates correctly, the dates of consideration of admission to the bar were very close to the dates of the rebellion or the civil wars, that there was no period of time really for a man to prove himself.

    Mr. Herbert Monte Levy 
    I think in some, we can say that what the Court did was to rest upon this past membership in a concededly legal political party without any evidence of scienter of any evil motivations. 
    I might say just to clarify the facts that I think my opponents perhaps give themselves away, in their brief in page 28. 
    I'm talking about scienter, right at the top. 
    There can be no real doubt of the validity of a finding of scienter in this case. 
    This is not a case like Wieman v. Updegraff in which knowing and unknowing participation and proscribed affiliates of the Communist Party were like condemned. 
    There would appear to be no sensible reason why the principle of that case should be applied at all to membership in the Communist Party as distinguished from its affiliates. 
    Unwitting membership in the Communist Party seems to us, Mr. Chief Justice Stone, preposterous. 
    They cite Schneiderman where of course Chief Justice Stone did not say that but said that a man who distributed particular parts of Communist literature advocating certain things should be held for knowledge of those at the parties (Voice Overlap) --

    They claimed that there was scienter. 
    My opponents claimed it based on an examination of the petitioner at pages 45 through 49 of the record, in which they say, “Look, he knew all about the Communist Party.” 
    But of course the questioning, I won't bother reading it. 
    It's too lengthy. 
    But the questioning deals solely with questions like if you are a true Communist -- if you are a true Communist, then certain things follow, what is contrary to the principles of Communism and so on. 
    In other words, they talk all about -- they are asking Schware, what does he think of the Communist Party today. 
    And he tells them, he's obviously knowledgeable, he tells us he reads both Communist literature and the material of the House Committee, an Un-American Activities, and he sets forth his knowledge of what the Communist Party is, all in the present tense. 
    This, my opponents contend in the brief indicates that in 1932 to 1940 he knew what the Communist Party was about.

    Mr. William A. Sloan 
    May it please the Court. 
    This is a review of a finding of fact made by a State Supreme Court. 
    The manner, in which the procedure in which the finding of fact was made, was not a typical lawsuit. 
    It was not an adversary proceeding and issues weren't framed, and the decision was not very much like that in an ordinary common law action. 
    The procedure is that the -- that a -- an applicant applies for admission to the bar. 
    There is a -- no contrary pleading, no issue made up and the applicant comes to the Committee for the purpose of satisfying the Committee, that -- that he has the requisite, moral character. 
    The Committee makes a determination on that in the absence of anything in the nature of issues. 
    After the determination was made in this particular case, the Committee decided adversely to the petitioner and advised him of it. 
    Subsequently, he asked for a hearing and again, a hearing was held without any further documentary alignment of the issues and the determination was reaffirmed. 
    Then, he petitioned for review to the Supreme Court of New Mexico. 
    Now, the Supreme Court of New Mexico in this case has decided what the procedure in the case should be. 
    There was no rule or statute that established the procedure and the procedure appears to be a petition for review. 
    To that petition, the bar examiners filed a response. 
    And in that response, there were admissions made concerning the truth of the matters that were testified to and the matters that were stated in the application. 
    Now, it is a fact that those are in the record. 
    Actually, those admissions were disregarded in the subsequent hearing before the Court and they did not fulfill the function of pleadings in a normal case. 
    Ordinary pleadings fix the issues in advance of a hearing and as a consequence of that notice is given to the litigant that there -- as to the issue as to which he will present evidence. 
    The response that was filed in this case was not a notice in advance of hearing. 
    It was a notice after all the evidence had been received, and the admission in those circumstances was not considered by the Supreme Court in the manner that counsel has tried to use it in his argument here as in effect changing the rule of law, that the burden of proof is on a petitioner to establish his moral character. 
    Now, this is a matter. 
    I submit that it's a matter of a law of New Mexico and the manner in which the State of New Mexico Supreme Court addressed itself to this problem. 
    I submit it's the procedural framework on which this Court should also decide it. 
    And our Supreme Court held and its holding is not at all unusual or different from that in other jurisdictions, that the -- that by applying for membership in the bar, an applicant thereby places his moral character in issue. 
    And thereby, submits himself to a burden of persuasion, not a burden of going forward but the burden of persuasion in a broad sense of satisfying the bar examiners that he has a good moral character. 
    Now, that particular issue has been decided adversely.

    Mr. William A. Sloan 
    Yes. 
    I understand that. 
    The determination of the Supreme Court of New Mexico is best stated in the last page of the original opinion. 
    It says that it had for determination before it the question of whether the Court had a conviction that the plaintiff or the petitioner was of good moral character, and they found that they did not hold that conviction. 
    So, the -- the determination of the Supreme Court boldly stated is that they did not consider that the petitioner had satisfied the burden of persuading them of good moral character. 
    Now, the question I submit before this Court is, was that determination by the Supreme Court of New Mexico wrong as a matter of law? 
    That is an answer to your question, Your Honor.

    Now, in the light of that fact, could you particularize or subdivide your general statement which I had set. 
    Our question is whether that decision with this petitioner who offered himself to admission did not have the requisite of moral character. 
    In as much that there is no record to supposedly sustain that, what issue does the record present in order to -- not merely to shock him but to define the issue that are embraced in that general conclusion?

    Mr. William A. Sloan 
    Well, I think that the bases of the Court's decision are clear from the opinion of the Court. 
    And I think those bases in all fairness include four particular things. 
    The Court considered that being a member of the Communist Party in the circumstances of this particular case and evidence was something from which an adverse interest -- inference touching moral character could be drawn. 
    Secondly, that the history of the use of aliases by this particular petitioner was something from which adverse inferences could be drawn. 
    Thirdly, that the record of arrests without prosecution or conviction in these circumstances of this particular case was something from which an adverse inference could be drawn. 
    And finally, that portions of the petitioner's account of himself as expressed in the application and in the -- in the evidence he gave before the bar examiners also, and taking all of those things together and not relying on one or the other. 
    And I might say not trying to ensure that only orthodox people become members of the bar. 
    The Supreme Court of New Mexico found that it was not satisfied of the moral character of the applicant and determined that he -- the action of the bar examiners in not permitting him to take the bar was warranted by our law.

    All right.
speaker="william_a_sloan" startTime="3749.568" stopTime="3926.473">
    Mr. William A. Sloan 
    Now, I have begun in my argument on making the point that the posture of the pleadings as relied upon by counsel for the petitioner really was not as strong or didn't -- didn't warrant his claim. 
    Under the law of New Mexico as determined by the New Mexico Supreme Court, those admissions in our response to the -- to the petition for review filed in the Court did not limit the issues and changed the burden of proof. 
    And I think that by answering Mr. Justice Frankfurter's questions, I have covered the next matter that I intended to cover, to wit the nature of the controversy that is before this Court for determination. 
    Now, I might say in passing just to point out the fact that the pleadings as relied on by counsel are not so important, is that the original pleading which is filed by the petitioner in this case, the -- the petition for review contained many matters which are not now in consideration, including a claim that the standard of good moral character which is applied in New Mexico is unconstitutionally vague and void for that reason. 
    That has been abandoned. 
    A number of things have happened, in other words, since the pleadings were filed which do pinpoint the issue in the manner of which I have told the Court in response to Judge Frankfurter's questions. 
    Now, it is important that the burden of proof is on the petitioner at all times and that it is the burden of persuading the fact finder of the truth of his position. 
    That particular burden results in -- in part from the circumstances of the case. 
    There was no evidence introduced against the petitioner in this case.Counsel has mentioned that several times. 
    From the nature of the inquiry, there ordinarily is not an inference from that circumstance. 
    It's not permissible that there was something else behind the door or under the table that they looked at. 
    The -- the burden, having placed the -- his character in issue in the manner stated by the Court, having applied for admission to the bar, he assumes the burden of demonstrating his good moral character. 
    And adverse proof is not necessary and under the law of New Mexico, and I think under general law, a party having the burden of proof is ordinarily not entitled to insist on the belief of his testimony if there is any rational basis for questioning it. 
    Now, the effect of --
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="3926.473" stopTime="3937.738">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Was there anything said by your court that indicated that they ruled against him on the question of his credibility? 
    I didn't see anything of that kind.
speaker="william_a_sloan" startTime="3937.738" stopTime="3940.991">
    Mr. William A. Sloan 
    In the opinion itself, Your Honor, there is not a statement to that effect.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="3940.991" stopTime="3941.802">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Nothing at all?
speaker="william_a_sloan" startTime="3941.802" stopTime="4083.537">
    Mr. William A. Sloan 
    How -- well, there are things that reflect upon the credibility of the witness, which the Court mentioned. 
    The Court did mention the fact that he had given inconsistent accounts of the reason why he first adopted an alias. 
    The Court mentioned that in the opinion and I take it that that was some reflection on his credibility. 
    I think also that the Court was referring to that in a statement that the Court made to the effect that it -- that his general attitude towards these several matters, which were under -- under discussion, reflected an improper present attitude as distinguished from improper past conduct. 
    I think that while it isn't spelled out like findings and rulings, it is an opinion of the Court and perhaps is cryptical.I do think that the Court did have reference to that, yes, sir. 
    Now, the -- it is the position of the respondent in this case that the fact finder, the -- the bar examiners first as the recommender to the Court and the state -- and the State Supreme Court of New Mexico was not bound to accept his testimony. 
    Particularly, he was not bound to believe all the exculpatory things and all the inferences from exculpatory things that he said. 
    If that is not appreciated and if the approach is not of that kind, is not kept in mind, the effect of it is to -- the effect of that procedure, which is what the petitioner in this case suggest to this Court, would be substantially to reverse the true rule of law and to place the burden of proof on the bar examiners and on the state authorities to demonstrate lack of moral character.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="4083.537" stopTime="4101.163">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Well, isn't it -- wouldn't be unallowable for us to say? 
    For all we know, the bar examiners, the State Supreme Court, his belief is severed from the Communist Party and infer -- they infer that he's a Communist to this day, would that be allowable or not, in this record?
speaker="william_a_sloan" startTime="4101.163" stopTime="4141.225">
    Mr. William A. Sloan 
    I would think that that would not be allowable because I think that that -- that there ought to be something in the record. 
    Now, I am -- I believe that it isn't necessary to do that in this case. 
    You have the burden of proof and he has to satisfy the Court of his good moral character. 
    And I believe that in entertaining the dubiety that they had concerning his character, that something of that kind may have entered into their thinking. 
    They don't -- do not spell it out in the opinion, but it was one of the things. 
    The -- the end conclusion of the Court was that they were not satisfied of his good moral character.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="4141.225" stopTime="4156.798">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    I understand that you state quite candidly that in order to find out whether the end conclusion had any basis, we have to take each -- each ground for the end of conclusion.

    Well, on the first one, you would say there's nothing, that we would not be one of us to say that for all we know the State Supreme Court, this belief is -- his involvement in the association, and therefore --

    -- they would assume that he was a Communist at the time that this came up, which was then raised of the fact that the bases were rejected, but I understood to say that we could not make such a gross opinion --

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    And suppose -- suppose it should be thought that the Court or the State was without authority to keep a man out of the bar or to put him out of the bar because he hadn't belong to the Communist Party back in the time when it was legal. 
    What in your judgment would that dispose of the case?
speaker="william_a_sloan" startTime="4221.128" stopTime="4258.750">
    Mr. William A. Sloan 
    If that were the ruling of this Court, it is clear that our Supreme Court gave evidentiary and legal weigh to that circumstance in evaluating the man's moral character. 
    And if you cannot make an inference from Communist Party membership to moral dubiety, I do think that -- that that would require a reversal and remand of the case for further consideration. 
    The Court unquestionably did consider that matter and it is my position that that inference is permissible and that an inference of that kind does not at all violate --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="4258.750" stopTime="4285.625">

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    I mean that -- let me put it to be more accurate. 
    I infer from that of Mr. Justice Black that it's sufficient to undermine the legal validity of the -- of the decision because it did enter into them. 
    Is that right?
speaker="william_a_sloan" startTime="4322.407" stopTime="4455.441">
    Mr. William A. Sloan 
    Yes, sir. 
    I think that is correct. 
    Now, it is -- as I have already stated to the Court, the Court did give value, evidentiary value to the matter of Communist Party membership and we believe that considering the nature of the Communist Party, the nature of the congressional findings on the Communist Party, the nature of the decisions of this Court relating to the Communist Party, that adverse moral inferences can be drawn from membership in the Communist Party, particularly on the two grounds of truthfulness and loyalty, those two particular grounds. 
    I submit to the Court that those are matters that are relevant to the office of an attorney. 
    I think that a State which protects itself from disloyal or untruthful attorneys, and makes loyalty and truthfulness a measure of the power of -- a measure of admissibility is doing nothing forbidden by the Due Process Clause. 
    Now, there are -- there had been some comparisons made here between this, and Ex parte Garland, and Missouri versus Cummings. 
    I do not think that those cases present the same kind of moral issue that the present case presents. 
    I think that in Ex parte Cummings and in -- in Missouri versus Cummings and Ex parte Garland, essentially, the offense which was proscribed and for which the test oath was adopted was adherence to the southern cause. 
    The form of words here in question, good moral character was not even used in that case.

    Mr. William A. Sloan 
    Well, if they had and the only proof of good moral character was adherence to the southern cause, then I would say that the use of its -- of the term, good moral character would not have made -- made constitutional what otherwise would have been unconstitutional. 
    In other words, that adherence to the southern cause could not be a basis of an inference of immorality. 
    And I want to make that quite clear, I regard this as a different type of case. 
    In -- in respect to the difference between adherence to the southern side in the civil war and adherence to modern communism, I think they're utterly different. 
    And I think that adherence to communism presents moral issues as distinguished from political allegiances. 
    I think they are quite different, and for that reason, I see no particular trouble for the respondent in this case from Ex parte Garland and In re Cummings.

    Cummings.

    Mr. William A. Sloan 
    Yes, sir, that is true. 
    But in the discussion of those two cases, there has been a general tendency to treat them as though they arose under the Fourteenth Amendment. 
    They -- they actually were decided before the Fourteenth Amendment and they are used more or less as a guide to what is due process of law in subsequent decisions. 
    It is a fact though that Cummings versus Missouri largely related to the ex post facto prohibition in the Constitution and Garland related to the bill of attainder prohibition in the Constitution.

    During the life of Mr. Schware and for a long time, it has been the requirement for admission to the bar in New Mexico and 47 other states that a person have a good moral character. 
    Now, the fact that you could not impose a punishment or that the Communist Party is or has been lawful in New Mexico and there have been actually candidates who filed and ran in elections in -- in New Mexico during the period that Mr. Schware was a Communist although he was not in New Mexico at that time. 
    That fact does not, to my pegging, remove the possibility of relevant inferences as to moral character, truly moral character, not political character, not religious or economic character but strictly moral character. 
    I think that that coupled with the other evidence in this case and not as a matter of adopting of a rule, of general or special application that permits inferences to be drawn.

    Well, I suppose 13 states ought to determine to their legislatures and their Supreme Courts that the NAACP was disloyal, that it wanted to subvert the states, the 13 states and that was to declare the truth. 
    And that the lawyer should go before state -- applicants should go --

    I would say that the inquiry in the case of the lawyer is as to whether he has good moral character, not the quality particularly of the NAACP and that an inference from mere NAACP membership to lack of moral character or doubt of moral character, which is more correctly the question here would be improper. 
    In the fact that 13 states did so --

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Well, suppose the legislature declared they did found it and the Court declared that they did found it that it's also was engaged in a conspiracy.

    Mr. William A. Sloan 
    Well, if the NAACP were of a different nature and it was so found by Court to be then I understand it to be, then I would say that you could make the inference. 
    As soon as it becomes conspiratorial enough, dishonest enough and disloyal enough then maybe you can, at that point, draw an adverse interest -- inference. 
    It's hard for me to consider the NAACP as a sinister organization as I do regard the Communist Party as a sinister organization. 
    With respect to the --

    Of course not. 
    And Your Honor, I should like to point out that I am not arguing that we must decide this case in the way that we have because Congress has done so. 
    And because Congress has made these findings concerning the nature of the Communist Party of this Court and its judges have made these findings, the adverse is true. 
    I am saying that if this Court can make the inference from communism to the kind of a conduct that has been recited in the Douds case and in the Dennis case and so on. 
    And if Congress can make findings that comprise pages of the statutes to the effect that the Communist Party is a conspiracy of disloyalty and dishonesty, then I believe that the bar examiners of New Mexico and the Supreme Court of New Mexico can make a light inference.

    I -- I think something of that kind may have been in their minds, Your Honor, but I still believe that our bar examiners and our Court actually registered judicially in their minds that they were not satisfied with the man's good moral character. 
    And our rule has provided for years that when they are not satisfied of good moral character, they will not permit the individual to take the exam. 
    Now, the other matters that the Court relied upon in the course of its decision and I should make the point that the function of the bar examiners as such is recommendatory only. 
    They neither admit to the bar nor do they refuse to admit to the bar in a final sense and I might add that they do not disbar lawyers in New Mexico. 
    All of those functions are reserved to the Supreme Court of New Mexico. 
    The -- the other matters that were discussed by the Court are the use of aliases, the -- and the record of arrests, and certain discrepancies and omissions. 
    Now, these matters are covered in our brief and we believe that they are material.We think that anybody who was admitting any person to an employment or a position would take into consideration and would give evidentiary weight to such conduct as that admitted by the petitioner here.

    Mr. William A. Sloan 
    That was -- that was the conduct which was claimed to comprise a violation. 
    There is a discussion in the -- in the opinions as to whether or not it is in fact a violation, which I think is rather beside the point. 
    I don't, I don't think it is too material whether it was a violation or not. 
    The -- the Court -- the Court did consider those arrests and the conduct that led up to the arrest as something from which an inference of adverse to the petitioner could be drawn. 
    Now, in that connection, I want to point out two things. 
    First of all, he said that he didn't know that he was violating the law whether he was or not, he did say that. 
    In addition to that, he also said that his work in -- in recruiting for the Abraham Lincoln Brigade was conducted by the -- on behalf of the Communist Party and that his actions relating to these arrests were the result of activity on behalf of the Communist Party. 
    Now, I think that all of those things are relevant in determining the nature of his Communist Party membership and whether or not he had the scienter which counsel told this Court there was no evidence of. 
    And they are further relevant to whether or not he was telling the truth at the time he appeared before the bar examiners. 
    The bar examiners are reasonably sophisticated. 
    I am sure that they have some misgivings as to whether a person, enlisting or recruiting for the Abraham Lincoln Brigade on behalf of the Communist Party knew what the law of the United States touching recruiting laws. 
    I'm sure that the bar examiners regarded that as a circumstance which they could evaluate in reaching their general notion that they were dubious of his moral character.

    Mr. William A. Sloan 
    Well, I think that the arrest for stolen car on his version of it and we have no other facts that it was taken, the arrest relating for stolen car was just a completely innocent occurrence. 
    Now, I think that while a person could quite properly have sympathies with the loyalist side in Spain, I may say that I have, rather ardent ones myself, I think that is different from recruiting -- recruiting soldiers for -- as a part of -- for the Abraham Lincoln Brigade as a part of your Communist activity. 
    I don't think --

    The only thing that we know about his arrest in connection with an indictment for violation of the Neutrality Act was that he was doing that work he says himself as part of his Communist Party activity and was governed by their instructions. 
    That's all we know about it. 
    He did not offer any explanation as to what particular conduct he had done. 
    It can only be gained here and there through the record. 
    He did not say what he had done and I do not think that in those circumstances, the inferences that can be drawn are entirely exculpatory. 
    I think that you can, considering the fact that the burden was on him to come forward and explain these things in an exculpatory manner.

    Mr. William A. Sloan 
    As I read the statute, now, there seems to be some nice legal points on that which I have never really spelled out. 
    But I believe that his statement as to what he did amounted to an admission that he had violated the law of the United States. 
    And again, the Court did not say, the Supreme Court of New Mexico did not say that by reason of that, he was excluded from the bar. 
    They took it into consideration along with other things and concluded that they had doubts about his moral character, partly as a consequence of that. 
    And I believe that taking into consideration, an arrest or a number of arrests in the manner the Court did is something that people do everyday and I believe it is within the realm of permissible state action to do so. 
    His explanation of his arrest in California, which were a factor in his case which were -- was decided upon by the Court, amounted to dismissing the California statute against an offense called criminal syndicalism as though it just wasn't fair. 
    It amount to saying that it was perfectly all right to get arrested in California if it was in connection with a Waterfront strike and arrested on a number of occasions and on ascertained number of occasions. 
    And it also amounted to saying that this was true even though the conduct leading up to the arrests had been conduct directed by and in aid of the Communist Party.

    Mr. Fred M. Standley 
    I'm a member of the Utah Bar and it's three there but the investigation goes on. 
    I have one last thing to say, this Court has in the questions, indicated in insistence on equating the good moral character qualification to violations of law and I don't think that's necessarily true. 
    For instance, if a man was arrested for rape, I'd say, and marries the girl, he can't be prosecuted. 
    Yes, but the case has to be no-crossed. 
    But that still indicates something or would indicate something as to his moral character. 
    The same way with adultery, we -- New Mexico has no statute on adultery. 
    There are great many people who thinks -- think that an adulterer is a man of bad moral character. 
    I -- I don't think that there is necessarily a connection between the conviction, so far as moral character is concerned. 
    I realized that on impeachment and criminal cases and so forth, that's required. 
    But I don't think that it necessarily follows that you have to be convicted of a crime to have bad moral character. 
   
   
   
   Rebuttal of Herbert Monte Levy
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="6754.556" stopTime="6762.110">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Levy, you may. 
    You have a minute or two. 
    You might finish now and you won't have to come back this afternoon.
speaker="herbert_monte_levy" startTime="6762.110" stopTime="6802.835">
    Mr. Herbert Monte Levy 
    Thank you, Your Honor. 
    I'll be very brief. 
    I -- I have to be. 
    First, to clarify the answers to -- the answers to some of Your Honor's questions about what was in this confidential report. 
    On page 11 of the record, you find one of the Board members saying, “I don't think our action was motivated in any way by any accusations or anything was made against him or were disclosed in some way by a report.” 
    Mr. Dunlevy, Schware's attorney, “Can I assume then that there is nothing adverse in that report?” 
    Board member, “No.” 
    Another board member, “Nothing more adverse than what he,” meaning Schware, “said.” 
    So they have read this.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="6802.835" stopTime="6813.150">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Well, it couldn't have been very serious because the only -- this member of the Court who had read it is Judge Kiker, and Judge Kiker was the only dissenting member of the Court, so it couldn't have been very damaging.
speaker="herbert_monte_levy" startTime="6813.150" stopTime="6897.385">
    Mr. Herbert Monte Levy 
    Well, I don't know, but I do know that they checked into the arrest and that it was just sent here by the Attorney General and that they found nothing -- and in here, it is said that there was nothing more adverse in that report in what was set forth in the record here. 
    And this is one of the basis upon which they decided. 
    There may of course also have been a lot in that confidential report which was favorable to Schware. 
    And in terms of burden of proof, I noticed that what the Attorney General stated was that you need one letter of recommendation, apparently, as long as there isn't anything black against the man in order to get admitted. 
    Now, here, what you have is endorsements by virtually everybody and the man is not admitted based purely upon what are really political judgments. 
    Now, I think the Chief Justice inquired whether the arrest in Texas for the stolen car, which was conceitedly completely innocent, whether that arrest had been considered. 
    My only answer to that would be that the Court distinctly says that they rely upon the record of arrest, which includes that particular innocent arrest. 
    They apparently rely upon the mere fact of arrest without any question even of the circumstances or actually of the innocence of the man.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="6897.385" stopTime="6902.981">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    The making of arrest wouldn't give you the circumstances, so they told you what they relied on.
speaker="herbert_monte_levy" startTime="6902.981" stopTime="6907.191">
    Mr. Herbert Monte Levy 
    Well, there were some circumstances in the record of the case, Your Honor.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="6907.191" stopTime="6913.374">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Well, then, it wasn't confidential.
