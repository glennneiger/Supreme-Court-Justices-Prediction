    May it please the Court. 
    I'll try to answer Mr. Justice Frankfurter's question first. 
    I think there's no problem at all about the question that you asked. 
    Section 503 of the 1940 Act which would be controlling under all of these cases, in 54 statutes at large at page 1171, provides for an independent trial de novo on the question of nationality

    Mr. J. Lee Rankin 
    -- and it's been uniformly so construed. 
    So that -- and in Nishikawa case in the transcript shows that that's the Section under which the action is brought in specific terms and the rest of them were brought under that provision of the statute so that this Section gives them a trial de novo in accordance with the requirements of due process.

    What is the line between those, as I recall it, there was once the District of Columbia that (inaudible) has been indicated. 
    It was said the trial that many people might think we're petty but entitle them to use them in fact. 
    I forgot the name it was written by as far as I recall it was Mr. Justice Harlan and many years ago.

    Mr. J. Lee Rankin 
    No, I think Congress dealt with it as providing in a declaratory judgment that would give him the complete review on the facts. 
    Of course, in this particular case, in the Perez case, there is no issue about the facts. 
    They're all admitted. 
    There isn't any on what the particular act was performed. 
    They admitted it.

    That is --

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    If -- if your adversary's position is correct that the law -- the Constitution forbids (Inaudible) or it does not permit the Constitution to take away citizenship which the man has not voluntarily abandoned, assuming at the Perez, would you say that -- then Congress could classify along with those who do not voluntarily (Inaudible) those who do by defining as a ground to forfeit citizenship, voting in a foreign country.
speaker="j_lee_rankin" startTime="370.673" stopTime="392.550">
    Mr. J. Lee Rankin 
    Well, I would say no if you say that you have to find subjective intent. 
    But if you have to find merely that he did evade the draft for this or went to a foreign country and stayed there for the purpose of evading the draft and he admits that fact as he does here then I don't think there's any issue of that. 
    You see, he --

    What I --

speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="399.583" stopTime="405.700">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    The question I was asking you was following up Mr. Justice Frankfurter's question (Inaudible)

    Mr. J. Lee Rankin 
    Yes, sir.

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    -- is the question I'm asking that is there not also an additional power or how do the reference to this legislative power in this respect that if they are right, your adversaries are right, saying there must be a voluntary or using the word to be deliberate, intentional, real honest to goodness abandonment by the person, before Congress can take away citizenship except maybe for a crime. 
    If that be the case, would you still say that Congress could classify the innocent and the guilty in that line or if you want to call it that are the knowing and the unknowing, of course, they lumped and only in one group and say the conduct which might be either could be used to forfeit citizenship, would you say that?
speaker="j_lee_rankin" startTime="463.544" stopTime="469.427">
    Mr. J. Lee Rankin 
    No. 
    I -- I don't think they could be lumped together if you say that there has to be subjective intent.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    General, at the outset of your -- of your argument, you impressed on us that we ought to view this case in the light of the facts, namely, that this man was down there in Mexico from the time he was nine or ten years old, that he -- he married a woman, had seven children and -- and a lot of other things happened down in -- in Mexico and you told us that we should take those things into consideration. 
    Now, how can you say then that there wasn't a factual situation for the Court to take into consideration and then -- and that all they had to do was just -- just to determine whether he actually voted down there and whether he actually stayed away.

    Mr. J. Lee Rankin 
    Well, what I meant was that there was no issue between us that the facts were any different.

    Mr. Charles A. Horsky 
    Just a -- pure words, Your Honor. 
    First, let me speak to this question that you were just discussing as to the facts. 
    I think the court below operated on the assumption which I am sure is the correct assumption under the statute that it's only -- the only findings it had to make were the findings, did this man vote in a political election, did he stay out of the country to avoid the draft? 
    There is nothing in the record and there is nothing that you could find out from even the hearings before the Immigration and Naturalization service into which I looked which would tell you why he did these things. 
    The Solicitor General would have you approach this case as if these two Sections were to be treated as evidentiary in terms of his intention that you take these into account in determining whether this man ought to be held to have abandoned his citizenship. 
    They do not operate in that fashion. 
    They operate automatically. 
    The vote is the fact and that's the end of it. 
    I don't know why he voted in the election. 
    I could think of a lot of reasons why he might have voted, which would have nothing to do with dividing his allegiance or showing any lack of allegiance for United States.

    Well, I perhaps didn't distinguish between opinions of the Attorney General and --

    Well, I -- I (Voice Overlap) -- with you.

    -- the ruling of the Attorney General.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    But he did say this is a way of getting a ruling from the Court.

    Mr. Charles A. Horsky 
    He said, if she wants to go to court, she can.

    Well, he said it's undecided and I don't know. 
    It's not --

    Mr. Charles A. Horsky

    Mr. Charles A. Horsky 
    But she's out --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="914.823" stopTime="921.340">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    -- it's illustration of the excessive burdens on an Attorney General attack on a case like this.
speaker="charles_a_horsky" startTime="921.340" stopTime="1052.946">
    Mr. Charles A. Horsky 
    I should think he should not be allowed to, either. 
    I've heard the Court of that. 
    One other item which is related to the matter which we were discussing as to this man's dual citizenship, there is no finding by the Court that he was a dual national, either by the Court or by the bureau -- or by Immigration and Naturalization Service. 
    One could construct a theory upon which he would be, I concede that. 
    I could construct the theory upon which he would not. 
    It, however, it seems to me that it must be irrelevant as Your Honor pointed out in the questions. 
    Whether a man's parents were American-born or foreign-born as to what his rights are under the Constitution, I think that issue must be an irrelevant issue. 
    I would concede that the proposition which I state in terms of what a man may do or may not do in order to abandon citizenship might have to be phrased somewhat differently in the case of a man who involuntarily was a dual national, who, because of the nature of his parents' birth was claimed by Italy or France or Japan or what have you, it might make a difference. 
    But it would only be a matter of phraseology. 
    His substantive rights under the Constitution must be the same. 
    Now, one more word and I'll be done. 
    The Solicitor General has referred to the necessity for the United States to have the attributes of sovereignty. 
    Of course, it must have the attributes of sovereignty and it does. 
    But certainly, it is not and has never been the law that in exercising those attributes of sovereignty, the United States may act in derogation of constitutional rights. 
    I suppose it is true almost everywhere in the world that a nation can legislate about church matters. 
    Most nations do not separate church and state. 
    That that certainly does not mean that in the United States, because you can point to all the other places where the Congress or the Legislature or the Executive can deal with the church, that Congress here can avoid the First Amendment. 
    We have here --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1052.946" stopTime="1055.911">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    But we have controversies as to when it does and when it doesn't.
speaker="charles_a_horsky" startTime="1055.911" stopTime="1099.675">
    Mr. Charles A. Horsky 
    Well, we do. 
    But we certainly admit that it is still effective, notwithstanding, the nature of sovereignty and the existence of the similar power in other countries. 
    What we have here but I cannot say it too much and too sincerely, is a constitutionally protected right. 
    A very important constitutionally protected right, native-born citizenship. 
    It seems to me impossible to believe that that right can be at the discretion of Congress to take away for as light or as grave a reason as it sees fit. 
    I submit that the decision below should be reversed.
