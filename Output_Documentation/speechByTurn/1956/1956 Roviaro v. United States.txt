    Mr. Maurice J. Walsh 
    If the Court please -- no rebuttal my time is short. 
    There's one other point that I would like to discuss orally and that is the refusal to permit the examination by the defendant or to submit to the -- the defendant on the trial certain additional reports by the witness Durham, Agent Durham. 
    And that arose in this fashion, Durham testified as you will recall that he had recovered this package which turned out to be narcotics from the seat of the informer's automobile or from the floor of the informer's automobile. 
    When the physical evidence was introduced, it was enclosed in an envelope which became Exhibit 6 and appears at an inscription which appeared on that, appears in the record at page 131. 
    That document contradicts Mr. Durham's testimony and says that the matter when it comes to the words, were obtained -- how obtained, found by Officer James L.Bryson, that's the name of man who was in the trunk of the automobile. 
    Where obtained, 74th and St.Lawrence Avenue, Chicago, Illinois and that refers to the material. 
    Now, this was called to Durham's attention and he was asked if that was not inconsistent with his testimony. 
    He admitted it was and said that it must be a mistake by Agent Fields who filled out the envelope. 
    Agent Fields on cross-examination when interrogated about this matter said that he had been given that information, the question was, “Who told you that this material enclosed in this envelope was found by Officer James Bryson at 74th and St.Lawrence?” 
    “I think agent Durham gave me the information at that time, later the same day on August 13th.” 
    And then he said that there was other information reported to him that he put on it. 
    Now, the exhibit also bears, according to the testimony of both after it was filled up, the initials of Durham and that was after these inscriptions as to how it was recovered were on the envelope. 
    The prosecutor then asked Fields in redirect whether this was the official report. 
    The agent said no, it was a -- it was an evidence cover. 
    I then asked if there were additional reports, written reports, by Mr. Durham concerning this transaction. 
    And Fields said yes. 
    I asked him if they were consistent with his testimony, he said he did not know. 
    I asked the Government for production. 
    The -- and asked the Court to compel it, the Court -- well, the prosecutor claimed no privilege for this -- for this report, for these additional reports covering this transaction but said that he didn't have them in court, he couldn't provide them until the next day at first. 
    The Court said this trial will end tonight, we'll finish it today. 
    The -- we then had some discussion of it, I urged the Gordon, the decision of this Court in the Gordon case where, what I conceive to be, a very similar situation arose and the Court thereupon denied production or inspection of the -- the additional reports of Mr. Durham covering this transaction. 
    My thought was in -- in seeking those was to find out whether his additional written matters, whether the other extra-judicial written statements by him were consistent with his testimony.

    The -- I don't know that the Government -- that the judge stated his ground but he -- he sustained the Government's objections and we -- I -- I would assume that that was the situation. 
    I -- I would like to -- to say this much to the Court that this charge of traffic in narcotics, traffic of course is deplorable but the very charge has reached the point now where it tends to import verity and therefore it is an exceedingly dangerous one. 
    The presumptions, Justice McReynolds -- Mr. Justice McReynolds in a dissent said in the -- in the Casey case that formerly the torture and they're acquiesced, and it's to secure a conviction. 
    Now, the presumption has been brought to the aid of the prosecutor.

    Mr. Maurice J. Walsh 
    Well, Your Honor, we don't know. 
    We thought so, but the Government -- when the Government wouldn't admit who he was, even when we asked if he was the informer then we -- we felt that we were powerless to go forward because the Government's four witnesses or additional witnesses might come in and say that it was an entirely different person. 
    The Government indicates that this denial by the man who was brought face to face with -- with the defendant, and I say this in response to your question, was -- that this denial was for the -- for the purpose of hoodwinking the defendant into thinking that this person was involved in the offense and was a fellow prisoner. 
    That's -- that's the argument that was replied by their brief on that question.

    Mr. James W. Knapp 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    I think that first we should understand what the Court of Appeals has said with respect to Count 1 -- Count 2. 
    They held that as to count 2, the possession count, there was no error because John Doe had nothing to do with petitioner's illegal possession of heroin and was not a participant in any sense of the word in the petitioner's procurement and transportation of the package. 
    Proof of his identity would not have shed any light at all on the -- on the undisputed illegal act of the petitioner. 
    It found that there were facts proved showing petitioner's possession of heroin which furnished prima facie evidence of guilt under Count 2 and left him with the burden to prove he possessed the narcotics legally. 
    They held that in as much as the sentence imposed was a general sentence and since guilt under Count 2 would support the sentence, it was immaterial whether error intervened as to Count 1.

    I think that is a far different crime because at that point, there would be an issue of fact to be determined by the Court and Doe would then of course be important to resolve that issue of fact.

    Mr. James W. Knapp 
    That is true and -- and I'd like to direct Your Honor's attention to the record there. 
    Thereafter, the Government on redirect examination inquired of the witness and this is at the record on page 53. 
    Question “On June 22, 1954, you said you saw Albert Roviaro for the first time is that right, sir?” 
    Answer “Yes, that is right.” 
    Question “Who did you see him in the company of, Roviaro?” 
    Answer “Yes, in the company of the John Doe.” 
    Question “The John Doe you have been referring to since you took the stand this morning?” 
    Answer “That is right.” 
    Question “Is that correct?” 
    Answer “That's right.” 
    Question “In the second time you saw Albert Roviaro, who was he in the company of?” 
    Answer “He was in the company of John Doe. 
    He went into the residence that day.” 
    Now --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="940.011" stopTime="947.823">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    That's the man -- that's the man who was present there when -- when John Doe said that he --

    Yes, sir, that is to redirect examination of Agent Durham so that --

speaker="james_w_knapp" startTime="958.390" stopTime="1003.051">
    Mr. James W. Knapp 
    Well, it went to the point of explaining the -- the testimony or the statement of Doe in Roviaro's presence that he did not know him. 
    And incidentally, the -- the answer to that question, question “Didn't Doe say he didn't even know him?” 
    Answer “Yes -- yes, sir, at first he did”, which implies that later on or at some other point he didn't stick to that story. 
    So, I think it is a fair inference that -- that Doe was seeking to cover up from Roviaro the fact he -- that he had been the informant in the case and -- and the -- and was seeking to -- to maintain his position as an informant because he --

    Mr. James W. Knapp 
    Well, I would think here that -- had the Government proceeded, they might have elicited that information from the agents themselves, but they did not go any further, Your Honor. 
    Now, the -- the Government's position is simply this, that this rule is the rule of long standing that the courts will not compel or allow the discovery of the names of informants or the channels of -- of communication of information flowing to the Government, either by the officer to whom it is given or the informant himself or by any other person without the Government's consent.

    Of the Liquor Taxing Act, by possessing and transporting distilled spirits in containers wanting the required revenue stamps. 
    The officers acting upon information received from an informant observed the actions of the petitioner and arrested him and found non-tax paid liquor in his car. 
    The petitioner's counsel moved to suppress the evidence. 
    And it's held that in these circumstances the source of information which caused him to be observed was unimportant to the petitioner's defense, the legality of the officer's action does not depend upon the credibility of something told but upon what they saw and heard, what took place in their presence. 
    Justification was not sought because of honest belief based upon credible information but they pointed out moreover as often pointed out public policy forbids disclosure of an informant's identity unless essential to -- to the defense as for example where this turns upon an officer's good faith.

    Well, as I say, Your Honor, those cases are the closest cases that we can get factually to them and they are cases arising -- and there are others which arise from search and seizure, and the search is based upon information received from an informant. 
    Now, obviously, the informant's identity is not disclosed.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Mr. Knapp, I'm much interested in the problem raised by -- I'm much interested, the problem raised by this case in your reference to the old Hardy case on a regular opinion, 109 Massachusetts. 
    Now, this rule -- this rule about informants, that isn't -- is that -- I know its functions under policy and the Government -- the opportunity of -- of having commission of crimes revealed to the Government et cetera, et cetera shouldn't be dried up, but isn't -- isn't the ruling Section 5, I wonder what it's all about, has to do with the relevance. 
    If a defendant wants to find out who it was who snitched on him, what's that got to do with the issues in the case? 
    He may then find out the fellow who told the Government is a (Inaudible) and not to be trusted, that has nothing to do that doesn't bear on within the framework of relevance in the chronic in the (Inaudible) crime had nothing to do with whether he did or didn't deal for money from a postal savings bank et cetera, et cetera or as here. 
    But when the issue -- when -- when some evidence through a person has come to the Government which does bear on and is relevant as to the defense that a man might make against a charge, then certainly the federal cases, those three cases that they rely on and differentiate, they -- of course you can't be shut off including your remedy, isn't that right?

    I say that if he introduced any evidence at all tending to controvert the Government's evidence which he has left it all undenied, he has not denied any -- any issue of fact in here. 
    But if there was evident at any point raised, an issue of fact raised then I'll say the Government would have been bound to have disclosed John Doe because he then would be a person who might shed some light on this controversy. 
    The agent says this, the petitioner says that, there is an issue of fact and at that point he has perhaps -- certainly becomes a witness who -- who can shed some light on it. 
    And in that point, we -- we say that obviously he must be disclosed but in the posture that we have hereof no denial, no evidence, uncontorverted evidence, as you might as well say admitted evidence of -- of the Government, there is nothing in here to show in the testimony of these witnesses other than the -- than the testimony that John Doe had been -- had at the police station denied knowing the petitioner.

    Mr. James W. Knapp 
    -- Mr. Walsh has assured us that he does not know however I think the trial court might well have considered whether in truth and in fact that petitioner knew who Doe was or -- or his identity. 
    In fact, Mr. Walsh at page 41 of the record says, "Your Honor, this is the point actually. 
    He has testified that John Doe was present at 11th and State Street with the defendant. 
    We know that person -- we know that person, that person is dead as I understand it." 
    So, certainly there is some -- something in the record to show that he had certainly some idea as to who this man was and when you consider the facts of the case, I think it -- that the judge might well have -- have thought that -- that Doe knew who -- that the petitioner knew who Doe was.

speaker="james_w_knapp" startTime="2402.871" stopTime="2509.859">
    Mr. James W. Knapp 
    Your Honor, I can only point to the factual circumstances as testified to the agents from which I think a reasonable person might conclude that the petitioner knew who Doe was. 
    For example, when got into the car and this is the testimony of agent -- of Officer Bryson on page 90, when this party got into the automobile, he said to John Doe hi. 
    So, John Doe said hello. 
    He says, “I have to wait a long time for you.” 
    So, he said, “Yes, I know." 
    He said, “I tried to get you at the place and I tried to call you at home also.” 
    He said, “I wanted to let you know I'd be an hour late. 
    I wanted you to come at 11:00 rather than 10:00.” 
    Certainly, he knew where to call him at the place. 
    He knew where to call him at home. 
    Later on, down at the bottom of the page, he said, “What about the other money you owe me?” 
    So, John Doe said, “Well, I'm doing the best I can.” 
    He said, “Things are so hot now it's taking me a long time to put it all down.” 
    “Well,” he said, “do what you can anyway.” 
    He said, “I brought you three pieces this time.” 
    And then when he left, after he had taken the package containing the narcotics from the tree and placed it in the car, “Okay, here it is. 
    I'll call you in a couple of days.” 
    Now, I think that from that testimony there's certainly is the inference to -- and when you consider that together with the evidence of the officer that they had been seen together on two occasions before, one going into the other's house, I think there's at least a strong inference that he had some idea who Doe was.

speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="2510.875" stopTime="2522.926">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    According to Mr. Walsh they thought it was this chap Holmes, Holmes is dead now and was of course at the time of the trial. 
    If that's the fact that he was dead and he couldn't appear, why was the Government so anxious not to disclose who he was?
speaker="james_w_knapp" startTime="2522.926" stopTime="2577.909">
    Mr. James W. Knapp 
    Well, the only answer that I can -- can say to that -- to that question is that if they have disclosed the identity of this person, it might have affected other cases. 
    And as a matter of fact, that's the -- the answer that -- the reason that the Government set forth for not wanting to disclose Doe. 
    The -- in resisting the disclosure and this is at the record at page 40, the Government advanced the reason that the informants work in more cases than one, that there are other matters pending. 
    And he went on and said that after an informant's name has been revealed, he is worth nothing. 
    And another time, the Government said the reason is because he is acting as a government employee in other cases and it would help other persons in matters that are pending.

    Mr. James W. Knapp 
    In the Court of Appeals, Your Honor, said to our minds it was wholly immaterial to have found the package. 
    The sworn testimony of Bryson and Durham is not at variance and indeed it isn't, while Bryson did not testify that he saw Durham pick up the package. 
    He was in the trunk of the car and Durham picks up the package and knocked on the back for Bryson to get out, so Bryson didn't see it but he saw -- immediately afterwards he saw Durham in possession of the -- of the package.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3038.210" stopTime="3069.526">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    But in this -- if Officer Durham testified that he -- he got it out of the car and Officer Bryson testified that he got it out and the record showed -- written record signed by or initialed by Officer Durham showed that Bryson got it out. 
    Certainly, you've got a conflict that the only man -- other man who was there and knew what happened should be on the job, that if he's wanted, isn't that correct?
speaker="james_w_knapp" startTime="3069.526" stopTime="3087.248">
    Mr. James W. Knapp 
    Well, Your Honor, I think I can explain that best with -- with reference to the testimony as to what happened to this package. 
    It was testified by Durham that he found the package. 
    Bryson said that he saw him with the package immediately when he got out of the trunk. 
    Sims who --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3087.248" stopTime="3088.774">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Saw who?
speaker="james_w_knapp" startTime="3088.774" stopTime="3216.909">
    Mr. James W. Knapp 
    Durham with (Inaudible). 
    Sims who was up at the corner of 24th and St.Lawrence and came down said that he -- the first person he saw with the package was -- was Durham. 
    I think all police officers agree that the package was field tested to determine the nature of its contents by Durham at 69th and some place out in Chicago, Cottage Avenue and then the package -- Durham says that he gave the package to Bryson at that point. 
    And -- and at that point, I believe there is a conflict in testimony as whether he gave it to Bryson, Bryson doesn't say that he did. 
    At least there is some evidence in the record that Durham gave it to Bryson. 
    The package was then taken to police headquarters, at which point it was turned over to Fields. 
    Now, Fields was down on the street with Bryson, he had no personal knowledge of who had recovered the package. 
    It could have been either Bryson or Durham. 
    And Fields prepared later on, I think they went home, it was late at night and they went home and they came back and the next day Fields prepared Exhibit 6. 
    Now, Mr. Walsh read the record here and he said I think I got the information from Durham. 
    But the record also discloses that -- that when they came back at police headquarters there was some dealing with this package and in fact all of the officers present initialed the glassine envelope containing the -- the heroin and so that at that point Fields might well have been confused as to who -- who did recover the -- the package. 
    But the point does remain of course that -- that Durham saw Exhibit 6 and put his initials on it. 
    Now, your -- I would like to go to point two, Your Honor, mainly --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3216.909" stopTime="3217.588">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Surely.
speaker="james_w_knapp" startTime="3217.588" stopTime="3326.774">
    Mr. James W. Knapp 
    -- mainly because the petitioner has -- has argued so vociferously about it. 
    I -- I think that when you consider the evidence here, there is no question of -- of applying a presumption to say that we're using a presumption to presume knowledge of the contents, although I think the presumption could go that far. 
    Actually, when you consider here is -- here is the petitioner, he gets out of his car and then another man slides over and drives it off and he -- the petitioner gets in along side of Doe in the passenger's compartment, they drive by a circuitous route and somewhere along the route they slowed down and then they come to a complete stop and they turn off their lights, then a minute or two later they start on again and they come to the tree and the petitioner gets out and he walks over to the tree, here it is 11:30 at night, tree was well lighted. 
    Now, here -- but he walks over to the tree and picks up this package and he puts it in the car and says here it is I'll see you tomorrow. 
    He walks down the street and carry at the (Inaudible) and then further down St.Lawrence and gets back in his car four blocks from where he left it. 
    Obviously, a prearranged meeting with whoever drove his car away. 
    Obviously, he knew where to stop at the tree to get out. 
    There was the conduct of going down around the circuitous route was surreptitious. 
    I think from those facts you might well find that he knew what was in that package regardless of any presumption.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    -- Well, I -- I get into trouble maybe to -- first time you told it doesn't matter whether it's an issue or not and then evidence was given that makes it an issue. 
    Believe me you don't put an -- a witness on a stand if -- if his testimony is not in issue, is that the whole theory of Anglo-American trial. 
    But what's an issue of -- of credibility raised is the issue of witnesses. 
    One who is important says yes and the other who says no then he's entitled to bring the witness who says no. 
    I mean I feel that -- oversimplify this thing, I don't see -- I think I do but I see you're saying the crucial question is whether this is relevant to the issues in the case. 
    And if it is, the fact that he's an informer is immaterial but that's -- it's cumulative which may be a consideration not having a fourth witness if you have three, but if it isn't rejected on that ground which is a matter of discretion for the trial court and if he's the only other fellow to a relevant issue, then he must be produced, informer or no informer. 
    Now, on which (Inaudible) to stand that it is not an issue, all -- that although an issue and it -- it is not irrelevant, it's cumulative and therefore the trial court has discretion --

    Yes.

    -- and if -- if there were any real question of identity, of course, we realize that the defendant is not required to take the stand. 
    Well, he has a right to do it and -- and a person who is innocent, I -- of course Your Honors explained many reasons why he might not desire to controvert, but I should think that he would and if he had, I say the man should have been produced at that point.

    Mr. Walsh, I've -- we've taken so much of your time, principally me. 
    If you want a few minutes to sum up your argument in order to -- to make any additional point, we didn't give you an opportunity to make, you may --

speaker="james_w_knapp" startTime="4117.206" stopTime="4213.778">
    Mr. James W. Knapp 
    -- the only other point briefly as to -- to point three, I think our brief adequately covers the point that there was no showing there that the -- that the report of Agent Durham would in anyway be controversial of -- of Durham's own testimony, they only showed that he made a report, they didn't show what was in it. 
    And in the Gordon and Krulewitch case, there was a showing on the part of the witnesses. 
    They have made prior contradictory statements. 
    Now, as to point two, I think I have started to -- in the main point that I have there is that -- that the facts as shown are consistent with a knowledge of the content of the package and that you don't have to rely upon the presumption to presume the contents, however, I do think that the Yee Ham case goes almost so far as to -- to hold that that presumption would create a presumption that he knew that there was heroin in the package and that it would be therefore incumbent upon him to explain it and that would not be an unreasonable presumption in view of the fact that heroin is not legally possible to be manufactured or produced in this country and you cannot import opium for the purpose of producing heroin. 
    And as I understand that no legal heroin in the United States or if there is, it's a very incontestable quantity.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Mr. Knapp, there's one point that I would like to have you state the Government's position, you may have and (Inaudible) namely, the ground that the Court of Appeals took that it heard with all these question of informer and so on because of the sentence, the stay in Count 2 and then under Count 2, the problem doesn't arise.
speaker="james_w_knapp" startTime="4234.782" stopTime="4236.037">
    Mr. James W. Knapp 
    They -- they say that as to Count 2 --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="4236.037" stopTime="4237.894">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    What is -- what is your position on that?
speaker="james_w_knapp" startTime="4237.894" stopTime="4306.129">
    Mr. James W. Knapp 
    I say that he is not a participant in the possession. 
    If you leave out Count 1 in the circumstances surrounding the evidence as to Count 1, you have clearly evidence of eye witnesses to the actual possession and transportation of the -- of the heroin by the petitioner. 
    The -- the John Doe was in no sense a participant in that. 
    He was sitting in the car and as that I would say is no more than any other observer, a person who for instance was standing across the street and saw it or someone in a house looking out a window and might have seen it, that -- that John Doe was not a participant in that actual possession and transportation of the heroin from the tree to the car. 
    And the Court of Appeals held that and I think that that is certainly as to Count 2, that -- that he certainly was not a participant -- not a participant in the offense. 
    I don't think he had possession to it, put in his car. 
    Thank you, Your Honor.
