    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Arkansas &amp; Louisiana Missouri Railway Company et al., versus Amarillo-Borger Express Incorporated et al., and Number 224, United States of America versus Amarillo-Borger Express. 
    Mr. Currie, you may proceed.
speaker="ralph_w_currie" startTime="24.550" stopTime="660.354">
    Mr. Ralph W. Currie 
    Mr. Chief Justice and -- may it please the Court. 
    Within the time which is allotted to me, I want to discuss the several legal questions that are presented by this appeal, including the question of mootness, and thereafter, assuming that a justiciable controversy exist my reasons for arguing that the judgment of the court below should be affirmed. 
    But before I begin the legal argument, I think it's appropriate and I believe I can be of the greatest assistance to the Court if I recite what the facts are, because it is difficult for me to explain my reasons for a legal conclusion without associating it with the facts upon which these conclusions are based. 
    Now, the commodity that we're dealing with here is a commodity known as carbon black. 
    Carbon black is a product of natural gas and oil. 
    It is produced primarily in the State of Texas and -- in the Southwest. 
    And the Panhandle area of Texas is the largest producer of carbon black. 
    The principal users of carbon black are the rubber manufacturers or the tire manufacturers. 
    The -- there's a statement in the record to the effect that approximately 95% of all carbon black is used in the manufacture of rubber to its entirety. 
    The Interstate Commerce Commission found in this particular proceeding and -- and the proceedings reported in 298 I.C.C. at 721. 
    And on page 723 of that decision, the Interstate Commerce Commission in this case pointed out that between 40% and 60% of all of the carbon black that was used in rubber was consumed around the Akron, Ohio area. 
    So that for all practical purposes what we have here was a movement, a tremendous movement of carbon black from the Panhandle area of Texas into Akron, Ohio. 
    The Commission's proceeding also discussed the fact that during the years 1954 and 1955, there seemed to be about 700,000 tons of this commodity that moved. 
    It's quite a substantial movement. 
    And the figures revealed to the Commission and recited by it in that decision. 
    It showed that 66 and ninth-tenth percent of it was moved by rail during those years and 28 -- eighth -- and eight-tenth percent by motor carrier with four and three-tenths percent by seatrain. 
    A seatrain is a water carrier that holds loaded railroad cars. 
    There was no movement by barge and by way of momentary digression, it is hard for me to restrain a chuckle when I hear counsel say as he did yesterday that the purpose in reducing these rate was to forestall barge competition because there immediately appears before my mind the picture of a barge moving from the area Panhandle of Texas across the plains there to Akron, Ohio which is also a place not on water. 
    The truth is that this movement of carbon black, it moved entirely by rail or by motor carrier. 
    Those were the two competing forms of transportation that moved it. 
    Now, prior to 1954, and I will let you say this. 
    It constituted for the appellees and motor carriers whom I represent here a very important piece of business. 
    It was important out of proportion to the revenue we received for it because it supplied us with a return haul. 
    You see, under our certificates which the Commission issued to us, we are not allowed to handle products in bulk. 
    We are not allowed to handle livestock. 
    Now, in the Panhandle area of Texas, the things that are produced are grain, which moves in bulk and oil which moves in bulk or by pipeline and carriers. 
    Consequently, when we carry products of general merchandise into the West Texas Panhandle area, there is little that we are authorized to move back. 
    And carbon black which moves in sacks is a commodity which offered us a return haul into the Akron, Ohio area. 
    So, it was of a -- a great deal of importance and at the time this controversy arose. 
    We were -- excuse me. 
    We were getting revenues in excess of a $1000 a day out of this transportation of the small percentage of the carbon black that we were being privileged to handle. 
    Prior to 1954, the rail rates and the motor carrier rates were on the same level or substantially the same level. 
    It had been that way for some time. 
    Now, during the period following World War II, there had been blanket general increases granted to the railroads and taken by the motor carriers. 
    And as a result of this -- of the application of these blanket general increases, the rates got slightly out of adjustment. 
    The typical illustration which everybody agrees was typical, was the rate from the Panhandle points of Texas such as Borger and Amarillo into Akron, Ohio. 
    There, the -- the rate when you add it on the various increases and calculated them according to the different formulas, the rails had a rate of $1.56 a hundred and the motor carriers a rate of $1.53 a hundred. 
    The railroads in -- early in 1954 filed a new schedule and reduced their rate not to meet the motor carrier rate but down to $1.4785, one hundredths cents per hundred, which put them five and fifteen one hundred cents per hundred pounds below the then prevailing motor carrier rate. 
    The motor carriers then filed with the Commission a new tariff seeking to establish the same $1.4785 per hundred pounds. 
    The rails protested that and the Commission suspended the rates of the motor carrier. 
    That was in 1954. 
    Hearing was had on the suspension. 
    They entered onto an investigation and the hearing was had in July 1954. 
    The seven months period expired with no action on the part of the Commission and the motor carriers voluntarily extended the period of suspension and this was the customary practice we are told until the Commission could complete its investigation. 
    At the time of the controversy which had its inception in September 1925 -- of 1955, the Commission had not yet completed its investigation and had not handed down its decision. 
    Neither had it done so at the time of the trial in the court below. 
    So that the practical effect of that situation was that the railroads were enjoying a differential of five and fifteen-one hundred cents below our rate, notwithstanding that differential in their favor. 
    They proceeded by carriers which were scheduled to become effective on September the 24th, 1955. 
    Rates which cut the particular rate down from a dollar forty-seven eighty-five down to a dollar thirty-three, precisely twenty cents, a hundred pounds under our rate. 
    We knew then that we could not exist with a twenty-cent differential against this.Even the 28% of the traffic we were getting would be gone with 700,000 tons moving that. 
    20 cents a hundred is -- is quite a difference. 
    So, we petitioned the Interstate Commerce Commission to suspend those rates on the ground as we thought that they were -- the rail carriers were embarking upon a course of a destructive competitive practice that was in contravention on the National Transportation Policy. 
    The -- the Commission suspended our rates, I mean the rail rates. 
    Our petition was granted. 
    By its order of September the 23rd, 1955 the Interstate Commerce Commission, not the Board of Suspension, but the Commission, the Division 2 itself, acting as an appellate division entered this order which was admitted by everybody to be a valid order and well within the powers of the Commission.

    And immediately, we asked the -- the Division itself to look into the matter and on the same day, the Commission did look into it and decided the Board was wrong and issued this order suspending the rates.

    No, sir, and the reason for that is this, Mr. Justice Frankfurter. 
    And I'll digress from the statement of facts for the moment to say this.

    Well, do it. 
    It's relevant, not otherwise.

    Mr. Ralph W. Currie 
    Well, it -- it's relevant.

    All right.
speaker="ralph_w_currie" startTime="758.033" stopTime="807.782">
    Mr. Ralph W. Currie 
    Certainly. 
    You see, the carrier under the statute -- under Section 15 subsection 7 of the Interstate Commerce Act. 
    The carrier has the right to initiate its own rates, simply by publishing them with the Commission and as -- given 30 days notice. 
    At the exploration of the 30-day period, the rates go into effect unless the Commission by affirmative action has stopped them from going into effect. 
    So that if the Commission decides that it is not going to suspend, all it needs do is nothing and the rates go into effect. 
    It requires affirmative action on the part of the Commission to make a -- a rate that the carrier has a right to initiate -- suspend it and you operate it.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="807.782" stopTime="823.312">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    So that this -- this -- from your point of view slashing ruthless tariff, proposed tariff by the -- filed tariff by the railroads would have gone into effect with all the evil consequences that you've laid before us, is that right?
speaker="ralph_w_currie" startTime="823.312" stopTime="841.071">
    Mr. Ralph W. Currie 
    Except for the action of the Commission, except for the action of the Interstate Commerce Commission which on the -- on September the 23rd, 1955 issued its order finding this probable unlawfulness and suspending the record.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="841.071" stopTime="860.160">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    I'm assuming the contrary hypothesis that the Board of Suspension rejected your protest or at least didn't act on it favorably, acted on it unfavorably and that the Division 2 did nothing about it. 
    Then, this ruthless tariff would have gone into effect unassailably, is that right?
speaker="ralph_w_currie" startTime="860.160" stopTime="862.291">
    Mr. Ralph W. Currie 
    Had the Commission done nothing about it? 
    Yes, sir.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Yes. 
    Well, I'm not -- I just want to know what the course of events.
speaker="ralph_w_currie" startTime="865.609" stopTime="865.943">

    That would have been --

speaker="ralph_w_currie" startTime="877.442" stopTime="905.912">
    Mr. Ralph W. Currie 
    Yes, sir. 
    Then, the -- I think the -- in -- I believe, Your Honor, has it correct that if -- if the Board of Suspension had decided to do nothing, the Interstate Commerce Commission itself on our appeal to -- to it to examine the action of its employees had resulted in no action, then these rates would have automatically gone into effect on September the 24th as scheduled.

    Yes.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    But suppose the -- what really was done had -- suppose the course of events had been what they were, namely that the Board of Suspension rejected your protest or didn't act on it favorably, Division 2, in fact, overruled the Board and suspend it. 
    And then, suppose Division 2 did what I have known courts to do, think of all what they have done and get together the next day and say “Let's reconsider this” someone, a member more interested or more alert or more anything or less anything, I don't care which and say, “Let's rethink this.” 
    And the next day they say “We were all wrong about it yesterday,” and then they recall that order.

    Page 7 of the record, the Commission refers to the order of September the 23rd and says that it entered upon an investigation concerning unlawfulness of the rates and charges. 
    That consideration has been given to petitions of the respondents requesting vacation and to reply as thereto in good cause appearing. 
    It is ordered that the order be set aside insofar as it suspended the operations, but the proceeding of investigation of said schedule shall continue in full force in effect. 
    I say that the necessary effect of that order, Mr. Justice Frankfurter, is that they reaffirmed the findings of probable unlawfulness because, otherwise, they would not have continued to investigate schedules.

    I think there's no justification for any such statement. 
    They merely say that on the phase of it is a basis for us to investigative. 
    It doesn't follow because you investigate to find a rate which a carrier can initiate and you may after investigation find that it's unreasonable. 
    To another phase of it, it's unreasonable.

    The order then went on to suspend the schedules and to tell the railroads that neither these schedules suspended nor those sought to be ordered by the new schedules should be changed until the proceeding has been disposed off or until the period of suspension had expired or until otherwise ordered by the Commission.

    The Commission could have said so and should have said so in its order of vacation. 
    So that I think the fair inference to be drawn is that there was noting in those petitions or nor in the replies which would have caused the Commission to change its mind about the reasons why these rates might have been probably involved.

    I don't understand it.
speaker="ralph_w_currie" startTime="1682.806" stopTime="1904.873">
    Mr. Ralph W. Currie 
    Simply because we took the position and I still take it, sir, that this Court on -- nor the lower court would not be required to search the record to find a basis upon which the Commission might have acted when it didn't say it acted on any basis and that the validity of the order, of any reviewable order must be tested by the recitals in the order. 
    And only if you challenge these bases for the recitals and say that there is no facts upon which that order can be based. 
    Is it necessary or even appropriate that one bring up the record upon which the Commission says it acted thus thereby showing that there was no factual basis for the recital. 
    But whereas here, there was no recital of any fact or what is more properly stated where they were reiterated or in effect reaffirmed findings which entitled as to certain protection and no basis for any contrary action, then the action itself is subject to attack the cause. 
    It does not disclose the basis on which the action was taken. 
    We went to -- to continue with the recital of the facts. 
    We went then to the District Court, the Judge Atwell, the District Judge before whom the case was filed and to whom the petition for temporary restraining order was presented, declined to issue it on the ground that he didn't feel that there would be any damage done to the complainants until such time as the application for temporary injunction could be heard. 
    Although the record doesn't show that the railroads were present, it does show that, on page 12, that the Government was present. 
    The railroads were actually present. 
    I invited them. 
    They didn't show here because at that time, they had not formally intervened. 
    Now, the proceeding went on. 
    The dealing with the subsequent proceedings before the Commission or after the -- the Court had heard the case on December the 12th, on January the 23rd it entered its order finding that the order under attack was invalid. 
    Thereafter, and by the way, the Court was pretty careful to say that they were simply -- it is simply saying that the order of September 23 could be modified. 
    They weren't going to say that the Commission could not have changed its mind. 
    But if they do change their mind or if it did change its mind, it had to do so under lawful means and set the matter back to the Commission with the open invitation on page 59 of the record that the Commission should -- if it wanted to set aside the order of September 23rd, do so lawfully.

    I think that you would have to treat it as though the Commission still had the petitions for reconsideration under advisement and it could have on January the 23rd, then simply entered an order granting the petitions for reconsideration asserting the factual basis upon which it acted.

speaker="ralph_w_currie" startTime="2012.887" stopTime="2236.218">
    Mr. Ralph W. Currie 
    Let me put it this way, Mr. Justice Frankfurter. 
    You may be able to change your opinion, but here in this case, the Commission was under a statutory duty and under Section 15, subsection 7 of the Interstate Commerce Act to state reasons why it would interfere with the -- with the, otherwise, invaluable right of the carrier to initiate its own rates. 
    It made this statement. 
    It -- it stated those reasons and those reasons were in substance that other people were going to be hurt by this publication or that there was probable cause to believe that there would be. 
    As a matter of fact, I think we can agree that the only time the Commission in the exercise of sound discretion can interfere with the carrier's right to publish its own rates is because it has determined that somebody is going to get hurt. 
    Otherwise, there's no reason to interfere with what the carrier may do. 
    And once the Commission has found that there exist a situation, which causes -- which may injure someone and has decided to take action to protect that someone. 
    Then, if the Commission decides that it is wrong about that that those facts do not exist. 
    I think it owes to that person the same duty. 
    Having once found that those rights are to be protected, the Commission is under a mandatory duty to protect them and if it finds it's in error about that, it owes to the -- to the person whose rights are thus being not longer protected, the duty to say -- to give the reasons for it just as though to the same standards it had to tell the carrier in the first place. 
    I think that's just with simple fairness and a necessary corollary to the suspension power. 
    Those things, the Commission did not do. 
    As a matter of fact, it seemed to have regarded it, just as though -- just as the District Court did in the Western supply, the Western Electric Company against Cinema Supplies Company, a case by the Sixth Circuit, in which the Court seemed to have found on a temporary injunction, mind you. 
    It found all of the facts in favor of the plaintiffs that would entitle the plaintiffs to the injunctive relief sought. 
    And then said that we have balanced the equities and they decided that we will not issue the injunction because under the -- all of the balancing of equities, it would not be right to do it. 
    And the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Fifth -- for the Sixth Circuit reversed and said that when a court has made -- when a case for temporary injunction is clearly made out. 
    It does not lie within the power of a court, though it'd be discretionary to deny the remedy. 
    And certainly whereas here, the facts which the Commission found to exist and which it did not take away in its subsequent order as it left those facts still enforced by its subsequent order -- by the very nature of the order. 
    It's simply saying that were just not going to grant the remedy any longer. 
    That was our complaint and that was the real vice in the argument, in the order of the Commission.

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    This Court has never made any such statement because it couldn't. 
    It must have made it with reference to a particular agency, with reference to particular proceeding on a particular record. 
    It doesn't make and I don't believe it ever has said in this blanket way because if there's one thing that's to be said about the relation of the Courts to the -- to the administrative agency that these are rowdily speaking ad hoc situations. 
    The idea of saying that this -- that this Court has ever pronounced that it can never led an administrative order by unless as we know what all the facts were, particularly when the facts aren't broad here for us to determine whether the administrative agency acted with the utmost reason.

    Mr. Ralph W. Currie 
    That leaves them presently, sir. 
    That leaves presently, sir. 
    By the way, I should add as a matter of -- of information that ultimately, the Commission found that our rates were all right too. 
    And so that presently, the -- the relationship between the motor carriers and the rail carriers is that the rate from the Panhandle to -- to Akron by rail is $1.33 per hundred and the rate from -- by motor carrier from the same points -- between the same point is $1.4785. 
    We have been permitted to meet the older rail rate, but we have not tried to meet the new rail rate. 
    We can't because we just can't justify it. 
    We know the Commission would -- would -- our over the road cost of operation just wouldn't meet and we just can't do it. 
    So, we have not tried to meet that rate.

    Mr. Ralph W. Currie 
    Well, my brief -- let me say it this way, Mr. Chief Justice. 
    This proceeding involves only one question. 
    Here, the Commission issued and admitted a valid suspension order. 
    It suspended certain rate schedules. 
    Thereafter, it attempted to set aside that suspension order. 
    The order -- the -- the District Court said that that attempt was ineffectual and that the suspension order was still in full force and effect. 
    Subsequently, the suspension order had expired by its own terms. 
    It was not a continuing order. 
    It is not a short-term order capable of repetition. 
    The power of the Commission over that order was exhausted when it expired by its own terms because the statute stopped it. 
    Still later, the Commission proceeded with its investigation and has entered a final order, finally terminating all matters at issue between this, these appellees, the railroads and of course the Commission. 
    This proceeding attempts only to ask this Court at this late date to decide whether the Commission had power to vacate an order which by subsequent events has already been vacated. 
    Now, suppose that this Court says “Yes, you had the power to vacate that order.” 
    Now, what possible good is it? 
    It solves nothing. 
    The order is already extinct. 
    It has already expired. 
    It is nothing except as a guide for future conduct.

    There are no reparations, Mr. Justice Clark, in this case.

    Mr. Ralph W. Currie 
    I have not been advised. 
    I would assume, sir that the shippers wouldn't want to pay, although, as I pointed out in the brief, these shippers were there. 
    They were present in the court below. 
    One of them made an affidavit in lieu of testimony in this case representing an association that ships 95% of all the carbon black.So, they knew what the facts were and they knew what the situation was at that time.

    Presumably it's correct, that's legal, it's valid. 
    Now, they should have been charging during those seven weeks the higher rate. 
    So now, they would be obliged, they say, (Inaudible) to go to the shippers and say, “Look, we charged you lower rates. 
    We should have charged higher and we have to charge this higher rate.” 
    The shippers would say, “Well, look, we've paid beyond to the order of the Court.”

    In the first place, those people are not parties to this suit and as I see the rule of mootness as laid down by prior decision to this Court. 
    This controversy has to be determined or has to be judged on whether or not there's anything that the parties to this controversy stand to gain or lose by it. 
    Second, if there be any -- three things -- secondly, if this Court finds that this case is moot and vacates the judgment of the court below, as it usually does, you are going to have the -- all of that situation will be eliminated.

    Mr. Ralph W. Currie 
    Now, thirdly, any controversy that can be settled between the shippers and receivers of the freight and the railroads could not be settled in this Court. 
    As a matter of fact, if the railroads feel that it would be unjust for them to collect the undercharges that might exist, all they need do is to apply to the Interstate Commerce Commission on the informal docket for a relief from -- and for permission to weigh the undercharges. 
    That's frequently done because it operates this way that if they collect the undercharges, the Commission might award reparation back to the shipper so as an administrative shortcut when they have a situation which the rails and carriers and the shippers think is obviously unfair, they simply go to the Commission. 
    The Commission -- the Commission decide that it would be unfair and that they would award reparation if collected, they said to take the shortcut and authorize the railroads to weigh the undercharge in the first instance.

    I simply say, sir, that -- that the railroads have nothing to lose. 
    They have no liability. 
    They're not liable for any reparation under this. 
    In -- in that connection, Mr. Chief -- Mr. Justice Frankfurter, the decision of this Court in Alejandrino against Quezon which just came to my attention yesterday, it's in 271 U.S. 528. 
    The -- this Court did say in that connection that it must be with the term of office, I mean this period of suspension of the term of office having expired, the case was moved even though the question of whether the man was entitled to his salary during that time have not been determined and was still left to be determined. 
    It may be persuasive. 
    I -- I simply want to conclude my remarks this way, if -- may it please the Court, because my time is about up. 
    That the brief -- my brief here indicates very clearly that if this still presents a justiciable controversy, the action of the court below needs to be affirmed. 
    The order was reviewable. 
    It's impact upon the petitioners there were just as definite and certain as it ever would be when we went to the Court. 
    The action of the Commission, I think as disclosed by the record, was an arbitrary action and in truth, it is worthy of some note that the -- that neither the briefs nor the argument make any real effort to justify de facto what the Commission did. 
    They spend their time arguing that it was not reviewable.
