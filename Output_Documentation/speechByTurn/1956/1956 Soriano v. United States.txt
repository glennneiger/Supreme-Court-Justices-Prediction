Soriano v. United States
speaker="george_w_foley" startTime="0.000" stopTime="151.224">
    Mr. George W. Foley 
    -- comment to make in closing. 
    Before the recess, I was dealing with the Government's argument that the statute of limitations of the Court of Claims is a consent statute and so must be interpreted and construed differently from other statutes. 
    The -- and our answer to that point is that there's absolutely no reason why a consent statute of limitations should be construed any differently than a -- an ordinary statute of limitations or statute that creates and limits new rights, and I pointed to the Osborne case of the Second Circuit which dealt with a consent statute. 
    Now, this argument of the Government was put forward in a case in the Supreme Court of Oregon, Peters against McKay in 1951, and the Court considered the entire argument at length and held that consent statute or not, it was suspended by war. 
    They said there that -- and pointed their argument there, they pointed out that where the State consents to be sued and then by recognition of its rules of international law and common law, closes its courts to the litigants, they thereby deny the privilege which they granted and that you must have some construction of the statute that avoids absurdity. 
    And they felt that it was not conceivable that the same hand which gave the right to sue should with the other hand withhold it while -- and both be in operation at the same time. 
    The comment of the -- the Court commented on the nursery rhyme. 
    They said that the law does not follow the precedent of the nursery rhyme, “Hang your clothes on the hickory limb but don't go near the water.” 
    And that's exactly the same -- the same situation here. 
    We can't conceive --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="151.224" stopTime="154.491">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    That's a negative rule of statutory construction, right?

    Mr. George W. Foley 
    [Laughs] I would say so, Mr. Justice, yes. 
    That the State in consenting to be sued can't at the same time say that it shall not be sued.

   Argument of Roger D. Fisher
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="174.969" stopTime="183.308">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Fisher.
speaker="roger_d_fisher" startTime="183.308" stopTime="280.160">
    Mr. Roger D. Fisher 
    May it please the Court. 
    I would like at the outset to state the position of the Government on the two basic issues now before this Court in this case. 
    I'll then take up each issue in turn in more detail. 
    The first issue is the one on which certiorari was granted. 
    The issue was raised in the petition whether members of the Philippine Army, who were recognized in certain ways, found in certain categories, were members of the armed forces of the United States for procurement purposes so at requisitioning of supplies could create debts of the United States. 
    It's an issue of status and authority, whether the status of this group of people, the Philippine guerrillas, who were later recognized or who were recognized contemporaneously was such that they have authority to create direct obligation upon the United States Government by their procurement, their requisitioning. 
    On this issue, our position is that they did not -- had no such authority. 
    Although, the Philippine Government was not holding independent, prior to July 4th, 1946, they were a semi-sovereign or quasi-sovereign, had some independence. 
    That was the position of United States from 1941 until 1946 when the Philippines required full independence to treat them with as much independence as was consistent with their position. 
    The assistant -- financial assistance which United States gave to the Philippine Army was handled in such a way, it was handled in much the way that assistance to other governments was handled --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="280.160" stopTime="299.720">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Foley, may I -- or Mr. Fisher, may I ask you just one question. 
    I hate to interrupt you but -- but how did we treat them in relation to such matters as this during that period between 1941 and 1946? 
    You said as to some matters, we -- we treated them as sovereign.
speaker="roger_d_fisher" startTime="299.720" stopTime="299.960">
    Mr. Roger D. Fisher 
    As to the --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="299.960" stopTime="303.151">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Now, how do -- how did we treat them in matters of this kind?
speaker="roger_d_fisher" startTime="303.151" stopTime="360.187">
    Mr. Roger D. Fisher 
    As to the financial arrangements with respect to the army and the payment of the soldiers and their supply, their procurement, all that is the bulk of my argument. 
    We handled that through the Philippine Government. 
    The United States advanced several hundred million dollars about -- around $300 million to the Philippine Government to be used to meet those expenses of the Philippine Army with -- of which General MacArthur approved. 
    He had a veto power on this military assistance as other aid missions have had and other military assistance. 
    These funds were advanced to the Government, put in the Philippine Treasury with the agreement that they would be only used for those purposes of the army of which we -- we, that is General MacArthur which the American Army Commander, approved those funds. 
    There are still funds in their -- in the Philippine Treasury beyond those required to meet the claims which have been approved and the return of these funds was the matter under discussion between the two governments right now.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="360.187" stopTime="383.206">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Did we -- did we assume the responsibility for the payment of those bills and merely make the Philippine Government our agent or did we limit the Philippine Government to the amount of money that we appropriated to them for that purpose? 
    Do they have the right to -- to incur obligations irrespective of appropriations?
speaker="roger_d_fisher" startTime="383.206" stopTime="407.683">
    Mr. Roger D. Fisher 
    Precisely, they could incur obligations. 
    A Philippine dispersing officer, a Filipino officer could procure without regard to the American appropriation. 
    That procurement went directly against the Philippine Treasury. 
    The -- the extent where those funds could be reimbursed or paid directly from the American funds that have been advanced to the Treasury with the question for approval of our military people in the field, where this military expenditure is appropriate.
speaker="stanley_reed" startTime="407.683" stopTime="415.046">

    But during -- during the occupation, during the Japanese occupation, the Philippine Government would not function.

    Mr. Roger D. Fisher 
    That's right and there were no --
speaker="stanley_reed" startTime="417.240" stopTime="427.311">
    Justice Stanley Reed 
    And no -- no money was -- was sent to the Government, I take it, to the payment of the soldiers that had been directed to surrender and then organized guerrilla bands.
speaker="roger_d_fisher" startTime="427.311" stopTime="473.044">
    Mr. Roger D. Fisher 
    No -- there was money appropriated every year by Congress. 
    During the war, it was a token amount of $100 for two appropriations, after that went back up to $269 million or whatever, $100 million dollars more. 
    The -- the funds were -- during the pre-period, from July of 1941 until the surrender in 1942, all procurement matters were handled as I've just outlined. 
    As soon as any bills were met by any one after the reoccupation in 1944, the landings at Leyte and the recognition of the guerrillas, the meeting of those claims, both governments recognized that all those claims were handled in the same manner. 
    The -- the thousands of guerrillas who were recognized and given back pay were paid by the Philippine Government through -- by Philippine dispersing officers. 
    The question here is --

    This claim was under the procedure, it was a claim against the funds advanced to the Philippine Government.

    Mr. Roger D. Fisher 
    Because of petitioner's contention, Your Honor, that this was a taking by officers of the United States, that this was a Fifth Amendment taking that the army cannot interpose its own review and he is claiming, I might say, against funds in the Treasury here.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Well, then all his business, you told us that's irrelevant to this problem -- to our problem.

    We say that -- that whether this -- that there was no authority to this group being Philippine members of the Philippine Army as such. 
    They got neither no authority to do -- to bind the United States and that whether we met that's -- that's our contention and that whether they -- whether the authority was -- was there or not depends upon what the act between the two governments were and whether this particular expense should be paid for as an expense of the Philippine Army is a matter for military discretion from funds appropriate for military assistance.

    Mr. Roger D. Fisher

    Mr. Roger D. Fisher 
    No, his supplies would have been an expense of the Philippine Army since the whole guerilla activities were as Philippine Army expenses. 
    I would like to start the -- and focus the question if I might as to where petitioner contend the Philippine Army got this authority, this general authority and deal with the legislation involved. 
    He states -- petitioner states on -- it's in the yellow brief, reply brief on page 23. 
    The Philippine Army was originally unquestionably a separate army. 
    Many said at that time, 1934 to 1941, it is true that the Philippine Army had no authority to bind the United States. 
    That's the agreed ground from which we start. 
    Petitioner concedes the Philippine Government and its army was sufficiently separate from the United States that prior to the act -- the events of 1941, it had no authority to bind the United States on any requisition. 
    Then he goes on in the middle of page 23, after the induction of the Philippine Army in 1941, the Philippine Army and its officers under the emergency conditions in the war against Japan had just as much authority to bind the United States as had any other American officer who was or was not part of the United States Army as defined by Congress. 
    He is relying here on the induction of 1941 when the President ordered the military forces of the Philippines into the service of the Armed Forces of United States. 
    As conferring that authority, I'd -- I'd like to deal with the -- the three key orders and -- one statute and two executive orders involved in their legislative history showing what were the intent at the time. 
    Did the United States intend to confer authority? 
    We also start, I might say parenthetically from the agreed premise that there is no authority unless it's been conferred expressly or impliedly. 
    And indeed, there would be authority as to be transferred at this time by these events from the United States Government to the Philippine Army. 
    The -- he refers to the Executive Order of July 26, 1941. 
    This is the order which we interpreted one or we're interpreting, it's on -- from the blue -- from the petition for the writ on page 10A and this is President Roosevelt in July 26, 1941 under authority which he had under the Constitution of the Philippines and the Independence Act, "I hereby call an order into the service of the Armed Forces of the United States for the period of existing emergency and placed under the command of a General Officer, United States Army," skipping down, "All of the organized military forces of the Government of the Commonwealth of the Philippines." 
    This order was to take effect from dates now specified by General Officer named by the Secretary of War. 
    Now, this -- this order was issued and derived following a War Department memorandum recommending this procedure, this memorandum in turn was based on the recommendations of General Garner who was out in the Philippines and General MacArthur.

    Justice Stanley Reed 
    It could mean when -- when the -- the Philippine Government is made independent that -- that authority was reserved by the United States.
speaker="roger_d_fisher" startTime="1843.894" stopTime="1973.775">
    Mr. Roger D. Fisher 
    The Philippine Government was -- the Philippines Islands were made independent in two stages. 
    In 1935 under an Act of 1934 was the first stage. 
    Ten years later, give or take, few months in July 4th, 1946, full independence was obtained. 
    During this interim period between 1935 and 1946, the United States reserved this authority to call up the organized military forces into the service of whatever armed forces the United States happened to have in the Philippines. 
    Now, we couldn't just call up the Philippine infantry or individual civilian. 
    We couldn't call up the Philippine Army into the service of an army we had in Europe. 
    We can only call them into the service of the organized military forces which the United States had in the Philippines. 
    It was -- it's an in between situation. 
    If we were defending the Philippines, we should have some authority to command their organized forces. 
    We had responsibilities at that time. 
    The -- in considering what they intended to do by this order, I'd like to look to the War Department memorandum quoted on pages 81 to 84, in fact, in appendix of our brief, the basic brief of the United States on this issue. 
    On page 82, the memorandum recites the conditions and this was the one approved by the Secretary of War which went to the President when he signed that Executive Order. 
    They quote General McArthur's view. 
    General McArthur states, "The importance of having the Philippine Army retained its complete identity and operation under its own laws and regulations." 
    In paragraph 4, skipping over to paragraph 8, "Any funds secured should be available to meet pertinent expenses of the Philippine Commonwealth." 
    We believe this indicates that there was at least some doubts as to what -- they were not planning to put the army under -- merge it into the American Army and give all Filipino soldiers the emergency powers which an American officer might have.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1973.775" stopTime="1985.583">

speaker="roger_d_fisher" startTime="1985.583" stopTime="2010.647">
    Mr. Roger D. Fisher 
    We certainly intended to have military command and we had it. 
    The language I'm looking at here is that the Philippine Army shall retain its complete identity reading on an operation under its own laws and regulations. 
    If Philippines' officers were to procure under their own laws and regulations, we submit that they were not to create obligations on the United States thereby.

    General Eisenhower had forces in his command on the landings in France.We communicated with the French underground. 
    We urged them to resist and to fight. 
    It is not enough to show that there were military commands and authority running to it. 
    The detail of the arrangements that have been made between governments here that if -- between this quasi independent government and then a fully independent government, these arrangements have been respected for 15 years and assumed to be that way, over a million claimants have been satisfied with this procedure, some 35 have suggested they have direct suits against the United States and a filed suit in the Court of Claims. 
    The -- it is simply on the theory you suggested that they're part of the military or army of MacArthur, the United States must be responsible for everything that happened.

    Mr. Roger D. Fisher 
    Following that order, people went to -- the military went to Congress to request funds for appropriations to meet these expenses of the Philippine Army. 
    It was first suggested that they should be met from excised tax funds that were being held entrust for the Philippine Government. 
    This is after the order calling them up. 
    It was assumed that the United States would not meet them from its funds but from excised funds that were to be held to be released in 1946. 
    They went and asked Congress for authority to release these in a premature fashion, early. 
    Congress said, "Why are you doing this, isn't this in expense of ours?" 
    The testimony which I'm particularly interested in is on 104 in the appendix of our basic brief. 
    Colonel Moore explained to the army on October 1941 what the arrangements were between the two forces. 
    In the middle of page 104, Congressman Cole asked them why they're to be exempted from the General Accounting Office requirements. 
    And the Colonel explains that the Army of the Philippines is organized, paid and administered in accordance with Philippine Commonwealth laws and regulations. 
    What about the funds, said Congressman Cole? 
    Colonel Moore, during the current emergency, every established agency of the Philippine Army should perform the functions prescribed by Philippine law for such agencies. 
    It is impractical, I'm skipping a little few words, to disrupt, during the current emergency, present Philippine practice and procedure in order that the Philippine Army might comply with the strict procedures prescribed by General Accounting Office for the United States procurements. 
    These were the procurements for the Philippine Army to be distinguished from the United States procurements. 
    The purpose of this, I must say, was to keep the Philippine to respect the integrity and independence of a government which we were fostering at that time. 
    This was not the poised -- poised responsibility on them except for the purposes of having them learn independence by the experience of responsibility. 
    The United States has -- we -- had a few brief years interrupted by the wars in which to help the Philippine Government assume the burdens. 
    The appropriations were handled in a way to give them the maximum chance to exercise that responsibility.

    Mr. Roger D. Fisher 
    Every -- every recognition order which we have found in which petitioners caught our attention stated specifically to avoid any confusion of the status of any units listed of -- listed or recognized as members of the Philippine Army and they were paid from these same funds. 
    I would like if I might, just briefly on the fact, this is a question which is still under consideration with the -- I was -- the Government was suggesting we try to deprive this Court of jurisdiction over this matter by saying this is one for which you ought to give weight to the -- to the determinations of the executive branch. 
    That was not our intention. 
    Now, we think the Court -- the views of the executive branch to which we referred are those establishing -- setting up and operating under an arrangement, this arrangement between the two -- two armies, between the commanders which for 15 years have been considered by the United States Government and by the Philippine Government as far as I know, at least by the Philippine Army, the operating factor, they will operate as separate unit without liability directly against the United States with liability against the Philippine Treasury which the United States as intergovernmental matter, government to government with me. 
    We suggest that this is a -- right now, pending -- and at the political level, between the two governments is the question of the return of the 25 or so million dollars which the United States have advanced which is above the cost of the Philippine Army as considered by the American military commanders. 
    The -- this money was promised to be returned and it has not been returned in accordance with the Snyder-Romulo agreement of further discussions. 
    The Philippine Government aren't going on. 
    The Philippine Government has raised with the United States at the diplomatic level, the question of the pay level for all members of the Philippine Army. 
    They had a different enlisted men who were paid at a rate for one peso instead of being the equivalent of half a dollar was considered as a dollar under Philippine Army law. 
    They received the lower rate of pay. 
    One of the claims pending is under various orders created in the Philippines, all members of the Philippine Army should receive the same pay to vadilify that they are officers in the American Armed Forces. 
    Other matters relate to -- to housing, allowances, quarters allowances while they were guerrillas, all these questions are not in this case but a decision by the Court in this case would certainly have a bearing on petitioner in this -- the yellow brief, page 35 at the very end. 
    How the payment of awards to Filipino's has been or will be made whether by direct payments to successful claimants or by payment to the Philippine Government for distribution is of no importance nor is it involved in this case. 
    We submit it is involved in this case, if Your Honors determine that there's a direct liability against the United States, the petitioner we paid from funds in the Treasury here not in the funds which have been appropriated or advanced for this purpose and that you will have -- perhaps reduce the political claim. 
    But the -- a Court of Claims judgement goes to the individual petitioner not to the Philippine Government.

speaker="roger_d_fisher" startTime="3812.891" stopTime="3915.525">
    Mr. Roger D. Fisher 
    I most certainly do and I welcome your question. 
    The period -- the six-year period within which the United States was consented to be sued in the Court of Claims is a -- this is a statute of consent contrary to common law. 
    At the time this statute was adopted -- first adopted in 1863, there was no common law rule tolling any statute of limitations for period of war. 
    The -- that first case that we've found holding a statute of limitations suspended was hanging out of this Court several years after the Court of Claims statute was first adopted. 
    The matter is one, as petitioners concede, of statutory construction of the language of the Court of Claims Act. 
    It is our view that consent is only by statute and a statute of consent is strictly construed. 
    The cases in this Court on that point need not decide. 
    When Congress intended the statute to be suspended for war, it does so. 
    It has adopted a number of statutes suspending a running of limitations during the period of war, that's done so from 1864 through 1948. 
    They are cited in the brief. 
    They have done it with -- in various ways. 
    They neither said, “You shall have until two years after the date of this Act or the period of war shall be subtracted or you shall have six months until you're out of military service or you shall have a certain extension of a period, one year of -- from the end of the war.”

speaker="roger_d_fisher" startTime="3949.175" stopTime="4125.636">
    Mr. Roger D. Fisher 
    Your Honor, the -- the second act -- the statutes are referred to on pages 40 and 41 of our supplemental brief dealing with the period -- the limitations question. 
    The second Act of Congress during the civil war in June was a special act for persons who because of the civil war were beyond the reach of legal process and they tolled the war during the period when they -- they extended the period of all statutes of limitations, every kind over which Congress could -- could act, they would do it for all. 
    They have been -- there have been various ones, if Your Honors are familiar with the questions of statute of limitations in criminal cases where fraud against the United States, the period within which frauds could be prosecuted or indicted was extended until three years after the war. 
    Petitioner's contention here is that as a matter of statutory construction, you must construe every single statute of limitations everywhere. 
    That's -- they -- they recognized this is one you have a hard time reaching unless you have such a broad proposition as including an implied exception because of the war. 
    The -- in 1948, this very statute, Court of Claims statute on case three of our supplemental brief, was amended to change that if -- the amendments referred to in page 51 out of that brief, the -- this statute was amended to delete the specific disabilities which at that time prohibited suit, married women, infants, idiots, lunatics and various descriptions and they provided that a petition on the claim of a person under legal disability or beyond the ceased time and claim accrues maybe filed within three years after the disability ceases. 
    The revisers note in explaining this, they -- the person's under legal disability could not sue, written in a footnote on page 51 and there's still should be barred until they become able to sue. 
    The revised language will cover all legal disabilities actually barring suit. 
    The petitioner here could not legally bring suit. 
    He was barred from bringing suit during the war. 
    He could not have brought suit until the war was over and the Trading with the Enemy Act was fixed and the common law disability was lifted. 
    He failed to file suit until five-and-a-half years after the end of the war. 
    As he filed suit in 1951, more than five-and-a-half years after the surrender of the Japanese on September 2, 1945 which is the date we will use, we will both agree on for this purpose as being the end of the --

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Why did you say an enemy?
speaker="roger_d_fisher" startTime="4128.604" stopTime="4304.279">
    Mr. Roger D. Fisher 
    An enemy under the Trading with the Enemy Act, a permanent resident of an area occupied by an enemy is an enemy of Mr. Soriano within Manila. 
    He was not a guerrilla. 
    He's -- he's a supplier. 
    He's a farmer. 
    He is a technical enemy and could not legally bring suit as they have argued at great length. 
    He is prevented from bringing suit. 
    The statute contains a special exception for anybody who is under disability which bars suit. 
    This Court in the very cases of Hanger and Abbott in the civil war cases continue to refer to the inability of a hostile or a party who could not reach the courts as being a disability. 
    These cases are referred to in the footnote on page 52. 
    It is the position of the United States -- I'd like to make clear if I could because we do not support, we do not adopt the position adopted by the Court of Claims in the Maritima case. 
    It is our position that the statute of limitations, the six-year statutory period in the Court of Claims is absolute as to everyone. 
    It is not suspended during war by an implied exception for the benefit of anybody. 
    There is a statutory exception for those who legally could not bring suit during the war and they have three years after the war within which to file suit. 
    Petitioner did not file suit either within six years, the time his claim accrued or within three years of the end of the war. 
    We believe that you cannot construe this statute as he asks without raising serious questions about all. 
    Consent statutes, all the tax refund claim periods during war as among people already situated and of course hard to reach. 
    He is asking a construction of this statute. 
    He tries to make the statute seem inequitable so that you have to construe it as an implied exception. 
    The statute is not absurd and it is not inequitable on its face. 
    Everybody who is barred by war has three years after the war within which to file a suit. 
    That's in the statute. 
    That's a far easier exception to find than one which says that the whole period when the statute says six years, that means six years plus whatever time there is disability. 
    The last requisitioning here occurred in January 1945. 
    Manila was liberated in February 1945. 
    The mail service -- commercial mail service of the United States opened on April 16, 1945. 
    It was more than six years after the commercial mail service is opened that suit was here barred. 
    We believe claim does not fall within the period of consent allowed by Congress and the process in each of the question decide than the -- one of our certiorari was granted. 
    We believe in these phases, the petition must be dismissed.
