    Mr. Edmund E. Shepherd 
    I would like Mr. Chief Justice to answer your last question.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="15.154" stopTime="15.854">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Thank you.
speaker="edmund_e_shepherd" startTime="15.854" stopTime="117.310">
    Mr. Edmund E. Shepherd 
    And at the same time to reanswer a question from Associate Justice Brennan. 
    Michigan has no record of legislative history for being possibly to tell just why that amendment was enacted. 
    My guess would be and it's merely a guess or a suggestion that that additional phrase or clause was put in there because of the increase in juvenile delinquency of which we are all aware. 
    Now if I might digress in the record just to give you an illustration of that, the other day just before I let -- I had occasioned to visit the State Police Post. 
    And there for the first time I observed polygraph test of a young man 19 years of age, accused of statutory rape on a 13-year old girl. 
    And I watched that and I observed his answers and he didn't confess, I understand he did live. 
    But the horrible part of it was that at the same time six others were awaiting a similar test for statutory rape on the same 13-year old girl. 
    So it maybe that acts of that kind induce the legislature to amend the statute. 
    Now, coming back to my answer to your question, Mr. Justice Brennan --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="117.310" stopTime="141.430">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well before you answer that one, Mr. Shepherd, I -- I wondered if -- if in passing this amendment, your legislature thought that perhaps it had to put another definition. 
    It created another standard let's say or another type of obscenity in order to be able to convict people.
speaker="edmund_e_shepherd" startTime="141.430" stopTime="203.153">
    Mr. Edmund E. Shepherd 
    That might be true. 
    Now, logically I passed to reanswering this other question. 
    I do not think that under the -- the statute and in each particular case, you have to prove as a matter of fact that some particular youth, a boy or a man was led to commit some act of deprivation. 
    I think that the -- the case, as a matter of fact, the issue of fact would be the matter contained in the book with the matter contained in the book tends to do these things. 
    So that as in this case, the Recorder's Court judge resolved the issue of fact but finding as I view this record that taking the book as a whole and having read of it, it is obscene within this definition.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="203.153" stopTime="210.933">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    I understand from that that the State's position that there was a finding on the book as a whole.
speaker="edmund_e_shepherd" startTime="210.933" stopTime="499.937">
    Mr. Edmund E. Shepherd 
    Yes, Your Honor. 
    That is definitely not the expensive maybe tedious. 
    Just for a few minutes, I want to take you to this record and show you just why I -- I make that contention. 
    At the outset, a motion was filed to -- on -- on the face of the statute. 
    The motion is filed to dismiss. 
    And on page 16 of the record there are some discussion about that in which the Recorder's judge reserves his decision on that motion. 
    And he didn't pass upon it until the end of the trial. 
    Now, he says among other things in regard to that. 
    Now I would like first to meet on -- I would like first to meet with counsel because after all, some of these passages are delicate. 
    Some of these passages, I don't mind telling you, so far as I am only on page 123, referring to the book, and there are over 500 pages. 
    And many continues I was pleased that the book was handed to me before the case commenced, which clearly indicates that at that time, when the motion was under consideration, he intended to read the whole book. 
    Now, the Court will turn to page 23, you will find that at that point in the case, during the receiving of testimony, these excerpts were introduced in evidence. 
    And what the Court said there clearly indicates that he did not intend to judge the book alone on those excerpts, because he says that the Court takes this position at this time. 
    I have not read the complete book. 
    I intend to. 
    Now whether I base my decision on the complete book afterwards or the excerpts contained in there will be a matter of my opinion, or my opinion there. 
    So, he passes thereby and he introduces the excerpts solely for the purpose of identification, not that he may judge it but that he -- that they may, as he says, save a lot of time marking at the book and the page references, and so forth. 
    Now on page 29, again he reserves the decision on the motion and clearly indicates that he is going to read this whole book and he says that he is just a slow reader, reads books very slowly or your excerpts very slowly or your briefs very slowly. 
    I do not -- I do not know that I have not completed reading anything but the brief and the motion. 
    I have read part of the book and I've read part of these excerpts. 
    So he's progressing, maybe somewhat slowly. 
    Now on page 32, we come to the point where they are about to introduce expert testimony on the literary value of the book and whether or not this or rather by passages which earned the scrutiny here or essential to the theme. 
    And he clearly indicates that that is the purpose of the -- of admitting that testimony. 
    Now we turn to page 58 and 59 of the record. 
    Again on expert testimony and showing just how the Court's mind is working down at the bottom of the page for the whole report. 
    Without objecting any further, my ruling would be the same on both issues. 
    It would be perhaps the Court and the literary issue and go be of help to the Court and the interpretation of the statute. 
    I am going to permit people who claim to know what it's all about to testify in this case.That would apply to both sides. 
    Now I want to point out just one thing here in passing. 
    Judge Ricker (ph) admitted in evidence and received in evidence testimony adduced from experts on literary values. 
    Experts who have read this entire book and who testified what if these episodes were essential to the main object or theme, he would not permit testimony as to whether in the opinion of any witness, the passages were obscene or the book was obscene because as he held right and wrong, (Inaudible) usurped is judicial function in passing on those questions. 
    Now, on page 77 --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="499.937" stopTime="506.946">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    You say, he would not let the experts testify as to whether in their opinion the book itself was obscene.
speaker="edmund_e_shepherd" startTime="506.946" stopTime="518.960">
    Mr. Edmund E. Shepherd 
    Whether it was -- yes. 
    Yes, Your Honor. 
    He -- he would let them testify as to whether or not these passages were essential to the main theme of the book, this conflict between the spiritual and physical.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="518.960" stopTime="520.667">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Yes.

    Mr. Edmund E. Shepherd 
    No, no Your Honor.

    Well, would he let them testify whether the excerpts would or would not corrupt?

    Mr. Edmund E. Shepherd 
    No, I don't believe so. 
    It may -- one or two questions from you slipped in and had been answered but take it by and large he carefully excluded any expert testimony on the issue which he himself is to determine.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="555.816" stopTime="579.703">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Well the reason I asked that is I noticed on page 32, he made a statement that I think they will be beneficial, while he said, and on the other hand I would like to hear the opinions. 
    I think they will be beneficial and helpful to the Court. 
    The opinions both as to the literary value and as to whether or not it tends to corrupt morals. 
    In fact there was no such evidence.
speaker="edmund_e_shepherd" startTime="579.703" stopTime="593.708">
    Mr. Edmund E. Shepherd 
    He said that, yes, but I think -- I can't point to pages but his -- his general approach or philosophy was if that is a question after all for him to -- to determine.

    They teach (Inaudible). 
    And we also -- we had a Bishop of an African church and we had a Father, a priest in the Catholic faith, who said they had read books, they had made the practice of criticism of books and that they were versed in literary values

    -- (Voice Overlap) of educations, (Voice Overlap).
speaker="edmund_e_shepherd" startTime="714.922" stopTime="847.193">
    Mr. Edmund E. Shepherd 
    -- that was -- that Your Honor please was the only issue of fact in this case as to the testimony developed. 
    Now on page 77, it shows, I think, that the Court was then studying this book very carefully at the bottom of the page. 
    Now just to clarify this, the conflict continues throughout the entire book. 
    It's a conflict between the physical and the spiritual. 
    And finally the spiritual wins out. 
    It said, it is questioning a witness here, he shows interest. 
    Yes, Your Honor, I am trying to distinguish which between spiritual passion and sexual passion. 
    The Court throughout the book it starts and varies in degrees I get it and then spiritual wins out and that's his evident -- quite evidently, he is taking a great interest in it and has written the book. 
    Now, I could refer through any number of page citations here but I turn to page 171 of the transcript of record in which the Court says however, the courts will permit it as I see it the testimony as to whether the material contained in there is of such literary value. 
    As to justify these particular passages, there might be immoral, nude, lascivious, and obscene. 
    So I am going to ask you again (Inaudible), if you feel that some of the materials in there is justified by the literary value of the book, can you answer that? 
    So it shows that each following true on that -- on that carrier. 
    It clearly indicates that he has read the book and is judging it, then just that way. 
    There is another question which he propounds to witness on page 179 and I will continue on page 180 where they confront. 
    You think that the literary value of the book would have been impaired at all by removing or changing some of those parts in the book. 
    That, well particularly in the very description of the -- let's call it sensual rather than sexual act. 
    Do you think the literary value would have been destroyed if some of those were changed? 
    And so currently -- idea of a literary value, I'd say no.
speaker="tom_c_clark" startTime="847.193" stopTime="848.254">
    Justice Tom C. Clark 
    What page is that on?
speaker="edmund_e_shepherd" startTime="848.254" stopTime="953.926">
    Mr. Edmund E. Shepherd 
    That's on page 179, if Your Honor please. 
    Then on page 180 just a little short quotation down at the bottom, it's a -- they've examined Father (Inaudible), I'm right in that pronunciation. 
    The Court says, “Now wait, I have read the book. 
    I would be terribly shocked if Father (Inaudible) had answered that any other way than he had." 
    And again on page 188, I hope I'm not too tedious, I think it's at the utmost importance. 
    Another witness on the stand, the Court says on the matter of obscenity nor salacious literature. 
    He has as I said received disqualifications and it goes to the degree rather than the admissibility. 
    So the Court will ask you, do you think that the passages could be eliminated, so rephrased without effect -- without affecting the literary value of the book. 
    And the colloquy goes on between the Court and the witness. 
    Our counsel has already gone over this opinion which the Court read and I think he followed -- to be followed both (Inaudible) and drawn on the modern rule but at any rate it's quite clear to me that he did after reading this book comes the conclusion that those passages, obscene passages, were not essential. 
    They're overstressed, they're overemphasized, and that therefore, the book as a whole was clearly obscene.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="953.926" stopTime="994.812">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    I wonder really whether what you've been through Mr. Solicitor General, throws any real light on what the opinion means because the threshold of all these, he specifically says that he's going to decide on one basis or the other excerpts or the book as a whole in his opinion. 
    From where you began -- began there on page 23 before he did as he undoubtedly did read the whole book, he says now whether I base my decision on the complete book afterwards or the excerpts contained in there will be a matter for my opinion there. 
    And you don't really get any light on anything until you reach the opinion, do you?
speaker="edmund_e_shepherd" startTime="994.812" stopTime="1036.364">
    Mr. Edmund E. Shepherd 
    Well am I rather doubted to you get a great deal of light on statutory construction for reading the opinion. 
    I think that what the judge was doing here in the sole function when she performed was to resolve the issue of fact. 
    Are these particular passages obscene? 
    Yes, they are. 
    Now if they're obscene, you integrate them to the whole of the book, does the make the book obscene? 
    Does the book contain obscene passages applying the modern rule, and that would be my view.

    It's my job then to read this book, as yet I'm fully innocent of its content. 
    I have to read this book and take myself while they upheld this is within the statute, therefore, the statute covers a thing like this and I must decide a thing like this if that's made of a crime whether that may or may not commit a crime by Michigan, is that it?

    They are cited in my Brother's brief. 
    We have a situation, an argument or a statute provides that -- it reads not wholly obscene but contained certain description.

    Well, maybe I don't make myself clear. 
    I think the only question and that that Court decided was one effect and I think in deciding or resolving that issue, he used modern rule. 
    He may have decided that these excerpts were obscene, obscene description. 
    But I think he also held that integrating, the myriad integrating into the book that the book itself was obscene.
