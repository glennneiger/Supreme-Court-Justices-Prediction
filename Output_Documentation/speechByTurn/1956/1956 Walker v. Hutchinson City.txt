speaker="fred_c_littooy" startTime="43.486" stopTime="227.390">
    Mr. Fred C. Littooy 
    May it please the Court. 
    During the argument by Mr. Levy yesterday, there were some pertinent questions asked by embers of the Court in regard to the procedure used in Kansas, an imminent domain proceedings. 
    Mr. Levy of New York apparently is not too well acquainted with our condemnation law in Kansas and so I would like to briefly outline to the Court the manner in which we have for the last 40 or more years condemned property in Kansas. 
    The statute which is under consideration now was enacted in 1913 and although it may not be horrid by Eastern standards, it, at least is venerable by our Kansas standards. 
    There -- this statute has been used by, not only cities but by counties, by townships, by school boards, by the State of Kansas, in other words, by any governmental unit that condemns land in Kansas. 
    I would not estimate how many pieces of property have been condemned for public purposes under this statute. 
    Greatly, this is the way it works. 
    The procedural statute requires that the city passed a resolution finding that it is necessary to condemn certain land for public purpose. 
    In this case, it was for the purpose of widening a street. 
    This resolution directs the city engineer to prepare the description of the land and a survey of the same that is necessary for this condemnation and present the same to the City Commission. 
    This resolution is published in the official city paper. 
    At the following meeting, we incidentally have a meeting every Friday morning, as required by law, at the following meeting, this description from the engineer of the land necessary to be -- be condemned as presented to the City Commission. 
    The City Commission then instructs me as city attorney to prepare an ordinance declaring it necessary to condemn this land for public purpose, which I had been due and this ordinance is read twice as required by law. 
    It's been on first reading at one meeting and passed at the following meeting assuming that the Commission desires to pass it. 
    The ordinance is then published on the official city paper as required by law and this ordinance passed by as the land to be condemned and the purpose for which it is condemned that specifies the voids that has been read from the street that is going to be condemned.

    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Did they give the names of the property owners too? 
    No, it does not. 
    It describes the land but does not give the name of the property owners. 
    Now, this is no secret proceeding by any means. 
    In a town, our size with 35,000 people, we have a newspaper with a circulation of 55,000, which sounds like some people buy a couple a day, but at any rate, it is very well read and there is a reporter from the newspaper that covers all of the meetings of the Commissions, and he attends the -- and he comes by the city all everyday for a news and I can assure you that there is no secrecy involved or intended in any case of this nature at all.

    Then, after this ordinance is published and then -- and becomes effective which is actually the taking of the land there, finding that it is necessary to take it, it is a legislative taking, the ordinance then directs the city attorney to make application to the clerk of the District Court of the county for the appointment of appraisers to meet and appraise this land. 
    That application is filed with the District Court and then the judge appoints three appraisers who take their oath and these appraisers then publish the notice which you see here in this transcript. 
    This -- this notice must be published one time in the official city paper, it must be published at least 10 days before the appraisers meet. 
    In this case, it was actually published 13 days before the appraisers met. 
    There is no question of with what the procedure used by the city followed the statute.

    It was a matter of common knowledge. 
    Now, I, whether or not, Mr. Walker knew or whether not, I have no way of knowing that.

    So they view the property, then they file the report with the city clerk and this report then is referred to the City Commission at its next meeting for approval or disapproval. 
    In other words, it might be that the city might wish to appeal from some of the values set by the appraisers.

    Mr. Fred C. Littooy 
    After the appraisers filed a report with the City Commission and with the clerk at the District Court, then the City Commission, either approves or disapproves that report. 
    In other words, they may feel that the prices are too high if found by the appraisers and will wish to appeal from those just as the land loan owner has the right to appeal so does the city have the right to appeal. 
    On the other hand, they may wish at that time to abandon some portion of the condemnation proceedings as to some particular piece of land. 
    In that event, they have 10 days after the -- the commissioners -- the appraiser's report is filed within which to abandon the proceedings and this must be done by resolution. 
    If they do not abandon it within 10 days then they -- they are left with, they have to pay the award or appeal from it. 
    And the property owner has 30 days within which to appeal from these commissioners, appraisers report after it is filed with the City Commission and he is then entitled to a full jury trial de novo on the District Court on the question of the amount of his damages.

    Mr. Fred C. Littooy 
    I think, probably, the basic reasoning underlying all of these decisions and condemnation cases are based on the considerations of the difficulty of giving actual personal notice. 
    Certainly, there are some people whose lands are condemned who you can -- whose residence you can ascertain without any difficulty. 
    On the other hand, there are many people whose residence is extremely difficult to ascertain. 
    They might be a deceased person who have -- who has heirs. 
    He might be a nonresident decedent who we don't know where he lives. 
    We don't know who his heirs are. 
    There may have been in a state conducted in a -- in another county or another state and he has heirs right there in our time, we would have no way of knowing it.

    It is the identical same statute. 
    And in that case, the Court held basing it on previous decisions of this Court and other jurisdictions that it is universally recognized that in condemnation proceedings, the summary may be -- the procedure may be summary and the notice may be indirect and may be -- may be he can use the constructive service and may be he used in the cases of both residence and nonresidence.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1314.075" stopTime="1318.094">

    Mr. Fred C. Littooy 
    That is correct, as to the -- to the -- that goes as to the damages of the land. 
    The statute is exactly like ours and it goes as to the damages and the Court clearly points that out that they feel that this provides due process. 
    Now, this is not the only jurisdiction that provides for a constructive notice in condemnation proceedings, Missouri, and California, Wyoming, as shown in the North Laramie case here and Mississippi among others all provide that the constructive notice is adequate notice and provides due process and condemnation proceedings.

    Mr. Fred C. Littooy 
    -- without giving him notice of the meeting of the appraisers. 
    Now, yesterday, in closing, I want to point out that Mr. Justice Burton, I believe, asked the counsel for appellant if he could distinguish between this case and the case of Collins versus of City of Wichita. 
    That case found its way up here just about the same time this case found his way up here last year. 
    That case involved the City of Wichita, the city condemned some property under this precise same statute and the precise same question was raised in that case as to whether or not this statue provided for due process of law. 
    While our case was going up to our State District Court and our -- and our State Supreme Court, that case was finding its way to the United States District Court and the United States Circuit Court. 
    And in that case, the United States Circuit Court upheld this statute as comporting with the due process provisions of the Constitution. 
    And on November -- last November 7, this Court denied a petition for writ of certiorari in the Collins case. 
    Two months later, this Court noted probable jurisdiction on the case at bar. 
    I cannot distinguish the two cases. 
    And for the reasons that we have set forth in our brief, then here, where they had reasons advanced by this course in -- Court in previous decisions involving condemnation, we respectfully submit that the decision of the State Supreme Court of the State of Kansas upholding this statute on the constitutionality thereof should be affirmed.

    Mr. Herbert Monte Levy 
    Actually, Your Honor, as I believe I stated yesterday, the only question I think that we can really properly raise here, the more I think of it, the more I become convinced to that, is the question of the valuation proceeding because if you'll notice on page 2 of my brief, we have the statutory provision involved. 
    And the only section which we passed -- which we brought up and the only section which was passed upon by the Supreme Court of New Mexico is 202 which creates that the commissioner shall give owner and lean holder of the property sought to be taken such and such notice of the time and place when and where damages will be assessed. 
    And that is all that Section 202 deals with. 
    Actually, we should, of course, like to have a broad ruling that -- in the case of a taking even the legislature should not be entitled when it deals with specific individuals, should not be entitled to be free of the due process requirement addressed.

    Mr. Herbert Monte Levy 
    The contention has been that the property was valued and taken without due process. 
    Actually, we're sticking here only to the question of compensation unless it would help this Court, and with my Brother Oswald's consent, I'd be quite willing to just say that we'll waive anything else and just rely on the constitutionality of 202 if that will help.

speaker="herbert_monte_levy" startTime="2267.188" stopTime="2352.514">
    Mr. Herbert Monte Levy 
    Your record actually raises the question of the constitutionality of 26-201 and 202. 
    You'll find that on page 3, paragraph 8. 
    Now, that was the complaint. 
    In the petition for appeal to the -- the notice of appeal to the Supreme Court of Kansas and the specifications of error, particularly in the specifications of error, you'll notice that the only error specified on the top of page 23 is the Court further erred by holding 202 constitutional, and that 202 does not provide sufficient notice. 
    And the opinion of the Supreme Court of Kansas also sticks straightly to the question of 202 and does not say anything about 201 which deals with the taking. 
    As I say, the question presented was presented very broadly to give this Court an opportunity to rule on the broader question which we hope it would rule the part. 
    As I understand the rules of the Court, the question presented in the petition for certiorari or elsewhere is deemed to subsume every -- to include every question which could be subsumed thereunder. 
    In Section 202, it's clearly referred to in paragraph 1 and paragraph 2 of the questions presented, and therefore, I submit, Your Honors, that it has been quite properly read.

    Mr. Herbert Monte Levy 
    That's right. 
    I would hope, I doubt very much that the Court would but I would hope that the Court might overrule on the question of taking to. 
    I might mention, for example, that in -- let me cite an additional case which I've just come across, case of Nelson versus United States in 208 F.2d 505, the Court of Appeals in this district held at page 513 that the legislature was not exempt from the requirements of the first 10 amendments. 
    They held that in terms solely of the Fourth Amendment, specifically that is, but I see no reason why the legislature is exempt from any requirements of due process imposes when they deal with individuals through condemnation, I suppose to general legislature. 
    I frankly think that the prior doctrine has been an error, but as I say, the real item which we press is the valuation and that that may be, despite the broad language, in the questions presented might be the only thing before this Court.

    Mr. Herbert Monte Levy 
    No, but I suggest that when a legislature passes an Act as to a named individual, which is a little different, it's almost like a bill of attainder as to property though I realize there are loads of differences. 
    I'm just analogizing that. 
    I think when they do that -- that then there should be some opportunity to contest the legislative act either a hearing before the legislature or in Court later on a public -- in the question (Inaudible)
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2542.980" stopTime="2592.917">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    His point is not yet said though in the practical purpose it -- it has never found it's possible to define that a legislative determination for public purpose is a subject to judicial review as to whether it is to a public purpose. 
    In other words, I don't know of any -- of any breach of governmental power that it is far to barring all the taxation as the condemnation of property to public purposes. 
    Now, the cases still allow or the other order by this Court to say, this is so obviously not a public service that is thereby must be unconstitutional like anything else, but the primary for that or whether condemnation can be directly by a legislative act, and I didn't suppose that it was disputable with this (Inaudible)

    Mr. Herbert Monte Levy 
    My position is that the question relates only to damages and that it can relate only to damages in terms of this Court's jurisdiction because the only question that was raised and passed upon in the Supreme Court of Kansas below was simply the question of Section 202 which deals solely with damages and does not deal with the question of transferring title of legislative act.

    But the Supreme Court of New Mexico here did accept the case and did rule solely on -- in its opinion and its opinion is directed solely to the question of Section 202. 
    Now, maybe they did wrong. 
    I'm not going to talk about that because I don't know Kansas's procedure well enough, but I submit that that really is a question of state law. 
    And they considered Section 202 solely under this particular prayer for an injunction.

    This does not appear in the record anyways. 
    As far as the record is concerned, the record merely alleges the property was taken without compensation.

    Mr. Herbert Monte Levy 
    Yes, that has been taken without due process and there is nothing in the answer at all to indicate or anywhere as in the pleadings to indicate that the defendant was actually -- the plaintiff was actually paid. 
    And under the statute, the -- under 201, the money may be deposited in the City Treasury and it may be sent to the plaintiff.

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    It says nothing at all about the compensation. 
    It rest on the charge that there are two sections of the statute, each of which is unconstitutional, the 201 and 202. 
    So that you have a complaint which raises no question of compensation either raises the question that the city is not entitled to have the land, it belongs to him here. 
    Now, you go to the Supreme Court, the Supreme Court refers to both sections of the statute in its opinion and it rest almost the time on eminent domain which says nothing about compensation. 
    It relies on cases that have been resting on eminent domain. 
    It does not indicate that there's any issue here in connection with the amount of compensation. 
    It treats it on the same basis of the complaint there and I cannot see yet. 
    To me, there's quite a difference, perhaps, that this kind of notice, it should be given in connection with the taking of property for a public use. 
    And the amount that's to be paid for that property for public use and I do not see here how that question of the amount to be paid has been litigated of with that matter why this judgment, if rendered either way would bar future suits to litigate that question.

    Mr. Herbert Monte Levy

    I would say the answer may be found on page 33 of the record that's the opinion of the Supreme Court of Kansas where they hold on the constitutional point.

    It referred -- it referred to both sections that when you get to 202, you find that it was necessary to refer to 202 because it defines not merely to an appraisal but to the taking of the land, 202 says, the Commission as reported by the judge of the District Court shall give any owner, an (Inaudible) holder of a record of the properties sought to be taken at least 10 days notice in writing of the time and place when and where the damage will be assessed about one publication of the officials city paper and so forth.

    It might perhaps -- I'm a little puzzled in terms of the thoughts of relitigation of something at this sort, if Your Honors here would prevail. 
    But it strikes me that the Court passes solely on the question --

    But you're only on a question of litigation, naturally, that's the issue --

    In terms --

    There would be a relitigation or whether if that has been relitigated or no.

    Now, I --

    And if it has, it's been litigated without being raised in the field.

    Mr. Herbert Monte Levy 
    May I ask Mr. Littooy, if with the Court's consent, if he would stipulate in any further proceedings that the question has not been litigated and is still open?
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3409.720" stopTime="3414.915">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well, I don't think this is hardly the time to enter the stipulations.

    Mr. Herbert Monte Levy 
    I'm afraid (Voice Overlap). 
    No, I'm just sure that the -- the court of Kansas would say, “Gentlemen, it's Section 202 that we ruled on and 202 is to deal only with compensation, and that's what you were in here on and that's what we let you on.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Mr. Levy, may I make concrete what I understand as to the -- the final question is and what might require us in order to pursue in regard to damages. 
    We had a case here last term, the Chief Justice wrote the opinion, (Inaudible) in which there was a -- a forfeiture of property dated on page 5 and the question of notice being given to an incapacitated woman. 
    And the point of that case was that the city rested on the so-called constructive notice and with the result that property would -- many times what the tax indebtedness was fell to the city and therefore, we withdraw from this poor woman who lost her property because she (Inaudible) could have noticed. 
    Now, there's nothing like that in this case, is there, on these pleadings. 
    This isn't a suggestion that because of lack of notice property condemned was appraised which have (Inaudible) or conceivably or importantly a lot of the smaller figures (Inaudible)
speaker="herbert_monte_levy" startTime="3502.865" stopTime="3509.713">
    Mr. Herbert Monte Levy 
    I submit Your Honor that though there's no express allegation in there that that is certainly a clear implication else the parties would never go on the Court.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="3509.713" stopTime="3525.666">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    It isn't right to have the case we have when it's the opposite there. 
    It was claimed properly, I forget the exact figures the Chief Justice remembers them, the property was (Inaudible) as much fell to the city because a much smaller tax wasn't paid. 
    That is this case, isn't it?
speaker="herbert_monte_levy" startTime="3525.666" stopTime="3539.361">
    Mr. Herbert Monte Levy 
    No, I grant you clearly that there is not that allegation refers there'd be no point to go into Court and there'd be no deprivation of property if the man had been paid this full value. 
    So that I submit that the allegation in the -- in the petition clearly raises that question.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="3539.361" stopTime="3595.135">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    No because, in the end, no matter how much money you pay, you may not want the properly taken. 
    You are too young to remember the famous spite -- little spite house corner in New York for which makes -- it wanted to pay a terrific, a vast amount of money and this owner said no. 
    I like it, it's my piece of property. 
    Now, that's (Inaudible) public to condemn the property. 
    Some (Inaudible) did request some money, they want to hang on to their own, they don't want any of that improvement. 
    But It doesn't follow because a man who would take -- against the exercise of eminent domain, it's merely a question of dollars and cents. 
    And as the city attorney, I'm sorry I don't know the exact title, the counsel for (Inaudible) pointed out. 
    Sometimes the appraisal may be too high for the city to comfort. 
    And they say, well, we don't -- we will pursue that part. 
    So it isn't merely a question of valid (Inaudible) whether it was against eminent domain.
speaker="herbert_monte_levy" startTime="3595.135" stopTime="3608.073">
    Mr. Herbert Monte Levy 
    But if they were just a question, if he's not wanting to give up the property, then I am sure that the pleadings would have raised the question of 201 and would have said that there's no notice given at all of any condemnation proceedings of any sort because --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="3608.073" stopTime="3612.659">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Well I stand out to deflect the answer, (Inaudible) of the petition.
speaker="herbert_monte_levy" startTime="3612.659" stopTime="3621.455">
    Mr. Herbert Monte Levy 
    I -- I submit that the Court is bound by the analysis of the Supreme Court of Kansas which found the -- the question of constitutionality of 202 to be performed.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3621.455" stopTime="3634.162">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Levy, if you -- if you would like to take one day to file a memorandum concerning the inquiry of Mr. Justice Frank, you may do so with the date to -- to counsel to refine to it.
speaker="herbert_monte_levy" startTime="3634.162" stopTime="3635.485">
    Mr. Herbert Monte Levy 
    Might I have two days, Your Honor.

    I'm afraid that would take us behind over the conference day. 
    I think you better take one day, you can refresh your mind now.
