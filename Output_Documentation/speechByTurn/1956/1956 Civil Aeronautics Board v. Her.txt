    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Number 540, Civil Aeronautics Board, Petitioner, versus Ida Mae Hermann, et al. 
    Mr. Solicitor General.
speaker="j_lee_rankin" startTime="14.332" stopTime="531.072">
    Mr. J. Lee Rankin 
    May it please the Court. 
    This is an action which involves an enforcement proceeding for a subpoena duces tecum issued by an administrative agency, the Civil Aeronautics Board, for a group of documents against the -- a number of respondents. 
    The question presented by the case is whether or not the agency has the burden of satisfying the District Court in each case, whether each document that is subpoenaed is relevant and material, whether or not it is in possession of the person to whom the subpoena is directed, and whether or not, prior to the issuance of such a subpoena, it must take the testimony in the administrative hearing and determine first the existence and then the location of the documents, and then proceed to inspect the documents to determine their relevancy and materiality. 
    The subpoena was issued in connection with a complaint, formal complaint, filed against the respondent which involves a number of parties. 
    The complaint charges that these parties are engaged in violation of Section 401 (a) of the Civil Aeronautics Act. 
    They are licensed. 
    Two of them are licensed as irregular and infrequent carriers. 
    The complaint charges that they are engaged in operating regular and frequent carriage of passengers and freight in violation of the statute. 
    Also, that they are engaged in using the various response in various activities in connection with this operation which are a violation of both the economic regulations and the statute in trying to accomplish this regular and frequent operation contrary to their license, and also, in using and controlling various corporations and nominees so as to be engaged in violation of the regulations of the Board under the statute. 
    The parties involved -- the principal parties are Ida Mae Hermann and Irving Hermann. 
    And they are individuals who have a partnership known as Nevada Aero Trades. 
    That partnership has the licenses to certain aircraft, and those are least to the carriers known as Great Lakes Airlines and Currie Transport Corporation. 
    Those are the only two carriers involved. 
    Then, there are 12 different corporations known as, Skycoach, with various additions to the name but that's the principle attribute which are agencies engaged in various principal cities in the United States in obtaining the sale of tickets for the transfer and carriage of various people from -- principally, from New York to Los Angeles by way of Chicago or Kansas City or Philadelphia, intervening and back the other way. 
    On pages 36 and 37 of the record, it is set out in detail attached to the complaint, an analysis of the various trips that these carriers made of the Currie Transport being bracketed in -- in a square bracket and the Great Lakes Airlines in a -- in parenthesis showing the frequency that the Board charges that they operated in determining or alleging that they are engaged -- were engaged in irregular -- in frequent and regular transport instead of irregular and infrequent transport. 
    Now, there were quite a number of documents that were involved in the subpoena. 
    The charge is that this activity, in violation of the licenses covered a period from December of 1951 on through 1953, about 38 months involved. 
    And it's claimed that -- and the Board claims that these two parties, the Hermann's, actually controlled Skycoach, all the 12 corporations that were engaged in selling these tickets, as well as the Nevada Trades, the partnership and a banking corporation that they had which furnished the banking services and another which handled their -- their gasoline. 
    And these 12 Skycoach corporations, the President was the brother of Mrs. Hermann, one of the two partners and the principal respondents. 
    And Great Lakes Airlines Agency, which served as a banking -- doing the banking function for the activities was head as its vice president of Mrs. Hermann's sister. 
    So, there's that family connection in regard -- in addition to all of the other aspects. 
    Now, it was seemed clear that these various documents that were subpoenaed were relevant to this controversy by reason of -- of the very nature of the complaint and the documents who requested it. 
    The documents that were included were the financial records of all of the various respondents. 
    The correspondence and agreements between the parties, the aircraft that was used, that in regard to it, the licensing and the -- and leasing and any agreements of that character, the personnel advertising material, personal records, the airline tickets which they are always -- they're supposed to be issued three copies, one for the auditor and one for the ticket agency, and one for the carrier, and there is probably several thousand at least documents that are involved in the request. 
    Now, it's apparent that in order to -- to show the nature of the complaint and satisfy the proof required that the agency had to show that this activity which was carried on with -- as alleged deliberately and willfully in violation, and also allege was concealed from the Board had to be proved by records which would be largely in the hands of the respondents themselves. 
    And odds complained that the Board had it in its possession the records so that it was not necessary for it to subpoena these documents. 
    The Government concedes as to such records as the Board actually had that there would be no necessity for such a subpoena to be issued, or that the Court would be required to enforce it. 
    But the fact is and I -- I have been advised by the Board that they did not have these records. 
    They had a report in two different forms of the type of -- or the activities in the carriage of passengers which were in the nature of summaries and financial report that was in the nature of summaries. 
    They also had some --

    Mr. J. Lee Rankin 
    I -- I don't know that it is. 
    I haven't -- they don't indicate the extent of their claim as to what the Government has. 
    But I tried to find out from the Board exactly what it had, and on their statement to me, I represent it to the Court, but that is all that we do have in that nature. 
    We also -- I also inquired about advertising materials and they had some advertising materials of Great Lakes Airlines, one of the carriers involved here, regular carriers. 
    But they had none as to Skycoach, and they had none as to Currie Transport, the other carrier. 
    And the Board says that over 99% of the advertising was handled under the name of Skycoach, and by it although they claimed to be under the direction of the two Hermann's. 
    So that what little they had was not anything like this, involved in the subpoenas. 
    The Board -- the examiner overruled the objections to the subpoena as being oppressive and they -- and then, the Board acted to overrule such objections, and the District Court overruled the objections. 
    And the District Court first ordered that there should be at 10 days postponement during which time the party should try to see if the information would not be furnished, and the Board proceeded to have its people go to the parties and examine their records and try to get the material and they were unable to obtain any satisfactory examination. 
    They did not get correspondents. 
    They were not able to obtain the certificate of stock that a man by the name of Smith, vice president of -- executive vice president of Currie Transport, had issued to him and said he was unable to find. 
    They were the one who know because they claimed that Smith was nearly the nominee for the Hermann's and that they wanted to see the endorsement on the stock to see if the certificates -- to see if it had been endorsed over in blank in that situation.

    Mr. J. Lee Rankin 
    It appeared to be the conventional thing to see if they could get together and get it solved between the parties. 
    But the charges are obviously very serious to these parties, and it -- if the Board's complaint is justified, and they had some information that -- in regard to prior examination of parties in connection with Skycoach that supported the complaint before they ever filed it. 
    It is of the nature that if these records show what the Board thinks they will show, they would be damaging and -- and justify the Board in revoking the licenses which are very profitable and requiring a cease-and-desist which they asked against all of the operations, Skycoach and the various individuals involved.So that they found that they were -- the information in the documents were not furnished in this kind of an experience.

    Mr. Solicitor, since Justice Harlan asked you as to the purpose of the District -- the meaning of what the District Court did in the initial state, you becoming into it, but that -- at this point is just as well -- what do you understand the District Court is qualifying to do by the decision of the Court of Appeals?

    Mr. J. Lee Rankin 
    -- a first -- they first put a burden upon the agency, and that's why the Government is so disturbed as far as the enforcement ability and powers of administrative agency are affected by this decision, and this is not the only one. 
    There are three others that the same Circuit Judge has recently handed down of the same general purport. 
    And he said, “First, they had to go back and -- and swear witness and determine what documents they were -- were, who had the documents, and whether they were relevant and material.” 
    That is the agency itself. 
    Then it -- under its inspection power which --

    Well, it does except that --

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    It indicates what document it was. 
    It identifies the class of documents and the period for which a disclosure is required.
speaker="j_lee_rankin" startTime="833.371" stopTime="836.956">
    Mr. J. Lee Rankin 
    Yes, but it's in categories, very largely. 
    I want to make that clear to the Court.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="836.956" stopTime="838.386">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Yes.
speaker="j_lee_rankin" startTime="838.386" stopTime="843.598">
    Mr. J. Lee Rankin 
    It doesn't call for each one because we just -- the Board just didn't know every single document.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="843.598" stopTime="865.061">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    But we -- but the Court of Appeals said, “Required by -- the individual documents should use, if required by the circumstances. 
    If required by the circumstances, the individual documents should be inspected by the judge.” 
    I don't understand that. 
    When are the circumstances not required, the individualization is required?
speaker="j_lee_rankin" startTime="865.061" stopTime="869.223">
    Mr. J. Lee Rankin 
    Well, we read it as though he requires it in all cases, because --

    Mr. J. Lee Rankin 
    The, “If required?” 
    Well, because he treats it as though it's a constitutional right to have every document determined by the Court to be relevant and material or you can't even have them produce to look at.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="887.933" stopTime="902.315">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    I could understand that proposition without committing myself to it. 
    But if I were the District Judge, I wouldn't so read the instruction. 
    Maybe I should, but I -- my fear is not incapable of writing English, so it's clear.
speaker="j_lee_rankin" startTime="902.315" stopTime="904.924">
    Mr. J. Lee Rankin 
    Maybe we're too careful of it but --

    But I'm not saying you shouldn't be but --
speaker="j_lee_rankin" startTime="908.300" stopTime="1010.755">
    Mr. J. Lee Rankin 
    Then, after we've gotten through the process of having such a witness testify as to the relevancy and materiality in the custody of the documents, we were directed by the Court, that is the agency itself, to use its inspection power and make copies and photographs of these various documents. 
    And if -- at that point, it was discovered that there would be other evidence that was withheld or necessary. 
    We would have put him up -- put on a further witness or witnesses to determine what other documents were necessarily available. 
    And then, at that point, for the first time, would the administrative agency be permitted to issue subpoena to try to get these documents? 
    And then, after the subpoena was issued and set out the various documents desired, after we follow these other three steps, the District Court was to examine each one in any enforcement procedure to determine whether or not the document requested was relevant and material, document by document. 
    Now, that is what we think is an impossible situation. 
    It's a reversal and departure from all of the principles under Rule 34, and what the civil rules of procedure in general practice which we try to accomplish. 
    And that -- there, the rule is whether or not a document in connection with discovery is probably material, and that is all that's required.

    Apparently, the purpose was to have the entire -- every document there to be ruled on step by step by the Court, and have them sifted out in that manner. 
    Now, we think this is a fundamental departure from the decisions of this Court. 
    We think the law, prior to this, these decisions by the -- this Circuit Judge in this Circuit, was well settled by the Oklahoma Press case and the Endicott Johnson case, and that the questions is properly, whether or not the various documents by categories are plainly irrelevant and immaterial, or generally relevant and material.

    Mr. J. Lee Rankin 
    I think it's too full. 
    I think that he treats it as though we're asking for far too much. 
    And the Board asked for so much because the complaint involves a violation during this entire period, and they're asking for the various transactions that occurred during the period.

    But the range, the time and period of the desired documents is something within the Court's discretion and as you -- as we view the matter, it appears to us that 38 months is a little long, but we think it ought to be restricted for two years that to say, subject to the trial court's discretion when the case get -- goes back on a showing made by the Board that they do need 38 months, would you be here?

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Yes, I understand that, but you wouldn't object to that kind of indication that the limits are matters of judgment, not the whole. 
    We've been just a little too extensive and prove it for the wider period of the District Judge.
speaker="j_lee_rankin" startTime="1205.027" stopTime="1237.343">
    Mr. J. Lee Rankin 
    Yes. 
    We recognized that the Court must have control under the discretion of -- of the range of the demands, and whether they are unreasonable. 
    The Court did try to take that into account in -- a regard here though, by saying that the documents could be furnished over a period of time, so they wouldn't be taking these books and records all away from the respondents, but could take certain parts of them. 
    And then, examine those and then return others so that it would be a staggered examination.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1237.343" stopTime="1277.057">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    May I ask you one -- may I ask you one little more question because I think you're quite right in saying this is a far-reaching importance in the relationship between the administrative agencies in Court. 
    Suppose the Court had said, “The categories on their face seemed -- the subject matter seems relevant. 
    The complaint, the complaint is within the scope of the agency's power. 
    Therefore, we direct obedience to subpoena, preserving all of the right to the -- to the defendant,” whatever he is called, “to object to particular documents.” 
    And if that objection is made, that should go to the Court for determination, would you be here?
speaker="j_lee_rankin" startTime="1277.057" stopTime="1284.202">
    Mr. J. Lee Rankin 
    No, I don't think so. 
    We recognize that the -- the system has a right in this area.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1284.202" stopTime="1324.146">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    What you're -- what you're objecting to is your interpretation of this decision that if an agency asks for a body of documents which they inevitably must ask in an inquiry like this. 
    It isn't just one document, there are two. 
    If in the normal course of the body of documents, that if on the face of the -- of the subpoena, the subject matter indicated that the document sought to be elicited, is relevant to the complaint of the agency. 
    The Board doesn't have to justify each separate unit of the body of documents.

    Mr. J. Lee Rankin 
    Yes, and we -- we contend that it's very destructive of this whole area of action to try to protect the public interest as far as the administrative agencies of the Government are concerned and is -- it reduces materially what could be accomplished by an ordinary citizen in just his own personal litigation.

    Mr. J. Lee Rankin 
    And he tried to that deliberately so that it wouldn't appear with the operation of business. 
    And I would like to point out one thing as to these various ticket coupons and the necessity for them. 
    You see, in order to -- what happened according to the contention of the Board in this activity was that Great Lakes Airlines was suppose to have tickets issued for news on Great Lakes Airlines and nothing else. 
    And it's the contention of the Board that Skycoach would issue tickets and would take those tickets and take passengers on Great Lakes Airlines and Currie Transport interchangeably so as to make this in the nature of a regular airlines operation. 
    And by tracing through the activities, the ledger account that's set out in the record shows that on the ledger, they merely had the item of almost a $1,000,000 of income from Skycoach or agency. 
    That's all the ledger showed us that they furnishes. 
    Now, you can't trace through there anything like that, what the activity was. 
    But if you'll take the coupon who has have it issued to John Jones, by Skycoach, for carriage on either Currie Transport or Great Lakes Airlines and then find that that man was on the document for the particular transport of Currie when he was listed for Great Lakes Airline, you can show just what was happening all the way through and who has had the power to control the activity and decide that this whole thing would flow together just as like one -- one of the number of cogs in an entire operation under the control of the Hermann's as contended for by the Board. 
    And it's only by their records in their possession that those things can be demonstrated unless you try to go out and find all passengers all over the United States which would be a place of an unreasonable burden upon an administrative agency.

    The documents who called for were not limited to two months or to any period. 
    On page 145 of the record, the final order of the District Court appears. 
    There were various subpoenas issued in this proceeding. 
    There were 10 subpoenas, all of which are the subject to this appeal. 
    And each subpoena, well, the period of them ranges from 34 to 38 months. 
    And when each witness was called upon, and the dates were staggered, he was to produce all of the documents for the 34 or 38-month period as the case may be.It was not broken up two months at a time.

    May I ask you, the District Court didn't decide. 
    How could it be appealed?
speaker="roland_e_ginsburg" startTime="1658.179" stopTime="1748.319">
    Mr. Roland E. Ginsburg 
    Well, the District Court made a decision, Your Honor, but if the District Court did not decide what the Court of Appeals conceive to be the legal issues in the case, and we agree with the Court of Appeals. 
    Now, in the Court of Appeals decision, there's a great deal of discussion at the inception of the decision as to how an administrative subpoena case, enforcement case, should be decided. 
    And the Court goes into a great deal of discussion as to how it conceives this should be done. 
    It is our position and this is all dictum. 
    Because at page 173 of the record, the Court says, makes a reference to the inspection in the District Court. 
    And then it says, “Since the Court proceeded along the proper lines in the first instance, all difficulties will now be resolved by the Court passing upon designated judicial issues, and those issues are essentially four. 
    The first one is possession and control by the person of the documents, by the person subpoenaed.” 
    We will acknowledge and we did acknowledge in this case, if the person subpoenaed had possession and control of the documents with one exception which I'll come to. 
    Accordingly, this is dictum. 
    If we don't assert this defense and the Court decides it, I believe that to be dictum and accordingly, I don't think it's controlling. 
    The other matter --

    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Would you be contented by what you call dictum as all eliminated from this opinion in case you went back?
speaker="roland_e_ginsburg" startTime="1753.446" stopTime="1757.343">
    Mr. Roland E. Ginsburg 
    Yes we would, Your Honor, yes we would. 
    And I think what was troubling the Court -- on the Court of Appeals --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1757.343" stopTime="1760.039">

    Back for what, bring back for what?

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Bring back on what issue? 
    You said you'd be contented if it went back to the District Court. 
    What would the District Court be doing if it went back, from your point of view?
speaker="roland_e_ginsburg" startTime="1770.641" stopTime="1797.803">
    Mr. Roland E. Ginsburg 
    We feel that on remand, the District Court should decide the issues in this case, the legal issues that we raised and they are relevance and materiality of the documents called for, burdensomeness or oppressiveness of the demand and whether or not the rights of privacy of individuals have been invaded by reason of the demand for personal income tax returns. 
    We asserted, sir, no -- no objection on the issue of possession or control.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="1797.803" stopTime="1816.920">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Am I right in understanding this to be your position that you made this objection before the District Court? 
    The District Court says, “Gentlemen, go and see what you can do.” 
    You come back, the Government is unsatisfied, the District Court then enforces the subpoena without more, is that what happened?
speaker="roland_e_ginsburg" startTime="1816.920" stopTime="1940.140">
    Mr. Roland E. Ginsburg 
    That is essentially what happened. 
    However, I would like to go under a little detail on that if I may, Mr. Justice, and that is, during the course of this inspection, I wanted to point out that the outset of this argument how tremendously broad these subpoenas are and how many irrelevant, obviously irrelevant documents are called for and I hope I'll have an opportunity to do that. 
    Now, the inspection was ordered by the District Court because it couldn't -- it was a -- it's a very difficult case to decide. 
    Obviously, the Board is entitled to some of these documents. 
    And just as obviously, the -- the Board is asked for too many documents, many of which have no relation to the case. 
    Accordingly, the District Court did a very reasonable thing and ordered an inspection, not just to see if the thing would -- could be worked out, to see if the Board could go out and inspect all of the documents. 
    And thereby, limit the subpoenas to the documents they needed, instead of requiring these respondents to assume this tremendous burden of producing unnecessary documents. 
    We've alleged and I think shown that we -- that the respondents couldn't have conducted their business at that time, their businesses, without these documents. 
    And the -- the Court of Appeals found there were truck loads of records, comprehensive and practically every book paper or record over concerning the respondent company, that's almost a quote. 
    Now, that was the way the issue was faced by the District Court. 
    And on remand, we feel the District Court should decide whether or not the documents are material, because the District Court didn't decide that. 
    The District Court said, after laying the subpoenas along side the charges of the complaint, the District Court can't say whether or not -- can't say that any of the documents are immaterial or irrelevant without examining the documents themselves which this Court has not called upon to do at this time. 
    The District Court did not decide that a single document was relevant or material. 
    And that we submit the District Court did not even decide that -- that any of them were irrelevant or immaterial, that they were not irrelevant and not immaterial. 
    It excuses double negative --

    If they haven't done it already?
speaker="roland_e_ginsburg" startTime="1950.345" stopTime="2019.339">
    Mr. Roland E. Ginsburg 
    They haven't done it. 
    If I may make a reference to -- to one demand and contained and it's common to all of the subpoenas served upon all of the corporate and partnership respondents. 
    That is the demand for all general ledgers, all subsidiary ledgers, all supporting documents of the books to the entries in these ledgers, and all vouchers, and all invoices and journals. 
    Now, here, we have some busy companies. 
    They have a lot paper work. 
    They buy just like any company. 
    There's a lot of routine purchases and sales. 
    They buy a typewriter. 
    They buy a paper. 
    They buy supplies. 
    They bag parts for their maintenance division. 
    I don't know if this Court is aware that every voucher and invoice in connection with everyone of these myriad purchases has to be produced. 
    Now, obviously, the vast overwhelming majority of these documents have no relation to the issues in this case. 
    This is what the Court of Appeals saw. 
    They could see that most of them were just routine transact -- most of the documents related to routine transactions which the Board wasn't even interested in. 
    And during the course of this inspection, I wanted to get --

    Mrs. Hermann said that the investigators did not ask for these documents, but such documents were available and they would have been glad to make them available. 
    My point here is that in my opinion, many of the documents called for have no bearing upon the case. 
    I'll take another specific example if I may. 
    The subpoenas directed to the corporate and partnership respondents called for all personnel and payroll records for a period of 38 months and all vouchers. 
    Now, Great Lakes Airlines has an extensive maintenance division. 
    It's established in this record. 
    They have many mechanics and I've seen out they're climbing around those airplanes. 
    They pay this man every week. 
    Every one of those vouchers has to be produced. 
    We don't see any -- any conceivable relevance. 
    I can't assume that for the Board, but we don't believe that they are relevant. 
    And we don't believe that the District Court passed upon this -- this type of issue.

speaker="roland_e_ginsburg" startTime="2429.688" stopTime="2531.319">
    Mr. Roland E. Ginsburg 
    Your Honor, we did in this way. 
    We filed objections and a return to the order tho show cause in which we stated that many of the documents were immaterial and irrelevant. 
    And in an argument before the Court, we attempted to point out the items, which we felt were not relevant. 
    And we also attempted to show the Court the affect of requiring these respondents to produce the documents that there -- the man was for hundreds of -- literally, hundreds of thousands of documents, many of which were in our opinion, needed. 
    And this is what the Court of Appeals, the Court of Appeals agreed with us. 
    The Court of Appeals founded the District Court haven't in effect decided the case. 
    I perhaps could try one more item here, to try to impress the Court with the fact that the Board is asked for too many documents in connection with these ticket coupons that the Solicitor General has referred to. 
    We have established here that there is a demand for no less than 90,000 ticket coupons to prove these ticketing practices and in the so-called relationship between the parties. 
    We don't believe that 90,000 ticket coupons are necessary. 
    I can't, again, assume this for the Board. 
    The Board after these many documents, we came in and said, this -- this amount to 90,000 ticket coupons. 
    I think there was an issue for the Court to decide whether or not they needed 90,000 ticket coupons, conceding of course that the Boards -- the Board has an argument hereto. 
    They probably need some of them, undoubtedly they do.

    Very well.

    Mr. Roland E. Ginsburg 
    And we concede that truly. 
    However, I think that they should prove the relevance of all the documents that are subpoenaed, not piece by piece, but by groups, but by categories.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2615.933" stopTime="2617.454">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Well, is there any to do that?
speaker="roland_e_ginsburg" startTime="2617.454" stopTime="2619.543">
    Mr. Roland E. Ginsburg 
    And, perhaps they are.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2619.543" stopTime="2643.167">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Well, I mean, the subpoena calls for reference. 
    You then -- you then -- then they didn't bring enforced. 
    I should think they must make out a case no matter how sketchy, putting in evidence in the complaint on which they're inquiring, in which they are engaged. 
    To that end, we made this call upon the defendants, whatever they are called --
speaker="roland_e_ginsburg" startTime="2643.167" stopTime="2643.546">
    Mr. Roland E. Ginsburg 
    Respondents.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2643.546" stopTime="2664.016">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    -- they have respondent too, respondents. 
    And so, we ask the process of this Court to make him deliver. 
    And then, the judge looks at the categories and judges it, relates it to the frame of the complaint, on the basis -- and yes, this seems to be a subject matter and a period that are relevant, is that right? 
    Would he --
speaker="roland_e_ginsburg" startTime="2664.016" stopTime="2666.970">
    Mr. Roland E. Ginsburg 
    I think he should do that, I don't think he has done it.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    What part of that has he not done?

    Mr. Roland E. Ginsburg 
    I don't think he is determined that the documents are relevant and material.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    That's his order. 
    His order is --

    Mr. Roland E. Ginsburg 
    I don't believe it does, Your Honor.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2675.480" stopTime="2676.583">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    It's in the terms, right?
speaker="roland_e_ginsburg" startTime="2676.583" stopTime="2707.710">
    Mr. Roland E. Ginsburg 
    It does not sir. 
    It says, “I cannot say whether or not any of the documents are immaterial or irrelevant.” 
    He doesn't even say -- he doesn't say that they are relevant. 
    He said, “I can't say whether they're irrelevant.” 
    That's what the Court -- District Court has said, and that's what the Court of Appeals said -- in that regard, the Court of Appeals said the District Court didn't decide the legal issues. 
    They never -- the District Court never talked about the burden imposed upon the respondents which was very considerable.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2707.710" stopTime="2737.915">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    What we're reviewing is orders of Courts, not talk. 
    Now, the order of Judge Hall on page 144 sets forth what it is that he's ordering your clients to do. 
    And I do not understand how he could have ordered them to do that, except on the presupposition that that -- that the documents, which were ordered to be produced, are documents relevant to this litigation. 
    I don't understand how a judge can make an order, otherwise than with that presupposition.
speaker="roland_e_ginsburg" startTime="2737.915" stopTime="2746.238">
    Mr. Roland E. Ginsburg 
    That -- I don't think we have to assume in this case, Mr. Justice Frankfurter. 
    We can turn to the previous page 143 and see what the Court said about it.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2746.238" stopTime="2747.502">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    What are you saying?

    Mr. Roland E. Ginsburg 
    That's the -- that's the language that I've been reading. 
    It's the first paragraph on page 143. 
    He said, “I can't say. 
    Therefore, I'm going to -- that I'm going to enforce the subpoenas.”
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2757.181" stopTime="2771.385">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    And what's the matter with that, if a Board having the duty of making inquiries? 
    He says, “Documents 1, 2, 3, or 4 or the class of documents is relevant. 
    And the judge says, “I can take care of it.” 
    Why do the Boards claim that it's relevant, sufficiently can they --
speaker="roland_e_ginsburg" startTime="2771.385" stopTime="2777.997">
    Mr. Roland E. Ginsburg 
    I don't -- I don't think that's discharging judicial power. 
    I think that this is a judicial decision to make.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2777.997" stopTime="2784.719">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Well, he said it's a judicial decision that it isn't relevant. 
    If it isn't irrelevant, then it's something indictment be called for.

    Mr. Roland E. Ginsburg 
    They're calling for a lot of documents that don't have any relation to the case, that's what I'm saying.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2799.535" stopTime="2805.566">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter

    Mr. Roland E. Ginsburg 
    If they really thought about it, I don't think they would. 
    In the course of this examination, Mr. Justice Frankfurter, they couldn't even scratch the surface to six representatives out there for six or seven days. 
    There were so many thousands of documents.

    Justice Harold Burton 
    No, I don't want -- if the subpoena calls for a category of interims, generally common, relevant, then upon the enforcement duty, if you want to isolate certain particular once that you say, either are the -- not burdensome or not relevant then institutionally the formally point goes out.
speaker="roland_e_ginsburg" startTime="2876.573" stopTime="2880.582">

speaker="roland_e_ginsburg" startTime="2883.518" stopTime="2891.119">
    Mr. Roland E. Ginsburg 
    It did not rule. 
    Instead of that, the Court said, “I can't conclude that -- and at this time, that any are immaterial or irrelevant set -- ”

    What the Court said Your Honor was, “Bring them all in here.

    I can't say they are immaterial or irrelevant.”
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2902.931" stopTime="2927.778">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Well, he may be intellectually -- he may be saying something that intellectually has required evidence. 
    But as a judge, he can't say that, merely because you say, “These have nothing to do.” 
    And if the Board would be thinking about it, how can a judge, District Judge of Court of Appeals of this Court say, “The Board didn't think about it and they just harem-scarem, asked a lot of documents.” 
    How can we make such a -- how can that be a starting point?
speaker="roland_e_ginsburg" startTime="2927.778" stopTime="2930.445">
    Mr. Roland E. Ginsburg 
    Well, that is what the Court of Appeals found here, Your Honor. 
    I think --

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    But how did -- could the Court of Appeals know that it's harem-scarem?
speaker="roland_e_ginsburg" startTime="2933.614" stopTime="2937.051">
    Mr. Roland E. Ginsburg 
    Because the Court of Appeals examined the subpoenas carefully.

    And we have the issues in them. 
    They have administered of complaint and they compare the two, I think it's apparent.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2947.542" stopTime="2956.360">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    I can understand that the subpoena called for the production of the 11th Edition of the Encyclopedia Britannica because that's a particularly interesting point. 
    And the Court could say it well.

    It is.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2958.142" stopTime="2973.259">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Maybe so, but that's so esoteric to claim but you better prove it. 
    But how a Court of its own could take judicial notice, category of documents that have some relation to the business, have no relation with the complaint, they get the scriptures as far as I'm concerned.
speaker="roland_e_ginsburg" startTime="2973.259" stopTime="2995.902">
    Mr. Roland E. Ginsburg 
    The Court of Appeals said in effect, “You've asked for all the documents that these companies have.” 
    All the documents are not necessary in this proceeding. 
    I should point this out. 
    Both Courts that looked to this case felt immediately, that there should be an inspection. 
    An inspection is what this case calls for, because the categories are so broad and call for so many documents --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="2995.902" stopTime="2997.553">

    What do you mean by inspection?

    An inspection of these very same documents with the opportunity to photograph the documents, to copy the documents, to know which documents are necessary.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    I can't understand the position by you that so vast an amount of the books and documents are of concern or abstracted for a time to cancel the coming of business. 
    There should be appropriate controls, so that your business can go on while the Boards could also be going on. 
    I can understand all of that. 
    I can understand the rich of years that -- according to the Solicitor General. 
    Do you say that cut it down unless you make up with the -- I can understand all of those particulars. 
    I cannot understand how from the face of a subpoena, anybody can say it has nothing to do with the case, unless it's a clear thing, kind of the foolish things that I have put about the 11th Edition of the Encyclopedia Britannica.

    Mr. Roland E. Ginsburg 
    May I address the question to you, Mr. Justice? 
    I -- I wonder if -- when all of the vouchers and invoices of a busy company are called for, it cannot be assumed that every one of them is relevant and material to define issues in an administrative enforcement case.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="3086.351" stopTime="3125.105">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    I -- I can't answer your question. 
    I can answer a suggestion. 
    I can agree with the suggestion that all of the vouchers over a period, even though they'd be dead vouchers, the historic documents that a business may have demand, but turning to a document, that's whatever eight or three months -- three years or two years old. 
    I can understand all of those accommodations that should be made for the reasonable comment of a business and the duty of a governmental agent, all that I can apprehend and understand and sympathize with. 
    I cannot understand any aspect determination of what the categories are or not relevant?

    No, Your Honor. 
    The first hearing, I think it was around April 7th or 6th, and the inspection continued from April 7 to April 15, 1955. 
    At the conclusion, the -- the Court asked the Government, “How long would it take to inspect these documents?” 
    And they said, “We can be done by such -- by the 18th of April.” 
    In the 18th, the Government came in with affidavits without notice to us which asserted that we have not permitted a full inspection, that they have not been able to see some documents.

   Rebuttal of J. Lee Rankin

    Mr. Solicitor General.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Mr. Solicitor, would it be asking too much if at the outset you would state what -- what comments you have to make in view of the candid statement by Mr. Ginsburg as to -- articulates concession that Judge Fee's ruling, that each individual document must be justified, is not -- is not supported by him and it is rejected by him. 
    What are the effects of that on your case? 
    What do you think this Court ought to do?
speaker="j_lee_rankin" startTime="3643.137" stopTime="3677.294">
    Mr. J. Lee Rankin 
    Well, if -- the difficulty I have with that is whether he's still urging that the District Court has to examine as to the various documents individually as to relevancy or materiality or whether he concedes that the general categories, if they're generally found to be irrelevant. 
    And it seems to me that under the complaint and the nature of these documents, it can be fairly assumed that they're relevant on the face of it unless --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="3677.294" stopTime="3678.907">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    They're two different questions.
speaker="j_lee_rankin" startTime="3678.907" stopTime="3680.319">
    Mr. J. Lee Rankin 
    -- unless they come forth.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="3680.319" stopTime="3682.092">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    There are two -- two different questions.
speaker="j_lee_rankin" startTime="3682.092" stopTime="3682.794">
    Mr. J. Lee Rankin 
    Yes.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="3682.794" stopTime="3714.956">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    I thought he was very clear in saying, he does not stand, he rejects the suggestion that the individual document must be just -- the relevance of it must be justified. 
    I understood him to say explicitly, categories alone, their relevance must be contested. 
    The second part of your -- the second question that you have just indicated, namely, whether the fact that the Board asked for them presumptively makes them relevant and that he does not agree with it.
speaker="j_lee_rankin" startTime="3714.956" stopTime="3741.168">
    Mr. J. Lee Rankin 
    I would not want to urge that the fact the Board asked for them alone, but in the context of their complaint. 
    And the nature of the documents, it seems to me that there is a showing of relevancy and materiality under the motions of the Court that unless there is some showing that this particular document, affirmatively made by the respondents, could not possibly contribute anything to this lawsuit. 
    That the --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="3741.168" stopTime="3771.293">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    But you wouldn't disagree with him that he -- that you go to Court and ask for enforcement, to say class one document. 
    He may interpose the events of class one document cannot be relevant. 
    At the very nature of the complaint, they want to disclose as to the description of class one documents. 
    The class one documents of obvious error. 
    You wouldn't cut off that opportunity for the respondents.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    General, what -- what is your position in regard to the statement of Mr. Ginsburg that this gets down practically to the -- the proposition as to whether the record should come to you or you should go to the records?
speaker="j_lee_rankin" startTime="3792.945" stopTime="4042.246">
    Mr. J. Lee Rankin 
    My position on behalf of the Government is that it's not correct. 
    The Government does not ask that it be brought to them as distinguished from going to their records. 
    The only difficulty is we tried the first one. 
    And what do we get? 
    We found that they produced no tickets, not a single one out of 90,000. 
    They produced no advertising material which was requested. 
    They didn't produce the stock certificate. 
    They didn't produce the minutes of the pilots' meeting that was specifically requested. 
    They produced no records of the Great Lakes Airlines Agency, and they produced no correspondence. 
    We found correspondence in the hands of some of the Skycoach agencies that couldn't possibly but have some kind of a counterpart in these other corporations. 
    But we go out there and we spend 10 days at the Court's suggestion which is entirely reasonable to try to solve this by going out and inspect it. 
    And what do we find? 
    We just played tag with it. 
    The -- some of the records are in Attorneys Keatinge and so forth hands, others in their advertising agent's hands, and others in the hands of their accountants. 
    And then, we can't find -- those aren't produced. 
    And finally, the Court got sick of it too. 
    We -- we don't insist on behalf of the Government that you -- they've got to bring them to the post office building and the Court was trying to provide a reasonable time by staggering the production and try to have the inspection, but nothing worked, and I couldn't see why it wouldn't. 
    This is a very serious situation for these people. 
    They've got one cease-and-desist order against the Great Lakes Airlines for operating as an irregular carrier. 
    And now, this is a question of whether a whole license be revoked. 
    Now, they don't have any right to have any ownership of any kind in Nevada Aero Trades, or any of these Skycoach agencies, or any of these other operations if they're connected with some other independent airlines. 
    And Currie is what they -- they claim they're independent of Currie. 
    Although, the Board claims that they just operate altogether measure like that. 
    Now, if we can show by the tickets that after they got the cease-and-desist back there, against one agency, they proceed to operate to Currie and operate them all together, and show how they -- they transferred employees back and forth. 
    They paid them out of this pocket and out of that pocket, and how everything is operated altogether, like he's charged in the complaint and that they took control of these various companies when in -- without any approval of CAB in violation of the statute. 
    Then, no Court would hesitate if the Board finds that their licenses should be revoked in a cease-and-desist ordered against them, which is a very serious thing, because they're making lot of money of this operation. 
    No Court would hold that should not be sustained. 
    But if we have it for one week or two weeks or three weeks or some month, and the Court might say, “Well, what about the rest? 
    Did they quit today?” 
    So, I think, on the face of it, that we're entitled -- administrative agencies, I urge you, are entitled to go into these things on the presumption within reasonable limits that they're trying to protect the public interest. 
    And when you charge like they have that here's the whole scheme of a number of cards working together, that these people who put together after they got one cease-and-desist already, to operate together and defeat of the whole purpose of this Act of Congress, it's time that it'd be looked at with the idea of giving the Board a chance to prove the things necessary to establish the facts so that we won't have any trouble of the facts, and then we can apply the law to those facts.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="4042.246" stopTime="4064.707">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    What you're saying is, therefore, at least, the inference I draw from what you say is that when Judge Hall said by laying the subpoena alongside the charges in the complaint, this Court cannot say, “these are irrelevant.” 
    He's simply using a double negative to set forth an affirmative, namely they are in the negative.
