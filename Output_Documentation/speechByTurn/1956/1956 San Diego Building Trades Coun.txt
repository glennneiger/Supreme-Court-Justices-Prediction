speaker="charles_p_scully" startTime="37.100" stopTime="355.123">
    Mr. Charles P. Scully 
    -- if -- if I say if I may then, I -- I perhaps should go back to the argument that I thought we had concluded with respect to the no man's land and attempt to point out that with respect, for example, with the State of California where we have no statutory provisions. 
    We have a court coming in to apply a federal statute without any administrative procedures of any kind and with a very serious question existing as to whether or not the federal law could compel the State as part of this judicial operation in that field to apply administrative procedures. 
    And then they would apply in that field a law which is consistent neither with the state law nor with the federal law. 
    And so we submit that instead of their being a no man's land because of a declination and a refusal of the States to enter sure of a -- session agreement that it will create just the opposite result and we think the Garmon case is classic for that. 
    Namely, that the considered judgment of Congress in enacting the Taft-Hartley law and its predecessor was to have a national uniform policy in which public rights would be enforced and in which the entrée by means of private suits for injunctions would be eliminated. 
    To ensure that, they established the mean for an expert Board with extensive procedures to handle administratively what a court would neither have the -- the time nor the staff to do. 
    And in order to have a uniform national standard, it is our argument under 10 (a) that they said to the state agencies, “We will cover the field of industrial relations. 
    We invite you to participate, but we invite you to participate on conditions which will ensure that the application at the state level will be substantially identical with that at the national level.” 
    And if you do not adopt that construction of 10 (a), then as this Court has previously indicated instead of having a no man's land when the Board declines jurisdiction but at least not having a multiplicity of applications in 48 different states, you will have the exact result which occurred in the Garmon case. 
    In the Garmon case, as I stressed in the statement of facts, there was no time when the Board had presented to it, the alleged conduct going to the question of secondary boycott, but at that very same time, that conduct was presented to a trial court in San Diego. 
    Now, it's our contention that if that information had been submitted to the Board initially rather than through the Superior Court and only a representation petition having been filed with the National Board, that on the record in this case when the Board had investigated that case, they would have found that there was jurisdiction under their yardsticks based upon the secondary boycott aspect. 
    And we submit they would have found that the picketing which was peaceful in all respects was for organizational purposes and occurred only after the union representatives while at the invitation of the employer spoke to the man. 
    The man said we want to join the union. 
    The union representative then went into the employer's place of business and asked him to sign a contract. 
    There was no question of representation. 
    The question according to the union's contention on the record was his ability to pay the wage demanded. 
    And yet, in spite of the fact that the employer will not follow up on that procedure and the union then strikes, we submit that we have the intervention at the state level of injunctive relief which is aimed at conduct which is guaranteed to the union under Section 7 of the Act, namely, a pure organizational picket line. 
    But on the contrary, you have a determination by an initial trial court followed by an appellate court which specifically finds the item that there is an unfair labor practice under 8 (b) (2) of the Act. 
    The very thing that Congress thought at the national level was so complex and -- and complicated that you needed an expert Board. 
    And it's our argument accordingly that on the point which you have posed the question, that instead of the contention that there is a no man's land, that there is an area where the Board's can come in but the area has to -- the state boards can come in but they have to come in so that it will be operated in a mannequin system with the National Board.

    Justice John M. Harlan 
    As I understand your argument that you within the state courts and courts enforced (Inaudible) system or authority that they had. 
    Would that petition in other words to say the board -- the state board governed by state law and they -- or they do apply it, they can only apply it, is consistent with the federal law.
speaker="charles_p_scully" startTime="387.186" stopTime="388.071">
    Mr. Charles P. Scully 
    Well, that's why I think that --
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="388.071" stopTime="393.641">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    And therefore, it takes that set of assumption and you have no (Inaudible) in the Garmon case?
speaker="charles_p_scully" startTime="393.641" stopTime="471.823">
    Mr. Charles P. Scully 
    No, that's why I think the Garmon case is an excellent example because to -- to create, it must be consistent with the National Act whereby just (Inaudible) pleading as they did in our case, they alleged their -- the industry affecting interstate commerce, they alleged an unfair labor practice. 
    The Board never had that information to determine it with respect to the unfair labor practice. 
    You can allege facts sufficient in the State such as ours so that you can remove yourself from the application of the local law which renders the conduct legal. 
    You can fail to apply to the Board which you've been exercising. 
    The administrative remedies would have protected the conduct and by going down the middle with respect to the area where the Board declines and where the State does not have and under its basic local jurisdiction. 
    You will have the third remedy device whereby you can obtain private injunctive relief in direct violation of the underlying theory of the Labor Management Relations Act solely by failing to disclose fully to the Board, the information that it can review. 
    And so, the Board will never be in a position and contrary to the statement by this Court in the Garner case. 
    This Court in the first instance will have the primary power and duty to review and decide that determination rather than the Board.

speaker="charles_p_scully" startTime="492.310" stopTime="569.894">
    Mr. Charles P. Scully 
    That's right. 
    With respect to the second portion of your question if I understood it correctly, Mr. Justice, it appears to go to the question that the Board argues that by the mere declination of power, there is a revitalization of a reserve power in the State to take jurisdiction over the area that Congress has originally vested in the Board. 
    Our position on that contention is that when Congress exercised its legislative authority, it went to the full scope of its authority as indicated in the (Inaudible) decision that discretion with respect to permitting the occupancy by the States of the area which Congress gave to the Board, the discretion that was to be exercised was the discretion of the Board, but that it was hand hemmed in with the conditional requirements set forth in Section 10 (a) of the Act. 
    And that accordingly, the mere declination would not be sufficient. 
   
   
   
   Argument of James W. Archer
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="569.894" stopTime="572.984">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Archer.
speaker="james_w_archer" startTime="572.984" stopTime="759.698">
    Mr. James W. Archer 
    If the Court please. 
    The outset I'd like to state briefly, the issue as I view it in our case and that is simply this that may a state court enjoin concerted union activity tortious under our state law and likewise, violative of the federal laws where the Regional Director of the NLRB has conducted an investigation and declined to take jurisdiction. 
    I want to emphasize that I said that the active days of the union here were tortious under our California state law contrary to Mr. Scully's contention that they were lawful activities and I will come to that in a moment. 
    I also want to emphasize the fact that I indicated that the matter was investigated by the National Labor Relations Board by a field examiner and it is so recorded in the records in this case. 
    Perhaps, the inadvertent misstatements of Mr. Scully in respect to the activities of the unions rises out of the fact that neither he nor any person appearing on the union's brief in this Court participated in the trial of this case in the lower court or appeared in the appellate courts of California. 
    A study of the record however will indicate conclusively that the nature of the activities were unlawful under California law. 
    The plaintiff employers here are engaged in the retail lumber business at the little town of Escondido. 
    They employed eight men. 
    The representatives of the two unions and this Building Trades Council called upon them and asked them to sign a contract. 
    They were afforded an opportunity to discuss their proposals with the eight employees on two separate occasions. 
    The men did not indicate at any time a desire to join the union or any interest in it contrary to what Mr. Scully stated here a few moments ago. 
    The examination of the findings and of the opinion of the Court, the majority opinion indicate that without any uncertainty that --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="759.698" stopTime="796.745">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Archer, how did the -- how did the opinion of the Court treat that question of -- of whether it was a violation of -- of California law? 
    The reason I asked that is because the dissenting opinion on page 54 says, "Before discussing those points, it should be observed that under our law, defendant's activity is lawful and hence neither damages nor injunctive relief is proper. 
    The majority does not question this proposition. 
    The rule was stated the citation of many supporting authorities."
speaker="james_w_archer" startTime="796.745" stopTime="838.447">
    Mr. James W. Archer 
    Well, I think with due deference to Justice Carter, he is in error, Your Honor. 
    I do not believe that the majority opinion holds that this conduct is lawful wherein they cite on page 52 of the record containing the majority opinion of the Supreme Court, the end of the second paragraph commencing on that page concerted labor activities for such a purpose, thus were unlawful under the federal statute.

    Well, I --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="875.257" stopTime="882.798">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    They did because they say that they were -- it was unlawful in California because it's unlawful under -- under federal law.
speaker="james_w_archer" startTime="882.798" stopTime="1076.300">
    Mr. James W. Archer 
    With that privilege. 
    Now, what I have come to, sir, is this that in those two cases, Park-Tilford and that Lillefloren case, California recognized for the first time, although I must confess it was not too great clarity, the difference between recognition or picketing and organizational picketing. 
    In the Park-Tilford case, they dissolved a portion of an existing injunction on the ground that -- that portion of it would prohibit organizational picketing. 
    They upheld that portion of the injunction, excuse me, that supported a demand for the immediate signature of a contract holding that that was unlawful under California law long prior to it being unlawful under the Taft-Hartley amendment. 
    So California as of Park-Tilford case recognized that recognitional picketing, a demand that an employer places men in the union prior to there being any indication that the employees as such have designated the union to be their bargaining agent or a majority was unlawful and contrary to the policy of the State of California. 
    Now by strange coincidence, the Lillefloren case cited there, subsequently, the 31 California case was an opinion written by Mr. Justice Carter who wrote the dissent in this case. 
    And in that case, he dissolved then in or that he on behalf of the five other justices of our Supreme Court comprised of seven, pointed out that a demand for a closed shop would be unlawful citing at Park &amp; Tilford case. 
    And he restates that the order should have restrained only the unlawful demand for the close shot. 
    On this question of the California law on recognitional picketing as distinguished from organizational picketing, I would like to direct Your Honor's attention to a very authoritative article that has appeared in the December issue of the Stanford University Laws Journal, law review. 
    Stanford Law Review, December 1956, it was published subsequently to the printing of these briefs with its very authoritative and it draws this distinction which I am endearing to draw for you that California now recognizes a difference at least at times it recognizes a difference between recognitional picketing and organizational picketing. 
    And the Court here found that it's -- this fell in the former category as being an unlawful demand for a closed shop violative of both the federal and the state law.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1076.300" stopTime="1085.011">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Is there any other language in the opinion other than that that you read bearing upon whether it is unlawful under state law?
speaker="james_w_archer" startTime="1085.011" stopTime="1417.214">
    Mr. James W. Archer 
    No, Your Honor, there is not. 
    Unfortunately, it was not stated with more precision but it believed to be the intention of the author of the opinion and the majority that they were making that distinction but did not state it with precision. 
    The findings in this case that I started to mention when Judge Warren asked me a question to indicate contrary to Mr. Scully that the -- the fourth finding found on page 14 that said employees have indicated they do not desire to join or be represented by any of the defendants. 
    And then at the top of page 15, the Court found that the unions did not intend to induce the employees or plaintiff to join the said union or to educate them as to the advantages of benefits of unionization, so that it was strictly a recognitional picket line that confronted us. 
    Now, we sought aid of NLRB on May 7th as Mr. Scully indicated. 
    And on May 21, the field examiner advised us in writing, "On the basis of the information submitted in your letter of May 20th, it is impossible for this office to process further your petition. 
    The amount of business done by Valley Lumber Company, the name of the co-partnership of the Garmon, is insufficient for the Board to assert jurisdiction on the basis of previous Board decisions." 
    Then on May 29, after the field examiner had made his report to the Regional Director, the Regional Director, Mr. Howard F. Laverne wrote to the Valley Lumber Company at Escondido and the -- and the second paragraph of his letter reads as follow, "As a result of the investigation, it appears that in the view of the scope of the business operation involved, it would not effectuate the purposes of the National Labor Relations Act to institute further proceedings at this time. 
    And I am therefore dismissing the petition in this matter." 
    Now, I have read that to Your Honor because in the opinion of the majority at page 49, excerpts from those two letters are quoted in the opinion. 
    Unfortunately in the second quote, they omitted the language where there are some asterisks there before the close of the quote. 
    They left this language out, "And I am therefore dismissing the petition in this matter." 
    I think it is of importance in view of some of the questions that have been asked to counsel today regarding these budgetary and other considerations, administrative considerations that in our declination here, they used the language, it would not effectuate the purposes of the National Labor Relations Act to institute further proceeding. 
    So at that point, we appeal to the Court and obtain our -- our injunction. 
    Now, the -- some question was raised in the briefs as to the fact that we had -- did not ask for an unfair labor practice charge or sought that relief. 
    There is a discussion of that in the record in this case and the testimony of Mr. Waddell that he discussed that with Mr. Laverne's office on the telephone. 
    And as a result of that, he concluded not to endeavor to file one. 
    We did not take the position that the union's activities constituted an unfair labor practice. 
    Our position and our theory of the case which is spelled out in just those words, our theory is in page 199, top of that page of the record, Mr. Waddell under cross-examination by Mr. Weiland of San Diego stated the design of the complaint in the case that if we acceded to the demand of the unions, we would then be compelled to violate the Act and not that the demand itself was a violation. 
    But if we acceded to it, we were then being put in the position of -- of being in violation of law, and therefore, the demand was unlawful. 
    Now, I would like to --

    Now, I notice in your petition, on page 3, paragraph 6, that you make your recital of the misconduct and then say that because such conduct would be an interference with the collective bargaining rights secured to said employees by the National Labor Relations Act and would require the plaintiff to discharge in violation of the said National Labor Relations Act, new employees who refused or violated to join one of the said defendant unions within 30 days after their employment.
