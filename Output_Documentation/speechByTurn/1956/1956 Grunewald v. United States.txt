    Mr. John F. Davis 
    Chief Justice, if the Court please. 
    I assume the Court understands the reason I'm back up here after the time that was given this morning is that in granting certiorari in this case, the Court's order separated two questions from the others and requested they be separately argued and assigned an hour to that time of which 30 minutes is mine. 
    And therefore, these 30 minutes is, by the initial order of the Court, to be -- to be spent on what are called question seven and 11 which I've quoted at page 6 of our brief. 
    Before going into my argument, I'd like to comment on Mr. Singer's comment with respect to the instructions to the jury referring to the printed transcript. 
    He read to the Court from the top of page 748, a paragraph in which the Court said that if you find any witness has willfully testified falsely, you may disregard his entire testimony. 
    And the impression I got from the statement was that this was supposed to apply to what followed it. 
    Actually, if we turn back to the preceding page, we find that the Court had been talking about the coconspirators and their testimony. 
    They were Government witnesses. 
    Their testimony in the case and the fact that the jury had to take this -- this testimony by coconspirators who had consistently lied that they had to consider that in the determination, so I think it follows naturally from precedes rather than from what follows. 
    Question seven in the order -- as stated in the order of the Court says, does it constitute due process to subpoena a person to testify before a grand jury in an investigation of which he is a primary target and thereby, permit an examination before trial of a de facto defendant. 
    Now, on this question as stated, the state courts have split right down in the middle, we cite some of the holdings on pages 92 and 93 of -- of our brief. 
    This Court has not passed upon the issue, although Counselman against Hitchcock has been cited by counsel as barring on it, I think, it has no barring on this question. 
    The lower federal courts --

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    The decision, of course, doesn't -- I meant to look at the remarks. 
    What does Counselman and Hitchcock say by way of thought about it?

    Mr. John F. Davis 
    I -- I'm not aware that it -- I haven't checked it since it was referred to but I am not aware that it refers to the grand jury situation at all and it may, Your Honor, but -- I --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="209.375" stopTime="211.209">

    Mr. John F. Davis 
    However, there has been language in the lower federal courts and the Courts of Appeals going both ways on this issue of whether or not it is proper to call a person who is a primary target before the grand jury. 
    This -- the Second Circuit has expressed some doubt about it. 
    This -- the District of Columbia Circuit has expressed some doubt, although, those are not holdings. 
    There is a District Court case in New York the Lawn case, L-A-W-N case, in which there was a holding that it was improper.

    Primary target isn't what I would call a term of art.

    Mr. John F. Davis 
    No, it -- it is a difficult term.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Yes.

    -- and I --

    But that was the way it was put to us.
speaker="john_f_davis" startTime="277.996" stopTime="429.240">
    Mr. John F. Davis 
    [Laughs]. 
    That's right. 
    I think that the difficulty of the question is -- is partially demonstrated by the difficulty in -- in phrasing it properly. 
    On the facts that we have in this case, I would say there has been no split of authority anywhere that on the factual situation, which we have here, even though these courts which say that it is improper to call certain witnesses before the grand jury would not say that it was improper to call Mr. Halperin before the grand jury in Brooklyn. 
    We must remember that the Brooklyn grand jury has been in panel to examine into frauds in the administration of the Bureau of Internal Revenue in the Eastern District of New York. 
    This appears from the record. 
    Now, insofar as there was a primary target for this investigation, it was obviously to be found among employees of the Bureau of Internal Revenue.Halperin was a source of information with respect to such a primary target. 
    He was not himself, the final object to the investigation. 
    The conspirators themselves in talking before they went before the grand jury were in agreement that they were in no danger with respect to being indicted by the Brooklyn grand jury because none of the acts which had been disclosed took place within the jurisdiction of the Eastern District of New York. 
    And in fact, the -- the grand jury did not bring any indictment against Halperin of its New York defendants. 
    I was, for a long time, puzzled as to why -- why the grand jury in Eastern -- deprived this matter with -- brought in the Eastern District of New York. 
    And my guess is, and this is a guess, but I think it -- it may be -- may be the reason Mr. Bolich who was later indicted by the Brooklyn grand jury for -- for his own tax evasion. 
    He was a resident of -- of Long Island and I think that the -- the matter was brought in the Eastern District because actually, they were -- they were shooting for the man in the Bureau of Internal Revenue whose residence was in the Eastern District.

   Rebuttal of John F. Davis
speaker="john_f_davis" startTime="434.742" stopTime="496.276">
    Mr. John F. Davis 
    The fraud -- yes, it was. 
    The -- his fraud -- the fraud investigation covered that -- that entire area. 
    Now -- well, this is -- with this background as to the purpose of the grand jury, I think, we've got a very different question as to whether it was appropriate to call Mr. Halperin before it if -- that we have one problem if the jury is trying to discover whether a particular man as himself guilty. 
    I'm not -- I'm not sure what the answer to what is but it's a different problem when they have decided that if there is a crime, a man has done it and to call him before them for -- for investigation and where they are investigating and trying to find out whether a crime has been committed and -- and who has done it. 
    And I think --

    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Several case I suppose, a straightforward case where a man is arraigned in a murder charge and his case had entered the grand jury. 
    There's no problem about that.
speaker="john_f_davis" startTime="505.373" stopTime="506.197">
    Mr. John F. Davis 
    That -- that is right.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="506.197" stopTime="507.812">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    You accept the doctrine though?
speaker="john_f_davis" startTime="507.812" stopTime="599.902">
    Mr. John F. Davis 
    No, I don't -- excuse me, I didn't mean to say that I accepted the doctrine. 
    I'm not sure that it is inappropriate. 
    Maybe in the murder case, it would be, I don't know. 
    But I'm not sure it's inappropriate to call the man before the grand jury and give him a chance to explain even though he is the primary defendant, but I say it is a very different question from the question we have here and we have much stronger case here than we would have in that case. 
    The -- the function of the grand jury is an investigative arm of -- of the Administration of Justice is well known to this Court and I'm not going to, at this hour, go into it. 
    I will say that as recently as the Costello case, this Court has explained the -- the importance of not imposing any unnecessary limitations upon grand jury following their investigatory processes where they will. 
    I may say that it's not -- it's not at all unusual that a grand jury actually stands as a protection for a person who is accused against the -- against the accusers. 
    And it's -- by no means a -- a decision that is only in favor of the of -- in favor of the Government to say that a grand jury should have the -- the privilege of -- of carrying its inquiry where it willed and giving a man who is accused if they doesn't claim his privilege, the right of --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="599.902" stopTime="630.688">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    I don't think that argument can carry you very far Mr. Davis because I'm sure you know the first place has to be taken care of by a rule that if a man wants to appeal, he should be allowed to do so. 
    But in the second place, unless, prosecuted, they had much changed their minds or their attitudes since I knew about it, that's at firsthand, and on the whole, they refused to give people who want to go before the grand jury to prove themselves innocent, a chance to go as often as they let come.
speaker="john_f_davis" startTime="630.688" stopTime="640.398">
    Mr. John F. Davis 
    Except that the grand jury may, of course, and on occasion, does take the matter into his own hands and insist on calling someone before it for an explanation.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="640.398" stopTime="645.851">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    The grand jury is a very responsive and the rest of the prosecutors before me.

    Mr. John F. Davis 
    By enlarge, that is true but I -- I suggest to the Court that the function of a grand jury -- the independent function of a grand jury is an important function and that limitation is on -- on its activity should be imposed with -- with great care.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="662.664" stopTime="674.601">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    If the -- is the argument one of constitutionality or desirable procedure in administration of criminal justice in the federal courts which --
speaker="john_f_davis" startTime="674.601" stopTime="715.188">
    Mr. John F. Davis 
    Well, I -- I think it's phrased in terms of -- of constitutionality but that depends upon whether the Fifth Amendment can be construed to be a protection against being asked the questions rather than a protection against being required to answer questions. 
    And there are cases where they use that language. 
    The Fifth Amendment doesn't say it's improper to ask things. 
    It only says that you've got a right to refuse to answer them. 
    If -- if the Fifth Amendment should be carried further and say that it's -- it's improper to ask them, then you would have a constitutional question here.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="715.188" stopTime="721.372">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    What's even is if you don't make it a constitutional limitation, it might be made a procedure of limitation.
speaker="john_f_davis" startTime="721.372" stopTime="738.354">
    Mr. John F. Davis 
    That is right. 
    That -- that is really the -- the -- I think the crux of -- of the argument in this case but they are both elements of it. 
    I will touch for just a minute on the last question in this phrase and again, it's quoted at page 6 of our brief.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="738.354" stopTime="770.209">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well, Mr. Davis, before you get away from that, I assume that -- that the Government didn't know that this man was to be a defendant and that they called him as they would in any other witness that he did claim his privilege as he did here. 
    Would that fact -- the fact that they didn't know he was going to be a defendant make any difference in -- in whether they could use that against him as to his credibility on the trial?
speaker="john_f_davis" startTime="770.209" stopTime="783.791">
    Mr. John F. Davis 
    Well, I think -- I think not, Your Honor.

    That's right, yes.
speaker="john_f_davis" startTime="785.306" stopTime="828.488">
    Mr. John F. Davis 
    And our position with respect to that is that when he takes the stand in the trial, whatever privileges he had before, obviously, no comment can be made on it if he doesn't take the stand. 
    I mean this Court is long held. 
    You can draw no inference and you can't make any comment on a failure of a -- of a defendant to take a stand. 
    But if he takes the stand and submits his explanation of these events to the jury, then our position is that he waives his protection and can be cross-examined even though he was subpoenaed before the grand jury in any -- in any respect.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="828.488" stopTime="830.322">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Thus, your position doesn't make any difference whether you --

    That's right.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="830.454" stopTime="836.917">

speaker="john_f_davis" startTime="836.917" stopTime="842.952">
    Mr. John F. Davis 
    That would be our position, although, on the facts of this case, we would say, you didn't have to reach that point, Your Honor.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Mr. Davis, I like to put to you another -- the relations to Raffel. 
    I myself could find a difference in this case in Raffel and I could find a difference that would require me not at all to overrule Raffel, but may lead me not to extend Raffel. 
    And I want to put to you on other argument in Raffel's opinion which doesn't commended the opinions of this with terrific force. 
    Namely, the suggestion was made in that opinion that he might as well look at facts in the face that we know there is a pressure on the jury to take it into account for the fellow who doesn't take the witness stand. 
    Now, I say that that's an inadmissible piece of psychological knowledge on the part of the Court, certainly in the line of the Bruno decision in 308 in which we assert the failure to give such a charge can't be excused on the fact that oh, well, it doesn't -- it doesn't -- such jurors anyhow, they privately take it against the fellow. 
    But we can't make such psychological, the dogmatic psychological observation and rest the rule of law.
speaker="john_f_davis" startTime="1350.215" stopTime="1354.145">
    Mr. John F. Davis 
    This is Court -- it -- it's quite clear that you cannot draw any inference of guilt and --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1354.145" stopTime="1364.330">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    But not only that, but you not only can draw any inference of guilt but you must affirmatively tell the jury not to run the assumption that they would try to discipline their minds.
speaker="john_f_davis" startTime="1364.330" stopTime="1366.324">
    Mr. John F. Davis 
    That is right. 
    And that is what the --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1366.324" stopTime="1372.502">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    And in the Raffel case, the contrary assumption was made -- one of the arguments in the case.
speaker="john_f_davis" startTime="1372.502" stopTime="1396.585">
    Mr. John F. Davis 
    Yes, but I think that is -- may not be pertinent to this situation because there, the question really was whether he was under any compulsion at all to -- to say anything in the first case. 
    Here, we have no such question and he was clearly subpoenaed and he had to claim the privilege. 
    So I'm not --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1396.585" stopTime="1401.685">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Well, I'm not saying this would tell you to -- against you in this case on that suggestion.
speaker="john_f_davis" startTime="1401.685" stopTime="1402.196">
    Mr. John F. Davis 
    That's right.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1402.196" stopTime="1407.383">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    I'm trying to -- it's relevant to a consideration of how far one will take Raffel.
speaker="john_f_davis" startTime="1407.383" stopTime="1438.261">
    Mr. John F. Davis 
    It -- it really goes to the question of whether he was really under any -- whether there was any inconsistency, whether he was under any obligation when -- in the first case, whether there was any reason why he should have denied it, unless you have a feeling that the defendant in a case who doesn't take the stand is -- is docking. 
    But it doesn't seem as much as though that was an obligation. 
    And therefore, there is less inconsistency between the first position and the second position. 
    In that -- in this case, however, there's no question that he was subpoenaed. 
    And there's no question about --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1438.261" stopTime="1438.333">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Whether he --
speaker="john_f_davis" startTime="1438.333" stopTime="1440.558">
    Mr. John F. Davis 
    -- whether he had an obligation to respond.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1440.558" stopTime="1469.108">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Well, I don't know what inference you draw from that. 
    I should think it's -- it's weaker than the Raffel situation where he was the master of his own faith. 
    On the first trial, he chose not to be a witness with all the protection, with all the kind of plea of -- of safeguards that the law affords at a trial. 
    He chose not to -- not to appear as a witness in the -- in this case. 
    For those subpoenaed, he has no choice.
speaker="john_f_davis" startTime="1469.108" stopTime="1512.076">
    Mr. John F. Davis 
    That's right. 
    The question -- the basic question there is one of evidence whether or not there was really any inference. 
    But what I was really discussing with Mr. Justice Brennan is whether these positions are in affect inconsistent. 
    And I am suggesting to you that it's -- there is more inconsistency in this case than there would be in Raffel particularly. 
    If in Raffel we have to put out of our minds the -- the thought that if -- defendant should appear to defend himself or something, it will be -- it will be assumed against him because he doesn't. 
    Then, there is less inconsistency. 
    In the first case, he just didn't -- there wasn't any obligation on him to -- to appear. 
    He just didn't because he didn't think of it, if -- if you please.
