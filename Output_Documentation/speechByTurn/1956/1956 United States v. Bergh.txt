    Number 17, United States, Petitioner, versus Alfred C. Bergh et al. 
    Mr. Rosenthal.
speaker="alan_s_rosenthal" startTime="18.038" stopTime="201.885">
    Mr. Alan S. Rosenthal 
    May it please the Court. 
    This case is hereon writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Claims. 
    The single issue presented is whether a federal per diem employees and federal -- a per diem employee is one whose rate of compensation is fixed on a piece-work, daily or hourly basis, rather than on an annual basis, are entitled to an extra day's compensation as a gratuity for work on holidays during World War II which were regular workdays for all federal employees. 
    The background of this litigation comes down to this, by two presidential directives during 1943, all normally observed peace-time holidays with the exemption of Christmas were designated as regular workdays for the balance of the war in the interest of obtaining maximum output in governmental activities. 
    For the duration of the law, therefore, all federal employees, per annum workers and per diem workers alike, worked on these days just as on other days in the work week. 
    For this work, per annum employees receive no additional compensation and per diem employees receive their regular rate of pay. 
    Now, the respondent in this case, Mr. Bergh, was one of these per diem workers, an employee of the Department of the Navy at the shipyard at Portsmouth, Virginia. 
    Pursuant to the previously mentioned directives, respondent and common with all federal employees worked on New Year's Day, Washington's Birthday, Memorial Day and July 4 in the year 1945 just as on other days in the work week. 
    For this work, and we think it's important to note this, the respondent was paid his regular wages plus any overtime or night differential that he was entitled to. 
    By this action, filed some seven years after his work was performed, the respondent seeks an additional day's pay as a gratuity for working on these days which we emphasized again were regular workdays for all federal employees. 
    His claim is that while concededly the largest class of government employee, the per annum worker, was not entitled to the gratuity. 
    The class of which he is a representative, the per diem worker, is entitled to this gratuity which the General Accounting Office estimates will aggregate somewhere perhaps in the neighborhood of $750 million.

    Justice Stanley Reed 
    Well, was -- if this -- this suit, of course, was filed in time?
speaker="alan_s_rosenthal" startTime="248.998" stopTime="363.760">
    Mr. Alan S. Rosenthal 
    That's right because the respondent in this case was in the service from 1946 to 1948 and under the Soldiers and Sailors Civil Relief Act, the limitation period did not run while he was in service. 
    There's no question about this suit being tardy. 
    Now, at the very outset, we think it's important to note that the payment of a gratuity, and that's what this is, this claim, to a federal employee must have its roots in a federal statute which either expressly provides for the gratuity in the particular circumstances or in the alternative confers permissive discretion upon the employing agency to pay the gratuity. 
    Now, here, we can, at the very outset, lay aside the matter of permissive discretion. 
    It may be that under the Act of July 16, 1862, set forth in the Government's brief at page 3, conferring authority upon the Secretary of the Navy to promulgate rates of wages, it may be that under that Act, the Secretary of the Navy had the discretion to award gratuity pay to these employees for working on these days which at the time were normal wok days. 
    But the plain fact is that if he had that discretion, he did not exercise it. 
    This respondent's employment was governed by a schedule of wages. 
    The schedule of wages is explicit on the matter of its compensation for holiday work. 
    It provides that for that work, he is to receive his regular rate of pay, plus of course overtime or night differential allowances. 
    The schedule of wages provides that he is to get gratuity pay only if he is unable to work on the particular holiday, relieved or prevented from working on the holiday and thus cannot earn his normal day's pay.

speaker="alan_s_rosenthal" startTime="366.853" stopTime="383.728">
    Mr. Alan S. Rosenthal 
    It says that he can't get it then but it says that with respect to the days upon which he -- he works, he is to be allowed his regular pay plus a premium of 50% if the holiday falls without his normal work week. 
    Now, these holidays fell within this employee's normal work week.

    Justice Harold Burton 
    (Inaudible)
speaker="alan_s_rosenthal" startTime="388.102" stopTime="648.420">
    Mr. Alan S. Rosenthal 
    That's -- that's right but the -- but the -- the schedule of wages did not specifically authorize this and the respondent has not contended at any point in this case that the schedule of wages here conferred an entitlement upon the respondent to this gratuity for holiday work. 
    So that the question comes down to whether in 1943 -- or in 1945 rather, there was a mandatory statutory requirement that per diem employees were to be given a gratuity above and beyond their normal compensation for working on days which were for all federal employees regular workdays as to this matter that we now turn. 
    The history of legislation on the subject of holiday gratuity pay for per diem workers goes back to 1880. 
    Prior to that time, the per diem worker was not paid on days in which no work was performed. 
    As a consequence, when a holiday intervened and the employee was prevented from work, his paycheck was reduced accordingly. 
    This was not so to the per annum worker, his salary has traditionally been regarded as payment for everyday of the year whether a workday or not. 
    Consequently, when he was excused from work, this had no effect at all upon his paycheck.He received the same amount. 
    Now, by a Resolution of 1880, limited in its application to the Government Printing Office and the Resolution of January 6, 1885, which had general applicability to per diem employees, Congress had vested itself to this situation. 
    It allowed, by these Resolutions, certain specified days as holidays with the same pay as on other days. 
    And as the legislative history of these Resolutions show, which is set forth in 18 and 19 of the Government's brief, the single purpose of these Resolutions was to equate the position of the per diem and per annum worker that, henceforth, the occurrence of a holiday with non-occasional reduction in the per diem workers paycheck anymore than did in the per annum worker's paycheck. 
    Now, despite the fact that this was the sole purpose of this Resolution insofar as the legislative history reflects, the 1885 Resolution was administratively interpreted by the Comptroller of the of the Treasury and then by the Comptroller General as meaning that when the per diem worker worked on the holiday and thus was able to obtain his regular wages, he nevertheless was entitled to this gratuity. 
    In short, under this interpretation, the per diem employee was placed in this preferential position, the per annum worker worked in the holiday, no additional compensation, the per diem worker worked on the holiday, he got his regular wages, he got his gratuity as well. 
    Now, this situation, which as I say, resulted from his interpretation of the accounting officials of the Government lasted until the 1930s. 
    On December 7, 1937, the President issued an Executive Order closing down the Government establishment from the day before Christmas, December 24th, and excusing all employees from work. 
    Now, this Executive Order had no effect at all upon the per annum worker unless he's paid.But December 24th wasn't one of the days specified in the 1885 Resolution. 
    Accordingly, the per diem worker was excused from work and couldn't work because his establishment was closed, received no additional compensation, received no compensation, as a matter of fact, at all. 
    Accordingly, a resolution was introduced into the House of Representatives which would have had the effect of allowing compensation to those per diem workers by way of a gratuity, to those per diem workers who had been -- who had lost wages by the result of this Executive Order, in other words, who hadn't worked on December 24th. 
    There was nothing in this Resolution to the effect that if the per diem worker had worked on December 24th and thus had been able to obtain his regular wages, he was to get additional day's pay as a gratuity. 
    Now, this Resolution was referred --

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    So that he would not have been included in the practice established -- in the -- he would not have been included in the -- in the administrative construction placed by the Comptroller, the Comptroller General giving him overtime when he did work.

    That's right. 
    That's why this Resolution was necessary.

    Mr. Alan S. Rosenthal 
    No, not by the Executive at this point. 
    These were just certain specified days designated in particular legislation which is why this probably came up with respect to December 24th. 
    Now, this Resolution was referred to the House Committee on the Civil Service which was advised by the Civil Service Commission that the problem of holiday pay for per diem workers raised broader issues which should be resolved by general legislation rather than on a piecemeal basis and attached to the committee report was a detailed decision of the Comptroller General comparing the effect of holidays upon the per diem and per annum worker. 
    And this decision set forth the various preferences and discriminations which had resulted as a result of the administrative interpretation of the 1885 Resolution. 
    And one of those, which was specifically referred to, was the matter of the per diem employee under this administrative construction obtaining double pay if he worked on the holiday while the per annum worker did not receive additional compensation.

    Mr. Alan S. Rosenthal 
    Well, in connection with the matter of holiday pay, we submit that you can go right back to this 1880 legislation. 
    It all -- it carried all the way through to the present time. 
    And there's no indication that Congress in this area intended to treat the per diem worker and the per annum worker in a different fashion. 
    Now, the 1938 Resolution which grew out at this initial Resolution, specifically provides that whenever an employee is relieved or prevented from working on a holiday, either one which it declared by statued or one provided for an Executive Order, he is to receive the same pay as on other day. 
    And after this Resolution was in enacted, 1938, the Comptroller General, same official who's administrative interpretation of the 1885 Resolution is all that this respondent has as a basis for his claim. 
    The Comptroller General rule on no less than four occasions that the effect of 1938 Resolution was to supersede the administrative practice that the 1938 Resolution by its provision to Section 1 which I've just related and the provisions of Section 2 which repealed the 1885 Resolution and all other inconsistent or conflicting laws -- to the extent of the inconsistency or conflict that the 1938 Resolution eliminated this practice which he had been following by reason of his reading of the 1885 Resolution. 
    Now, between 1938, when the Comptroller General made this determination, and 1943, at least, the Comptroller General's interpretation of 1938 Resolution was accepted generally. 
    This is shown by among other things to follow.Several bills were introduced in the subsequent Congresses which would have had the effect of restoring the old practice. 
    These bills provided that the employee who worked on the holiday was to obtain double compensation. 
    In a committee consideration of these bills, it was a -- specifically directed to the Committee's attention that the Comptroller General had interpreted the 1938 Resolution. 
    As requiring gratuity pay, only worthy employee was relieved or prevented from working and thus couldn't draw his normal wages. 
    The Bureau of the Budget, the very organization which had drafted the 1938 Resolution and by the Congress that it was not in sympathy with the aims of the subsequent bills to -- which would have restored this practice, that in the words of the Bureau of the Budget, double compensation for holiday work was not consistent with the program of the President. 
    Now, not one of these bills even got out of the Committee. 
    Second, the 1940 edition of the U.S. Code prepared under the direction of the House Committee on revision of the laws expressly reflects the view of the codifiers that the 1938 Resolution repealed the 1885 Resolution at least to the extent that -- that earlier Resolution required double compensation for work performed on holidays. 
    It wasn't until 1943, at least, and maybe later, that this problem, this claim, the double compensation for holiday work arose, and then, of course, only because of this presidential directives declaring these days regular working days for all federal employees. 
    And we must stress again that what the respondent has here is no more than this administrative interpretation of the 1885 Resolution by the Comptroller General and in placing total alliance upon that administrative interpretation, he, at the same time, says that the interpretation of the Comptroller General of the 1938 Resolution has eliminated this administrative practice is all wrong. 
    And we can't pay any attention to it, whatsoever, and solely that the same interpretation which was given by the codifiers of the U.S. Code, we can't give any attention to that either. 
    The only thing that we can look to is this administrative construction of this earlier Resolution.

   Argument of Herbert S. Thatcher
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1419.962" stopTime="1421.683">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Thatcher.
speaker="herbert_s_thatcher" startTime="1421.683" stopTime="1635.813">
    Mr. Herbert S. Thatcher 
    If the Court please. 
    The 1885 Resolution of Congress, which is the basis for the respondent's claim in this case, has as this Court observed in Kelly when the matter was first before it then applied and construe it for over 40 years prior to the 1938 Resolution on which the Government relies to require a holiday allowance for per diem governmental employees, the per diem employees, roughly, the blue collar employees of the Government. 
    Now, this -- this holiday allowance has no relation to whether the individual actually worked or not. 
    It's -- it is a gratuity, as the Government claim, payable on the occurrence of the holiday. 
    If the individual happens to work on a holiday, he is to be paid at his regular compensation which was done here, straight time and of course no claim is being made for that. 
    The reason for the allowance of a holiday gratuity by the Congress had been explained somewhat by counsel for the Government in the case of where the employee does not work on the holiday, for the per diem employee who does not work on a holiday, it was to equalize him with the per annum -- per annum employee who was paid even though he did not work. 
    In the case where the employee did work on a holiday, it would to compensate him for the extra burden he was put to in giving up his -- a day usually devoted to either religious devotions or patriotic observance or recreation. 
    Now, the sole question in -- in this case is whether that 1885 Resolution on which we rely entirely has been repealed by the 1938 Resolution insofar as the 1885 Resolution does allow the holiday gratuity and has about four years prior to the 1938 Resolution. 
    The entire question has been submitted and argued twice before the Court of Claims and twice the issue has been resolved against the Government. 
    It was here in Kelly, but in Kelly, this Court decided the case on a different basis, namely, the particular contract involved there between the Government employee, the Printing Office employee and the Government. 
    Here, we have no such contract. 
    We rely solely on the 1885 statute. 
    Now, one would suppose that if Congress really intended to overturn or repeal so deeply embedded a -- in longstanding, a practice of holiday allowances, it would have done so in response to complaints or criticism of the practice or it was made of some study or consideration of the questions involved and certainly, that have -- would have used very clear and precise language in repealing that long -- low established practice. 
    Yet, exactly, the opposite is true. 
    The congressional history, as I will show shortly in little more detail, contains that solely with no complaints of criticism, no suggestions that the -- the holiday allowance to the per diem -- per diem employee was in anyway unjust or inequitable or too expensive or for any reason whatsoever should be abolished and there was no discussion of the problem in that entire history and there is no language of repeal. 
    Let us look for a minute --
speaker="stanley_reed" startTime="1635.813" stopTime="1644.409">
    Justice Stanley Reed 
    Does your interpretation leave the 1938 Resolution as meaning exactly the same thing as the 1885?
speaker="herbert_s_thatcher" startTime="1644.409" stopTime="1688.176">
    Mr. Herbert S. Thatcher 
    No, it deals -- with an entirely different subject. 
    The 1938 Resolution deals with the subject of what to do when a -- when a per diem employee is called -- loses his holiday -- is -- is not paid -- is not employed because the holiday occurs on a nonworking day, on a -- ordinarily it wouldn't work anyway like -- like a Saturday or a Sunday. 
    The 1885 Resolution has application only to various calls of work on a regular workday, which is a holiday -- which is also a holiday. 
    You see, the two statutes don't deal with those -- deal with two separate things.

    Mr. Herbert S. Thatcher 
    Yes, Your Honor.

    Mr. Herbert S. Thatcher 
    The 1938 Resolution states that the -- the Government per diem employee shall receive his holiday allowance only when -- or not only, but on the -- when working -- when he is relieved or prevented from working solely because of the occurrence of a holiday.

    Mr. Herbert S. Thatcher 
    That is correct, Your Honor.

    The Government has to show a conflict between them. 
    We say there is no conflict between them that they can be applied and construed together with no conflict except as to the matter of paying a -- of paying a per diem worker his holiday allowance when he wouldn't been called to work in any event. 
    That is what the 1938 statute deals with as we'll see by the congressional history, that is all that Congress was concerned with.

    Justice Harold Burton 
    As I understand that you -- you claimed the 1938 is partially inconsistent with the 1885? 
    It's inconsistent --

    Yes.

    That is right, Your Honor.

    Mr. Herbert S. Thatcher 
    There is no question that the claim involved.

    So it all depends on how you read Section 2 of the 1938 Act.
speaker="herbert_s_thatcher" startTime="1888.329" stopTime="1892.456">
    Mr. Herbert S. Thatcher 
    That is one part of it.

    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Right.
speaker="herbert_s_thatcher" startTime="1893.936" stopTime="1906.831">
    Mr. Herbert S. Thatcher 
    But I think if we apply the bare language even of Section 2, it is obvious that there's no outright repeal that there is a repeal only to the extent of such -- of any inconsistency, only to that extent.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    I don't know about -- don't know what the -- whether there is or isn't but the repeal is restricted if the questions got caught up with your answer, but if you restrict it to the extent of such inconsistency or conflict and therefore I have to practically consider that there is no inconsistency or conflict (Inaudible) 1885 extent and you say not on the extent of work but of the administrative -- of the administrative allowance could apply.
speaker="herbert_s_thatcher" startTime="1946.160" stopTime="1950.256">
    Mr. Herbert S. Thatcher

    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Well, would you go this far that you say that there is possibly an ambiguity and that the statue can be read as saying the Joint Resolution of 1885 is repealed and all other laws to the extent inconsistent therewith are repealed.
speaker="herbert_s_thatcher" startTime="1967.227" stopTime="1991.687">
    Mr. Herbert S. Thatcher 
    I don't see how we can by the bare language or the punctuation or -- or any other tenant of -- of statutory construction that I'm aware of. 
    If it says read literally, it certainly doesn't. 
    The phrase “to the extent” must apply to both the Joint Resolution and all other laws, it must as a matter of plain English.

    Mr. Herbert S. Thatcher 
    It's -- there would -- there would have to be other punctuation then and if you wanted to limit the -- the phrase to the extent of such inconsistency to the latter part of this -- of Section 2, I should think.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="2010.106" stopTime="2014.497">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Do you say that that reading that I suggested would have to have a comma after act?

    Mr. Herbert S. Thatcher 
    Yes, or after act.

    I could think that would have been the normal thing to do. 
    Yet, Congress did not do that and as we will see for a very good reason because it was not concerned with repealing anything that's filed in its entirety at all.

    There's no evidence in the entire legislative history that there was any intent to repeal that 1885 Act in its entirety at all.

speaker="harold_burton" startTime="2057.106" stopTime="2070.748">
    Justice Harold Burton 
    The -- the clause certainly says without punctuation, all other laws is inconsistent and therefore the other laws must -- must have any other of the 1885 law as being also in the same classification.

    Mr. Herbert S. Thatcher 
    Yes, the 1885 to the extent of any inconsistency is of course repealed.

    That is right, Your Honor. 
    As -- as I -- as I started to say a minute ago, going on beyond the language of the -- of the repeal or clause which I don't think in any normal construction can be read as an absolute repeal of the 1885 Act. 
    Certainly, Congress would have given much more perfect language so that's been intended.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2139.764" stopTime="2156.695">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Does the legislative history about, which I was skeptical a minute ago, now I'm curious, would that shed any light whether the first clause said -- suggested to the construction of Justice Harlan that any light --

    A great --

speaker="herbert_s_thatcher" startTime="2170.483" stopTime="2272.040">
    Mr. Herbert S. Thatcher 
    I think -- I think there was a great deal of light in the legislative history to show that Congress did not intend an absolute repeal. 
    And I'll come to that right now, if I may. 
    As counsel for the government stated, this whole matter of the 1938 Resolution was precipitated by a -- a very harmless thing -- the President had declared December 24th, 1937 as a holiday. 
    December 24th, 1937, is a holiday which put the per diem employee out of work for that day with no compensation whereas the per annum employee did receive compensation for that day. 
    The remedy that -- that one -- that one oversight, a Resolution was introduced by Congressman Ramspeck to give the per diem holiday to pay for that day, that day only. 
    When it got to Civil Service Commission, the Civil Service Commission send a letter over to the House Committee which is considering this particular Ramspeck Bill and suggested well it might as well appear to this whole problem of the presidentially or administratively the three holidays at one -- in one piece of legislation and therefore suggested that the -- the legislation instead of just making the one pay on a power -- for -- for purpose of per diem pay on a power of grant of pay that all presidentially declared holidays be accorded the same weight and respect to per diem holiday allowances as in respect to the per anum and that was done.

speaker="herbert_s_thatcher" startTime="2902.841" stopTime="3197.843">
    Mr. Herbert S. Thatcher 
    For over -- for -- for over 40 years prior to 1938, that was the fact in the case and there was no word raised in Congress or anywhere else that that created any particular inequity. 
    The per annum employee has other benefits. 
    Many of the benefits, we set forth some of them in our brief which the per diem employee does not. 
    He doesn't have the hazards of employment principle that the per diem blue collar worker does. 
    He doesn't work when it rains. 
    He -- he works half day sometimes. 
    His job stopped when the work is ended, when the picker's job is unresolved, sort of differences between the two classes testifying a difference in that particular respect. 
    And as I said, no complaint ever was made or no objection raised because of that differential between per annum and governmental. 
    But getting back to this legislative history for just a minute, as I said before there is no mention of whatsoever in that legislative history in the report or in any discussion on the floor that anyone was complaining on the side that they're making any objection to this practice of paying a per diem employee a holiday allowance in addition to his regular work when he did work on -- actually work on a holiday. 
    There is not a word of complaint about that practice which the Government claims has been repealed and which Congress intended to repeal in 1938, not a word on it. 
    The only word that -- a complaint that we do find is in respect to this business of calling or -- or paying a per diem employee for a holiday -- on a holiday when he wasn't called to work, when he wouldn't been -- been called to work in any event because that was a Saturday or a Sunday or some other day of nonworking day. 
    There was a complaint about that in the -- in a letter written by the Comptroller or in a -- in a letter written by the Comptroller which was given to the House Committee. 
    But that is the only practice of which there was any complaint at all. 
    Now, it doesn't seem -- it doesn't seem reasonable that Congress would actually had intended -- actually had or was intending to repeal all aspects of holiday pay as contended for by the Government except the single situation of where an employee is prevented from working solely because of the occurrence of the holiday without some discussions in Congress or complaints being made or -- or objection was being made for the other practices without a little more of studies and was given to that problem and certainly without very express and explicit language to that effect but the manner on which -- which the Government reads the 1938 Resolution would incorporate the word "only" into that Resolution. 
    In other words, that a holiday allowance is payable only in as one situation covered by the 1938 Resolution, yet the word "only" that it nowhere -- does not anywhere appear in the 1938 Resolution. 
    In other words, if Congress actually intended to repeal that 40 years practice of paying a per diem employee, a holiday allowance and a holiday work, it could very easily have done so by expressed clear language yet such language is utterly liking in -- in the 1938 Resolution and even repeal or cause doesn't repeal the 1885 law in so many words. 
    I've mentioned the analogies that would -- results where the -- where the Government's contentions followed here. 
    One final point, the Government argues that the 1938 Resolution should be considered -- considered in the light of the fact that in 1943, the President had said that federal employees work on all of the holidays except Christmas. 
    Well, I don't -- I don't see what possible relevance -- what the President did in 1943, five years after the 1938 Resolution was before Congress, can have in throwing light of the -- the intent of Congress was five years earlier. 
    It has, to my mind, absolutely nothing to do with this case which -- to which we're trying to file what the intent of Congress was in 1938.In the wartime, policies in 1943 or 1945, in six or seven years later, have no relevance or give us no help at all on that question. 
    As a matter of fact, the -- the wartime policy resolution of the President did not say the employee should not be paid whatever he was actually should be given. 
    I merely said that the holidays was to be considered a working day. 
    And as stated by the court below, if the Government required the assistance of the per diem employees, it should pay up the rate set forth by the statutes, just as in private industry, employees were paid premium pays or paid for work on holidays even during the wartime.

    Mr. Herbert S. Thatcher 
    None, for the reason that, if you will read it, it's based solely on the assumption that the 1938 Resolution operated to repeal the 1885 in its entirety. 
    And we say that that subject construction simply cannot hold out. 
    In other words, the Comptroller General's interpretation -- there's just one interpretation on it, it was predicated on that assumption that the 1885 was repealed.

   Rebuttal of Alan S. Rosenthal

    Mr. Alan S. Rosenthal 
    May it please the Court. 
    First of all, with respect to the manner of the legislative history and it's bearing upon whether Congress intended to repeal in its entirety the 1885 Resolution, it's interesting to note that immediately following the text of the Resolution in the legislative history in the Committee Report, it has stated that Section 2 proposes to repeal the Joint Resolution of 1885, not in part just opposes to repeal. 
    Now, with respect to the terms --

    Mr. Alan S. Rosenthal 
    We think, Your Honor, in this area --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="3343.070" stopTime="3352.749">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    I mean, if it makes -- if it makes no -- I mean, to believe that that is not the descriptive of Section 2, what you've read, isn't it?
speaker="alan_s_rosenthal" startTime="3352.749" stopTime="3355.555">
    Mr. Alan S. Rosenthal 
    Your Honor, we think that it is descriptive of Section 2.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="3355.555" stopTime="3358.285">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    But it leaves out the second half of it authentically.
speaker="alan_s_rosenthal" startTime="3358.285" stopTime="3592.048">
    Mr. Alan S. Rosenthal 
    Well, because we think that the Congress intended to bar Section 2 to its references to the -- to the extent of such conflict or inconsistency actually related to all other laws inconsistency -- inconsistent or in conflict. 
    Now, certainly, there is at least an inconsistency between these two statutes. 
    The 1885 Resolution, as interpreted administratively, required double compensation that the employee worked on a holiday. 
    The 1938 Resolution, in terms, requires gratuity pay, only if the employee is relieved or prevented from working on the holiday. 
    Now, with respect to the -- the matter of the Kelly case, we see absolutely no inconsistency between our position here and the course holding in Kelly. 
    We have never suggested that the 1938 Resolution constituted an absolute bar against contracts providing for gratuity pay. 
    Indeed, at the very outset of my argument, I attempted to make it clear that our position is, that there must be either a statute creating a permissive discretion upon the agency which there was in the -- in the Kelly case. 
    It was the statute of 1924 which gave authority to the public printer to enter into these contracts, or else, there must be a statute which actually requires it. 
    Now, in this case, there's no aspect to permissive discretion at all, but this claim is based upon as a must-be upon our being a statute granting absolute entitlement to it. 
    Now, we again call this Court's attention to the fact that after the 1938 Resolution was enacted, it was uniformly construed until this wartime situation arose as eliminating this practice. 
    It was construed by the same official, the Comptroller General, who had set out this administrative practice which forms the sole basis for the respondents' claim. 
    Now, with respect to the absurdity of paying a man the same amount whether he works or whether he doesn't work, as was pointed out by the Court, this is a situation as pertained with the per annum worker and until 1945 Congress did not see that to make any change. 
    Additionally, all of these special statutes, which was set forth in our brief, which related to a date not included in the 1885 Resolution, these were statutes which were enacted before 1938, each of them provided in terms that the employee who was relieved from working was to get gratuity pay. 
    None of them applied to the employee who had worked on that specific day. 
    So, there, the Congress itself, apparently recognized the -- that there was no inherent absurdity in paying a man the same amount whether he worked or whether he doesn't -- he didn't. 
    Now, since -- of course, 1945, both per annum and the -- the per diem worker obtained additional compensation for holidays. 
    But if you will trace the -- this legislation, in its subject of holiday pay from its very beginning to carry it through to today, there has -- there isn't a shred of evidence in any of the legislative history or in the terms of these bills to indicate that Congress intended to create this preference for the per diem worker, the preference arose by virtue of this administrative construction of the 1885 Resolution. 
    The Congress in 1938 has its attention called to that Resolution and to these preferences and discriminations that arose thereunder. 
    And then, they came forth with this 1938 Resolution which provides that gratuity pay when the employee is relieved or prevented from working on that day. 
    And then in Section 2 they say to the extent, inconsistent or in conflict, the 1885 Resolution rather and all other resolutions are hereby repealed. 
    And we think that the -- if the Court pleases, that for these reasons that the judgment below should be reversed.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="3592.048" stopTime="3597.463">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Did I understand you to say that under Kelly case here is an explicit statutory authorization to make such an agreement?
speaker="alan_s_rosenthal" startTime="3597.463" stopTime="3624.627">
    Mr. Alan S. Rosenthal 
    No there was a -- there's a contract of -- the Government in the Kelly case took the -- did not contest that the Act of 1924 which is in, I think, 44 U.S.C. 40, that's the statute relating to the setting of wages for employees of the Government Printing Office that that statute conferred upon the public printer, the authority, if he felt it necessary.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="3624.627" stopTime="3628.472">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    But isn't there a similar statute right in every executive ordinance?
speaker="alan_s_rosenthal" startTime="3628.472" stopTime="3645.277">
    Mr. Alan S. Rosenthal 
    Well, the Navy, of course, has a similar statute, the Act of 1862. 
    Now, the Secretary of the Navy, in setting forth the terms and conditions of this response employment did not see fit to make provisions in the exercise of his discretion for gratuity pay.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="3645.277" stopTime="3658.156">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    And even when you haven't got any -- that kind of a little statue practically every executive agency of the Government as by practice follow the fixed -- fixed rate.

    Mr. Alan S. Rosenthal 
    That's right, but that's quite true.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    And if that's true -- if that is true, then, it is open to every executive press to get from under the Act the Resolution of 1938 by what we call "contract."

    Mr. Alan S. Rosenthal 
    No. 
    Well, the Resolution (Voice Overlap) -- it's the -- yes, the Resolution isn't a -- a prohibition. 
    It's just that the Resolution moved the requirement of paying this double pay. 
    Now, very few agencies have seen the necessity and again if you compare the terms of this respondent's employment with those of his private counterparts, you'll find that in the absence of this gratuity pay, that pay compares very favorably and of course that's the object of the -- the Department of the Navy to see what that -- there was a moral -- like rough equivalent between the pay of these employees, per diem employees and those -- the pay of his private counterparts.
