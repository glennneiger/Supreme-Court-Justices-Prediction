Guss v. Utah Labor Relations Board

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Number 280, P.S. Guss, Doing Business as Photo Sounds Products Manufacturing Company, Appellant, versus Utah Labor Relations Board. 
    Mr. Billings.
speaker="peter_w_billings" startTime="16.785" stopTime="199.374">
    Mr. Peter W. Billings 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    I believe that perhaps this, the third of these three cases, brings in clearest focus the issue which has tied the three together. 
    That is the question of whether 10 (a) provides the exclusive manner in which States may attempt to regulate unfair labor practices as defined in the Act when they affect interstate commerce. 
    In this case, the appellant is engaged in the manufacture of special photographic equipment for the Air Force. 
    I -- I think he most ably fits this definition of a borderline industry so far as interstate commerce is concerned as used in the statutory history of Section 10 (a). 
    The total amount of these three contracts was around $150,000. 
    He purchased about $50,000 worth of materials from outside of the State and delivered the finished special equipment to the Air Force to bases both inside the State of Utah and in other Air Force bases throughout the United States. 
    He had his employee according to the ballot conducted by the NLRB, 26 employees. 
    Soon after he started performance of these, the three contracts, the Steelworkers Union filed a petition with the National Labor Relations Board for certification of the steelworkers as the bargaining representative for his employees. 
    And the day that the hearing was set on such petition, the union and Mr. Guss entered into an agreement for a consent election to be conducted by the NLRB. 
    That was -- and that election was conducted in May of 1954 and the Steelworkers Union prevailed by a vote of 15 to -- 25 to 11 and the union was duly certified by the National Board. 
    Very shortly after, within a week after that certification was issued, the union filed with the National Board a complaint alleging unfair labor practices, both in the conduct of the election in the alleging discriminatory discharges of some of these employees and a refusal to bargain. 
    And thereupon, the National Board conducted an investigation of these charges between that day and July of 1954. 
    In other words, just over a couple of months. 
    On July 1st and July 15th of 1954, the Board came down with its new jurisdictional yardsticks under terms of which the appellant here clearly fall without.

    Yes, Your Honor, they have not been changed except as in case -- by case determination. 
    They may have been expended.

    They are general -- they are general persons.
speaker="peter_w_billings" startTime="216.212" stopTime="663.592">
    Mr. Peter W. Billings 
    That's right. 
    And so on July 21st, 1954, the regional director of the National Board advised the union that he would not process their -- further their complaint on the ground that it would not effectuate the policies of the Act for the National Board to do so. 
    The -- thereupon, without any appeal to the National Board as the letter of declination invited, the union filed almost exactly the same charge with the Utah Labor Relations Board. 
    And within a few months, the -- the Utah Board held a hearing and made the determinations from which this appeal was taken. 
    The Utah Board is set up under the Utah Act which is -- which might be characterized as a little Wagner Act. 
    It was passed in 1937 shortly after the Wagner Act was passed by the National Congress and was patterned on it. 
    Instead of talking about interstate commerce or affecting interstate commerce as the National Act did, it uses the words intrastate commerce and the orderly operation of industry and is ministered by a Board similar to the National Board. 
    However, in 1947, it was again amended to add certain unfair labor practices of employer -- of employees as well as employers, but it was not amended to conform to the Taft-Hartley Act which was passed in the same year and it has not been since amended, so that everyone here concerned in this case concedes that the Utah statute does not meet the requirements of Section 10 (a), that it -- it does not have consistent corresponding provisions to the National Act. 
    Some of the particular differences which might be pointed out are that the Utah Act has no provision for the filing of non-Communist affidavits by union officers and by the filing of financial reports by unions. 
    It does not provide for the 60-day cooling-off period for the respective strikes and it has different standards for the determination of a bargaining unit in the first place, so there are real and substantial differences in the Act. 
    We raised the issue of the power of the State Board to issue any order in this action at the commencement of the hearing and throughout that hearing and appeal under the state statutory procedure to the Utah Supreme Court raising the same issues. 
    And that was the only issue passed upon by the Utah Supreme Court. 
    The Utah court affirmed the decision of the State Board that it had jurisdiction on the basis that there was intrastate as well as interstate commerce involved. 
    Relying on the decision of the California court in the Garmon case which came out only a few weeks before this case was decided and arguing that unless it did so, this so-called “no man's land” would prevail. 
    Now, I think that this case I have here has these distinctions from the two which we have heard before. 
    One, and I think perhaps the most important that here, there is a state board and a state statute involved rather than a state court. 
    Secondly, the National Board actually asserted jurisdiction in the proceedings and then within -- within two months after that, declined to exercise jurisdiction over unclaimed unfair labor practices arriving -- rising out -- out of the very election which the National Board had conducted. 
    And thirdly, different from the other two, is an employer here who is raising the issue, point being that the sword of exclusiveness of 10 (a) cuts both ways. 
    We join with counsel for the unions in the two preceding cases in our position that based on the express language of 10 (a) based on its legislative history, it provides the only, the exclusive manner in which the States may act in matters affecting interstate commerce where there are parallel provisions between state and federal law, and this is certainly one of those. 
    We have the same pattern in our statute as is in the national statute for the certification of a union for election to be conducted by a Board and for a Board to hear charges of unfair labor practices of both employees and employers. 
    But aside from that same general framework as I have pointed out, there are -- are real and substantial differences. 
    And of course, one of the most important from the standpoint of an employer and his employees who may be members of the union which is seeking to organize his employees is a question of -- of Sections 9 (f) and (g) of the National Act which require the union before it can avail itself of the National Board to file the non-Communist affidavit of its officers and the provisions which require the union officers to file financial statements. 
    Those protections are not given in the Utah Act. 
    So that if the Utah Act is applied, certainly, this employer and his employees are deprived of rights given to them under the National Act. 
    Therefore, if the Board can do as it attempted to do in this case and merely by declining to act, place jurisdiction in the State Board, it can do that which Congress said it couldn't do and that is make an employer who's been as affects interstate commerce subject to statutes which are different from the national.

    Mr. Peter W. Billings 
    As I read Section 10 (a), Your Honor, it says in any cases and then it sets down at the -- in those cases, the state statute must have corresponding provisions not inconsistent with the federal statute, and I would think it would have to do it by general categories and not on a case-by-case basis.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="694.267" stopTime="707.184">
    Justice Hugo L. Black

speaker="peter_w_billings" startTime="707.184" stopTime="736.038">
    Mr. Peter W. Billings 
    I would say that we did it on the basis of their jurisdictional yardsticks which are general rule. 
    They were published, as I said, a week or 10 days before the letter of the Board declining to act. 
    The letter of the Board does not expressly incorporate the yardsticks but I was informed by counsel for the Board that that was what they meant when they said in their letter, “Will not effectuate the purposes of the Act.” 
    That was the language they used.

    And I -- and I'm really seeking to emphasize that point by pointing out the situation in this case where under the doctrine of the Arkansas Oak Flooring case decided this last term by this Court, the National Act applies to this situation even though the Board may not act for reasons of its own or for reasons set forth in the Act. 
    Still, the National Act applies. 
    And I understand that's the issue which the National Board raised in its brief which Mr. Justice Harlan inquired about. 
    I think --

    Mr. Peter W. Billings 
    Well, yes.It was not raised down there, surely. 
    But I think the -- the issue is -- is there because how can a state board which is a creature of state statute and which is authorized only to enforce state law, how can it here apply national law? 
    It has no authority.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="917.838" stopTime="925.868">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    (Voice Overlap) -- that was a problem of the defendants, not quite in that form but that would be essentially, this difficulty that the defendants had in the San Diego case.

    Mr. Peter W. Billings 
    Yes, Your Honor. 
    And I think that's what makes my case all the stronger than the San Diego case. 
    I can see a state court enforcing a law -- a federal law. 
    It does it all the time. 
    Now, a -- a labor law maybe a little more peculiar as Mr. Justice Frankfurter pointed out in the -- in the -- a state court's ability to -- to formulate. 
    But certainly, a state court can do that but I don't -- my point is that a state board, a creature of state statute with jurisdiction limited to that statute can't enforce a -- a National Act and the National Act is the one that clearly applies here.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="966.290" stopTime="994.679">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    I wouldn't believe that's -- or just about that because I think conceivable that a state may -- a state may have an administrative agency, the purpose of accepting the cases that should be allowed to be brought in the state court under the FELA, and I see no difficulty of that. 
    There may be (Inaudible) whereby the state agency might determine whether or not this comes within the Federal Employee Liability Act.
speaker="peter_w_billings" startTime="994.679" stopTime="1049.277">
    Mr. Peter W. Billings 
    Well, I think -- I'm not saying constitutionally, that could not be done. 
    I'm saying though that a state board which has its power limited in this -- as it is here to enforcing a state act couldn't very well do that unless the state legislature said it could. 
    That's my point, Your Honor. 
    And I think that the -- the only other thing I think that need be said in this case is the -- with respect to this so-called “no man's land” that seems to worry everyone is that that is within what Congress felt its policy, what it was to be. 
    That is that the National Act was to apply, the national policy was to apply. 
    If the states wanted to enforce it, that policy in situations where the National Board for some reasons of budgetary faults, they did not choose to act. 
    The states could do so if they subscribe to the National Act by enforcing -- by enacting statutes like the National Act.

   Argument of E. R. Callister
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1096.823" stopTime="1099.350">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Attorney General Callister.
speaker="e_r_callister" startTime="1099.350" stopTime="1415.761">
    Mr. E. R. Callister 
    Chief Justice, Honorable Court. 
    I agree with my opponent -- opposing counsel here that this case is a little different in the two previously presented. 
    Here in this case, we have a specific refusal by the -- the National Board to proceed. 
    We have an action by a state board which is fully consistent with the Federal Act. 
    And thirdly, we have a comprehensive labor relations statute in Utah which almost does not exactly correspond with the National Act. 
    It does provide at least a guarantee of the basic rights provided in Section 7 and 8 and certainly, was consistent with the National Act in the instant case. 
    In that regard, I'd like to read if I may from the decision of the Utah Supreme Court. 
    It stated, “In the present case, there are no allegations that either party was deprived of rights which it might have obtained under the federal law had the NLRB heard the charges presented to it. 
    There are in fact, no intimations that the National Board would have disposed of the matter in a way other than which the State Board did. 
    No subsidy conflicts between the provisions of the Taft-Hartley Act concerning unfair labor practices and the Utah Code have been alleged nor do any appear with reference to the particular charges involved here. 
    Since we discovered no conflict with federal authority in this case and since the values of immediate legal supervision of labor and controversies within this company can only be maintained through state action. 
    We hold that the Utah State Labor Relations Board had jurisdiction in this matter and affirmed its decision in order.” 
    Now, it seems from listening to the arguments that have gone on today relating to this question that there's a particular concern about Section 10 (a) of the federal act as to whether or not that prevents the National Board from declining jurisdiction in particular cases. 
    I think we have to start out with the proposition that there's a presumption in favor of state jurisdiction in the absence of something expressly to the contrary in the federal act or in the federal decisions. 
    Assuming that presumption, then I think we can turn to cases such as the Welch versus New Hampshire, Northwest Telephone versus Nebraska, Missouri Railway versus Larabee. 
    In those cases, there you had a federal law, another federal administrative body, empowered and directed in some cases to institute rules of procedure and so forth. 
    However, in these cases, the federal administrative body did not take affirmative action in -- at the time these cases arose in designating the various rights or rules and so forth. 
    And it was held in all of those cases that where the Federal Government has created administrative bodies which could take care of these matters by regulation or otherwise but have not, then the State's jurisdiction applied. 
    As you recall in the Welch case, that involved the Interstate Commerce Commission which was authorized to promulgate rules relating to the length of hours which a truck driver might drive. 
    New Hampshire had a state law but I think allowing him to drive for 12 hours, and the ICC came along with the regulation for eight hours. 
    But before that went into effect, the Court held that the state laws applied. 
    Now, it concerns me about this “no man's land” as they termed it because of the economic impact, I think that a decision as advocated by my opponent would follow. 
    As pointed out in the amicus curiae brief of the State of New York, over 90% of the businesses in the United States have less than 20 employees. 
    As a consequence, it would be an almost impossible task, I believe, for the National Board with its limited resources and personnel to handle each and every case that might arise in this field. 
    The proper place for it, I think, is with the State. 
    And certainly, the mere fact that the state law might differ from the National Act is no argument against to permitting them to act when the Federal Government declines to act because I think some regulation is better than none at all. 
    If our adversaries are correct, you're going to have a law of the jungle when it -- it applies to these “no man land” cases. 
    The Federal Government won't act and the State can't act.

    In other aspects, the Utah Act does not conform to the National Act.

    And they say it should be noted here that the Board has been unable, unable, unable because of the prescribed condition to consummate any such agreements. 
    I -- I -- that's a little (Inaudible) I must understand because the provision is not as you indicated that the state law must be consistent where that the State must have -- in other words, Section 10 (a), the -- with an implication of an incitement to get the States to pass little Wagner Act.

    Mr. E. R. Callister 
    Right. 
    But it's our contention that 10 (a) does not apply to these cases where you have a declination by the Board of jurisdiction. 
    As I pointed out in the Welch case, there you had a Board empowered to act but it hadn't acted as yet, so the Court let the State take jurisdiction enforce its laws. 
    And it seems to me here where you have a Board who -- which is empowered to act and it declines to act, I think that's a much stronger case than when it -- it just hasn't gotten around to acting as yet.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1709.911" stopTime="1727.469">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    They haven't gotten around to where they must but aren't there seven cases?

    Mr. E. R. Callister

speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="1809.289" stopTime="1835.261">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Stated another way, your position, isn't it, that Congress authorized States to exercise jurisdiction in these labor cases affecting commerce if a formal session was made?Congress did that. 
    But that -- in addition to that, you want us to construe the act as meaning that the Board by declining to exercise jurisdiction in other and different cases can give the states jurisdiction.
speaker="e_r_callister" startTime="1835.261" stopTime="1837.562">
    Mr. E. R. Callister 
    That is correct, Your Honor.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    And you rest -- and you rest that, I take it, or so you take that view. 
    You rest that in part on the authority of -- on the provision of the statute, I forgot what section it is, that the Board can make rules or regulations to effectuate the purposes. 
    And one of the purposes of the Act is to be able efficiently to carry it out. 
    And the Board has ruled that then they carry it out efficiently to answer to all discrepancies.
speaker="e_r_callister" startTime="1863.958" stopTime="1868.034">
    Mr. E. R. Callister 
    Well, I also -- pardon me, Your Honor. 
    I also based it upon this too.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="1868.034" stopTime="1876.428">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Have you made those arguments? 
    They are pretty good. 
    [Laughter] It's not -- be good enough but they're pretty good.
speaker="e_r_callister" startTime="1876.428" stopTime="1951.353">
    Mr. E. R. Callister 
    But further than that, I think by reading the language of Section 10 (a), you can also reach the conclusion that Congress didn't intend to prohibit the National Board from declining jurisdiction in such cases. 
    The word “empowered” is used throughout that section. 
    The Board is empowered to prevent unfair labor practices. 
    It is empowered to enter into the session agreements. 
    The word “direct” is not used. 
    Now another thing, at the time -- well, since the inception of our Labor Relations Act in 1935 and subsequent, the Board has consistently declined to exercise jurisdiction in -- in certain cases, the small cases in which they felt that no substantial interest as far as commerce was concerned was affected. 
    They've done that continuously and it's true that at the outset, they did it on a case-to-case basis. 
    Now, this Court, in the Bethlehem case, certainly was aware that there was this particular type of the case where the Board had declined to exercise jurisdiction for budgetary or other reasons.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="1951.353" stopTime="1955.379">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    I presume Congress was aware of it because they were so aware of the Bethlehem case.
speaker="e_r_callister" startTime="1955.379" stopTime="1955.617">
    Mr. E. R. Callister 
    That's correct.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="1955.617" stopTime="1959.405">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    They amended it to grant -- state jurisdiction that there was assessment.
speaker="e_r_callister" startTime="1959.405" stopTime="1962.023">
    Mr. E. R. Callister 
    That's what I'm getting to, Your Honor. 
    So it --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="1962.023" stopTime="1963.727">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    But they didn't do the other?
speaker="e_r_callister" startTime="1963.727" stopTime="2102.665">
    Mr. E. R. Callister 
    Well, I don't think they had to. 
    Here is the situation. 
    You have -- you had two distinct matters under consideration there in the Bethlehem case in my opinion. 
    You have the case that was before you at that time regarding the -- the certifying of the foremen's union. 
    And there it was held that the Board's declination of jurisdiction in that particular field was because its declination was in the nature of a decision and then you reserved the question of declination for budgetary reasons. 
    Now, Congress had that decision before it when it enacted 10 (a). 
    Now, I think if you read that act, it says, “Provided that the Board is empowered by agreement with any agency of any State or territory to cede such agency jurisdiction over any cases in any industry.” 
    Now, they are speaking more than just to these cases that were declined because of budgetary reasons. 
    Under the language of this proviso, the Board concedes its jurisdiction to a state agency on any case regardless of the effect that the particular case might have on interstate commerce. 
    There's no restriction here except for these limited few such as mining, manufacturing and so forth where they say there that they can only cede jurisdiction when it's predominantly of a local character. 
    Now, in my opinion, that exception that is put in here relating to mining and manufacturing and transportation and so forth indicates, at least to me, that the intent of Congress was not to be regulating or doing away with the powers of the States to act where the Board had declined jurisdiction but on the contrary. 
    It seems to me it's a recognition of them. 
    Here, they're granting to the States, providing the States, don't have inconsistent laws and so forth. 
    They're providing here that they concede their jurisdiction in any case. 
    Now, I also believe that -- that this 10 (a) provision has given the interpretation advocated by -- by --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2102.665" stopTime="2112.580">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Do you consider, General, that the -- the report of the committee that was quoted by counsel is consistent with that?

    Mr. E. R. Callister 
    Yes, I do, Your Honor.

    Well --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2115.343" stopTime="2116.568">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    -- would you mind elaborating?
speaker="e_r_callister" startTime="2116.568" stopTime="2170.602">
    Mr. E. R. Callister 
    Yes. 
    I'll have to confess that as far as the legislative history of this particular provision is concerned, it's very unsatisfactory I think from both sides. 
    But under that quoted committee report, it was referred to in the case previously. 
    It spoke of borderline cases that this was designed to take care of borderline cases. 
    I don't -- can't tell from the legislative history or from that excerpt that borderline cases met the small cases that -- cases that were declined because of budgetary reasons. 
    A borderline case is a case not -- not like you had in the Bethlehem case. 
    A borderline case doesn't mean its borderline because the amount is particularly smaller, it falls below the standards or because the Board has declined jurisdiction for budgetary reasons.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2170.602" stopTime="2174.910">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    But when they once fix the limits, they're not borderline anymore, are they?
speaker="e_r_callister" startTime="2174.910" stopTime="2200.294">
    Mr. E. R. Callister 
    That's right, Your Honor. 
    And at the time, I'd say the Section 10 (a) was written into it, the Board had consistently up to that time declined jurisdiction for budgetary reasons. 
    At that time, it was on a case-to-case basis however. 
    Another point I would like to make is that --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="2200.294" stopTime="2205.353">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Do you know whether the Board asked the Congress to change this or not or just going to the Court?

    Mr. E. R. Callister 
    I don't know that, Your Honor, whether they've asked for a change in this or not.

    Mr. E. R. Callister 
    Well, there have been several amendments proposed. 
    I'm aware of that, Your Honor. 
    But as to whether or not the Board has requested a change, I'm afraid I just don't know if that isn't --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2224.361" stopTime="2231.308">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    It just seems frequent to be more a popular, so that is amplified due to fighting this to the Congress.

    Mr. E. R. Callister 
    [Laughs] 
    I'll agree with you there. 
    Now, 10 (a), as I was going to state, had given the interpretation advocated by the adversary. 
    It would rule out, in my judgment, state court action. 
    And I just can't conceive that Congress would intend to rule out state court action. 
    In it -- just as much as I cannot conceive that Congress intended that their biggest area where no law would apply at all, state or federal.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2265.549" stopTime="2274.719">

    Well, my difficulty with that is, if I understand it correctly, it is not unusual for at least the local regional officers to refuse to take a case, let's say, in the construction industry only because the particular employer or the particular controversy doesn't appeal relevant to other matters pending before that office, he -- like the kind of controversy that that office wants to give its time to investigate. 
    And that apparently is without regard for whether or not a particular industry involved like the construction industry, may be one where it would be wise for the Board to resolve all controversies.

    No, no. 
    I don't think you're wrong about that, but I do think this. 
    What we have here, if -- if the State Boards or the state courts can't act -- first of all, you have to determine whether or not the Board can decline jurisdiction.

    Mr. E. R. Callister 
    Well, I think under -- I like to say, first of all, you have to determine whether or not the National Board can decline to exercises its jurisdiction. 
    And that I think it can by the very wording of the statute and I think this Court, inferentially at least in the Denver Building Trades case, came to that conclusion. 
    So, once establishing that the Board can decline jurisdiction for this budgetary reasons then if the state court or the State Boards can't act, then there's no law that would apply. 
    And I can't believe that that's consistent with the national policy as set forth in the Act or stated by Congress.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="2556.235" stopTime="2561.737">

    Mr. E. R. Callister 
    Well, there we come to another reason why I think that Congress didn't intend to apply to this -- Section 10 (a) to these situations because Congress certainly, we ask to be charged with the knowledge of what has been happening. 
    And if they felt that this National Board had to act in every one of these cases, certainly, the appropriations for the National Board and the personnel would have been enlarged.

    Mr. Peter W. Billings 
    -- I wanted to refer to two questions. 
    One that Mr. Chief Justice asked with respect to the statutory history. 
    And Mr. Callister said that he didn't think they were talking about when they said borderline industries, talking about borderline so far as interstate commerce is concerned. 
    Now, I wanted to refer the Court to the report of both the Senate majority and minority on this provision because that is where this provision originated. 
    It was in the Senate. 
    The Senate majority report said the --

    Could I trouble you of where you're reading from.

    Mr. Peter W. Billings 
    Yes, Your Honor. 
    The -- right at the bottom of page 27. 
    A proviso which has been added to this subsection permits the National Board to allow State Labor Relations Boards to take final jurisdiction of cases in borderline industries, for instances, borderline insofar as interstate commerce is concerned. 
    Then in the minority report, and this is on page 28 of my brief, they say Section 10 (a) adds a proviso to the present Act empowering the Board to concede to any agency of any State or territory jurisdiction over any cases not predominantly national in character. 
    So I think it's very clear from both the majority and the minority that this borderline area where this case falls is the type of case they are talking about when they passed 10 (a), that they wanted, perhaps, the States to act that they wanted the States to adopt a policy similar to that of the National Act.

    Mr. Peter W. Billings 
    Yes, Your Honor.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Do you happen to know how many -- whether in District Courts, there have been -- how many cases do you know have come up or they would be the Court of Appeals initiative. 
    How many cases have arisen which it's not by way of mandamus but somebody says here, your yardstick doesn't apply to the new laws of -- applied it under them? 
    Is the litigation -- is the litigation seemed to be flourishing if there was a (Inaudible) body of cases?

    Mr. Peter W. Billings 
    I would guess there would be. 
    I haven't seen any statistics of it, Your Honor.

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Mr. Billings, do you suppose that -- that on account of the fact that you and your adversaries have agreed, both party are taking the same side, some of these complicated questions could be escaped as being removed.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    But you haven't agreed with the Utah Labor Relation.
speaker="peter_w_billings" startTime="3303.265" stopTime="3304.896">
    Mr. Peter W. Billings 
    No, I have not agreed with the Utah Board.

    (Voice Overlap) --

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    I see. 
    You just agreed with the steelworkers but they're yours -- but they were yours, but adversary for a second.
speaker="peter_w_billings" startTime="3310.613" stopTime="3319.861">
    Mr. Peter W. Billings 
    Well, that's perfectly true, Your Honor, but I gather that -- and so far as the facts of this particular case is concerned, they haven't agreed that my client was any better fellow than he was six months ago.

    I see.
