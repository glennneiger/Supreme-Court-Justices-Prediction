    Number 321, Ruby Nell Thomson versus Texas and Pacific Railway Company. 
    Ms. Tarpley.

    Ms. Beverly Tarpley 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    This is a case arising under the Federal Employers' Liability Act, a suit involving an injured workman on a railroad. 
    The employee had been hired several months before this accident to perform the duties of an agent-operator on the respondent's railroad lines. 
    After a few months of training or a short period of training, she was employed first of all on what was -- what was called the extra board. 
    That meant that she went to various stations up and down the line, filling in for a day or here and there while employees were on vacation or on sick leave. 
    After a period of several months of doing this kind of work, she bid in and received by a reason of her seniority a regular job as agent and operator on the station at Monahans, Texas, a station in far west Texas. 
    There on her testimony, it was her job to perform various duties of the clerical nature to take care of train orders and handling tickets and things of that nature. 
    When she first went to this job -- pardon me, a Mexican laborer, also an employee of the respondent railroad was engaged in handling the mail which came in on a regular passenger train, which passed -- passed through on the petitioner's shift. 
    Now, handling the mail meant loading up a baggage cart, that sort of thing, follow these individual bags and mail which had been prepared by the postal employees and lock in the postal room, pulling that cart out to the waiting train, climbing up on the cart and picking up the bags and mail individually and tossing them into the Post Office cart, receiving incoming bags of mail, getting down and pulling the cart back into the waiting mail room. 
    Now, as I have said, when petitioner first went to work on this particular station, a Mexican laborer, who was a witness in the trial of this case, was handling this mail and he continued to handle it up until two or three days before the petitioner's injury. 
    At that time, she was told by her immediate superior, who was the witness, Higginbotham that she was to handle the mail, she was to handle it alone and with no assistance. 
    There's no testimony in the record that the handling of the mail up to this time had been improper, that the train could been delayed or that the Mexican laborer was no longer available. 
    Simply the very statement that her superior requested that she handle the mail. 
    She did so for two or three days and on about the third day, on the day of the accident, she climbed down from the mail cart after handling several bags of mail weighing 50 to 75 pounds each, felt a sudden catch in her back. 
    Shortly after that time, she was taken into the hospital and received various treatment over a long period of time. 
    This case was tried in the Abilene Division of the Northern District of Texas and a jury verdict was returned for the petitioner. 
    The case was reversed on its merits by the Fifth Circuit and brought here by certiorari. 
    Now, it is our contention that the Fifth Circuit reversed this case or reversed the jury verdict on two particular grounds. 
    Both of those grounds are arguments which had been advanced before this Court in numerous decisions arising under this Act and have on each instance been rejected by this Court. 
    The first of those arguments, one advanced by the railroad, was that this woman was engaged in doing only the usual and customary duties of her employment at the time of the accident or in other words, the whole idea of non-negligence. 
    Now, we feel that the Fifth Circuit improperly analyzed the record and in arriving at their decision that this was usual and customary and therefore no negligence, that they rely on the very argument, as I have said which have previously been advanced before this Court and rejected. 
    The testimony is clear that it was not usual and customary as to this particular employee. 
    The allegations of the petitioner's complaint in the trial court were failure to furnish sufficient help, failure to furnish a safe place to work. 
    And the jury was charged on that basis and on that basis, on the basis of the testimony of petitioner and the testimony of these other witnesses returned a verdict that she had been furnished improper help. 
    Now, the first of these cases arising before this Court after the 1939 amendment to the Act, which was of course the amendment that abolished assumption of risk, was the Tiller case in which this Court set forth a very exhaustive opinion and set forth a very complete summary of the intent of Congress and the responsibilities of the employer under this Act. 
    The lower court in the Tiller case had advanced the same theory that the Congress by abolishing the defense of assumption of risk had not meant to increase the employer's responsibility towards his employee. 
    This Court said that that was just another way of saying no negligence and assumption of risk. 
    In other words, the employer could not simply, by saying this is a usual and customary duty, force the employee to take on whatever risk were involved in performing that job. 
    And as we said, this was first advanced by this Court in the Tiller case, it has been advanced by this Court down through the years in the Stone case, Blair case, all of which cases had been cited by petitioner and reaffirmed in fact by this Court in three opinions handed down by this Court only last month, the Rogers case and the other cases following. 
    The second thing that the Fifth Circuit mentioned was a failure to protest sufficiently hard on the part of the employee. 
    The record showed that several days before this accident occurred, the petitioner's immediate superior told her that she had to handle the mail and had to do it alone. 
    The petitioner then testified that she had previously been instructed by someone who was hired in the railroad line of organization that it had become the railroad's policy to encourage its women employees to dress in a manner becoming a woman and that this made it impossible for them to climb up on carts and do manual labor.She told her superior that and he said, "You're hired out to do a man's job and that's what I intend for you to do."

    I didn't get your last statement that was made.
speaker="beverly_tarpley" startTime="460.203" stopTime="481.049">
    Ms. Beverly Tarpley 
    The -- her immediate superior there on the job, the witness Higginbotham, told her in response to her protest about the fact that she could not do this job while wearing the clothing she'd been requested to wear was, "You have hired out to do a man's job and now those are the duties I see fit for you to do."
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="481.049" stopTime="487.347">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Now, before that, what had been told to her in that regard by a higher superior, did you say?
speaker="beverly_tarpley" startTime="487.347" stopTime="623.175">
    Ms. Beverly Tarpley 
    Yes, sir. 
    She had been requested to wear skirts and hose and normal female attire, and such attire made it impossible for her to climb up on mail carts and do the kind of manual labor that her superior insisted. 
    And during that period of time, the laborer, who was an employee of the railroad, had been doing this work. 
    So at that point, on a direct order from her superior, she began doing the work and after performing it only two or three times suffered an injury. 
    Now, the Fifth Circuit held that that was a failure to protest and said that by reason of her failure to protest, she could not recover under the circumstances. 
    Now, it has been suggested -- pardon me, it has been suggested by the petitioner and we would reiterate here that the conduct of the employee is not the test set forth by Congress or by this Court in its interpretation of the law under -- arising under the statute, that it is the conduct of the employer which is the sole criteria for deciding whether or not there is liability. 
    I believe that this Court in its case of Rogers versus Missouri Pacific, one of the latest cases deciding, has said that the only ground of inquiry for an appellate court is whether or not the negligence of the employer contributed in the slightest degree to the injury of the employee. 
    And by reason of that statement and it is a statement which this Court has made many times before, we feel that the Fifth Circuit simply did not follow the interpretation of the law laid down by this Court previously. 
    They -- we feel that they ignored the sense of this Court's opinions in -- and put improper emphasis on her conduct. 
    Under those circumstances, we feel that the decision of the trial court ought to be affirmed. 
   
   
   
   Argument of J. B. Look
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="623.175" stopTime="628.671">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Look.
speaker="j_b_look" startTime="628.671" stopTime="744.382">
    Mr. J. B. Look 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    Now, here's why we are up here. 
    The petitioner pled in her pleading that that morning she noticed there was an unusual heavy amount of mail and then she told her superior about it but he ordered her to go ahead. 
    The proof did not show that. 
    There's absolutely no evidence as to that. 
    Now, here's what happens on these jobs. 
    She had been working for some 15 months as an agent-operator. 
    She testified it was normally one of the regular duties of an agent-operator to handle the mail, that she knew it was the duty of the agent-operator at Monahans, where she asked the railroad to send her to handle the mail. 
    Now then, what happens is this, the Post Office employees sacked the mail, not the railroad. 
    They determine how much it will be in a sack and how many sacks there will be and they load them on to these carts. 
    And then a railroad employee takes the cart and takes the mail off of the truck, which is an ordinary kind of cart that the railway express and railroads all use, and sets them inside the -- the Railway Post Office car and takes the rest of them all. 
    Of course, the Railroad Post Office car, their employees in there are United States employees, United States Government employees and not railroad employees.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="744.382" stopTime="747.575">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    How heavy do these bags get?
speaker="j_b_look" startTime="747.575" stopTime="756.806">
    Mr. J. B. Look 
    On this occasion, she stated the bags were -- some of them 50 to 75 pounds on this particular occasion. 
    Now, remember --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="756.806" stopTime="759.648">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Do they get heavier than that on -- on occasions?
speaker="j_b_look" startTime="759.648" stopTime="811.311">
    Mr. J. B. Look 
    I -- I don't know, Your Honor. 
    The record is completely silent as to that. 
    I -- I don't know how heavy they might get. 
    I took it that this was "unusually heavy this morning" is the impression that you get from reading the record on only, that this particular morning she said the sacks were heavy. 
    But now, all of this happens while the train stops there.It stopped there in the station at Monahans. 
    There was no way in the world that the railroad could have known, the T &amp; P Railroad could have possibly known how many sacks and what weight the sacks would be that the Railway Post Office Company -- the United States Post Office Company employees would sack on that train. 
    Now then --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="811.311" stopTime="818.892">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Had she been told before that she must do this herself but must not -- must not get any other help?

    Mr. J. B. Look 
    No, sir.

    She -- she must not use this Mexican?

    Mr. J. B. Look 
    No, sir.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="823.618" stopTime="827.994">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    You mean that it wasn't as counsel stated that this -- it was?
speaker="j_b_look" startTime="827.994" stopTime="902.046">
    Mr. J. B. Look 
    No, sir. 
    She stated that she couldn't wear skirts and hose, he -- the superior and still do that job. 
    Now, her superior that she is talking about, that first told her about skirts and hose, worked on another division of the railway and he had told her that so long as your duties are performed -- you can perform your duties satisfactorily, we want you to wear skirts and hose. 
    But one of her duties was handling the mail, which is the normal everyday duty of agent-operators throughout the -- the country. 
    Now then, when she got to Monahans, someday beforehand, she said this when she was reminded that she was not performing that function. 
    She -- she said, "I can't wear skirts and hose and do that." 
    He says, "All right, then don't wear skirts and hose but your job is to handle the mail." 
    She never did tell anyone that the job was too strenuous for her, either on that morning or any other occasion, she never complained to anyone. 
    Now then, we get to the -- to the Tiller case.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="902.046" stopTime="909.896">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well, what was her purpose of talking to them if she wasn't complaining it was too heavy for her?
speaker="j_b_look" startTime="909.896" stopTime="933.986">
    Mr. J. B. Look 
    She said she would have to climb up and down on those carts and she couldn't dress in skirts and hose and go -- she'd be exposed that way, you see, out around the station. 
    That was her only complaint that I can't -- now the -- also in the other division, a woman wear skirts and hose, "I can't wear skirts and hose and climb up on and around those carts.” 
    And he said, “Well, don't wear skirts and hose."

    One or two sacks, I think.

    But she testified she had never at any time ever had any other trouble. 
    She's been doing this now for 15 months, handling mail, not off just to this train but trains up and down the line.

    Now, our position is this that a request for help or assistance is essential in a case such as this to establish liability for this very reason, your negligence of course depends upon the existence of a duty. 
    The existence of a duty arises by virtue of a reasonable anticipation that some injury will befall someone.

    How would the woman know -- know when she's taking care of the mail whether there was going to be very light load or whether there's going to be a very heavy one like -- like this. 
    And I would think that it would have some significance as to how she dressed, if she dressed normally in women's clothes. 
    And occasionally, she got a -- a truck like this, it would be a dangerous thing for her, wouldn't it, to handle -- handle mail bags that -- that are up to 75 pounds and -- and running around this trucks in a woman's clothing, skirts that might get tangled up on -- on things that trip her and injure her?

    This was a very small town station with a very small number of people. 
    For instance, in -- in -- say in Dallas, they have people that do nothing but panel mail off a train, say your agent there of course is a very high official and you're operator there, they'll have many of them on duty. 
    But in this little stations like Monahans, where they -- and Merkel and all of the other little towns up and down the T &amp; P and up and down the Santa Fe and every other railroad that it's normally just a part of her duties. 
    It was all of the operators perform this duty. 
    No one had ever asked for additional help or said that it wasn't -- that they couldn't do it. 
    Now then, if you have a duty that's just a normal duty, that is a duty that's imposed by the nature of the occupation which we have here. 
    If for some reason this employee can't do it, the employee must in order to establish negligence, in order to establish a duty. 
    In other words, a reasonable anticipation of injury, the employee must apprise the employer of the fact. 
    Now, we have this in here. 
    The petitioner had been undergoing treatment for a kidney ailment. 
    She -- the respondent knew nothing about it. 
    She went to a private physician. 
    She told -- didn't tell her boss. 
    She didn't tell anyone else. 
    Now, that may have weakened her on this particular day.

    Mr. J. B. Look 
    It may have weakened her and caused the injury or what happened, we don't know, except that she and other employees did it constantly. 
    The only thing different is she was ill on that day and had been treated by a doctor. 
    Now, we didn't know about it. 
    There was no way that we can tell (Inaudible) orders, the employee goes to see a doctor and maybe suffering some illness. 
    Can it possibly be said that merely requiring someone expecting him to do their normal job would be negligence if by virtue of the illness it makes it dangerous if we don't know about the illness?

    The complete conversation in regard to this was brought out that she had with Mr. Higginbotham.

    Now, the opinion of the Fifth Circuit, a very reading of it shows and -- that they exhaustively searched the record. 
    It's right with -- with annotations and of course what the case amounts to is an analysis of the facts. 
    Now then, we get into this situation, may it please the Court. 
    Ordinarily, when a case turns upon merely an analysis of the facts in the particular case, this Court does not concern itself with those cases because by the very nature they are very limited in our application. 
    In recent years particularly of course more and more of these cases like the Rogers case, like this case, like the case yesterday, two of them I believe, and your employer-employee relationship. 
    Now of course, there -- there is no really bright dividing line between negligence and non-negligence. 
    Judges always have and always will differ. 
    This Court in the Wilkinson case pointed that out. 
    Well then, here's the difficulty. 
    We have our trial courts and we have our Courts of Appeals, which ordinarily are intended to be and are courts of last resort. 
    In other jurisdictions, either by statute or a court rule where there are intermediate courts, the highest court will not review questions of facts because it necessarily involves merely a second-guessing.

    I didn't think that the determination was based upon what we might do taking a printed record and say the thing mattered, it was rather what the trial judge ordinarily might properly feel that the jury could draw upon it, that they could draw the inference which the Chief Justice's question suggests. 
    That's a jury question for the jury to decide, isn't it?

    No, sir. 
    I -- I think that the -- the test is whether taking the printed record and with what we have whether a reasonable man could for more than mere scintilla of the evidence have reasonably arrived at the verdict that they did. 
    It's not what the trial judge was -- thought at the time, but it's what we have the benefit of seeing the record, that is the purpose of having the record.

   Rebuttal of Beverly Tarpley
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2500.464" stopTime="2505.079">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Ms. Tarpley, did you -- have something in rebuttal?
speaker="beverly_tarpley" startTime="2505.079" stopTime="2598.532">
    Ms. Beverly Tarpley 
    May it please the Court. 
    It seems to me that the question in which has been advanced here is simply an indication of the fact that this was a fact question involved, which was properly left in the jury and in the trial -- trial judges' wisdom was left to the jury and that it should have been so left. 
    The petitioner testified that she had asked for help and had been -- or rather that she had been instructed not to ask for help. 
    The witness Higginbotham on page 89 of the record testified that this was not her sole duty and that she was only to assist in handling the mail. 
    There's a square conflict of fact between the two witnesses or between the testimony of two witnesses. 
    And certainly, that's -- by its very essence, the type of thing which should be left to a jury determination in which the trial judge in his wisdom did leave to a jury determination. 
    Now, throughout the record there are simply conflicts of fact which should and all through have been left to a jury determination, and that determination ought to be upheld. 
    The respondent has said over and over again that the petitioner or that the railroad was not apprised of the danger of this work. 
    But again, we have the testimony of the petitioner that she had been told that this was a man's work. 
    Certainly, that shows notice within itself that this was the type of work which a woman ought not to be required to handle without assistance. 
    Now --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="2598.532" stopTime="2601.599">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Who was -- who was the District Judge here?
speaker="beverly_tarpley" startTime="2601.599" stopTime="2604.013">
    Ms. Beverly Tarpley 
    The Honorable T. Whitfield Davidson, who is now --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="2604.013" stopTime="2607.649">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    How long has he been a judge?
speaker="beverly_tarpley" startTime="2607.649" stopTime="2806.567">
    Ms. Beverly Tarpley 
    Well, over 20 years. 
    He's now the presiding judge of the Northern District, if the Court please. 
    And this Court has held in the case of Lillie versus Thompson, which was the case in which a woman who has suffered a criminal attack in a poorly lighted section of the freight yard. 
    This Court held that an employer had to reasonably anticipate the dangers of a particular situation as those would affect a particular employee and had to anticipate those dangers. 
    That's exactly the same type of thing that is present here. 
    An employer would have to anticipate the danger to an employee of requiring that employee to handle work which was beyond her physical strength. 
    In short, we think that this case has one issue and one issue alone and that is that under all the circumstances, under all the conflicts and the testimony that this was a jury matter and as this Court has said repeatedly again and again, one that should have been left to the jury determination. 
    That the jury having reached the decision, that that decision should not be upset by second-guessing in the record or sitting here and attempting to construct inferences out of the printed record when the jurors have the benefit of the living witnesses in the Court's charge. 
    Has -- it has been said this Court repeated again in -- in the Rogers case that under all the circumstances if in the slightest degree, this Court -- the employer's negligence contributed to the employee's injury then the Federal Employers' Liability Act apply. 
    It also said in the Schulz case that if the evidence was such that the -- the jury could in reasonable probability arrived at a verdict of negligence that verdict should not be disturbed. 
    There is this final factor which I would like to bring to the Court's attention in which I think suggest the basis for the decisions of the Fifth Circuit and the decision advocated by the respondent here. 
    In neither the respondent's brief nor in the opinion of the Fifth Circuit have the latest pronouncements of this Court been advocated as authority for those decisions. 
    In the respondent's brief, not one case of this Court is cited as authority for the proposition that this situation presents a case of non-negligence or that this is a case which should not have been left to the jury. 
    The same is true of the opinion of the Fifth Circuit, which was based primarily on the Wadiak case, a case out of the Fifth -- of the Seventh Circuit. 
    We feel under all those circumstances that both the respondent and the Fifth Circuit have refused to follow the latest pronouncements of this Court and have on that basis and that basis alone, on the theory which they have which differs from this Court have decided that this case should have been taken from the jury.

    If I may say this, after the opinion of the Fifth Circuit and this case was handed down and prior to the term -- the petitioner's term for motion for rehearing had expired, this Court published it's opinion in the case of Schulz versus Pennsylvania Railroad which was a Jones Act case and similar of course on the liability angle, the Federal Employers' Liability Act. 
    In that case, this Court said that negligence cannot be measured like a -- an acre of ground but that is something that should be left to the -- the sound discretion of the jury. 
    That case was particularly called to the attention of the Fifth Circuit by the petitioner in her motion for rehearing and that motion for rehearing was overruled without opinion. 
    Thank you.
