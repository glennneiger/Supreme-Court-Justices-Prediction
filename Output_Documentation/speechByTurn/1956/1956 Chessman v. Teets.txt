    Mr. George T. Davis 
    I did, sir. 
    But there is a matter of question that was asked and I have to take it in order to be clear about it, if I may. 
    I understand I have only a few minutes but let me --

    Five minutes.
speaker="george_t_davis" startTime="25.149" stopTime="85.734">
    Mr. George T. Davis 
    May it please the Court. 
    In connection with one question that was asked with reference to when Mr. Chessman learned that Stanley Fraser was related to Mr. Leavy. 
    There's a series of -- of pieces of information about this. 
    The -- there was a letter and I -- it's in the petitioner's Exhibit Number 12. 
    There was letter written to Mr. Chessman in -- in July of 1948. 
    This letter -- I'm not sure that this letter was -- was allowed in evidence but I believe I know it's in this file at least for identification. 
    And in connection with this subject, it was a letter from Emily Matthews who was the wife of the man who sat as an adviser during Chessman's trial. 
    In the course of that letter --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="85.734" stopTime="86.937">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Adviser to whom?
speaker="george_t_davis" startTime="86.937" stopTime="341.679">
    Mr. George T. Davis 
    As an adviser to Mr. Chessman. 
    In the course of that letter, she said, and it appears just above in the middle of this handwritten page, "The record is in sad page, they have the third man on it now, and Al is quite elated as he is M. L. wife's cousin. 
    Now, this is clarified by a later statement by Mr. Chessman. 
    They have the third man on and he is M. L. wife's cousin. 
    Subsequently, a letter was written to Mr. Chessman on October the 12th, 1948, which incidentally was after that letter that had been sent by Mr. Persons (ph), that court reporter, who said that these notes were undecipherable. 
    This came to Mr. Chessman from Al Matthews and he says, "The judge told me when the record was completed he was going to bring you down here for the purpose of having an agreed settlement of the record." 
    Now, that was a letter from Mr. Matthews. 
    I must say in fairness to Judge Fricke, that Judge Fricke did testify that Mr. Matthews had apparently misunderstood him. 
    But that, of course, was not known to Mr. Chessman in anyway because that's the letter that he received from Mr. Matthews. 
    Now, I go to Mr. Chessman's testimony in the hearings before Judge Goodman. 
    And at the time he was testifying, Ms.Asher who was interrogating him said to him, "Did you at that time" -- speaking now of the July, 1948 letter from Emily, “Did you at that time relate that reference to M. L.'s wife's cousin to Stanley Fraser?" 
    Chessman said, "I had never heard the name Stanley Fraser in my life so I was unable to do so." 
    "When did you first hear the name Stanley Fraser?" 
    Answer "Some time shortly before, so far as I can recall, the transcripts were filed." 
    Now, I am referring not to the augmented record but to the original transcripts under the original contract which was in 1949. 
    I don't remember exactly. 
    "Now, Mr. Chessman, when did you first learn of the relationship between Mr. Stanley Fraser and Mr. J. M. Leavy? 
    Answer "Some time in May of 1954. 
    I was at San Quentin and I had a date." 
    And I am reading incidentally from pages 572 and 573 of this record, Volume 7. 
    "I -- I was at San Quentin and I had a date for execution in a few more days. 
    I had retained Berwyn Rice as counsel who was the first attorney I'd had since these proceedings began." 
    He told me he'd just returned from a trip to Los Angeles. 
    During the course of the investigation down there, he asked me first, did I know that the reporter who had prepared this record was related to the prosecutor. 
    And I told him no, that I didn't. 
    And he said well, I have information that he is. 
    Now, Mrs. -- Ms. Asher proceeded to ask him one further question and asked him whether he knew or whether he didn't know when that original letter said that he was M. L.'s cousin that he was referring that -- that Emily was referring to Miller Leavy. 
    And he answered, in the course of his questioning, that he didn't know that because he assumed, he said here -- he said that he assumed from the letter that this was the third man working on the notes. 
    He didn't know that that was the man who actually was retained or would be retained to transcribe the notes. 
    And so, he didn't put it together and, of course, M. L.'s cousin meant nothing to him so far as Fraser was concerned until his own counsel told him about it for the first time in 1954. 
    Then I -- I call your attention to Volume 6, the testimony of Mr. Fraser --

    Question "At the time -- just to digress for a moment, at the time he went to see Judge Fricke in his chambers -- did you tell Judge Fricke that you were related to Mr. Leavy in any sense or degree?" 
    And his answer is, "No, I did not." 
    And it develops that he never made that disclosure --

    Now, I ask Your Honors also, if I may, I direct your attention to that same volume to pages 321 and 322, and 331, and 339 were he discusses the relationship between himself and Mr. Leavy with reference to these notes.

   Argument of William M. Bennett
speaker="william_m_bennett" startTime="596.199" stopTime="686.280">
    Mr. William M. Bennett 
    May it please the Court. 
    Because we are concerned with the question of counsel here and a very long and a very voluminous record, we must look at the totality of the facts. 
    And the first thing I'd like to discuss is the method by which the record was prepared, a method approved incidentally by a California court in construing a California statute in the California rules upon appeal. 
    Now, when reporter Perry died, he being the reporter who had lived during that trial and taken all the notes, the California court was confronted with a most unique situation. 
    A new trial was impossible for the reason that the grounds for new trial in California are purely statutory and no new trial was permitted. 
    The California Supreme Court has so stated. 
    Discharge of the prisoner, maybe that occurred to somebody, but that was impossible. 
    This was a -- a most serious charge and kidnapping had been found against him on two counts and a death penalty had been imposed, so that was impossible. 
    Now, there was a third thing that might have been done and that rested with the petitioner himself, Mr. Chessman. 
    Under the California Rules upon Appeal, he had the right under Rule 36 to make application to Judge Fricke to prepare a settled statement. 
    That was not done. 
    There was no way then, and I know of no way now by which he could have been compelled to do it. 
    So, there was a remedy available to him which he did not exercise.

    What does that mean, compare a settled statement?
speaker="william_m_bennett" startTime="689.351" stopTime="708.081">
    Mr. William M. Bennett 
    Under Rule 36 of the Rules on Appeal, Your Honor. 
    If for any reason, the stenographic notes are not capable of being transcribed, the party affected, it may make application to the Court for permission to prepare a settled statement of that which occurred at the trial, meaning the --
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="708.081" stopTime="709.719">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Does that apply to capital cases?
speaker="william_m_bennett" startTime="709.719" stopTime="730.728">
    Mr. William M. Bennett 
    That applies to capital cases and our Supreme Court has so held in People against Chessman 35 Cal.2nd at 455. 
    It's so stated in that opinion but Mr. Chessman did not do it. 
    Now, the fourth thing and the only thing then that remained to be done, discharge being impossible, know new trial, he not electing to --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="730.728" stopTime="747.509">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    I just want to enter a caveat. 
    I -- I don't think it's axiomatic that if a trial had -- has been passed and something beyond anybody's control what the lawyers called an act of conflict effects, in another time it's precluded. 
    I just stating so --

    Mr. William M. Bennett 
    Well --

    Yes. 
    So -- so that being so and because an automatic appeal was conferred by California upon Chessman in the death penalty case, a complete appeal, of course, would require a record. 
    The State had the judgment of conviction, death penalty in two instances. 
    But the interest in the appeal was to Chessman's benefit to have a record before that Court so that any errors which might lead to a reversal might be exposed.

    Let me ask you this, Mr. Bennett. 
    Suppose it has to be possible to make up this question, suppose nobody, suppose Fraser and everybody else as I can apparently carries hieroglyphics, what would have happened?
speaker="william_m_bennett" startTime="878.484" stopTime="926.951">
    Mr. William M. Bennett 
    Well, Your Honor, I can refer the Court to the case of Miller against United States which was referred in 317 U.S. and I don't have the exact page, but in that case, the reporter for the Court was also the secretary to the judge and she was so busy, it's stated in the opinion of this Court, that she could not transcribe the notes. 
    It was quite lengthy. 
    Now, I believe it was a habeas corpus proceeding. 
    Application was made to have the Government transcribe the record and it was resisted by the Government and the Court then pointed out that a bill of exceptions would lie and that in preparing it, the -- one making up the record was entitled to rely upon the notes of the judge, consult with the witnesses and go to any other source from which veracity could be established leading into this record.

speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1098.651" stopTime="1100.574">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    But we also have questions to Mr. Davis before --
speaker="william_m_bennett" startTime="1100.574" stopTime="1100.885">
    Mr. William M. Bennett 
    Yes.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1100.885" stopTime="1101.838">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    -- I began to speak.
speaker="william_m_bennett" startTime="1101.838" stopTime="1211.155">
    Mr. William M. Bennett 
    And I welcome the questions, Your Honor, and I hope I can answer. 
    But in any event, this was a method that was compelled under our rules on appeal as construed by our courts and our state court has held that this method adopted under California law was a fair method. 
    Now, when we talks in term for so -- fairness, I think we're talking in terms of due process at least at this beginning stage of the case. 
    And so, the method adopted, the method compelled was a method that has been held to be valid under California law, California law which conferred the appeal in the first instance. 
    Now, as to the manner in which the trial transcript was prepared, that -- that just wasn't happenstance that Mr. Fraser was employed. 
    He wasn't walking down the street and he wasn't selected out of a crowd to do this job. 
    When reporter Perry died, the seriousness of the problem confronting the appellate aspects of this case were apparent to all, the judge and the prosecuting attorney and to Mr. Chessman, himself, who asked that the proceedings be dismissed. 
    And so, the notes were given to other reporters in the Los Angeles County Court House Building and a reporter by the name of Gerni (ph) read them and she voiced the opinion that they were capable of being transcribed. 
    She would not undertake the test, however, because she had daily duties to attend to and she didn't want to get involved in this. 
    Now, Mr. Fraser was selected, first of all, because he had formerly works in common employment with Mr. Perry, the dead reporter. 
    He had even lived with him for a time. 
    They had talked shop the way lawyers do and the way reporters do and each had read the notes of the other each was a pitmanic reporter. 
    And that's why Mr. Fraser was selected and he was --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="1211.155" stopTime="1212.362">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    What kind of reporter?
speaker="william_m_bennett" startTime="1212.362" stopTime="1270.396">
    Mr. William M. Bennett 
    Pitmanic, Your Honor. 
    That -- that style of shorthands -- rule of shorthand. 
    And that's why he was selected. 
    And he was selected upon the recommendation in the first instance of this (Inaudible) Gerni, the other reporter who had first read, the dead reporter, Perry's notes and said they were capable of transcription. 
    Now, before reporter Fraser began, these facts must be taken into consideration. 
    Before he died, reporter Perry had dictated on to a recording device, the first 646 pages of this transcript. 
    The first 646 pages of the transcript were transcribed as they always had been in the past by his long time transcriber one Grace Peter Michael. 
    So that whether reporter ,Perry, had lived or whether he had died, the first 646 pages would have been transcribed in the same manner as appears in the record before this Court and as was reviewed by the California Supreme Court.

    Apparently not.

speaker="william_m_bennett" startTime="1284.653" stopTime="1318.304">
    Mr. William M. Bennett 
    I know. 
    I realized that. 
    So that the 646 pages are important because they show that if -- if nothing else existed we have a key to the penmanship and the style and a pitmanic system of the dead reporter. 
    And it incidentally, within the first 646 pages, is found the testimony of the two kidnap victims. 
    Their examination and their cross-examination by the defendant. 
    That's in the first 646 pages taken from the voice, if you please, of the dead reporter Perry.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="1318.304" stopTime="1320.874">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Does that include Chessman's testimony?

    Mr. William M. Bennett 
    No, it does not, Your Honor. 
    It does not. 
    Now, there's another thing that must be said here and it's this. 
    There was a question about the competency of Fraser by Mr. Chessman in his long continuing series of attacks upon the man's character and ability. 
    But this Court specifically directed an inquiry into the question of fraud and collusion. 
    And Mr. Fraser was exposed to all of the questions and all of the examinations of Mr. Davis. 
    And he was attacked as to ability and to character. 
    And all that I've just related came out. 
    To begin with, Mr. Perry's style of penmanship was what we call "copperplate". 
    Those are the words of a man, named Paul Berdict (ph), who testified as an expert before Judge Goodman and who said that his notes were of the best quality and quite legible. 
    Now, Mr. Fraser testified before Judge Goodman as to his prior experience with Perry in reading his notes, how they had been life long friends, how they had worked for a common employer in Seattle, and how they had a room together. 
    And after all of that was done, they even examined the method by which Mr. Fraser prepared these particular transcript pages. 
    And they found, true, that he consulted the notes of Judge Fricke. 
    Well, that was approved in the Miller case decided by this Court. 
    He did talk to some of the witnesses. 
    That apparently is approved by the Miller case, decided by this Court. 
    And he used other sources of material. 
    And after all that that was done, the Court found that the record was prepared, not only by Mr. Fraser but with the assistance of Leavy and Fricke in an eminently fair manner and that Mr. Fraser was especially confident and qualified to prepare the record. 
    Now, before the page was closed on a preparation of the record, there was another man who made his entry into the preparation of it and that was Mr. Chessman himself. 
    Mr. Chessman was furnished a complete copy of the reporter's transcript, he being at San Quentin State Prison. 
    And he read it. 
    We have to presume he read it because here was a man who knew that his fate is continued, right to live would depend upon whether or not he could discover some material errors in the transcript that was delivered to him at San Quentin State Prison. 
    And so, he read it and he forward it to Judge Fricke, a document, legal size, double-spaced comprising approximately 28 pages, and there, he set forth all of his objections to the transcript as prepared by Fraser.

    Mr. William M. Bennett 
    On February 11th, there was a proceeding in Judge Fricke's court and, of course, the courtrooms are always open to the public and it was reported and it was transcribed. 
    And at that time, the first portion of the transcript was presented to the Court. 
    Later on in April, there was another proceeding transcribed again at which it was adopted. 
    Now, at the first proceeding before Judge Fricke, the clerk was directed to send the transcript to Caryl Chessman at San Quentin State --

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Well, was he given any opportunity as what I'm trying to find out.
speaker="william_m_bennett" startTime="1526.468" stopTime="1526.947">
    Mr. William M. Bennett 
    Well, Your Honor --
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="1526.947" stopTime="1529.640">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Did that appear to be represented at either of those?
speaker="william_m_bennett" startTime="1529.640" stopTime="1690.700">
    Mr. William M. Bennett 
    We can approach that this way, and I'd like to take a little time to answer that question. 
    The allegation has been made that from language contained in an affidavit of J. Miller Leavy, the prosecutor at the trial of this case, stating that the transcript would be delivered to Chessman in Court, that from that, he inferred a promise that he would be present. 
    Now, that affidavit was filed with the California Supreme Court in order to gain more time to file a brief or the transcript to complete it on November 3rd, 1948. 
    On April 3rd, 1949, before the transcript had been filed, there was an affidavit filed by Chessman himself for the California Supreme Court in which he sought time, further time to read the transcript. 
    And in that affidavit, he said that he had been duped by Judge Fricke and prosecutor Leavy into thinking that he would be present at the hearing before Judge Fricke to settle the transcript. 
    Now, if there is sought to be established any state action from that, to begin with, it wasn't a promise from Leavy to Chessman made in his presence. 
    It was language taken from an affidavit. 
    Secondly, if it is any kind of a promise, there has to be some reliance upon it. 
    Now, if Chessman knew on April 3rd, 1949 that he would not be present in Court and he must have known it because he said in the affidavit that he had been duped into thinking he would be present, then, it was his duty, if time were remaining, to take legal steps to compel his presence in Court to take those steps. 
    He said on April 3rd, 1949, he had been duped. 
    The transcript was settled on June 1st, June 2nd, and June 3rd of 1949 so that he have the time period from April 3rd, 1949 to June 1st, 1949 within which to make application to some California court to order his person produced before Judge Fricke, and he did not do so. 
    He applied once to the California Supreme Court to be produced and they denied it without prejudice. 
    And he, by this time, knew full well but without prejudice manner. 
    Now, further, he could not, for a moment, have entertained the notion that he would be produced or that the transcript would be delivered to him in Judge Fricke's court for the reason that it was in fact delivered to him at San Quentin State Prison. 
    That's where he took delivery. 
    So as to that fabricated promise and as to this notion of reliance, the facts disclosed that it just is not so.

speaker="william_m_bennett" startTime="1741.689" stopTime="1904.697">
    Mr. William M. Bennett 
    Your Honor, we'll approach it this way, and again, we have to go back to the days before the trial proper commenced. 
    Now, at that time following arrest and arraignment, Chessman was represented by the deputy public defender, the first public defender's office in United States was established in Los Angeles, by the way. 
    And later on, before the trial commenced, 48 days before the trial begin, as a matter of fact, this took place in the courtroom. 
    The Court, "Are you a good lawyer?" 
    Chessman, "I think so." 
    The Court, "Few lawyers say they are good." 
    The defendant, Chessman, "I think I am a good enough lawyer." 
    The Court, "You don't want to trust it to a lawyer?" 
    Chessman, "I don't want to do it." 
    And then some more, and it's quite clear from that, that he insisted upon representing himself. 
    And then again he said this, at another p oint in the transcript. 
    This is Chessman speaking, "I wish to point out that it is my intention to act in propria persona at this time and to continue to do so until such time as it is legally established that I am not qualified to do so and that I will not accept a court appointed attorney." 
    Now, that's how the trial began, Chessman representing himself. 
    And if there's any question, whatsoever, of -- of a competent rejection of counsel or if you want to put in terms of labor, consider this, this is not an ignorance, or an illiterate, or an uninformed, or misguided, or coerced individual. 
    On the contrary, here's a man of intelligence so described by Judge Goodman. 
    In fact, Judge -- Judge Denman said that his briefs would do credit to an experienced criminal practitioner. 
    That's the man who pushed away the aid of counsel at the beginning of the trial. 
    Now, when he did that, he was unnoticed of what California law was. 
    And California law guaranteed, if you please, his presence at the trial. 
    Not a word any place in the California Constitution or statutes or other States that we can find saying, if you are convicted and if you represent yourself, you thereby acquire the right to leave the prison gates to make an appearance. 
    So that it is our position that when he elected to defend his own cause, he had before him the possibility of conviction or the possibility of acquittal. 
    And the possibility of conviction entailed with it the disability of being unable to represent himself if imprisoned in a state prison. 
    And further --

    Would you permit to represent himself who was denied the truth of being present in Court when the transcript was such?
speaker="william_m_bennett" startTime="1922.936" stopTime="1979.960">
    Mr. William M. Bennett 
    Well, and again I'd like to answer it this way. 
    In Price against Johnston, this Court weighed what I thought was the obvious. 
    In other words, the public safety which is a -- a paramount requirement here as against the rights or I prefer to call them privileges of the individual. 
    In the Johnston case, the Court was dealing with the habeas corpus case of course and the question was whether the prisoner was entitled to make an oral argument upon appeal. 
    And this Court said that in that case, it was discretionary. 
    Now, of course, if it's discretionary, it cannot be a matter of right. 
    And if that is the rule that is to obtain in the federal courts, and the courts now were talking about the Sixth Amendment release the trial process, certainly, no higher rule should obtain in the state courts where we are not operating under the Sixth Amendment although California does furnished counsel in these cases. 
    No doubt about it.

    Well, Your Honor, because overwriting all of these discussion now, apparently is the premise that Chessman wasn't there and that he should have been there, but let's look --

    Mr. William M. Bennett 
    Yes.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2204.264" stopTime="2204.985">

    I do not think --
speaker="william_m_bennett" startTime="2204.985" stopTime="2205.846">
    Mr. William M. Bennett 
    All right. 
    Now --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2205.846" stopTime="2227.705">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    -- myself without. 
    That doesn't exhaust the problem as I understand that, namely, that there's a public interest to be represented whether Chessman chooses or not. 
    Just as much so, that there's a public interest that your Supreme Court could hear an appeal although Chessman tried him, through have -- I handle that he doesn't he want to have the appeal.
speaker="william_m_bennett" startTime="2227.705" stopTime="2244.655">
    Mr. William M. Bennett 
    Well, but Your Honor, if we would trust an attorney upon a man, a state appointed attorney, if you please, would that -- wouldn't that man have the right to assert his right not to have such an attorney represent him. 
    He -- whether its trial or appeal?
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2244.655" stopTime="2262.346">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    He can -- he can to the extent in saying, "I want my attorney to be there.” 
    And of course then the State, the trust upon attorney would deal but he has no right to foreclose a public interest to be so great, that you hear an appeal although he protest against having them.
speaker="william_m_bennett" startTime="2262.346" stopTime="2355.433">
    Mr. William M. Bennett 
    Well now, in answer to Justice Brennan's question and to show the consistency of the position of Chessman so far as rejecting the aid of counsel is concerned, after the record was filed and it was forwarded to the Court, the competency of the manner of preparation was reviewed by the California Supreme Court, and in that proceeding, Chessman wrote a brief. 
    And in his opening brief, which we have quoted on page 27 or our brief, he again asserts his position to appear personally. 
    That has always been his position. 
    He has never, until loss this Court created the argument for him, he has never said, "My position is, I should be there or an attorney should represent me." 
    His position has always been, "Only I, can defend my cause. 
    Only I should be present. 
    Now, of course we've got a new attack in the case, an attorney should also be present, but that has never been his position up to now. 
    So that whether or not anybody asked him if he wanted an attorney, really there was no need for it. 
    This man was so vociferous about what he wanted that nobody had any doubt that he would not accept the services of an attorney. 
    And of course, on death row, these things aren't sacred in California or in any other state prison. 
    He knew that all he had to do was asked the Supreme Court to have an attorney appointed and that would be done. 
    The fact of the matter is he did not do it. 
    His only interest was in prohibiting the proceeding or in representing himself. 
    Now --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2355.433" stopTime="2360.847">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Doesn't in here take what you call the -- the Court suggested it for him.
speaker="william_m_bennett" startTime="2360.847" stopTime="2498.214">
    Mr. William M. Bennett 
    No he doesn't, Your Honor. 
    His position hasn't changed. 
    Now, so far as -- again, coming back to his right to be present, we do have to balance the public safety requirements as against Mr. Chessman's privilege or desire. 
    Here was a man convicted of two very serious charges which entail the death penalty. 
    The distance from San Francisco to Los Angeles is 800 miles, round trip. 
    Now, supposing the man's name were Delinger or something else that carries a lot of evil connotations, is a state judge within his sound discretion saying, "Open the gates, exposed him to the public for 800 miles." 
    Now, is there any difference because his name happens to be Chessman? 
    You know what the record chose in this case. 
    We think that the California court had the right not to let him out. 
    The California Supreme Court said that that was the case and every single court that has reviewed this question without exception has said that he does not have a right onto the due process requirements or under equal protection or under any other theory to be present. 
    And the reason for that is quite obvious. 
    He is now been a judge, the menace to society. 
    Now, getting back to what occurred before Judge Fricke, if the transcript had been prepared, if it had not been given to Chessman, if he had not have the time and opportunity to read it, and if he not submitted a long list of written objections which were then filed before this Court, that would be a far different case. 
    The record would have been settled without his voice being heard, but his voice was heard and here's the interesting about all of his objections. 
    We say, well he didn't put a certain objection in -- in the courtroom adverse of that, and a way to believe that knowing that his life was at stake in this proceeding, if an objection didn't occur to him or if for some reason, he was playing a cat and mouse game with his own life that -- that is something we cannot control. 
    But every single objection that he put into his list of omissions and inaccuracies was allowed or disallowed by Judge Fricke and then most minutely reviewed by the California court and they said, allowing everyone of his objections, it would not have affected the result upon appeal.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="2498.214" stopTime="2503.493">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    What is the document where we'll find his objections and on what the Court deal with that?
speaker="william_m_bennett" startTime="2503.493" stopTime="2550.202">
    Mr. William M. Bennett 
    It's a document, Your Honor, which is contained in the supplemental first transcript and Chessman's document is entitled motion to correct and augment record, perhaps, this is reporter's transcript. 
    And then, the document, legal size, entitles defendant, appellants, list of inaccuracies and omissions in the record, reporter's transcript. 
    And Judge Fricke, by the way, at the time of adopting or settling the record said, as the trier of fact that there were facts here that he had given due consideration to all of Chessman's objections. 
    Now --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2550.202" stopTime="2638.088">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Mr. Bennett, I've been through a point. 
    May I ask you to comment on what the Chief Justice's judgment is there? 
    In his standing, the copy I have is -- you happened to have the petition with the appendix. 
    At page 9 -- October 19th, there are two things that I'm going to ask you about, Judge Denman said, no one in question that Chessman would have been entitled for a reversal if he had been able to maintain his contention. 
    But the judge instructed the jury that if they found that he has committed the attorney charge, they must render a verdict for the best interest although such is going on, et cetera. 
    And secondly, he enforced in this they had to claim the two record and show those with prejudicial statements made by the prosecutor as to requirements of the judging judge. 
    The last shall be first stating that in the trial first, is it -- is it on facts. 
    Mr. Davis -- and I say to the facts why do we change it? 
    It is one for retention. 
    Is it a fact that one them, with Chessman's objection to the accuracy of the record was that they were omitting and that was reported to be the his examination or cross-examination interjected in a lot of remarks trying to prosecute. 
    Is that a fact?

    I have already --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2714.008" stopTime="2715.249">

speaker="william_m_bennett" startTime="2715.249" stopTime="2719.838">
    Mr. William M. Bennett 
    Well, the judge may not give such instruction under California law. 
    Second --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2719.838" stopTime="2722.694">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Did Chessman say that in fact he did?
speaker="william_m_bennett" startTime="2722.694" stopTime="2792.124">
    Mr. William M. Bennett 
    Well, yes. 
    I -- I can answer that most fully, Your Honor, in this way. 
    It was never said until 1954, and then in a petition for writ of habeas corpus for the first time, the claim was made that Judge Fricke had told the jury they must return the death penalty. 
    That was the allegation. 
    We denied it. 
    And subsequently, that was sent to Judge Goodman along with the fraud and collusion. 
    And Judge Goodman had in his courtroom Judge Fricke, two lady jurors, who sat in the original trial, Cecile Oskin (ph), the county clerk, who sat throughout the entire trial, Leavy, the prosecutor, who was there throughout the entire trial. 
    Everyone of those witnesses, without exception said, "No such instruction was given." 
    Now, on the other side of the table, there was not produced a single witness who said that he or she had heard such language. 
    And so, that language of Judge Denman's, while it appears is -- is grossly inaccurate. 
    The proof of that allegation in Chessman's petition has never come forward nor frankly will it because it wasn't said.

    Mr. William M. Bennett 
    There was actually an offer made from Judge Goodman to Mr. Chessman to have Fraser's ability tested on the stand to the extent of the reporter going into chambers and transcribing and the offer was refused by Mr. Davis. 
    You can draw your own conclusions.

    Well, but am I not also entitled with all the conclusions from the statement of a judge, include that I have reliable statements taking and thinking Judge Goodman here for this sense of relevance, who, unless you tell me the quotations are inaccurate except the things that are set forth on page 34 and 35. 
    The Judge then said I don't care if you it move it up to the hills. 
    It wouldn't affect me. 
    How -- how dependable are these by me if they're not found.

    Mr. William M. Bennett 
    Well, but Your Honor, if -- if we're talking now by Judge Goodman's language, he said no question that Chessman would have been entitled to reversal if it's -- it's preceded by an "if". 
    He doesn't say this --

    Mr. William M. Bennett 
    Well, the reason Judge Goodman was doing that, of course, was because he was -- he was limited.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2935.209" stopTime="2948.444">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    I -- I advise you to suggest. 
    All I'm saying is that when he -- on page 34, I don't think the Supreme Court is going to be spending 4 days leave to determine the accuracy of his good grounds. 
    Whether they did or not, I'm not going to do it.
speaker="william_m_bennett" startTime="2948.444" stopTime="2949.058">
    Mr. William M. Bennett 
    Yes. 
    But Your Honor --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2949.058" stopTime="2957.827">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    What kind of a judicial mind have you for the determination of an issue if the Judge says, I'm not going to be concerned with that issue.
speaker="william_m_bennett" startTime="2957.827" stopTime="3002.002">
    Mr. William M. Bennett 
    But, Your Honor, the fact to the matter is, as one of the other justices said, that there was almost no limit upon what Mr. Chessman could prove in that proceeding before Judge Goodman, if he could. 
    And we talked about the notes being accurate and what Judge Goodman permitted. 
    Let's look at it this way, the charges made that Judge Fricke said, "Bring in the death penalty." 
    Now, to demonstrate that he didn't say it, proof was taken in the Court. 
    Now, the notes, as transcribed, don't contain it. 
    And on top of that, we have five or six witnesses in Judge Goodman's court who say, “They didn't hear it.” 
    So, isn't there some basis for concluding, well, if the notes don't say it and if the witnesses say they didn't hear it and if Mr. Chessman produced nobody who says he did hear it, that therefore possibly, the notes might just be right.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="3002.002" stopTime="3014.523">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    There other considerations if -- if we've correctly informed that what are for the transcribed notes of the final -- the final notes that the underlying transcription by Mr. Fraser's not available.
speaker="william_m_bennett" startTime="3014.523" stopTime="3037.100">
    Mr. William M. Bennett 
    Well, but Your Honor, isn't the answer to that is this that if there's -- we could talk about this forever but there has to be a time in a judicial proceeding when proof has to start marching forward. 
    And if the contention is made that this was so and if they didn't produce a single witness to establish it, we could talk about it endlessly but the fact to the matter is, the State has proved that it did not occur in a federal court. 
    We presented the witnesses.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="3037.100" stopTime="3058.053">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Your answer proves it and -- as a matter of -- of authority of a document as what is colloquy, if I'm presented for the document which you represent a lot of underlying data what is essential is that the underlying data in order to find out what is the final form of the transcription represents the underlying data --
speaker="william_m_bennett" startTime="3058.053" stopTime="3058.454">
    Mr. William M. Bennett 
    Well, the underlying --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="3058.454" stopTime="3060.025">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    That would be the problem here.
speaker="william_m_bennett" startTime="3060.025" stopTime="3068.082">
    Mr. William M. Bennett 
    The underlying data, if the Court please, are the legible shorthand symbols of deceased reporter, Perry. 
    I think that's the beginning answer of that.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="3068.082" stopTime="3081.914">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Well, that might be. 
    We now have, what Mr. Fraser said is the transcription, although, he first did some raw things, some rough notes we could destroy -- but I don't understand.
speaker="william_m_bennett" startTime="3081.914" stopTime="3090.250">
    Mr. William M. Bennett 
    Well, if the Court please, that the reason there were notes is because I've got notes here for an argument, I have notes for a brief and I just don't say them after I'm finished in those part.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="3090.250" stopTime="3095.438">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Well, speaking of the determination of the weight to be attached to your argument is not your own notes.
speaker="william_m_bennett" startTime="3095.438" stopTime="3322.844">
    Mr. William M. Bennett 
    That's correct, Your Honor. 
    But all I can say again is that, well, I'd like to go into another point if the Court please. 
    Now, so far as the due process is concerned, we're dealing here with -- with an appeal and this Court have said that the State need not confer an appeal but just so it's conferred equally to all -- the requirements of the Federal Constitution are met. 
    Now, I cited the case of Avery against Alabama in the brief in the -- that presents an instance where a man who was arrested, arraigned, tried, and convicted within a period of four days.He was represented by a court appointed counsel. 
    They had asked for additional time to make a better defense and upon conviction, that became the basis for a motion for a new trial. 
    And this Court said in the Avery case that because on the motion for a new trial, there was no showing made that a different or better defense would have occurred, therefore, there was not like a due process. 
    Now, let's relate the philosophy of that case to the present situation. 
    The California Supreme Court had said that even allowing all of the inaccuracies and omissions of Chessman, the result upon appeal would not have been affected. 
    Judge Goodman reviewed the somewhat startling claims of fraud, collusion, conspiracy, improper use of notes, improper consultation with witnesses, and he found a reporter eminently qualified, he found no such mandatory death penalty, instruction had been given, and in short, that the best possible record was prepared. 
    And In fact, there was no showing ever made that the record that's prepared wasn't in fact a better record than would have been prepared by the dead reporter, Perry. 
    So, that we have here, in addition of those things, the voice of Chessman himself at the settlement hearing in the document which I just picked up, all of his list of objections and things that should be disallowed. 
    Now, never at anytime throughout the nine or ten-year course of this case has he been able to do anymore than say, “I have the right to be present but don't call upon me to prove what different result would obtained, and I have made allegations in the past which have been upon scrutiny by the courts destroyed. 
    But I still assert that I have the bare right to have the entire proceeding reversed, why, because I was not there even though I can't show a different result." 
    Now, we don't think that's the law. 
    The California Supreme Court in reviewing his record and his list of omissions said that they were looking to the record on appeal to determine any substantial errors which would call -- cause a reversal. 
    Now, this Court in the due process cases, particularly dealing with counsel reverses only when there is some error has been made out. 
    And if there hasn't been error made out to the prejudice of the defendant, the result is usually affirmed. 
    Now, we're dealing here with a process which admittedly is unique but it's created by a State. 
    And we concede, perhaps, it isn't ideal although there's no showing made that it isn't perfectly suited to the role that you'd fill on appeal, and perhaps, it doesn't need every conceivable hardship. 
    But recall now that this remedy was taken by California or this procedure because among other reasons, Chessman himself elected not to furnish to the trial court his version of what went on.And so, we were compelled to do it. 
    Now --

speaker="william_m_bennett" startTime="3346.286" stopTime="3404.546">
    Mr. William M. Bennett 
    Well, let's make that clear. 
    The transcript was filed in the Court on April 11th, 1949. 
    It was immediately mailed to Chessman at San Quentin State Prison. 
    At San Quentin State Prison, he had the period of time from April 3rd, 1949 to June 1st, 1949 within which to read the record with a critical eye, which he did. 
    He asked for one extension of time and in the affidavit seeking the extension, he said to the California Supreme Court that he was quote "exhaustively studying the record for error." 
    And then on the settlement dates on June 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Los Angeles, this document I have in my hand was there, mailed there by Chessman from San Quentin and this document contains a list of every error he claimed occurred, every omission that was there and all the rest of it. 
    And so --

    His views were presented. 
    Now, again getting back to this due process and the -- the bare of assertion of the right without a showing of any prejudice, what may we ask more could he do with reference to this transcript then point out those things he thought which were in error 
    Well that's what he did in this document and he had to do it in writing before the judge could consider it.

    But I -- I do say that if the Court is to be true to what is the apparent meaning of repetitious and stale claims and habeas corpus actions that they should mark some finality to these proceedings because if -- it does not become final ultimately. 
    I suppose we could be here next year and the year thereafter because he thinks of a new idea. 
    Now, I say this most sincerely to the Court. 
    If this were the kind of a case were we had a method not approved just to fairness by a Court, a manner not approved just to fairness by a federal court, a transcript not given to him or he didn't have time to write down all of his objections, if these were a trial process at which his present was necessary and vital, then we'd have a far different case. 
    But this is strictly an appellate proceeding. 
    The federal courts have -- have so held it, and they pointed out the -- the duty of a State with reference to an appeal and it's not a Griffin against Illinois situation. 
    On the contrary, unlike Illinois, we paid an exorbitant rate to have a transcript prepared for this man, why? 
    So that somebody could find an error and reverse his conviction if possible. 
    That's what California did for this man. 
    The invalidity of the many, many attacks upon it must be apparent by now because not once, not once and fortunately we've got a trial before Judge Goodman has a single one been sustained. 
    Now, the State of California feels that we've done everything compelled by law. 
    We don't feel that we've violated any due process requirements. 
    We don't feel that we're at liberty dealing with the people of our State to cast out upon them, even under lock and key and under guard, a man so dangerous as this. 
    For example, we've got a man in California who recently killed 13 people and is quite proud of it. 
    Now, is any judge when to take upon himself, the risk or the presumption to release that man into society for an appellant proceeding? 
    As I said before, this Court doesn't compel the federal courts to do it in oral argument but why should a higher rule be placed upon a State? 
    And so far as the cases in due process talk about state procedures that are setup that aren't perfect and all that sort of thing, I would like to know what -- what answer can be furnished by way of remedy to the situation when the reporter dies under a California Rules other than that which we did.

    I suppose all the testimony and trials are important but I wouldn't classify this is the most important --

    We attempted to find it at the noon recess and we couldn't find such, Your Honor. 
    And I -- I'd like to say this along those lines. 
    The two counts were really concerned with your -- our counts 711, the death penalty counts. 
    Regina Johnson testified within the first 646 pages. 
    She was examined on direct. 
    She was cross-examined by Mr. Chessman. 
    Mary Meza, the other kidnapped victim and subjected to the sexual acts of degradation, she testified within the first 646 pages prepared by -- from Perry's dictation. 
    She was cross-examined by Chessman. 
    Now, that's the important testimony in this case so far as the death penalty counts are concerned. 
    And if we retain but those two, it doesn't matter as to the rest. 
    And the balance of the testimony following the 646 page is necessarily devoted to most of the other counts.

    Mr. William M. Bennett 
    Well, thank Your Honor. 
    There is one thing I -- I would like to say about the counsel cases. 
    Sometimes it's hard to grasp a rule from the counsel cases coming from this Court, but when they do read due process into those cases, they find prejudicial error. 
    That's my language, as I understand the cases in those situations. 
    I haven't yet found a case in which this Court has reversed on notions of due process where no different other or better result would obtain and that's this case. 
    Now, I can only emphasize to the Court again the State determinations of the contentions here, the prior federal determinations and if California had any notion that what we did was less than completely fair here or if we have any notion as to guilt, we'd be the first to say so. 
    But we consider that under the standards of this Court as to state procedures that there can be no valid criticism of that which we did. 
    Let's again go back to the idea that Mr. Chessman had a -- a right, an avenue which was open to him and he didn't take it. 
    And so we prepared the record for his appeal. 
    Now, --
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="4263.106" stopTime="4311.227">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    What do you say to this proposition? 
    That as a result of the habeas corpus proceeding, this present proceeding, there's been a developed material which everybody seems to recognize, it was not in Chessman's possession at the time of the state court review of this record. 
    And that therefore, the state court has never passed upon the settlement of that record in light of (a), the interviewing of these witnesses by the prosecutor and -- and the stenographer and (b), the relationship between Chessman between the stenographer and the prosecutor.
speaker="william_m_bennett" startTime="4311.227" stopTime="4354.896">
    Mr. William M. Bennett 
    Well, Your Honor, at what point that came out to me frankly becomes somewhat immaterial except as we're concern about Brown against Allen in the application to have the right to raise question from the state court. 
    But to the merits of those contentions, the relationship that has been fully going into before Judge Goodman and this Court can decide that argument on the merits upon his findings of fact that the relationship did not taint any of the trial transcript. 
    The allegation made for the first time in 1954 that Judge Fricke said, “You must bring in the death penalty.” 
    I cannot conceive that the closure --
