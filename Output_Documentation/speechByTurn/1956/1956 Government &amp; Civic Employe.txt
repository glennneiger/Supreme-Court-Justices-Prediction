    Mr. Gordon Madison 
    May it please the Court. 
    There isn't anything mystic or mysterious about the working to labor union. 
    To put it generally known or how they operate in order to accomplish there objectives. 
    As to general, all of them believe in the principle of collective-bargaining and they attempt to bring about collective-bargaining agreements. 
    They use strike in such instances. 
    Where union and non-union members become in daily contact, you'll find in sentence on paragraph 1 that should be close shop.

    Has Alabama experienced strikes in the case of Government employees, State employees?
speaker="gordon_madison" startTime="54.320" stopTime="55.662">
    Mr. Gordon Madison 
    That is prohibited?
speaker="william_o_douglas" startTime="55.662" stopTime="61.056">
    Justice William O. Douglas 
    No. 
    Has it experience in strikes of -- by state employees?
speaker="gordon_madison" startTime="61.056" stopTime="309.225">
    Mr. Gordon Madison 
    Insofar as I know only there may have been some threats. 
    They do deal sometimes in picketing. 
    Then we all know they have designed that this place to the stores, some other places unfair to organized labor. 
    They insist sometimes on the collection of dues. 
    They asked the employer to take out the money and remit. 
    In their meeting they do have political discussions about candidates which they have a right to do, to a certain extent. 
    And that they used to keep both on regular on (Inaudible) I'm not sure, United State Senate. 
    We have under the merit system, political activity is prohibited. 
    Here's where the borderline will come in these meetings. 
    It's difficult to determine. 
    Except that they have a right to say one will vote or against. 
    You don't have the right to get into organization to make speeches and go out and engage in open political activities. 
    Now, it seems to me that which one all of these things, that could be provided for by the State in its wisdom would be for the legislature to determine. 
    Maybe some or all of them might constitutionally be prohibited by stand of state employee. 
    They cannot belong to a union which engages in these activities. 
    Certainly, that's true as to collective-bargaining. 
    I don't know all the decisions of this Court. 
    You can't read them all and you can't keep up with all them in all the state court decisions. 
    But I believe this Court has said somewhere along the line that collective-bargaining has no place in public employment. 
    Now, the District Court has said when this case was before it, contention was made that this Solomon Act which has been read to you all is unconstitutional on its face. 
    Well, if there is any discrimination in this Act it appears on its page. 
    The District Court said, we don't say there's no way to construe this Act in a constitutional manner. 
    If it had been unconstitutional on its face for any reason, would there have been any logical reason for abstaining and sending the case back to the state court? 
    Wouldn't if federal court have proceeded, is there no way other than to say it's unconstitutional, would have struck down right then. 
    And when it came up here wouldn't this Court have said, â€œNo. 
    We are not going to affirm. 
    There is no possible way it can be constitutional. 
    So, why send it back?" 
    This Court didn't do this -- do that. 
    It affirmed to stay in the lower court. 
    Now, when the union -- and I'll make this point whether there's anything to it or not, I don't know what I'm going to mention. 
    Up to that time, the -- the employee have seen and the union have been thriving together. 
    But when they started in the in the Circuit Court of Montgomery County seeking a construction of this statute, the employee member was dropped or he didn't participate in the suit.And the union alone brought it. 
    Why? 
    I don't know. 
    The other side may answer that (Inaudible) anyway. 
    And then the issue was formulated there. 
    It seems like it was studiously avoided to bring in any question about the constitutionality of Solomon Act. 
    Now, we want you to tell us by declaratory judgment because we've got a dispute between us, as to whether or not you are a labor union or a labor organization within the meaning of the Solomon Act.

    At the A.B.C. Board had refused to bargain with them and hence they had ceased any attempt to bargain collectively. 
    They then said that we have from that time on conducted merely a discussion group. 
    And being merely a discussion group, we say that the Solomon Act does not apply to us. 
    And we ask this Court to hold that we are a union and our activities as such. 
    That we do not come within the provisions of the Solomon Act.

    That's right, sir. 
    And I want to state that's the basis for the Supreme Court of Alabama decision. 
    There should be no mistake between them. 
    Let me get that clear. 
    The Supreme Court of Alabama went into the rules of this organization, went into the Constitution. 
    It went into the law of Mr. Philip Murray when it was setting up, this organization all of which provide for collective-bargaining and it's in -- one of the main purposes and objectives of the union. 
    It went into the clauses whereby the -- the member should take an oath to abide by those rules and regulations. 
    That then none of them can't be changed without approval by the executive committee. 
    They went into the question that this union is connected with the International Union. 
    And in that constitution of the International provided for collective-bargaining. 
    And that those rules and regulations constitute a contract between a union and the members and between the members themselves. 
    And it then went on to say that a local union merely on the whim of a representative or the local group cannot change the declared purposes and objectives of that national or international organization. 
    And then they --

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Madison, I haven't quite got an answer to -- to the question. 
    I understood you to say that petitioner, in its brief in the state court and its argument represented to the Court that there was not a constitutional question involved. 
    That it was only the question as to whether the ex-conduct of -- of the petitioner constituted or brought them in -- within the act itself. 
    Now, is that -- I -- I just want to know if I'm correct in -- in my recollection of what you said?

    Mr. Gordon Madison 
    Well, Your Honor I will put it this way because it -- it maybe important, you'll think. 
    I don't want misstating it. 
    My recollection is that it occurs in both briefs. 
    I know it does in the brief filed on behalf of the State. 
    What I know is that we did argue -- argue the constitutional question for fear that the Court might say this is of such public importance or something.You go ahead and deal with it anyhow. 
    What we stated before we did that, we didn't think that question was in and had been raised.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    But you -- you went beyond that. 
    You also said, if I understood you correctly, that the pleadings disclosed that the constitutional -- that there was no constitutional attack on the Solomon Act.

    Mr. Gordon Madison 
    That -- well, I -- it -- it doesn't it -- I'll put it this way. 
    I'll put in the reverse. 
    There's nothing mentioned in the pleadings that the Solomon Act is unconstitutional.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="723.440" stopTime="754.948">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    All right. 
    What -- would you mind stating what is meant, what -- what proper inferences may be drawn from the judgment of the Montgomery County decree saying the prayer for injunctive relief is denied. 
    But what's the significance of that?
speaker="gordon_madison" startTime="754.948" stopTime="777.104">
    Mr. Gordon Madison 
    Well, they asked that the -- the members of the A.B.C. Board and this manager of the store, the supervisor of all to be enjoined from enforcing the provisions of the Solomon Act. 
    Now, they did that on a theory, I guess, if they thought they were not under it and A.B.C. Board was attempting to apply it to them, that you ought to be enjoined from that.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="777.104" stopTime="790.693">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    And did the prayer, that's your remark a little earlier that the pleadings did not attack the constitutionality? 
    That covers I take it, the terms of the prayer by the complainant before the Montgomery County Court?

    Our recollection is correct.

    Wherefore (2) proceedings under it or acts under it should be enjoined. 
    As far as, my recollection am I wrong or right in -- in having an impression that in your State, you can, one can get an advice from somebody.

speaker="gordon_madison" startTime="814.930" stopTime="819.245">

    In order to enable the appellants and I point that isn't one of them that makes (Inaudible), showing the remedy, he might have in the state court. 
    And then insisted in that court, that the District Court then pass on the constitutional issues which it raised when it first filed the suit. 
    Then the three-judge District Court, we had a hearing and argument up there. 
    We introduced the record that before the Supreme Court of Alabama, introduced the briefs on both sides. 
    And then Judge Graves who was the presiding judge in that case along with Judge Grooms and Judge Lynn. 
    They stated that they had given careful consideration to the decision of the lower court, that is the lower state court and the decision of the Supreme Court of Alabama and used the language, as I recall that they were clear to the conclusion that the state courts had not construed the Solomon Act in an unconstitutional manner.

    Mr. Gordon Madison 
    Now, I do wish to deal just briefly in conclusion with this. 
    As I said, that the courts have said, this Act could be construed on a constitutional manner.I think that means something. 
    I think that take cares of some their argument about discrimination. 
    But as I pointed out, that the labor relations in different parts of the State of Alabama, as if the different county Government body, the different city Government bodies and difference maybe among the teachers and the Board of Education. 
    It may be necessary and desirable into some parts for the local communities to legislate by ordinance of resolutions or by rule or some other way. 
    Either one way another on these questions. 
    Now, yesterday, Mr. Chief Justice has been asking about the higher institutions of learning.

    Mr. Gordon Madison 
    Over in the University of Alabama, are possibly our two largest. 
    They are governed by Board of Trustees. 
    And it -- the -- it is provided on their constitution that the sole management and control of those two institutions, shall vest in the Board of Trustees. 
    Now, maybe the others are covered in the exemption containing the statute or that's are not covered by the Solomon Act, to -- to have Board of Trustees or some other civil board. 
    They undoubtedly have rule-making power just exactly like of County Board of Education or City Board of Education. 
    If they adopted the rules, the question would be as -- as I conceive it to be whether not that rule that they've adopted proscribing public employment, of course, of membership to the labor union whether or not that was a reasonable rule. 
    I believe this Court have said that there is constitutional protection to a public employee against unreasonable arbitrary action.Now, with sum on all of these reasons I pointed out about the activities of -- of the labor union they maybe entirely in order -- entirely order permissible in private employment but not in public employment.

    And in the -- but this qualification which I do not think is a qualification that the appellants here urged their construction on the ground that a different construction would raise constitutional questions. 
    But the issue of whether or not the Act itself is constitutional was not as an issue put before that Court. 
    You say in this present suit, an answer was filed by the respondent and the sole issue is whether or not the complaint is the labor union or other labor organizations within the meaning of the Solomon Act. 
    And the reply brief by the present appellant takes up questions that were evidently put from the bench in the argument before your Supreme Court and the reply brief does not raise constitutionality but raises the question whether this is an organization that comes within it by virtue of its activities or whether it's the debating or a cultural organization. 
    I think you're wholly correct -- you are wholly correct in my reading of the brief as to the issue that were put before the Supreme Court of Alabama.

   Argument of Milton I. Shadur
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1449.350" stopTime="1454.305">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Shadur, and would you respond to that particular phase of the case please?
speaker="milton_i_shadur" startTime="1454.305" stopTime="1625.046">
    Mr. Milton I. Shadur 
    Yes, Your Honor I will. 
    Mr. Chief Justice if it please the Court. 
    I think that a good deal of clarification can be obtained here if we see exactly what the course of this litigation was and why the issues were raised in the places that they were. 
    We start out with the immediately prior to the passage of the Solomon Act with this union which engaged in activities which we will assume for the moment are constitutionally protected. 
    Now, then, the Solomon Act is passed at that point. 
    In literal terms the Solomon Act applies to the point of union. 
    At that point employees begin to leave it and the union goes to a point where from 250 members you end up with one. 
    We, thereupon, go into the Federal District Court in order to challenge the constitutionality of the Solomon Act. 
    And the Court tells us, "No. 
    You can't do that because although perhaps the Solomon Act literally read, is unconstitutional. 
    We cannot presume that the Alabama courts will so construed it." 
    They then say, "We will abstain from exercising our jurisdiction until such time as a construction of the statute may be obtained from the Alabama courts." 
    Now, then, we go into the state courts. 
    We file the same complaint because we have the same activities. 
    But because we're doing it in order to obtain a construction so that the constitutional question which is then pending before the District Court, the United States District Court can be raised with the benefit of an authoritative construction of the Act, we then raise it in exactly the manner that Mr. Justice Frankfurter has stated. 
    We put the fact situation before the Court. 
    At that point having put the fact situation before the Court we say, give us a declaratory judgment on this real controversy which exists between this union and the State of Alabama as to whether this statute on these activities can apply to this union. 
    Because if it is applied, it would raise serious constitutional questions. 
    And we stated specifically in the complaint that the purpose of this action, and this is at pages 77 and 78 of the record. 
    This bill for declaration of complainant's rights is brought in part pursuant to the judgment of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Alabama Case Number 7466. 
    And we asserted that the respondents --

speaker="milton_i_shadur" startTime="1645.355" stopTime="1670.305">
    Mr. Milton I. Shadur 
    In the state court, the only reference to a possible allegation of unconstitutionality is the one that Mr. Justice Brennan referred to in paragraph 10. 
    But we specifically brought this action for construction, for a declaratory judgment because the federal court already had jurisdiction, for purposes of determining the constitutionality.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="1670.305" stopTime="1684.303">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Well, it'd fair to say that you neither sort nor desired a determination of the Alabama court on the issue of constitutionality because you felt that was pending in the federal court and wanted it determined there?
speaker="milton_i_shadur" startTime="1684.303" stopTime="1722.514">
    Mr. Milton I. Shadur 
    That's correct, Your Honor. 
    We already had a case pending. 
    The only reason for any Alabama state court proceeding at all is because the judgement of the Alabama state courts on what the statute means, on the construction of the statute, is binding on the federal courts but the court which first had jurisdiction was the Federal District Court, the three-judge court. 
    That was a court in which the constitutional question had been raised and was pending subject only to the obtaining of a construction to see whether our constitutional question may not have been premature but --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1722.514" stopTime="1754.331">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    But must the Alabama Supreme Court decide constitutionality on an argumentative implication that the issue before Federal District Court involved constitutionality if they construe it this way? 
    Can Alabama Supreme Court -- were the tedious people, and there's a good deal of respectful autonomy between state courts and federal courts. 
    Why can't the Alabama or the Supreme Court says if you want us to declare these unconstitutional aspects?
speaker="milton_i_shadur" startTime="1754.331" stopTime="1785.389">
    Mr. Milton I. Shadur 
    Well, Your Honor, the Alabama Supreme Court in the question as presented to us, is confronted with an argument that if it construes the statute so as to cover these activities, serious constitutional problems will be raised. 
    If the Alabama Supreme Court, nevertheless, applies the statute to us, the constitutional question which we have preserved in the three-judge District Court is at point available to us and ripe for determination.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1785.389" stopTime="1833.736">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    But -- but really if you say to the Alabama Supreme Court or to this the constitutional questions are avoided if you construe it one way rather than another, that isn't a necessary and automatic rule that it must construe that way. 
    That is a proper consideration as this Court indicated yesterday. 
    If you please, an important one in construction. 
    But the Alabama Supreme Court for within its power, about which we can say nothing, thought the consideration which were urged to give it one construction rather than another, didn't require that construction. 
    And it came to an end. 
    And it -- in its determination with that. 
    So, that isn't an implication that it would declare that the statute unconstitutional if that issue were pressed before it.
speaker="milton_i_shadur" startTime="1833.736" stopTime="1833.784">
    Mr. Milton I. Shadur 
    That's correct.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1833.784" stopTime="1836.854">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    That both progress themselves with issues that are pressed before it.
speaker="milton_i_shadur" startTime="1836.854" stopTime="1837.401">
    Mr. Milton I. Shadur 
    That's correct, Your Honor.

    Mr. Milton I. Shadur

    Subsequent to that ruling, we came back to the United States District Court and said we have an authoritative construction, which is what you sent us to Alabama for. 
    And having obtained that construction we know say, that this statute as so applied to us, is unconstitutional.

    But then if we should rule upon the -- on issue as now presented to us and would mean that we might be declaring unconstitutional, an act of the State of Alabama, the Supreme Court of Alabama has not passed on that issue.

    Mr. Milton I. Shadur 
    Well, Your Honor, in -- in passing on the application of the statute the state Supreme Court has reviewed in all aspects, whether this statute can or cannot covered our union. 
    In exactly, the same manner as for example in the Spector cases, which came before this Court, in which there was also the situation of abstention from jurisdiction. 
    And after this Court directed the plaintiffs in that case who were attacking the unconstitutionality of the Connecticut taxing statute, directed those people to go to the state courts of Connecticut. 
    The Supreme Court of Connecticut refused to pass on the -- on the question of the federal constitutional right. 
    It decided what the construction of the statute was, in light of the fact, that there was already a District Court proceeding pending. 
    And armed with that construction, the plaintiffs then came back to the federal courts and came to this Court and this Court decided the merits that that statute as so applied by the Connecticut Court was unconstitutional.

    Justice Harold Burton 
    This case, the Federal District Court held the case and -- and asked you to go back and exhaust your state remedies. 
    You went back and exhausted them on the -- on the statutory construction but didn't say a thing about the constitutional question that's not been exhausted. 
    Although it's within their jurisdiction to pass on it.
speaker="milton_i_shadur" startTime="2353.788" stopTime="2392.303">
    Mr. Milton I. Shadur 
    Well, the exhaustion of the state remedies that was directed by the United States District Court was to secure a construction. 
    Because the thing that the United States District Court hypothesized, Your Honor, was that it was possible that this statute although literally it did not so read, might be applied only to cover an organization in which members belong for the purpose of engaging in collective-bargaining. 
    That issue is no longer in this case. 
    This has -- we have arrived at a conclusive construction and we know have the opportunity to raise this problem.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Are there any authoritative finding on the part of your -- your Supreme Court in Alabama, to the effect that this Act as applied to you is constitutional?
speaker="milton_i_shadur" startTime="2407.302" stopTime="2409.978">
    Mr. Milton I. Shadur 
    An authoritative finding in the Alabama Supreme Court?
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2409.978" stopTime="2410.816">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Yes.
speaker="milton_i_shadur" startTime="2410.816" stopTime="2418.158">
    Mr. Milton I. Shadur 
    There is no specific statement in the holding with respect to that problem, to my recollection. 
    I might say --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2418.158" stopTime="2423.390">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    How -- how can we know then that they would find that -- that is the fact?
speaker="milton_i_shadur" startTime="2423.390" stopTime="2496.691">
    Mr. Milton I. Shadur 
    The Attorney General, also argued and much more directly than our argument in the briefs, in the Alabama Supreme Court, that the Solomon Act is valid and is not subject to constitutional objection. 
    Necessarily, the Alabama Supreme Court's decisions with the arguments that had been placed before it, subsumed the constitutional question even though that they may not have said in so many terms. 
    We find that we can constitutionally do so. 
    They have said, "Well, we don't think that the activities of these people are strictly such and so. 
    We also find this and therefore this people are a labor union within the meaning of the Solomon Act." 
    But having had the arguments presented to them, if they did, both by the Attorney General and by ourselves, they necessarily had to pass that problem in order to find the statute applied. 
    Because if they found the statute applied and as so applied was unconstitutional, then they would either have to say, "We will construe the statue differently" or we will say that it would apply, but having so applied it, it is unconstitutional statue.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well, but -- you -- you rely heavily on the question of discrimination here.
speaker="milton_i_shadur" startTime="2503.901" stopTime="2505.725">
    Mr. Milton I. Shadur 
    That's correct, Your Honor.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2505.725" stopTime="2510.926">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    You did not argue that all before the Supreme Court of the State, as I understand.

    Mr. Milton I. Shadur 
    That's right, Your Honor.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2511.765" stopTime="2533.766">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Now, suppose that we didn't take any stock in the rest of your argument, but did rely on that. 
    Would there have been a finding in your Supreme Court based upon on argument, that -- that it was not subject to the objection of discrimination?
speaker="milton_i_shadur" startTime="2533.766" stopTime="2570.434">
    Mr. Milton I. Shadur 
    Well, in order to avoid that problem, I am prepared to say that the -- that discrimination argument from our point of view is a constitutional argument in this Court. 
    We would -- if -- if that were a preliminarily question, we would consider that only to the extent that it indicated a violation of due process. 
    So, there is no -- in other words, that the due process argument is enhanced by the exclusions from the statue to the same extent that the basic classification is arbitrary. 
    So, are the exclusions arbitrary and show a due process violation.

    No, Your Honor.
