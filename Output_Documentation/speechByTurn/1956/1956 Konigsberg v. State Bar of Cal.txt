    Mr. Edward Mosk 
    Thank you, Your Honor. 
    Mr. Chief Justice, Associate Justices, Mr. Belcher. 
    This case arise before this Court by reason of the action of the Committee of Bar Examiners in the State of California in denying the petitioner admission to the Bar of California by reason of his alleged views, opinions and associations. 
    Under the State Bar Act of California, the Committee of Bar Examiners is empowered to certify to the Supreme Court applicants who fulfill certain requirements. 
    There is no dispute that the petitioner here fulfilled all of the educational, age, residence and other requirements of this sort. 
    There are in addition, two other requirements. 
    One is that the applicant be a person of good moral character, and the second is that the legislature in California has said that no person who advocates the overthrow of the Government by force and violence or other unconstitutional means shall be certified. 
    Now, shortly before the time that the petitioner here took the bar examination in the State of California, he was called in before the Committee of Bar Examiners and asked certain questions relative to his qualifications. 
    He thereafter, with the consent of the Committee took the bar examination and passed it so that there are no impediments other than the position of the Committee of Bar Examiners that the petitioner here has not sustained his burden of proof. 
    That he is a person of good moral character, and they state he has not sustained his burden of proof that he does not believe in the overthrow of the Government by force and violence. 
    Now, over a period of time, there were four hearings held before the Committee of Bar Examiners. 
    Three, before this other in subsection and then a final hearing in effect that de novo hearing before the full committee of these bar examiners for the State of California. 
    In the course of these hearings, the following facts were basically established.First of all, the petitioner himself, the background of the petitioner, a graduate of Ohio State University in 1931, later getting a master's degree in Social Work, taught History and English Literature in the Cleveland High School. 
    He was a supervisor in the Department of Health here in Washington, D.C. 
    He was a Research Director of the Council of Social Agencies in Los Angeles. 
    He was a supervisor for the State Relief Administration in California. 
    He was a Director of Social Services in the City of Hope Sanitarium in Duarte, California.Subsequently, in the -- during the war, he became a captain and he -- and was in charge of information and education for some 400,000 soldiers in Germany in the Seventh Army. 
    And three times, he was a candidate for public office in Los Angeles, twice for the Board of Education and once for the State Assembly. 
    The record contains no single fact other than those which I shall refer to in a moment, indicating anything about his work record, his personal record, his life in the community of Los Angeles other than the very highest recommendation as to his character. 
    In addition, the petitioner brought before the Committee of Bar Examiners some 40 letters from every single stage of his life as a social worker in the hospitals, in the army, everything, in -- in the university. 
    He brought letters from persons like Right Reverend Monsignor Dwyer, from Rabbi Jed Cohen, community leaders all indicating that he had an impeccable personal record in his community. 
    Now, at the hearings, the Committee commenced by introducing and showing to the petitioner a series of articles which he had written during a brief period of employment with a Los Angeles newspaper known as the California Eagle. 
    This is a newspaper of weekly circulation and primarily -- primary circulation is in the Negro community of Los Angeles. 
    These articles were vigorous, pungent, strong, challenging political articles but all dealing with the political -- were all commentaries on the political affairs of the day. 
    These articles were introduced and shown to the petitioner. 
    He acknowledged that he had written them over a period of about a year and he was asked at various times. 
    “Do you still believe the things that are in these articles? 
    Would you write the same articles today?” 
    And a number of questions of that sort. 
    Now, he further introduced testimony. 
    There was further introduced certain testimony that in one point he had appeared before a -- the California Senate Investigating Committee, commonly known as the Tenney Committee. 
    And he was asked whether the testimony that he had given at that time before that Committee would be his opinion at this time, and he was shown a written statement that he had introduced at that time and asked whether he still believe these things to be true. 
    Now, he was also asked whether or not he was a member of the Communist Party. 
    There was introduced a witness who came before the Committee who testified that sometime in 1941 or 1942, the petitioner had been a member of a small group in the Communist Party with this -- with this witness. 
    She was asked on cross-examination whether or not what was said at the meetings, she recalled nothing that was said in any of the meetings. 
    She was asked whether there was any discussion of advocacy of force and violence, she said, she didn't remember anything that anybody said including this petitioner at any of those meetings. 
    So that there was no evidence presented at the hearings other than the -- their testimony that he -- that this witness who incidentally went under cross-examination, when asked how she knew this petitioner she said, “Well, he's the only face in the room that's familiar to me, so he must be Konigsberg.” 
    But assuming that the -- that there was some element of identification, the only testimony that there was, was the bare testimony that he may have been a member of the Communist Party in 1940 or 1941. 
    Now, he was asked questions regarding an advocacy of force and violence. 
    He answered, responded to every such question and not once but about six times during the course of the hearings. 
    He said specifically, “I do not. 
    I never have. 
    I never will. 
    My entire record, my entire background is contrary to any belief in doctrines of force and violence.” 
    He did on one occasion respond to a question, “Are you a Communist?” 
    And he answered to this question, “no,” if you mean by that, a philosophical Communist. 
    There was some colloquy between the Committee and the petitioner at this point in which he indicated that what he was trying to distinguish was between his belief in Jeffersonian Democracy which did not mean advocacy of force and violence and their interpretation apparently of Communist Party membership. 
    So that he specifically denied that he was a Communist. 
    He declined to answer repeatedly saying that this is solely on the basis of high moral principle. 
    He said that this is not self-incrimination. 
    I am not relying on the Fifth Amendment. 
    I'm relying solely on the First Amendment and my -- my deep abiding feeling that you have no right to inquire into this area.

    Mr. Edward Mosk 
    The -- at the very beginning, Your Honor, there was some reference to his saying, “Well, you can bring lots of nameless informers.” 
    But I think a -- a careful examination of each of the references that he made would indicate that the basic reference was that on the basis of the First Amendment they had no right to inquire. 
    He did make such comments. 
    I think on perhaps one or two of the occasions.

    Yes. 
    There -- there were such references, Your Honor. 
    However, the -- the basic position that he took with regard to his refusal was this is a First Amendment position and you have no right to inquire. 
    Thereafter, of course, they did bring a -- they did bring a witness before them and from that point on certainly, any references that he made were always to his -- his basic First Amendment position.

    That is not abridgment of speech.

    Mr. Edward Mosk 
    Well, it -- it comes, Your Honor, from the -- the whole feeling that one must not -- we must not encroach on the right of association.

    Is that what you're arguing?
speaker="edward_mosk" startTime="640.917" stopTime="644.658">
    Mr. Edward Mosk 
    That is part of our argument, Your Honor, but it is not the basis in which we're here.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    (Voice Overlap) all vague and looks upon the First Amendment. 
    The First Amendment would be -- what Fifth Amendment would (Inaudible) to other people?
speaker="edward_mosk" startTime="652.307" stopTime="676.905">
    Mr. Edward Mosk 
    Well, what we have here, Your Honor is the -- by the use of this testimony and the kind of questions that they are asking him in the area in which he declined to answer, we have a situation where they are coming up with an arbitrary determination of his unfitness, so far as his good moral character is concerned.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="676.905" stopTime="692.170">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    I can understand that, but I would like to have a particular delineation of definite and the indication, what part, what in the Fourteenth Amendment other than arbitrary determination that he can't practice law. 
    I understand that.
speaker="edward_mosk" startTime="692.170" stopTime="692.589">
    Mr. Edward Mosk 
    That's correct.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="692.589" stopTime="710.297">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    I understand that. 
    But when you talk First Amendment, you talk something that I don't understand unless you define it. 
    Every time we got any objection in this Court, now they only say First Amendment as I've said it, other claims refers specifically and all sorts (Inaudible), the First Amendment, the next amendment apply.
speaker="edward_mosk" startTime="710.297" stopTime="732.503">
    Mr. Edward Mosk 
    Well, in this case Your Honor, what we have is a -- and I -- I think is basically a margin of the general freedom to be -- to be free from inquiry into one's beliefs, one's associations which are generally interpreted as coming within the First Amendment protections as protected by --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="732.503" stopTime="740.302">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    What about the general interpretation? 
    Do you mean to say the state statutes require him in his -- lots of belief that a man has?

    Mr. Edward Mosk 
    I would not say that they cannot, Your Honor.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    It's all right. 
    Then, you have to be very particular --

    Mr. Edward Mosk 
    All right, in --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="744.412" stopTime="752.505">

    What is the inquiry with us to testify about that disclose everything?
speaker="edward_mosk" startTime="752.505" stopTime="788.026">
    Mr. Edward Mosk 
    Right. 
    In this, the -- the substance of the First Amendment as it is grown as I understand it, Your Honor, is that there are areas of -- of speech, of political association which we say that society will prevent that the values to society are such that the encroachment of the State by asking questions or inquiring into on asking the person to give up his rights in this area is protected by the First Amendment.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="788.026" stopTime="791.140">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    I don't know such decision of this Court.
speaker="edward_mosk" startTime="791.140" stopTime="811.772">
    Mr. Edward Mosk 
    I think perhaps Your Honor, in a sense we may be asking this Court to go further than it has in any case in this area. 
    But in this case of course, what we have is a determination which comes within the arbitrary determinations of the Fourteenth Amendment and this of course is basically what we're -- we're --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="811.772" stopTime="813.654">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    I understand that (Inaudible)
speaker="edward_mosk" startTime="813.654" stopTime="814.004">
    Mr. Edward Mosk 
    I'm sorry, Your Honor.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="814.004" stopTime="814.681">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    I understand that.
speaker="edward_mosk" startTime="814.681" stopTime="815.737">
    Mr. Edward Mosk 
    All right.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="815.737" stopTime="847.455">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    I understand the claim that life or -- life and liberty over property may not arbitrarily that they could take, that is, without any justification on the part of the State to pursuant calling or the exercise of what has been deemed as human right. 
    I understand that. 
    When you talk First Amendment that goes from abracadabra, you loosely complete, gain others but you loosely complete.
speaker="edward_mosk" startTime="847.455" stopTime="850.790">
    Mr. Edward Mosk 
    Well, I -- I suspect that perhaps, I'm using it more loosely --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="850.790" stopTime="854.543">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    It's not that we shouldn't discuss that, I just want you to know it means nothing to me.
speaker="edward_mosk" startTime="854.543" stopTime="856.044">
    Mr. Edward Mosk 
    I -- I think perhaps Your Honor --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="856.044" stopTime="858.922">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    That's to close my analysis.
speaker="edward_mosk" startTime="858.922" stopTime="872.814">
    Mr. Edward Mosk 
    If I may, I think that by the time, perhaps I have concluded my remarks. 
    I may have been able to tie it up so that you will see a little more clearly what -- at least as we see it, how the two are tied up. 
    But basically of course, we're here on basically --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="872.814" stopTime="894.463">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    I just like you to know why I think this. 
    For decades some of us fought against this Court declaring stuff unconstitutional on vague general grounds and that's the law of human rights, the spirit of the Constitution and I think the objection to that law of applying the Constitution applies to every provision of the Constitution.
speaker="edward_mosk" startTime="894.463" stopTime="895.010">
    Mr. Edward Mosk 
    Now --

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    I hope you in your time discuss the First Amendment.
speaker="edward_mosk" startTime="898.872" stopTime="917.549">
    Mr. Edward Mosk 
    I shall indeed, Your Honor. 
    Now, we -- I think that that probably gives a fair appraisal of the facts that we have before this Court. 
    And I think basically all of the facts that are essential to a determination.
speaker="harold_burton" startTime="917.549" stopTime="931.650">
    Justice Harold Burton 
    But before your complete reaction, I -- I understand that the answer as to whether or not but refusing to say whether he's a member of the Communist Party.
speaker="edward_mosk" startTime="931.650" stopTime="933.271">
    Mr. Edward Mosk 
    That is correct.
speaker="harold_burton" startTime="933.271" stopTime="944.544">
    Justice Harold Burton 
    So, the only part of the record clearly a desire not to say whether he was a member of the Communist Party.
speaker="edward_mosk" startTime="944.544" stopTime="968.919">
    Mr. Edward Mosk 
    It is a little more than that I think from the record, Your Honor. 
    At a subsequent hearing, when he was questioned, why do you answer one question and not the other? 
    He indicated that that subsequent hearing that he felt that perhaps he had violated his principles in even answering the philosophical question, and if he were asked it again he would decline on the same basis.
speaker="harold_burton" startTime="968.919" stopTime="970.412">
    Justice Harold Burton 
    But actually he did answer.
speaker="edward_mosk" startTime="970.412" stopTime="971.797">
    Mr. Edward Mosk 
    Actually, he did answer the --
speaker="harold_burton" startTime="971.797" stopTime="975.296">

    He answered that he was opposed to force and violence.
speaker="edward_mosk" startTime="975.296" stopTime="976.018">

    That is correct.
speaker="harold_burton" startTime="976.018" stopTime="981.635">

speaker="edward_mosk" startTime="981.635" stopTime="983.437">
    Mr. Edward Mosk 
    That -- that is correct.
speaker="harold_burton" startTime="983.437" stopTime="987.947">

    That is correct and high moral principle that he also indicated.

    Well, his moral principle was (Inaudible)

    Well, his -- his moral principle was --

    That's correct.

    Mr. Edward Mosk 
    The -- as we see it, the burden is on him to answer any questions that go directly to his fitness to practice law. 
    It is our position that several -- we have several answers to this particular question. 
    One is that whether or not he was a member of the Communist had -- Communist Party or no relationship to the type of things which are important for the -- for the practice of law.
speaker="harold_burton" startTime="1038.747" stopTime="1047.609">
    Justice Harold Burton 
    Well, I think it's whether he was in favor of overthrowing the Government by force and violence and that's the basis for his moral character?
speaker="edward_mosk" startTime="1047.609" stopTime="1048.338">
    Mr. Edward Mosk 
    Well, now you see --
speaker="harold_burton" startTime="1048.338" stopTime="1050.259">
    Justice Harold Burton 
    (Voice Overlap) --
speaker="edward_mosk" startTime="1050.259" stopTime="1055.168">
    Mr. Edward Mosk 
    There, we -- he has responded to the questions on force and violence.
speaker="harold_burton" startTime="1055.168" stopTime="1056.593">
    Justice Harold Burton 
    Yes, he responded to that.
speaker="edward_mosk" startTime="1056.593" stopTime="1057.332">
    Mr. Edward Mosk 
    That's correct.
speaker="harold_burton" startTime="1057.332" stopTime="1062.553">
    Justice Harold Burton 
    Now, some people may think a Communist Party (Inaudible)
speaker="edward_mosk" startTime="1062.553" stopTime="1138.014">
    Mr. Edward Mosk 
    Right. 
    Now, on that Your Honor, the second question asked after the first question has been asked and answered, avails the questioner nothing. 
    The cases before this Court and apparently respondent pretty much concedes that simple Communist Party membership without scienter would not be sufficient to base their decision. 
    So that having gone backwards from the second question, that is, “I do not believe my whole lifetime indicates that I do not believe it,” and even more than that. 
    This record discloses one of the articles introduced by the respondent here written before any of the events that are involved in this case indicated that he wrote them. 
    That he did not believe in force and violence, that anyone who did believe in force and violence should be punished for it. 
    So that in the state of this record indicating the denial, indicating additional affirmative proof, indicating letters from persons in high positions, indicating despite the respondent's statement that if they don't go to the issue, the letters for instance from his law school professors went to this issue.
speaker="harold_burton" startTime="1138.014" stopTime="1156.514">
    Justice Harold Burton 
    (Inaudible) suppose those are all matters apart from what I'm asking. 
    I'm trying to find how far this man going up (Inaudible) and so forth answered the questions that were asked and you make him respond to the question, “Are you in favor of force and violence to overthrow the Government?”
speaker="edward_mosk" startTime="1156.514" stopTime="1157.411">

    Therefore, I do not think that we are called upon on the facts of this case to challenge the constitutionality of that statute. 
    I've been trying to think that the statute itself is improper.

    We're not dealing even with a teacher as important as the independence of a teacher is concerned. 
    We're not dealing with a private employee here. 
    We're not dealing with an army officer as this Court has had to deal in general related cases before. 
    We're dealing here with a free and independent bar. 
    We're dealing here with a -- with the -- a institution, the law of a legal profession which is absolutely unique in our society. 
    We're dealing here with the only group within our society which must remain absolutely free and independent of -- of the kinds of restraint that we find, unfortunately required in some of these areas, because it's only the lawyer who must stand between the individual and society, who stands between society and the individual who protects society from the individual.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    You don't answer me to what gain, I do not see why you emphasize that -- that whatever may be full of teachers and policemen and plumbers is not applicable to lawyers.

    Mr. Edward Mosk 
    Let me -- let me hasten to add that I'm not -- I'm not conceding that they're propriety of -- of going into these areas for teachers. 
    But I say that there is a strong distinction because the lawyer from the very beginning, when you try and select who are going to become lawyers, you must not at the very beginning crush out the selection of a complete cross section of everyone who meets the other requirements for the practice of law. 
    But if the State of California as it has endeavored to do in this case say, “We will select one from another,” and this is the word that they used in their own brief. 
    We have the right. 
    The State of California has the right to select who shall be lawyers in the State of California. 
    And I say that as soon as you allow the State of California to select one from another on the basis that they have tried to do here, that is on the basis of disagreement and basically, that's what they have done here on the basis of disagreement with the opinions, the ideas expressed by this petitioner. 
    This is the basis --

    That -- that may be but his moral character does involve (Inaudible) in the practice of law.
speaker="edward_mosk" startTime="1527.740" stopTime="1590.325">
    Mr. Edward Mosk 
    Oh, yes, no question about that and we do not challenge, except as applied in this case. 
    And as applied in this case, we say it's arbitrary a violation of Fourteenth Amendment, but the term moral character as it has always been interpreted in the past in California up to this case was that if a person had violated some statute, if they had -- if the person was -- had been involved in a fraud, the person had fraudulently made his application. 
    Things in this area are properly and we do not question their right to term moral character based on these things. 
    But what they are doing now for the first time is saying, but moral character means something else. 
    We don't agree with these articles. 
    As a matter of fact, they say the majority of the people don't agree with these articles and that may well be. 
    But I submit that the mere fact that the majority of the people in the State do not agree with one's ideas is not a basis for saying that he is not a person of good moral character, given the kind of record that we have here. 
    And I hasten --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1590.325" stopTime="1592.384">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    He's not that -- I think it's extraordinary.
speaker="edward_mosk" startTime="1592.384" stopTime="1655.015">
    Mr. Edward Mosk 
    I hasten to add that because we must approach this case from the -- from the nature of the record here. 
    Fortunately, for this petitioner, he was not in the same position of the ordinary young man of the 22, 23 or 24 years old who comes before the Committee of Bar Examiners with a -- with a clean slate. 
    He's had no work record. 
    He's had no opportunity to establish a general reputation in a record in the community. 
    But this petitioner was a man of 42 by the time he arrived at where we are today. 
    And in that basis, he had many years. 
    He had been a social worker in several cities. 
    Nowhere in this record is there any challenge to the substantial reputation and record of good moral character that this man had build up save only the four things that the respondent here brings out. 
    Save only the -- their allegation of membership in the Communist Party 15 years earlier.

    The premise of your position is that he answered the question as to whether he was a Communist or in a philosophical sense and he said no. 
    Now, supposing he'd answered this question as to whether he was a member of the Communist Party and his answer to it showed that he was an officer of the Communist Party and a member of it, and that he had not stated truth to the Committee when he had first -- when he had first said that he was not a philosophical Communist.

    That's correct. 
    And Mrs. Bennett's testimony as far as this record is concerned is in effect a -- a shell. 
    It says, you are -- he was a member of this group and nothing that anybody said there was some reference to all. 
    Well it was implicit but of course this is a -- is a mere conclusion of the -- of the witness where she makes the -- the generality that it was implicit that bad things went on.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="1816.897" stopTime="1873.649">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    What I'm puzzled about is whether he said at page 38, Mr. Sterling, a member of the Committee. 
    This is all in relation as to why he balks at answering the question, “Are you a member of the Communist Party?” 
    And Mr. Sterling asked, “If you are afraid if you answer the question as to membership in the Communist Party the negative and say, “No, I am not a member and I have never been.” 
    Assuming you made that answer, you were afraid that we could find half a dozen people who would say that you were -- were and have been and therefore you were -- if you were on a perjury trial and the jury believed them and not you, you've committed perjury. 
    And his answer was, “I'm saying no matter what answer I have, whether I was or wasn't then, definitely, there would be several whom you could get to say the opposite and as I said before.” 
    Then Mr. Sterling and the judge subjecting him to a perjury trial and the witness answer yes.
speaker="edward_mosk" startTime="1873.649" stopTime="1963.709">
    Mr. Edward Mosk 
    Yes. 
    I -- I say I'm aware that on the -- the very first occasion in the first colloquy between the Committee and Mr. Konigsberg at a time when he was there without counsel, if you recall he had been called in without any knowledge of why he was been there and he was without counsel at that time. 
    However, even at the same hearing and -- and still without counsel, I called Your Honors attention on -- on page 30 or starting right at the bottom of 29. 
    I understand that under the law as it is today, you may ask me specifically, “Do I advocate the overthrow of the Government by force and violence?” 
    I specifically answer, “I do not. 
    I never did or never will.” 
    When you get into the other question of specific views in a political party, it seems to me only the fact the right of political opinion is protected under the First Amendment and is binding on the States. 
    And then over on the next page on 31, again the question, in other words, you feel that asking you that question is a violation of your constitutional rights. 
    Answer “Of free opinion, free speech, yes.” 
    And then he goes on. 
    So that it is true that -- that at the very beginning there perhaps was some mixture of -- of discussion about nameless informers and so forth. 
    But basically, if -- if you read the entire record, it's basic to what he has said that while he did mixed in this other argument in every occasion, he said this is predicated on -- on the First Amendment. 
    And certainly, after the first hearing, there were no other reference as I think after the first hearing.

    Mr. Konigsberg, “The Committee is not empowered to ask with regard to political affiliations to that type.”
speaker="edward_mosk" startTime="2001.646" stopTime="2040.455">
    Mr. Edward Mosk 
    That's correct. 
    I think that it's -- it's simply a paraphrase of what he had said before. 
    But I think that Your Honor will find that it was only at the first hearing, the very first hearing that these other element of -- of nameless informers was intruded into it. 
    And even then, it was almost always in juxtaposition of saying, “Well, how do I know how many people you're going to bring or going to say something else.” 
    But in addition, in almost every case, he said however it's protected under the First Amendment. 
    So that there is this slight other element but it's -- it's only in connection with the -- what he referred to constantly as his First Amendment position.

    But in the -- in our situation, the ultimate question that is the -- the wrongdoing about the Communist Party, he has already answered.

    Suppose a member of this Committee after he said he's not a philosophical Communist, I don't know what that means.

    No, no. 
    I'm not asking. 
    But suppose after he said he was not a philosophical Communist, (Inaudible) that's apparent. 
    And suppose this woman, this witness before the Committee then -- perhaps I should (Inaudible) 
    Suppose the member of the Committee doesn't affect the problem that you can express, you said that you're not a philosophical Communist. 
    So far as I am concerned, I do not think membership in the Communist Party as in the Court would be a barred admission. 
    We don't have to rest on the decisions of each case by the Supreme Court but that is my view, at least being provided. 
    But this lady before us the other day said you were a member and active in a cell on which she then was a (Inaudible) 
    I'm not suggesting on the facts (Inaudible) 
    And this member of the Committee says, “I want to make it perfectly clear to you (Inaudible)” 
    “Yes, I was a member of the Communist Party.” 
    I, for one do not think that's a bar and I think it's illegal. 
    But I do realize the right and find out from you whether you're telling the truth, of course. 
    And I should like to determine whether this lady is truthful or not with what she said if he was a remember of this cell, because if she's right about that and I'd like to ask you more questions about your -- this claim of not being a philosophical Communist.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Well, I added to that. 
    Before I make an admission, I know there are other members on the Committee but this questioner stated that his search for evidence was not to bar him because of Communist connection or affiliation or sympathy but that is the lawyer given the right to ascertain whether this is the truth telling a person.

    Mr. Edward Mosk 
    Right. 
    Well, in a sense, we've come to -- to part to the vice in -- in having answered this question. 
    You see, Mr. Konigsberg himself at a subsequent hearing said, “I was wrong in answering this question because I realized that in a sense, I have reached the principle that I have always lived in but under the stress of a hearing, I answered the question.” 
    And I think in a sense this is the -- is the vice that we have here. 
    He should not have answered that question either and it's only because he did that we get into the position of perhaps having to say, “Well, we can prove the truth of a belief.”

    Mr. Edward Mosk 
    Let me give an example and by a specific thing that we have in this record. 
    A respondent in this record apparently recognizing that simple membership alone would not have been sufficient and they -- they go back and forth on this issue. 
    On one place, they say yes, another place they say no, have decided that they must in some way and this record show that he really does believe in force and violence. 
    So, in order to establish this, they seek through these articles that they've introduced and they've read them through and called them through. 
    And what did they come up with in order to prove that this petitioner believes in force and violence, they come up with a statement that reads substantially like this. 
    They say petitioner wrote in this article that everyone should militantly defend the principles of the Constitution of the United States. 
    And then they put in quite parenthetically. 
    They say, “Militant means forceful, warlike. 
    Therefore, he believes in force and violence.” 
    Now, this is what happens as soon -- and by ways of specific examples -- this is exactly what is going to happen as soon as we penetrate into this area of “what do you think” and “what does this article mean” and “who were your associations.” 
    We'll come up with this kind of -- of article which they have said now in this record before this Court this proves that this man or it -- they don't say proofs. 
    I'm sorry. 
    They say this indicates that perhaps he really does believe in force and violence. 
    And this is exactly what happens not only in the articles, but it's also going to happen as soon as we start intruding into and I -- I hope I'm not being too general, but into the area of what a person thinks in the political area, in the realm of -- of political ideas where what this generation says is correct and true and -- and right. 
    Perhaps, 10 years from now, someone else will say no and this petitioner can't wait 10 years to be admitted to the Bar. 
    It seems to me that in the case of the -- of the applicant for admission to the Bar, he has established on this record his good moral character by every standard which we have known in the past, save the one that they -- that the respondent here is endeavoring to bring in and that is he has refused to answer these couple of questions, these few questions and sometime in the past without more, he was, they alleged a member of the Communist Party. 
    So that -- it seems to me that what we are dealing with this is -- is an entire record. 
    Maybe this case would be different if we had a 23-year old boy asked some of these questions, I think not. 
    But we have a record here which is overwhelming in its proof of this man's good moral character. 
    Every sign in this record points to his good moral character, except these intrusions into this -- this area. 
    And it submit -- it seems to me that given this record to hold that this man on the basis of this -- his failure to answer these few questions and this -- the other points that they have raised, it becomes an arbitrary determination and contrary to the Fourteenth Amendment. 
    Now, I had hoped to hold a few minutes, I think I have about five and I would like at this time to -- to reserve that. 
   
   
   
   Argument of Frank B. Belcher

    Chief Justice Earl Warren

    Mr. Frank B. Belcher 
    May it please the Court. 
    In the order of this Court granting certiorari which appears at page 133 of the record, the Court directed to counsel three questions touching upon the jurisdiction of this Court to hear this matter and asked that we comment upon them not only in briefs but in oral argument. 
    Paraphrasing these questions, the first were, were petitioners constitutional claims raised before the Supreme Court of California? 
    The second question was, was the Supreme Court of California's denial of the petition for a writ of review, a final judgment within the meaning of 28 U.S. Code 1257? 
    And the third question was, if a final question, was it a rejection of petitioner's claims under the Fourteenth Amendment? 
    Answering those questions, I would say that in my judgment, the answer to the second question is yes, that the rejection by the Supreme Court of California of this petition for a writ of review was a final judgment sufficient for the purpose of giving this Court jurisdiction in that respect. 
    Answering however the first and the third questions, my answer to this Court is no to each of them. 
    I hold here petitioner's plea which was filed before the Supreme Court of California. 
    And I say to this Court that there is not one heading, one paragraph, one sentence or one phrase or a single authority which raises the constitutional questions before the Supreme Court of California which they attempt to place before this Court. 
    It has then a rule --

    But in making that Statement, he overlooks the case of Johnson against State Bar in our 4 Cal.2d which is cited in our brief which was a petition for review addressed to the State Bar of California before the Supreme Court of California and in which they attempted to raise a constitutional question.

speaker="frank_b_belcher" startTime="3837.926" stopTime="4025.850">
    Mr. Frank B. Belcher 
    Well, frankly, I can't say as to the requirements but I know that it was always the practice in these matters to submit a brief with your application. 
    Now, it is true that for many years, the Court out there entertained very informal petitions that did not have to be much more than a letter simply stating if we want the Court to review this. 
    But I have known of no relaxation in the requirements of that Court so far as the briefing is concerned. 
    I place that Court -- that points simply before the Court because we were directed to argument. 
    Now, the petitioner in his briefs and in his arguments before this Court here has sought to show that this petitioner was denied admission or certification for admission in California because of his political, economic and social beliefs. 
    I say to this Court with all the conviction that I can muster that I think there is no foundation for that statement at all. 
    That the petitioner in this case was denied certification to the Supreme Court because he failed to establish his good moral character and because he left some considerable doubt as to how he stood on the matter of the use of force and violence in the overthrow of the Government. 
    Now, we have a specific statute on that score that no one maybe certified for evasion to practice law who advocates the overthrow of either the Federal or the State Government by force and violence or other constitutional means. 
    That is the way the matter became a subject of inquiry before our Board of Bar Examiners. 
    Now, the Board of Bar Examiners made two findings and one of them was that this petitioner had not sustained the burden of proof as to his good moral character and that he had not let the statutory test -- test of being one who could not advocate the overthrow of -- the Government by force and violence. 
    And there was no finding that he was denied admission because of any of his social, economic or political beliefs. 
    Now, by statute, it became the duty of the Board of Bar Governors to make inquiry into these things, and that is exactly what they did in discharge of their duty. 
    Now, the report passes of evidence in all which were introduced into that hearing. 
    The first one had to deal with a transcript of a hearing in which this petitioner appeared before the so-called Tenney Committee which was a legislative Un-American Activities Committee in the State of California. 
    Now, at the time he appeared before that Committee as shown by transcript of the proceedings, he was asked and I quote. 
    "Have you ever been or are you now a member of the Communist Party?" 
    Now, Mr. -- although he was directed three times in his appearance before the Tenney Committee to answer that question, he never did so. 
    And his answer was a long two or three-page garbled reply, the summoned substance of which was that he declined to answer the question.

    Now, Mrs. Bennett's testimony left much to be desired that I can see her identification of this man was not all that you might wish. 
    But in the course of her testimony, she testified that it is implicit in the fact that one who is a Communist that one expected a forceful overthrow of the Government at some time. 
    Now, this respondent was present when Mrs. Bennett testified, and later on, when he was on the stand he was asked by a member of the Committee as follows and I'm now referring to page 117 of the brief of the record. 
    “Who? 
    A lady by the name of Bennett testified here. 
    You heard her testimony. 
    Is there any part of that testimony you wish to desire to deny?” 
    Mr. Konigsberg replied in part. 
    “That is a question relating to opinions, beliefs, political affiliations.” 
    And again, he said, “The Committee is not empowered to ask with regard to political affiliations of that type.” 
    And in short, he may -- he declined to make any more specific answer but no place, even no given repeated opportunities so to do that he ever denied one word of what Mrs. Bennett had testified to. 
    Now, in addition to that, they were introduced into the record here as counsel for petitioner has indicated some 27 articles which the petitioner had written for this newspaper called, The Eagle. 
    The petitioner himself later put in some 51 articles which as I recall included the 27, which the Committee had introduced. 
    Now, I'm going to refer to certain excerpts from those articles, not as an infringement upon this man's freedom of the press or freedom of speech but for the purpose of showing certain characteristics in his line of thinking which furnished that I submit a reasonable foundation for later inquiry by the members of this Bar Examining Committee.

    Mr. Frank B. Belcher 
    Has a right to do it. 
    No question about it and I concede it. 
    The second trend in these articles which he wrote shows his extreme sympathy with everyone who has some leaning towards the Communist doctrine and particularly with the Soviet Union and things that they do. 
    For instance, he wrote, “On freedom side or such good people as a Hollywood Ten, the (Inaudible), the Members of Progressive Party, the Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Committee, the Paul Robeson's and the Howard Fast's. 
    On the other side are the giant corporations, the Mac Arthur's, the Truman's, the Mason's, the American Legion, the Chamber of Commerce and practically all press, radio and movies.” 
    Again, he says, “A school system that is so deeply committed to the anti -- anti-democratic conspiracies being enjoyed by the economic loyalists to whom they have sold out. 
    I criticize the Boards of Education, the Board of Supervisors, the Sheriff, the City Council.” 
    He called our defense forces a scoff army and he spoke up and again I quote, “Sons slaughtered on foreign fields to ensure greater profits for the Morgan's and the Mac Arthur's.” 
    He was severely critical of the Secretary of State, the Attorney General, called the President dishonest, spoke of him as Hydrogen Harry and referred to and again I quote, "His program for war and American fascism which Taft and his collaborators are helping Truman and his cronies to fasten on America." 
    He wrote quote -- and quoting again, “The nationalist theory and terror over communism, manufactured by the Taft-Truman axis to divide and deceive the American people.” 
    Again, he also wrote of the intellectual dishonesty of certain Senators and he spoke to the leaders of our land as and again I quote, "Men without principles, without morals and without hopes." 
    He wrote of American imperialism and he also wrote and again I quote, "The obscene cry of fighting communism." 
    He charged the United States of these articles with aggression in Korea. 
    He demanded that we take our troops out of Korea. 
    He advocated joining the Soviet Union in rebuilding a democratic United Nations and world peace. 
    He wrote critically of the building of strings of bases around the Soviet Republic and he charged the United States of provoking China and with aggression in Korea. 
    He charged the United States with war against the people of Korea and spoke of it as being a criminal war. 
    He bemoaned and again I quote, “The jailing of the leaders of the Communist Party.” 
    He charged our Government who are trying the outlaw peace but he praised the Soviets as being the true promoters of peace. 
    He advocated the withdrawal of our forces from Korea, of canceling the martial plan, of withdrawing that from the North Atlantic Pact and he urged recognition and establishment of trade relations with Red China and with their admissions to the -- the United Nations. 
    He also charged the leaders of our land with and again I quote, "Treasonous betrayals of our political code." 
    He charged the Supreme Court of the United States that sold out to its enemies and that again I quote, "Judges with impunity violate our constitutional rights." 
    He even charged the Vatican and the Pope with duplicity and conspiring to help Hitler launch World War II and he blasted all persons who criticized Russia. 
    He charged the American people with permitting the Government to make war on the people of Greece, China and Korea and predicted that in time, the Government might make war even upon its own people. 
    Now, before going I think --

    Could I ask you a question at that point?

    Yes, sir.

    Mr. Frank B. Belcher 
    No, sir.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="4502.517" stopTime="4503.978">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Then, why refer to it?
speaker="frank_b_belcher" startTime="4503.978" stopTime="4818.591">
    Mr. Frank B. Belcher 
    Because I say that it furnished the Court of Appeal for cross-examination of this man an inquiry into some of his beliefs and associations which he consistently defined to give the Committee the right to do. 
    Now, I want to again make it clear, exceedingly clear that I recognize the man's right to write and speak as he has done. 
    But I want to make it equally clear that I think that the Committee of Bar Examiners of California not only had the right but that they had the duty with those utterances coming from him to ask concerning some of his beliefs with reference to the forceful overthrow of the Government or the use of other unconstitutional means. 
    Now, the Committee did attempt to question Mr. Konigsberg with respect to these articles but without much success. 
    For example, when they asked him if certain statements written by him was a true statement, he replied in substance that when a person writes as a newspaperman, freedom of the press and freedom of the speech are involved, "regardless of truth or falsity.” 
    And argued that by reason of the First Amendment, he was not required to answer as to whether he now took the same position. 
    When asked again further as to some of his present beliefs, he answered and stated and again I quote him, "I believe that what I believe today has no bearing on my moral fitness to practice law." 
    Now, he persisted in that position time and time again even though this Committee advised him that all it was trying to do was to test his veracity. 
    Now, the following transport -- transpired in front of this Committee by Mr. Fuller, a member of the Committee, quote, "To return to the editorial entitled, Court of Last Resort, dated May the 11th of 1950, there is this language. 
    When the Supreme Court of these benighted States can refuse to review the case of the Hollywood Ten, thus making that high tribunal an integral part of the Cold War machine directed against the American people, then the enemies of democracy have indeed won a major victory. 
    When the commanders of the last legal bulwark of our liberties sell out to the enemy, then the fascists have gone far, much further than most people think. 
    He who cannot see the dangerous damnable parallel to what happened in Germany is willfully blind." 
    He questioned, “You made that statement?” 
    Mr. Konigsberg - “If that is a correct copy of what I wrote, I made the statement at that time, yes. 
    Mr. Fuller - “And would you make that Statement today?” 
    Mr. Konigsberg - “Again, I give you the answer that because of the guarantees of the freedom of speech, the freedom of the press under the First Amendment, the Committee has not empowered into -- to inquire into what I think or say today.” 
    Mr. Fuller - “Have you any evidence to support your statement at the Supreme Court sold out to the enemy?” 
    Mr. Konigsberg - “I think I covered that in what I said in answer to your previous question.” 
    Mr. Fuller - “I don't believe it is in the evidence to support that statement.” 
    Mr. Konigsberg - “Are you asking me if I have any evidence now?” 
    Mr. Fuller - “Did you have any evidence then?” 
    Mr. Konigsberg - “I think the same answer applies.” 
    Mr. Fuller - “What is the answer?” 
    Mr. Konigsberg - “The Committee is not empowered to ask me questions relating to what I thought or opinions which I express.” 
    Now, the Committee also asked this petitioner, quote, "Mr. Konigsberg, are you a Communist?" 
    Now, his answer to that was long and in bulk but in substance it was that he did not advocate the overthrow of the Government by force or violence that whether he was or wasn't a Communist, the Committee would get a dozen informers who would say the opposite and that his right of political opinion is protected under the First Amendment, but he didn't answer the question. 
    Pages 37, 38 and 39 of the record, the same question was put to him and he took the same attitude. 
    When he was asked if he had knowingly participated in any organization which he believe was sympathetic to the Communist cause, his answer in substance was that it wouldn't have made any difference to him one way or the other, so long as the organization had other proper objectives. 
    And he declined again on page 40 of the record to say whether he was or was not a member of the Communist Party. 
    On page 118 of the record, he was asked. 
    “Are you a member of the Communist Party now?” 
    To which he made this reply “The answer is the same I would give. 
    The Committee is not empowered any more than they may inquire whether I'm an Elk, a Freemason, a Democrat or a Republican. 
    It might be incriminating to be a member of the Democratic Party today, like saying all Democrats are traitors. 
    Now, he was advised by this Committee that the Committee was interested in knowing whether or not he had any past or present affiliations with the Communist Party.

    Do I personally advocate the overthrow by -- the overthrow by force or violence or other unconstitutional means, and at the time I say, No, you can't ask any further political questions.” 
    Again, he said on page 125, “The Committee can only ask. 
    Do you now personally advocate the overthrow of the Government of the United States or this State by force or violence or other unconstitutional means, and if I say no, yes or whatever it may be, that is as far as you can go.”

    But when he simply took the position that I say today, today and he limited it right down today that I do not advocate the use of force and violence and then declined all the right to cross-examination.

speaker="frank_b_belcher" startTime="5740.197" stopTime="5930.850">
    Mr. Frank B. Belcher 
    But I -- well, I -- I apprehend that your degrees of proof for a criminal conviction and those for a denial of practice of law or even disbarment may be somewhat different. 
    Now, may I just include in closing, point out just briefly to this Court some of the utterances which he just has made and while we have cited a number of cases in the brief, I'm only going to refer to two. 
    And I do this because of the very obvious separate which has been made here to place lawyers in a different category than public employees and school teachers. 
    And I say to this Court that I want lawyers under no lesser standard, certainly one equally strict with the school teachers and municipal employees if not even more so. 
    Now, in the well-known Adler case against the Board of Education as latest 342 U.S., this Court said in response to an argument that this Steinberg Law constituted an abridgment of the freedom of speech and assembly of person seeking employment into the public schools of New York. 
    And I quote, "It is clear that such persons have the right under our laws to assemble, speak, think and believe as they will,” and we so concede to this petitioner. 
    The Court continues on. 
    It is equally clear that they have no right to work for the State in the school system on their own term, and the same thing may be said with respect to the right to practice law. 
    And quoting from United Public Workers versus Mitchell, “They may work for the school system upon reasonable terms laid down by the proper authorities of New York. 
    If they do not choose to work on such terms, they are at liberty to retain their belief and associations and go elsewher.” 
    And so with this petitioner. 
    Has the State best deprived them of any right to free speech or assembly? 
    We think not. 
    Such persons are or maybe denied under the statutes in question, the privilege of working for the school system of the State of New York because first, of their advocacy of the overthrow of the Government by force or violence or secondly, by unexplained membership in an organization found by the school authorities. 
    They have to notice in hearing to teach and advocate the overthrow of the Government by force and violence and known by such persons do have such purpose. 
    According in that case, quoted from Garner against the Los Angeles Board of Public Works as follows. 
    "We think that a municipal employer is not disabled because it is an agency of the State from inquiring of its employees as to matters that may prove relevant to their fitness and suitability to public service. 
    Past conduct may well relate to present fitness.Past loyalty may have a reasonable relationship to present and future trust.Both are commonly inquired into in determining fitness for both high and low positions in private industry and we are -- and are not less relevant in public employment." 
    And certainly why should they be any less relevant when a question involved is one of admission to the Bar?

    From time immemorial, one's reputation has been determined in part by the company he keeps.

    I was going to refer to the CIO-Doud's case but unquestionably, it will be read by the Court in reaching its conclusion in this case. 
    But in summary, may I simply say that I think the Board of Bar Examiners of the State of California and the Supreme Court in passing upon that very conduct was more than warned in the only two findings which they made. 
    One, that this man had failed to sustain the burden of proof as to his good moral character and that he failed to establish that he did not advocate the use of force and violence and other unconstitutional means in the overthrow of the Government. 
    And therefore, I say that if this Court gets passed jurisdictional question into the merits of the matter that the decision of the Supreme Court of California should be affirmed.

   Rebuttal of Edward Mosk
speaker="edward_mosk" startTime="6399.885" stopTime="6413.813">
    Mr. Edward Mosk 
    As a matter of fact, if Your Honor will read our brief, I do not think that the brief cited really very many cases on any point. 
    This was presenting a new approach to the Court and there were practically no cases cited as I recall.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="6413.813" stopTime="6418.254">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    That's probably the beauty of it. 
    There are no cases to be cited for this argument.
speaker="edward_mosk" startTime="6418.254" stopTime="6541.943">
    Mr. Edward Mosk 
    That might have been an answer. 
    [Laughs] However, I -- I think that if Your Honors will read the -- the record here, I think that the record will satisfy you that it was at all times before the Court and was responded to by the respondents and maybe a major part of their response to our position obviously indicating a complete recognition of the constitutional position that we were putting forward. 
    I also call to the Court's attention and this was -- is only a first step before the California court have they granted review, we would then have filed our actual briefs and arguments so that this was a preliminary step before the California court. 
    But let me address myself just to the couple of points that counsel has mentioned here. 
    First of all, he has said that we failed to meet our burden of proof and has placed everything on this burden of proof. 
    He has avoided saying that it was this -- it was the failure to answer questions or it was the Communist Party membership or it was the articles of the Tenney Committee. 
    He has simply lump them all together and said, “We haven't met our burden of proof.” 
    Now, I want to submit to the Court that this -- on this record, the burden of proof within the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment, that is we have only -- we have not an unlimited burden of proof to meet. 
    We have a reasonable burden of proof to meet. 
    They cannot place upon us an unreasonable burden. 
    Now, I submit that on this record, where we have shown affirmatively our good moral character beyond anything that any normal person could do any 23 or 24-year old could do while we've qualified educationally passed the Bar exam affirmatively in addition to simply in language established non-belief in force and violence. 
    And I call to Your Honors attention the one article that dealt with a relevant question under their theory. 
    Force and violence was a complete declaration of that people should be punished to believe in force and violence.

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Did they all omit it?
speaker="edward_mosk" startTime="6543.949" stopTime="6635.691">
    Mr. Edward Mosk 
    That was one that seemed to have been omitted in their original offer which we subsequently in order to make the file clear did offer. 
    And we -- we have shown an affirmation of belief in democratic principles and the deviation on this -- this philosophical Communist question only came in the context of saying if you mean by a philosophical Communist, I am a believer in Jeffersonian democracy. 
    And in that sense, certainly, I am not a philosophical Communist. 
    This was the context in which this question was answered going directly to the force and violence question. 
    Introduced letters from all walks of life and -- and just to -- to point out one of them from Professor Niverville of the University of Southern California, one of the people who knew him last and closest points out, “It was my impression that Mr. Konigsberg is a man with the courage of his convictions but not one who holds those convictions blindly or with any but the most honest motives.” 
    He seems to hold the Constitution in high esteem and is a vigorous supporter of civil rights. 
    But it is interesting to note that despite his vigorous position, he showed a willingness to recognize the necessity from time to time of balancing the interest of the individual against the interest of society and so forth. 
    So that when counsel says, “The letters did not go to the heart of the issue,” these letters did go to the heart of the issue and we offered to bring these people before the Committee and let them cross-examine them on the heart, but the Committee never availed itself of that opportunity.

speaker="edward_mosk" startTime="6659.288" stopTime="6814.587">
    Mr. Edward Mosk 
    I would not -- the facts would not be that close, Your Honor that I would want to comment on it from that point of view. 
    I -- I would like to refer to the other cases of the counsel cited and the Adler case for instance where counsel used this to say and pointed out that it involved the right to work in a school system and I submit that right there, we've come to the crux of the difference and it is certainly not my position that there -- that there is such a great difference between education and the law and I don't want to be placed in that position. 
    But nevertheless, this case was at least in part based upon the fact that here were employees, employees of a school system. 
    But when we are dealing with the legal profession, we are not dealing with employees of the State. 
    The lawyer is not an employee of the State. 
    He is an independent person and the very independence of the lawyer is the reason why the kind of encroachment which the respondent here is endeavoring to make is going to destroy that very independence of the Bar. 
    Because if they are entitled to ask this kind of a question, what would prevent for instance the Supreme Court of -- or the Committee of Bar Examiners say in Alabama from saying, “Are you a member of the NAACP,” knowing that so far Alabama is concerned, the NAACP believes in overthrowing the -- the kind of -- of status of the Government there. 
    And I submit that you cannot make this kind of an encroachment in the case of a legal profession and still maintain the kind of standards and high moral principle that the legal profession includes. 
    I would like to and I have not the time to do it now, call to the Court's attention the questionnaire which respondent themselves sent out to petitioners here and see whether they included themselves within that good moral character of these political questions. 
    They asked the -- every petitioner certain questions in a questionnaire which is included in the record here at page 262. 
    And in this, they went directly to the type of thing which has always been good moral character in the past. 
    I submit, Your Honor, that what they have asked him to do, the petitioner here to do is to give up his good moral character, his principles in order to become a man of good moral character. 
    And I submit that this is improper and the petitioner should be allowed to be a member of the Bar.
