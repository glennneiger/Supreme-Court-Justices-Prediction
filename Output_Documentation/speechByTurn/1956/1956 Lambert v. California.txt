    I'd like to emphasize that in the trial court level of this case, there was no question raised as to unlawful search or seizure, false imprisonment, any factual basis other than the actual elements of the crime of being a person who had suffered prior convictions, in fact, those two prior convictions had been suffered in the State of California, should been a resident over the required period of time, she had not registered where the Chief of Police has required by the ordinance.

    Emphasis has been made that first offender should not be required to register.

    When either you or Mr. Linn in this good time state whether the State of California asked this Court to consider the ordinance as though it were -- there were written in to it that these must be convictions for crimes in California. 
    The convictions must be with regard to prosecutions within California. 
    Either you or Mr. Linn in good times can answer that.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Didn't -- didn't you answer that yesterday, Mr. Grey, by saying that it made no difference whether was in California or in any other State?

    Mr. Philip E. Grey 
    Well, I answer that to this extent that they were interested in the question of whether or not it was the actual judgment of conviction or the fact of conviction. 
    The Court has never passed upon that other phase of it whether or not it applied outside of the State.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="226.543" stopTime="228.441">

    Mr. Philip E. Grey 
    That's true.
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="229.200" stopTime="229.737">

    All right.
speaker="philip_e_grey" startTime="229.737" stopTime="338.743">
    Mr. Philip E. Grey 
    But I'm trying to emphasize that the facts of this case do not warrant going outside of the State of California, so to speak. 
    I think Mr. Justice Brennan yesterday asked about the actual practice. 
    In my experience, some 14 years with the City Attorney in close contact with the police department, we know that this law is enforced in the -- to the same extent as is any other law of the State of California insofar as it affects strangers to the State. 
    A person coming in to the State who has been in business in some other State for a number of years attempts to open a place of business. 
    He is not permitted with the laws of California nor the laws of the City of Los Angeles. 
    Should he violate the law, generally, when it comes to the attention of the law enforcement officers, he is given notice or warning. 
    You are engaging in a business that requires a special type of permit. 
    You should get that permit. 
    Now, in this matter here, I think that generally, most of the persons who are either interviewed as witnesses or suspect of a crime are interrogated, not only as to the nature of the present business but generally as to their past activities. 
    If during the course of an interview, it becomes apparent to the law enforcement officers that this man has suffered a prior conviction, he is generally advised that in Los Angeles, a person must register. 
    In many instances, the person is arrested upon probable cause for some other crime. 
    This becomes an incident to the general investigation. 
    I think the figures that we have shown do reflect that that is the proper procedure, the answers to the question propounded by the amicus curiae.

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Well, do I understand that correctly, Mr. Grey, is that to say then that a person who has been convicted of a crime and interrogated in the manner you suggested is not prosecuted then and there for having failed to register but as warned first that one must register?

    Yes.

    Mr. Philip E. Grey 
    -- supplemental brief. 
    The question was, “Is it now or has it ever been the policy to permit felons to register and then release them when there is no other charge upon which to hold them?” 
    The answer, “Ex-convicts who have failed to register as such are rarely booked on that charge alone. 
    The policy is to allow the subject to register and then release him except in those cases where a subject is uncooperative and/or is frequent in high crime rate areas of the city.”

    Now --

    Now, what did they do in this case?

    We don't know, Your Honor. 
    The evidence --

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    But did they follow that policy in this case?
speaker="philip_e_grey" startTime="411.109" stopTime="412.265">
    Mr. Philip E. Grey 
    I can't say.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="412.265" stopTime="415.197">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Is there anything in the record to show that they did?
speaker="philip_e_grey" startTime="415.197" stopTime="450.075">
    Mr. Philip E. Grey 
    There is an offer of proof made at the time that in motion in arrest of judgment was made to the Court after the verdict of guilty had been returned and offer to prove certain facts in a motion in arrest of judgment, the Court is only interested in the constitutionality of the statute, the form of the complaint, not in the evidence. 
    So that it was improperly presented at that time. 
    At no time during the course of the trial was there any evidence offered to show the facts or circumstances surrounding the arrest but then --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="450.075" stopTime="458.572">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    (Voice Overlap) your office know what the background of this was? 
    What -- how -- how she happened to be arrested on this -- this charge? 
    You didn't look at that?
speaker="philip_e_grey" startTime="458.572" stopTime="574.718">
    Mr. Philip E. Grey 
    No. 
    This is what has happened in many instances, going further with my practical application. 
    For persons who have been interviewed or suspected of crime, and it is determined by the law enforcement officers that there has been a prior conviction suffered by this particular person. 
    If that person is seen or interviewed over a period of time, more than five days and one month, investigation shows that they have resided at a particular place within a necessary period of time, investigation checks to see that the crime for which they were convicted actually would have been a felony in the State of California, an application for a complaint is made to the City Attorney. 
    This application then lists all of the various elements that are necessary to prove and establish the violation of this law. 
    Thereafter, a warrant is secured. 
    Now, what happened in this case? 
    I really do not know except for this offer proof. 
    There was no question raised nor any law enforcement officer required to establish probable cause for the arrest. 
    I know that this began with a verified complaint charging a person with having violated a municipal ordinance. 
    The evidence is presented in that light. 
    What the background may have been? 
    There may have been all the probable cause in the world to arrest this person, for all I know or there may have been none. 
    At any event, there was no illegal search nor seizure. 
    There was no evidence taken from the appellant which was introduced in the Court. 
    Had there been a false arrest, there would have been a civil remedy but not a criminal remedy. 
    The charge before the Court was that this person was an ex-convict who had failed to register. 
    Those were the elements that were presented to the Court. 
    They were established by -- mostly by stipulation and proof of this prior conviction.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="574.718" stopTime="603.744">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Well, I gather though, Mr. Grey, the rest of the answer to six, there's no record of the number of instances where ex-convicts have been questioned taken to the record division for registry and later release based upon the personal experience of the officer's questions, the question there had been many times more cases of this type that of actual bookings in this charge. 
    That implies though there'd been a substantial number of bookings without a prior up to newly registers, doesn't it?
speaker="philip_e_grey" startTime="603.744" stopTime="605.489">
    Mr. Philip E. Grey 
    Bookings for other charges?
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="605.489" stopTime="610.375">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    No. 
    As -- this says actual bookings on this charge. 
    I'm meaning at the top of page 9.
speaker="philip_e_grey" startTime="610.375" stopTime="611.244">
    Mr. Philip E. Grey 
    Yes, I see that.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="611.244" stopTime="613.108">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    The answer you referred us to.
speaker="philip_e_grey" startTime="613.108" stopTime="656.455">
    Mr. Philip E. Grey 
    Well, the other thing is given through the answer to questions two and three indicate that there were only 39 arrests during 1956 for this particular charge and of the 39, 36 of these resulted in complaints being issued by the City Attorney. 
    I think what they -- they meant to say that many more persons have been told to register than appear by the number of bookings as 39 figures because I think it's understandable that the police department is not interested in the minor type of violation if they are investigating a major crime. 
    And this becomes an incident to it.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="656.455" stopTime="679.188">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    No, but the fact it appears to be that in many cases at least, however, many doesn't very clearly appear, they'll book someone in a -- well, if it is established that he has been convicted of a crime, he has failed to register and will be prosecuted for having failed to register.
speaker="philip_e_grey" startTime="679.188" stopTime="751.804">
    Mr. Philip E. Grey 
    Well, I have -- the figures indicate that only 39 occurred in 1956. 
    May I go further and say this that under California law, in recent years, we -- the Supreme Court and the appellate courts have stated this, “That it is the duty of the police officer to stop and question persons seen on the streets during the late hours, that it is a right and duty or a privilege to protect the general public whether they are committing crime or not, there's nothing wrong in stopping a person and talking.” 
    Then the cases have gone further and said, “That if during an interview a person reveals that he has committed a crime, there is justification for an arrest.” 
    Let's take for an example this type of situation. 
    During the early mornings of the hour, police officers see a person walking down in a warehouse district, everything is closed. 
    They stopped and talked to the person. 
    During the course of this conversation, he revealed that he had suffered one or two prior convictions. 
    The officer would be justified in making an arrest for a misdemeanor committed in his presence under those circumstances. 
    So that that may be the result of these 39 cases, it may not.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="751.804" stopTime="755.834">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr.

    Mr. Philip E. Grey 
    There again, that appears in the record. 
    At the time of the motion for arrest of judgment was made by an offer of proof, there is no such evidence in the record except by way of this offer of proof which was not material to the Court in considering --

speaker="earl_warren" startTime="808.236" stopTime="899.094">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well, now, let -- let me ask you this, Mr. Grey. 
    It seems to me that this 39 arrest in one year in that great city of Los Angeles, in the great county of Los Angeles would make it look that -- as though this was only used when it would serve a particular purpose. 
    Now, you have thousands of men every year arrested in Los Angeles County for -- for a crime of various kinds. 
    You have many, many thousands more arrested in your -- in your county. 
    You have many thousands of -- of ex-convicts, I'm sure, who go through your State in -- or your city in the course of a -- of a year, a city of two and a quarter million, county of almost 5,000,000 people and still, there are only 39 arrests, and -- and this particular woman is one of them. 
    Now, isn't that a rather strange enforcement of the -- the law and -- and many of these thousands that I speak of are -- are very bad criminals and many of them are not convicted of a -- of the major offense, why is it that there are only 39 arrest for this crime in one year?
speaker="philip_e_grey" startTime="899.094" stopTime="922.892">
    Mr. Philip E. Grey 
    I would think these figures to be beneficial to me, Your Honor, by saying this, that of the 245,000 of arrests made during the year of 1956 -- 225,000, for major crimes, most of those people have registers as has reflected by the answer to question number one showing some 43,000 persons registered.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="922.892" stopTime="941.774">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Now, wait a minute, wait a minute. 
    Let's -- let's take that number right there. 
    I noticed that too and that struck me significant. 
    You've had 43,313 register as of July 10th, 1957.

    Well, the only reason I asked you this is because 43,000 registered in that time and only 39 arrest in the years.

    It would be difficult to have the police officers investigate in great detail. 
    I think the Law Review Article of Pennsylvania answers that to a certain extent stating that a detective is looking for a major crime. 
    He devotes more time and effort and he uncovers this and he said, “Well, let that go. 
    I'm trying to establish larceny, burglary --

    -- and murder.” 
    And it becomes an incidental thing. 
    Of the 39, those, perhaps, are situations where no other charge was made and a person refused to register as a last resort. 
    This ordinance was enforced.

    Well, as I've started my remarks here, I have said that common practice is to request a person to register. 
    They meet him again on the street, a matter of weeks and months later, they ask him, “Have you registered since?” 
    “No. 
    I'll get to it in a week or so.” 
    Checked with the registration or records reveal that he has not registered, then goes back -- brought to the City Attorney and then complain it.

    Mr. Philip E. Grey 
    I think yesterday Mr. Justice Frankfurter asked a question to counsel as to the justification for this type of an ordinance. 
    Being interested in this case knowing it's coming up before this Court, I noted a news article appearing August the 8th in the Los Angeles Times. 
    It was significant to me in that it showed a young girl, a secretary, 22 years of age, walking down the street when a man grabbed her, stuck a knife in her back, dragged her to the rear of a house. 
    He assaulted her, she screamed, and he left. 
    This young lady was taken to the police department. 
    She was able to identify the victim by police photographs. 
    It appears that this man had registered in 1948 as an ex-convict having been sentenced in the State of Indiana for criminal attack upon a 25-year old woman. 
    Therefore, a period of nine years, there was no criminal activity yet. 
    And on occasion of -- of this sort, he was apprehended. 
    He was identified because of the mode, the method that was used in the prior case to the most recent one. 
    So I think that that is one example where a justification is present. 
    I think it's also interesting to note that on October the 8th of this year, a news article appears stating that in the United State District Court, Southern District of California, the matter of the case of United States of America versus Hermeghan, Perez, Garcia and Garcia, numbers 26-641, San Diego Criminal Records. 
    Judge Carter was called upon in the trial court level to pass upon Section 1407 of Title 18 of the United States Code Annotated. 
    The -- we wrote a 35-page opinion holding this section to be constitutional. 
    And in part, the statute provides that no citizen of the United States who is addicted to or uses narcotic drugs as defined by the Internal Revenue Code or who has been convicted of a violation of any of the narcotic or marijuana laws of the United States or of any State thereof, the penalty for which is imprisonment for more than one year shall depart from or enter into or attempt to depart from or enter into the United States unless such person -- such person registers under the rule prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury, providing a penalty of $1000 or imprisonment for not less than one or more than three years. 
    In this opinion, Justice Carter answers most of the questions or attempts to answer them that have been here raised as to the right of self-incrimination, the right to travel the constitutionality of a statute. 
    And that I was very interested to know that Congress had in 1956 passed that statute.

    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    I -- I hope we don't lose sight of the constitutionality of this statute because of the peculiarities surrounding this particular case in which the lady concerned was fined $250 and given three years probation. 
    There may have been some matters that took place at or about the time the officers made inquiry of her. 
    For instance, in their offer of proof at one place here, they say that she was -- at the time of her arrest, she was in the company of her employer and attorney. 
    I don't know whether it was my friend here, it might have been me and after the thing had happened, I have a -- somewhat of a reputation for being (Inaudible) and quite a scene might have happened if they tried to arrest my secretary, and I didn't think she was guilty, I don't know whether it happened in this case or not. 
    But anyway, an incident arose there. 
    And the lady was packed off to jail and she had a four-day jury trial on stipulated facts.

    And we must remember that it is the policy of the Department of Corrections not to release prisoners except on parole, subject to supervision for a period. 
    Every parole officer is instructed to see that these people registered. 
    The man is given a pamphlet or a piece of paper, a mimeographed piece of paper telling the cities in which registration is required, the jurisdiction's county wide in which registration is required, he has given a course of, they call, pre-parole training in which he is directed to do this thing. 
    And every parolee, I think you can say without a peradventure of a doubt that goes to Los Angeles County, well, the city is a mad county, or other places in the State where they are required to register is told to register and they checked it.

    Mr. Clarence A. Linn 
    Well, he would have to register and he would be presumed to know the law. 
    The fact that the man comes from New Jersey wouldn't give him any greater rights. 
    He now the same difficulty in determining whether his crime was committed in New Jersey was the felony in California as he would have, what he was charged with recidivism in California. 
    Your prior convictions no matter where they were -- were committed become a -- a part of the proceeding in California. 
    Those things are things which are incident to law enforcement and as the police states. 
    And I think it's correct, policemen don't go after people willy-nilly. 
    If a person hasn't registered, just call to there attention from outside the State, they are registered.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Now -- now, let's just -- just go into that a bit. 
    There are 47 other counties in the State beside -- besides Los Angeles. 
    And there are thousands, tens of thousands every year who were convicted of crimes that are denominated the felony but who get misdemeanor punishments and who do not go to the state institutions nor are they in anyway subject to the policies of -- of the County of Los Angeles Probation Department.

    Mr. Clarence A. Linn 
    Not unless -- I have no information, we -- not unless the probation officer from their particular county in caring for these people would advice them. 
    And that many -- many probation officers, they transfer their probations when they move from one county to another, they transfer them to the supervision of the probationer in the other county or the probation officer in the other county. 
    And I would think that there, he would get the information.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1922.156" stopTime="1969.245">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    This saying Mr. Linn -- the only reason I said that was because you said that took care all of those in California and -- and it doesn't take care of but a minority of them. 
    Now, in addition to that, this case goes back to -- this statute goes back to 1921. 
    A man could have committed a crime when he is 21 years of age at that time and could be 58 years old now. 
    And I'm sure at that time, there was no such policy to -- either in Los Angeles or in the State Corrections Department or in any county of the State of notifying them of anything but they are -- but they are under this act, aren't they?

    This -- this is -- is a small amount compared to the sex registration law, sex violators that we have in California, a state-wide law, all types of sex violators have to register. 
    They have to register with their sheriff, the Chief of Police.

    No, I don't think so.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    In the first place, the registration of sex offenders says, “Any person who, since the first day of July 1944,” and this act was enacted a year or so afterwards. 
    This act -- this ordinance goes back to 1921. 
    And as to some of these offenses in -- in here, it says, “Any person who, after the first day of August 1950, does so and so, and so and so.” 
    So the -- the -- your statement that a person having done something when he was a boy and is now 40 years old had to register under this act isn't -- isn't entirely accurate because there hadn't been enough elapsed time for that to happen.

    All persons convicted of felonies, it would be difficult to say which kind of felony, where this recidivism lie, if we word forgery as -- is, we know, one of the crimes in which there is a fairly high rate of recidivism. 
    We know the legislature said it is so in sex crimes, narcotics, we know armed robbery for the purposes of administration. 
    If nothing else, it would be reasonable to say, "Well, let's have all people registered, whether they're stockbrokers who've run afoul of the law in selling stock or burglars who have broken into stores”. 
    If you have to break it down too much, then you have an administrative problem worse than -- than Judge Brennan contemplates about the people who come from New Jersey charged with crimes if they do not know of felonies in California. 
    The administrative problem would be great if you had to set it and the statistics.

    I'm not a specialist on it but those are the figures that the legislature accepts. 
    I don't know whether sex crimes are. 
    I -- those are the ones that bother us most on these registrations because people have a certain horror and naturally so and rightfully so of -- of that type of criminal. 
    And -- and those -- that is also a crime which some young people fall astray of the law in and outgrow it probably more rapidly than in some others. 
    That's not my job. 
    That's the legislature who studies these things and makes the classification. 
    But the classification here is one convicted of crime. 
    The law applies to that person. 
    Now, that classification is the oldest crime itself. 
    You can't vote to California if you've been convicted of a felony. 
    You can't vote public office. 
    You can't get public employment. 
    It's a ground for divorce. 
    It's a ground for impeachment of witness. 
    It disqualifies persons from being jurors. 
    You can't carry firearms of -- own or possess firearms except under very stringent rules. 
    Persons convicted of certain effect of sex crimes that are required to register. 
    Narcotic addicts are required to register under the federal law. 
    These are all classifications based upon conviction of crime. 
    And they are as old as our laws. 
    In Nebbia versus United States, this statement is made, “The Fifth Amendment, in the field of a federal activity, and the Fourteenth Amendment, as respects state action, do not prohibit governmental regulation for the public welfare and the guarantee of due process, as has been held, demands only that the law shall not be unreasonable, arbitrary or capricious and that the means selected shall have a real and substantial relation to the right to be attained.” 
    Now, take this question of recidivism or professionalism in crime. 
    You have all kinds of statistics. 
    Probation officers show that their probationers make good records. 
    Parole officers show that their parolees make good records. 
    The prison records also show this. 
    They show that in the year 1945 to 1949, the records compiled by the Bureau of Criminal Statistics of California show that only a little over one fourth or 25.8% of the people admitted to prison, finally get that, no prior criminal record at the time of the admission to prison. 
    Now, 74.2% of the people who are received into that prison have had prior criminal experiences, 37.6% prior jail or juveniles are brushes with the law, 24.5% at one prior criminal term, 9% had two prior criminal imprisonments, and 7.1% three or more prior -- three or more convictions. 
    This shows that these people are potentially recidivists. 
    Over 75% of them are potentially recidivist because they have repeatedly committed offenses. 
    They're right out of prison on parole in Los Angeles County, Los Angeles City, other cities of the State, and San Franscisco not among them, have said by ordinance that these people must register because in the opinion of the legislative body, they are potentially dangerous to the community.

    There's been no interpretation of the law considering this rehabilitation matter, that is whether that would wipe out his requirement for registration. 
    That has never been brought to the attention of anyone or nothing has ever been said about it personally. 
    I think a good case could be made for the man not having to register after this rehabilitation has taken place. 
    And as far as the probation, it's a common thing to expunge the record. 
    It's done everyday in Los Angels. 
    Our old friend Judge (Inaudible), the thing is so common that the Court attachés gave him a sponge on a string which he hangs in his chambers and under it says “To expunge the record".

speaker="clarence_a_linn" startTime="3539.794" stopTime="3673.603">
    Mr. Clarence A. Linn 
    Yes. 
    The intent in a case of this kind is similar to -- what would take -- I'll give the rule briefly as it's set forth in the -- in the Morissette case, which counsel has relied upon. 
    In that case -- we'll first come to Balint and Behrman, two United States Supreme Court cases, dealing with narcotics, does regulatory measures in exercise on what is called the police power, where the emphasis of the statute is evidently upon achievement of some social betterment rather than the punishment of crimes as in cases mala in se. 
    No intent is required in cases of that kind where the statute is a regulatory one in order to -- to affect some public purpose. 
    And the difference was pointed out in the Morissette case which affirmed the language of this Court in Balint and Behrman. 
    But said the -- the Morissette case, they said intent was necessary because it was stealing property off of a government reservation. 
    And they said stealing, larceny and its variance and equivalence which are among the earliest offenses known to the law that existed before legislatures. 
    In other words, no intent is necessary for the violation of these misdemeanors set up by local legislatures and regulatory matters. 
    But intent is necessary for those crimes which have come down through the common law where -- which are infamous in nature and therefore, there must be an intent. 
    In this type of case, the intent is not necessary unless the legislature particularly puts it in.

   Argument of Samuel C. McMorris

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Thank you. 
    All right, Mr. McMorris.

    Mr. Samuel C. McMorris 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    Beneath the certain fact that Judge Waters and I argued constitutional law for -- for the first two days of this trial, my remaining 10 minutes will -- will seem small indeed. 
    It's been mentioned several times about appellant's case taking four days. 
    For the first two days, Judge Waters and I argued constitutional law and I don't think that we should have gotten angry at the appellant because of that fact. 
    It was due mainly to the fact that Judge Waters had to take the case that I cited and obvious after two, justified the prosecution. 
    It took two days. 
    We submitted the facts in about five minutes except for what to me is the most important fact of the case. 
    We never admitted mens rea and contracts of provision taken here by appellee, my feeling is that the true law in this type of situation as stated by this Court in the United States against Kahriger, 345 U.S.22. 
    In this case, a person who knew of the law and yet, he said, “I will not register or -- or as a gambler,” whatever it was, “until I test the constitutionality of this thing”. 
    And this Court held that as long as he was in good faith knowing the law, not registering but the test of constitutionality that he was not guilty of -- of criminal intent, then I submit that -- that appellant here has to have no less benefit. 
    The -- here's -- certainly a person who know the law, the liberty of violation or to make a test case which, I think, is -- is probable seizure as long as he in good faith as he was in this case, that -- when you don't even know the existence but -- but if you did know what would -- would either register or perhaps to make a test case, it'll be readily wrongly had been done. 
    But certainly, the rule of Kahriger is to the effect that we -- there must be a criminal intent in this sort of situation. 
    Now, this is not all like the typical regulatory statutes which had been mentioned by a police, regulatory implies the regulation of a specific conduct, say to selling something, food or drug. 
    Say the driving of car, a person may have ability to have a car inspected, a duty to check his lights, a duty to have his food and -- and drug checked. 
    But here, a person is simply living in a community, as -- as they imply, amicus curiae for appellant. 
    A -- a perfectly passive status with no action at all, with -- this -- they are required to know some way that because they are just living in the community, must check a law and see whether now they have to register an ex-con as an ex-con. 
    It is particularly unfair since the laws are all for a reason. 
    The law says 33 and there are number of jurisdiction and above all, there are only five States, California being one in the whole United States, only five which our States have enacted such a law of this. 
    Those had been limited to -- to either -- to narcotic offenders or the sex offenders in every instance, those five States. 
    There have never been the general catchall felonies as you wish to apply to state laws which apply the registration are limited. 
    And I submit that that limitation in itself made a competent constitution reasonableness although I have my doubt of it. 
    But certainly, it comes closer to being reasonable than does our present ordinance. 
    Now -- and -- and one other point which particularly in California are Section 290 of the Penal Code specifically requires that notice be given before the person is required to register by the Court itself. 
    And they are required to sign in writing, “We have been informed of our duty to register.” 
    And that has made a part of the record of the case. 
    And I submit that this kind of a law had to be dealt at all. 
    It must first be limited. 
    And above all, some form of notice must be given before a person to be held a criminal for not registering, particularly as applies to incoming migrants. 
    And I submit that the only way that they can be properly approached is to require the police not as in their discretion but as matter of the law, built in to the law, that before you register and before you can pick the thencoming people, you must give them first a chance to register and explain the law to them. 
    .And this is under Section 290, the Court itself or the probation officer or -- or someone and also the State must, not in distress, and as a matter of law, tell these people, “You are required to register, sign here that you've been told for.” 
    We have nothing anywhere near that application of reasonableness in -- in our department.

    Justice Charles E. Whittaker 
    How would you enforce the law if it depended upon subjective matter of whether or not the person that you were just presumed or not to know that there is a law?
speaker="samuel_carter_mcmorris" startTime="4084.932" stopTime="4150.149">
    Mr. Samuel C. McMorris 
    Well, Mr. Justice Whittaker, simply by placing the burden upon the State of informing them so there can be no question. 
    You see, rather to leave the burden upon the millions of migrants we have in California or in other cities, City of Los Angeles, placing the burden upon them, we could put upon the State the burden so easily, so conveniently, so firm of -- of informing them, “We want to register,” if indeed our policy is not to make criminals out of America is what we do part too much of. 
    But -- but we -- we're trying to enforce a law that the idea is to get them to register, not put him in jail for not registering, and it's a very simple thing just to tell them either to the Court or to the arresting officers, “We want you to register if you want to live in Los Angeles. 
    No, you didn't know this because you do here,” and because -- because even lawyers do not know the law, as I did when this thing first of rule. 
    And many others, as I discussed, never heard about it. 
    It's a very simple thing to place the burden upon the Government. 
    And I think the constitutional clearance requires them to let this people know, “We want you to register if you live in Los Angeles,” if indeed it's the law (Inaudible) that constitute all which I have my doubt about. 
    I'm personally (Inaudible).

    I understood Mr. Grey to say that that's the way the law was effectively administered.
speaker="samuel_carter_mcmorris" startTime="4154.618" stopTime="4215.005">
    Mr. Samuel C. McMorris 
    It is not so and certainly it would not apply in our specific case. 
    But I think there should be a requirement in the law and not after the women could preach of individual arresting officers, Mr. Justice Harlan, which is -- which is the situation which admitted here is left to the (Inaudible) of the officer who, if you're uncooperative, you don't stand attention or salute, you can stand up and you can express your constitutional right, free to speak as I think you're arresting me falsely, you're on property if you're going to hold you and show you that we're the biggest here, which is what happened in this case. 
    And on one other point, we made an offer of proof that we did not know that we had registered. 
    Under that, Mr. Judge (Inaudible) could have been shown that the officers gave her a chance to register if -- if that were the case. 
    The question was raised by Mr. Chief Justice Warren, as whether or not in this case, she was given a right the chance to register. 
    But had that been so, it could have been showed on our offer of proof that she had no notes of any kind and no knowledge that she had registered. 
    And had the officer give her such notice that could have been brought in under cross-examination.
speaker="charles_e_whittaker" startTime="4215.005" stopTime="4223.223">
    Justice Charles E. Whittaker 
    Well, do you contend that such offer of proof could have appropriately come after the verdict and upon the motion in arrest?
speaker="samuel_carter_mcmorris" startTime="4223.223" stopTime="4358.840">
    Mr. Samuel C. McMorris 
    In the first place, we made an offer of proof before conviction. 
    We made an offer of showing intent. 
    Our whole factual of defense was intent, no intent, no mens rea, no notice. 
    Perhaps, the officer given her notice as was suggested here, we don't know whether he did or not. 
    They could have, under cross-examination, shown that in fact, she didn't have notice because we told her to register or go to jail. 
    I mean that was never been upon the motion for a new trial or motion for arrest of judgment, that was then a proof of the witness that goes through to stand for. 
    We concede it that she hadn't registered. 
    We wanted to show that she did not know she had to register. 
    And at that point, surely, they could have brought in the cross-examination the officer told her to register or go to jail which was not -- obviously not the fact. 
    So it nearly screwed what (Inaudible) back to defense but we got from a demurrer raised constitutional objection with the hope of the people. 
    Now, the fact as -- as contended by the -- by the Attorney General here that uncooperative people are people at high rate crime rate areas are the ones who get registered or get convicted under this law, shows that the great discretion and leeway letting the police officer to decide who -- who to prosecute and -- and this would have a particular heavy insight from the minority group because they tend to live at high crime rate areas and are subject more throughout the rest and here, it often aren't cooperative because they do resent that thing and here people who aren't cooperative live in high crime rate areas are just singled out admittedly by the police for prosecution whereas other people are not prosecuted but are given the chance to register. 
    I think we should not them let the people to discriminate the matter of law, the matter of constitutional right that people must first be informed if we do want them to be registered rather that to be made criminals again when they try to straighten up and be decent American citizen. 
    As for the congressional law I mentioned I do not know what it would be faced whether they were brought here and couldn't relevant here, to me, of course, to come under attack. 
    But it's certainly is a more limited thing. 
    And I also I submit that it would require notice, would require criminal intent of law which was passed by Congress in 1956 requiring a limited group of narcotic vendors to register. 
    I suspect that as under all federal laws which I have noticed, they would require (Inaudible) and probably therefore a notice that they had to register.

    I know I must register. 
    I did inform the Court as a matter of court record. 
    He had the reporter's records transcribed. 
    They were -- they were informed in open court of his duty to register. 
    And they've signed.

    They cannot deny because we have -- we have shown conclusively that they did know the state opinion.

    It will be open where you had no such commitment from the defendant that he didn't know. 
    It would be open to him, would it not, simply to say “All the prosecution may say is true yet, I was ignorant of it and therefore, you'd have to discharge me.” 
    Is that right?

    I think, Mr. Justice Whittaker, that it is true and that it -- that it should apply and that the burden of proof should be upon the State if they want to -- to have this kind of law this -- which is an unusually unique and a strange law. 
    At first, they (Inaudible) at all but I do think that we do consider the -- the concept of criminal registration constitutional at all, that it must be with proper notice even if we don't limit to this small kind of appeal.

    Justice Charles E. Whittaker 
    Don't you get down actually to the question of whether or not there's reasonable relationship between this ordinance requiring registration and the purpose for which registration may be required? 
    As I indicated they are suggested to counsel for the State. 
    Clearly, it would seem to me, that in narcotics and sex offender cases, there is such reasonable relationship between a registration ordinance and the offense as to make it reasonably sound, but when you make it general to cover all possible offenses wherever committed, that might have been regarded as felonies in California, then you got a different question, haven't you?

    Mr. Samuel C. McMorris 
    I agree, Mr. Justice Whittaker, on -- on that point. 
    As one of the points, as I think I have attempted to raise in my brief along with many others that I've tried to think every possible to concede the point including the vagueness of the ordinance other than -- as to what -- when you are pressed of felony, particularly says its strictly to the Court as to whether or not a crime is actually a felony or a misdemeanor, if it is possible to felony and also of the right given to the Chief of Police to pass whatever law may be necessary and proper to -- I mean whatever -- may be necessary and proper of carrying into effect the registration ordinance for a number of other reasons which I have attempted.

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Your time was up but there's one other question I want to -- I don't know if it makes any difference in the point you've raised. 
    From your brief, I gather, you've argued quite a different point with reference to notice. 
    Is that what you put in here? 
    You offered to prove, as I understand, that this law which required registration of conviction of a felony was a law that was not clear and what a felony was. 
    The definition of a felony in California was one that was so vague and ambiguous. 
    It frequently would require proof of some kind and study an investigation to determine whether a person's act was a felony. 
    You offered to prove, as I recall it, during the trial that she did not know whether the offense which she committed was a felony or not a felony. 
    You were raising a point there not that -- not saying that you were challenging the idea that a person was presumed to know the law, I mean, in that favor, but that they couldn't be presumed to know so as to fasten criminal guilt on the meaning of a felony when it was obscure as it was in California.

   Argument of Warren M. Christopher
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="4706.025" stopTime="4716.142">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    And Mr. Christopher, if you would like to have five minutes in which to sum up your views as friend of the Court, I'd be very happy to hear you.
speaker="warren_m_christopher" startTime="4716.142" stopTime="5020.750">
    Mr. Warren M. Christopher 
    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice Warren. 
    By way of summary then, we first thought to show here that the effect of this ordinance is to invade the constitutionally protected right of convicted persons. 
    The first one we mentioned was the right to privacy. 
    Mr. Linn made that point very well for me when he told the story of the young sex offender in California who found it impossible to get a job now because of the existence of his registration. 
    Another constitutionally protected right, which we feel is invaded by this ordinance, is the right to liberty. 
    And finally, we've talked about the right of free transit among the States. 
    The privilege and immunity and move freely among the United States. 
    I might bring this point closer to home by asking you to imagine that there was an ordinance in Alexandria, one in Arlington and one in Falls Church as there are in many Southern California communities. 
    Now, this ordinance has contained a provision that if you go into a particular area five times in a month, you have to register. 
    So a person living in any one of the Virginia communities would certainly have to register in every other one because his normal professional and social life would certainly take him into the other community. 
    In Los Angeles, the only way a person can be safe with the freeway system being what it is and the constant transit from one part of the city to another is to register in all of the communities. 
    The second point we've attempted to make is to say that if this ordinance is permissible at all, it cannot be sustained here because it is not reasonably restricted to the evil with which he purports to deal. 
    That's Mr. Whittaker's point exactly. 
    I'd like to expand that to say it's not only as it limited -- not limited in terms of the offenses that are included but as our brief indicates, it's not limited in terms of time elapses since conviction and it is not limited in terms of first -- first offenders and probationers. 
    I would again point out that the statistics that Mr. Linn hasadduced here today with respect to the prison population and the number of convictions that they have had are not quite in point with respect to first offenders and probationers as I said yesterday about all those statistics prove as the judges don't very often send people to prison unless they have prior records. 
    I'm sure it's common knowledge to all of us that most first offenders are put on probation and never reach that prison population. 
    There are a great, great many people in the United States who commit one crime in their life and thereafter lead law-abiding lives. 
    And finally our third point, and this is on somewhat different level, we contend that when a morally innocent and passive status has been made a crime, conviction of that crime requires proof of wrongful intent, requires that is a showing defendant knew or should have known of her duty to register and ignored it. 
    Now, at this point, I'd like to deal with the question that Mr. Justice Whittaker raised. 
    He asked how you would go about proving this matter at trial that the defendant always get off by saying that she or he did not happen to know of the ordinance. 
    If the answer to that is that this would be as any other fact in the course of the trial, if the defendant claimed that she did not know of her duty to register, the prosecution could controvert that and put on evidence that that was just inherently unbelievable. 
    If the Los Angeles police had publicized this ordinance in the way that I think they ought to by radio announcements and in the newspapers, they might very well be able to convince the jury that she was not telling the truth when she said that she didn't know about it. 
    So it seems to me that that would be an issue in the litigation just as other issues as to her guilt and innocence. 
    And I see no insuperable problem in that regard. 
    I would mention in that connection that I feel that Mr. Grey has almost conceded this point by his statement that it's the policy of the police to permit a person to register if he's picked up and doesn' know of the law. 
    That's exactly what I'm contending for. 
    I would just like to have that made more definite than in the discretion of the police, the statement in -- from the police that they used this ordinance only with respect to people who are uncooperative or who live in high crime areas, I think it has in it a seed of a very dangerous harassment. 
    High crime areas has an unfortunate connotation, meaning areas of our city where the minority groups congregate and live and uncooperative knows there's something that can be determined by a particular police officer in terms of his like or dislike of the person who was involved. 
    And thus we are contending that a person should not be convicted of a crime punishable by imprisonment simply because she existed for a period of time within the geographical limits of the city and at some time in the past had been convicted of a crime punishable with felony in California.
