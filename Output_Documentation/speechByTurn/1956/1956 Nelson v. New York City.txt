    Mr. William P. Jones 
    May it please the Court. 
    At this time, Your Honor, because the appellee served his brief three weeks late, I'm going to have to ask leave of the Court to serve the reply brief. 
    The clerk's office informs me that copies have been furnished to the members of the Court.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Very well.
speaker="william_p_jones" startTime="52.020" stopTime="152.180">
    Mr. William P. Jones 
    This appeal is from the final order of the New York Court of Appeals which denied the motion for reargument but granted the motion to amend the remittitur to show that constitutional questions had been presented and necessarily passed upon. 
    Appellants challenged the constitutionality of Title D, Chapter 17 of the Administrative Code of the City of New York and the action taken by the City thereunder in taking two of appellants' properties in foreclosure in rem for the collection of delinquent real estate taxes. 
    In this case, appellants' two properties worth in the aggregate $52,000 were confiscated to collect $887 of water charges. 
    The statute involved -- provides an in rem method of collecting delinquent real estate taxes. 
    It provides --
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="152.180" stopTime="155.818">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Any difference water taxes and real estate taxes?
speaker="william_p_jones" startTime="155.818" stopTime="419.487">
    Mr. William P. Jones 
    Water charges are defined by statute as a tax lien and then the statute goes on to define that at all delinquent liens, tax liens shall be foreclosed. 
    However, at this point, I take occasion to point out a significant difference that water charges can be collected in persona as provided in code. 
    Furthermore, water charges can also be collected in a very simple way of turning off the water which is also pointed out in our brief. 
    Well, the statute provides for the usual posting of a list of delinquent parcels in the clerk's office and then notice by publication, that is the novice feature of the statute. 
    That's the way the action is commenced. 
    Then from that date, the defendant taxpayers have seven weeks to redeem their property. 
    If they don't redeem, then the statute forecloses them forever from redemption. 
    It then provides that they'll have another 20 days to answer it. 
    If they neglect to answer through inadvertence, mistake, oversight or any of those reasons, the statute directs that an absolute -- an irrevocable deed issued to the City for those -- for each of the parcels, that accomplishes a confiscation, a barefaced simple confiscation of all and the entire value of the property. 
    Now, in this case, the appellants have been paying their real estate taxes ever since they acquired these two pieces.One was a -- a piece of real estate in Brooklyn, the other in Queens. 
    One was acquired in 1934 and the other in 1938. 
    The record shows that during that entire period, the appellants paid all of their real property taxes, which were vastly in excess of the amount of the water charges. 
    Now, commencing in 1945, due to the unexplainable behavior of a trusted bookkeeper who managed the clerical details for the office, these -- these bills for water charges were not paid. 
    The appellant trustee didn't know about it. 
    He was being presented with the real estate taxes in vastly larger amount than the water charges and he paid all of them. 
    But this clerk, this bookkeeper didn't give him the -- the water charges for some reason. 
    In any event, the water charges commencing with the year 1945, were not paid, and it is for these water charges that the foreclosure action was commenced. 
    That keyed it off. 
    Now, the statute provides that this foreclosure shall be instituted against any parcels which are four years or more delinquent. 
    The action against the Queens property came first. 
    That was instituted in May of 1950. 
    In May of 1950, there were only $72.50 worth of water charges which were delinquent four years. 
    Those were the only charges for which this foreclosure action could have been instituted.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    What was that amount again, please?
speaker="william_p_jones" startTime="421.612" stopTime="460.672">
    Mr. William P. Jones 
    $72.50. 
    That property was assessed for $6000. 
    Our appellant trustee did not -- didn't have any actual notice of that action. 
    Nobody sees the publication in the -- in the newspaper. 
    You just don't. 
    It's one of those things. 
    He didn't see the list posted in the county clerk's office in Queens County and he didn't see mail notices to this office which he maintained which this bookkeeper is also concealed.

    It's conceded, Your Honor, that I personally found here notices in that office. 
    The record says that they were found in the office after -- long after this property was foreclosed.

    Actually, they were found up on top of a bookcase.

    In fact, it couldn't have, no.

    We went and checked the record and -- and since 1934 and in one case in 1938 and the other, he had an unbroken record of paying the real estate taxes. 
    There was one exception. 
    A half year's tax for the year 1948, 1949, real estate tax was not paid. 
    Now, that is an --an inadvertence just like the water charges, but other than that, which doesn't figure in these cases because that one was not four years old and couldn't key off this in rem statute.

    Mr. William P. Jones 
    Well, now, that can bring us directly to what I believe is the -- is the key in the case, acquainted with generally with the in rem type method of foreclosing real estate taxes. 
    Those statutes exist in many States. 
    One of the ordinary elements is publication by notice, no return by a publication, commencing the action by filing a list of delinquent taxes in the County Clerk's office or the County Auditor's Office copy with publication in a -- in a newspaper and possibly followed by a mail notice. 
    Now, that is the ordinary way.

    But, why do you say possibly?
speaker="william_p_jones" startTime="1445.328" stopTime="1449.196">
    Mr. William P. Jones 
    Because all of the statutes don't require the mailing of the notice.

    Unknown Speaker

    Mr. William P. Jones 
    That's right. 
    That's the -- that's the kickoff point, Your Honor. 
    The filing of that list in a County Clerk's office commences the action and then he has to publish in a local newspaper. 
    And then, he is told to mail a notice if he knows the address. 
    Now --

    There should be a proceeding whereby an official of the City or of the State to -- took a notice, of the pending suit before closure, and delivered it to the individual who made the return.

    Mr. William P. Jones 
    No, I'm not -- I was just about to get to what I consider the point here. 
    The -- I was reviewing very briefly the in rem general type of the in rem statute which brought -- was brought on by -- by published notice and -- and the list posted. 
    The other element of the in rem proceeding is that a judgment those against the property itself dispensing with any personam process or any personam collection or any personam liability. 
    But then this is where they diverge and why this statute involved is -- is novel, unique, and the question brought here today we think is a -- a new question presented to this Court for the first time. 
    Most of the other in rem statutes provide that there be a sale of the property to collect the tax and that the surplus goes to the owner.

    Mr. William P. Jones 
    Well, but there's the sale and -- and it exposes the property to a -- a fair objective sale in which there's a strong possibility that there will be surplus for the owner. 
    At least he's got that, and that's the minimum that we say he can insist on, all right.

    Mr. William P. Jones 
    There was an option, an option under another Section of their code Title A, but this particular, now, this is where the City statute is unique and novel. 
    It doesn't order a surplus sale. 
    In fact, it orders and directs that there be no surplus sale, but that there be a confiscation of the entire property.

    It isn't actually an equity redemption.It's a chance to pay your taxes, an opportunity you have for seven weeks after that list is filed. 
    Then, you've got another 20 days to answer and if you inadvertently miss them both, the statute orders an absolute deed executed to the City or irrevocable deed for that entire property.

    Mr. William P. Jones 
    That is correct. 
    Every -- every statute that I have checked in connection with this case provides a surplus sale. 
    And when -- now, to find the surplus sale is at least requiring a sale that guarantees that the tax authority is going to get only its taxes plus interest, plus penalties, plus cost of the action and if there's anything left over, it goes to the owner. 
    Now, the other -- very briefly, the other --

    Justice Hugo L. Black

    Mr. William P. Jones 
    I say that, yes, but they're getting a windfall that it isn't tax collection at all. 
    That puts the tax authority in the real estate business. 
    The other case that he's -- appellees have cited in support of the statute involves a Michigan statute. 
    So, Michigan statute also provided a surplus sale. 
    They did it a little differently in a rather curious difference by providing that the purchaser if the tax fail would be sold the smallest possible, undivided fee interest, which he would take in payment for the amount of tax. 
    So then, you'll see the purchase if the tax sale winds up as a cotenant in fee with the owner, but the owner still has his surplus represented in the remainder of the fee. 
    Now, that's also a surplus method. 
    He's preserved his ownership in the land. 
    Likewise, the Nebraska statute, involved which they cite in support of this statute. 
    I want to refer the Court to United States, the Lawton 110 U.S.146, which appears to be very close to the point of this case.

    Of course, if you don't give back what Congress said you're entitled to, that's the deprivation of property arbitrarily and therefore without due process by the Secretary of the Treasury no matter how it ended.

    Mr. William P. Jones 
    Well, in my reading of the opinion, I -- I gathered from the opinion that the statute didn't actually provide for the surplus to go to the --

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Or in any explicit detail turned.
speaker="william_p_jones" startTime="2604.600" stopTime="2776.358">
    Mr. William P. Jones 
    There is a point of improper notice in this case. 
    However, following the doctrine laid down in the Mullane case. 
    Mullane case, which was the key to the decision in Covey versus the Town of Somers states that any pro forma notice, which is reasonably calculated to bring the action to the attention of the defendant will satisfy the minimum requirements of the due process. 
    Of course, in the Covey case, there is an incompetence, but we contend that that minimum requirement for notice is not satisfied in a case where the plaintiff, the party bringing the action in New York City in this case knew or should have known from the facts that the pro forma notice would be a mere gesture. 
    They in fact did know that this notice would be a mere gesture or should have known and are chargeable with knowing that it was a gesture from the record in the case. 
    Now, this is why after plaintiffs -- after appellants, Queens property had been taken, they continued to pay real estate taxes on it. 
    And the City continued to bill them for taxes, even though the City had taken title to it and sold it to somebody else for $7000 and retained all the proceeds, the City still continued to bill the appellant for real estate taxes and the appellant paid those taxes. 
    Now, if that isn't notice to an opposite party, who in turn is going to rely on pro forma notice to give this uninformed person notice about confiscatory action, then he's not going to get any notice. 
    Why, I -- I don't see what -- what would be a good example.Furthermore, the appellants paid the much higher real estate taxes and left unpaid the water charges. 
    Now, the water charges were small in amount, but because they are the older ones, they would detain these ones. 
    But nevertheless, they went on paying these -- these large taxes. 
    Now, that also is notice to the City that their pro forma type of notice would not get across to the appellant and therefore, there is not the proper minimum notice in this case required by Mullane, the ruling of the Mullane case.

    Mr. Seymour B. Quel 
    Thank you, Your Honor. 
    If the Court pleases, before I discuss the merits of the statute, I have suggested in my brief and my adversary does not agree that this appeal was academic with respect to the larger of the two parcels involved. 
    Now, Mr. Jones did not touch upon that aspect of the case in my argument and I would like to develop that briefly. 
    When this case got to the Court of Appeals, the Court of Appeals said in a brief opinion, “This is a hard case, but relief should come from the legislature.” 
    After the decision of the Court of Appeals, Mr. Jones filed his notice of appeal to this Court after he got the -- was permitted to amend -- amend it and this Court noted probable jurisdiction. 
    Now, in the meantime, the New York legislature amended the in rem foreclosure statute and that amendment is annexed as an appendix to my brief. 
    And that amendment provided in substance that with --
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="2939.451" stopTime="2940.847">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Whereabouts?
speaker="seymour_b_quel" startTime="2940.847" stopTime="3039.220">
    Mr. Seymour B. Quel 
    The Appendix, Your Honor, commencing on page 20 of -- of my brief. 
    It was laws of 1956, Chapter 481. 
    Now, that amendment provided in substance that with respect to in rem foreclosures, which had been completed in the past, the taxpayer could come in within a period of 60 days after the passage of a statute and request the return of his property. 
    And the Board of Estimate in its discretion could grant that application, provided that he paid the back taxes. 
    As to future in rem foreclosures, the period for doing that was four months, but it also expressly applied retroactively, provided, you came in within the 60-day period. 
    Now, this taxpayer came in and requested that the property be reconveyed to him pursuant to the statute and we wrote him a letter and said, “We would reconvey it to whom, provided, that he paid” -- it was about $15,000 of taxes which accrued in the meantime. 
    And he wrote back a letter which said, “We'll be glad to do this after the Supreme Court decides the case, but will you please hold it in abeyance while the appeal is pending.” 
    Now, those letters are not part of the record, because I -- and I didn't want to print them as a appendices because strictly speaking, they are not part of the record and they couldn't be. 
    They are circumstances which happened after the decision of the Court of Appeals. 
    However, I have made typewritten copies of those letters and with the Court's permission, I'd like to hand them up. 
    The statute, of course, I've printed because the Court can take judicial notice of that. 
    Now --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="3039.220" stopTime="3058.761">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    Now, matters pertaining to mootness arriving subsequently do not fall within rule of court that case was to be decided on the record because the issue of mootness arises subsequent to and therefore, whatever is relevant to determining that as you may properly be before this Court, as I understand them.

    Well, I'm glad you know that, Your Honor. 
    And perhaps, I should have printed as an appendix to my brief, but I hesitated to do that.

    Thank you, Your Honor.

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Does that relate to all of the properties?
speaker="seymour_b_quel" startTime="3069.307" stopTime="3224.049">
    Mr. Seymour B. Quel 
    No, it relates to one of the two properties involved. 
    The reason for that is this. 
    The statute is expressly made applicable to any property which the City has not reconveyed since it acquired title. 
    Now, the larger of the two properties, the City still had when the statute was passed and by its expressed terms the statute applied. 
    The other property, the so-called 45th Avenue property which is the smaller of the two the City had sold some six or seven months after it -- it had acquired title. 
    And as to that, the statute does not apply and I can see that the appeals of our respect to that parcel. 
    But as to the other parcel, I think that the appeal is moot. 
    Now, of course, in his reply brief, the -- Mr. Jones says he doesn't like the statute and its terms and so forth, but any question -- I mean, the -- the ameliorated statute. 
    But any questions relating to that are, of course, not before the Court on this appeal and would have to be, it seems to me, the subject of a separate proceeding. 
    Now, turning to the other parcel as to which clearly the appeal survives. 
    What happened here in substance is that the appellant had a bookkeeper who was an embezzler and a thief and they say so, themselves. 
    Incidentally, I don't know to this day, what the bookkeeper's name was or -- or what's happened to him. 
    We have accepted at their face value the statements contained by Mr. Nelson in his affidavit when he moved to set aside the in rem foreclosure with relation of his property. 
    And Mr. Nelson says on page 9 of the record in his affidavit, “On or about November 13th 1952, the bookkeeper's attempted suicide precipitated deponent's discovery that the bookkeeper had for a number of years been converting his employer's funds to his own use. 
    And otherwise, acting, so as to injure deponent and his co-trustees and deprive them of their property. 
    Now, of course, that lies at the crux of the case. 
    I don't see how the question of notice can arise in this case, as it did for instance in the Mullane case or as it did in this Town of Somers case, which incidentally involved a very similar statute to the instant one, but it was the New York State statute or the instant one is applicable in New York City alone.

    Mr. Seymour B. Quel 
    The other is the statewide statute and I might explain to Your Honor, just what the difference is and why we -- why we felt that a New York City statute was necessary. 
    You see, those statutes provide that when you foreclose, you cannot exclude any property which is delinquent because what they were trying to guard against was any possible favoritism on the part of the collecting officer. 
    Now, the state statute provides that if a parcel has been delinquent for four or more years, the tax district may foreclose.And when the tax district proceeds against these parcels which are delinquent, it takes in every delinquent parcel within the tax district. 
    Now, of course, New York City with its five counties is all one-tax district and that just wouldn't have worked for the City. 
    We don't want to foreclose against everything all at once. 
    So, the New York statute which parallels the state one very closely provides in substance that instead of doing it by the whole tax district, you can do it by so-called wards or sections. 
    The city treasurer picks out a section which is a well-recognized geographical division of the tax map and then proceeds with the in rem foreclosure. 
    Now, if he proceeds -- and again, they were trying to guard against any playing of favorites in its taking in some parcels and excluding others, if a parcel is delinquent within the definition of a statute, it may not be excluded except or -- for rather narrow exceptions which are not irrelevant by all. 
    Briefly, if some question of title has been raised or if some question as to -- if some arrangement has already been made to pay the taxes on an installment plan and one of the minor exception. 
    Now, that means that when the City proceeds against a particular section, it must include within that Section every parcel which is four or more years delinquent as to taxes. 
    The city treasurer has no discretion. 
    He may not exclude it because it is small. 
    As a matter of fact, one of the reasons for the passage of the statute was if the City had an enormous number of tax liens and no practicable method of collecting them. 
    You see, the old alternative method and the one which prevails before the in rem procedure was in essence, a method which was substantially in personam and was similar to a private mortgage foreclosure.

    Is that the customary way?
speaker="seymour_b_quel" startTime="3586.425" stopTime="3608.323">
    Mr. Seymour B. Quel 
    Yes, Your Honor, and the statute so provides -- the statute provides that if you register your name with treasurer as the owner of property, he must under the in rem foreclosure statute, in addition to the publication in various newspapers and the filing in the county clerk's office, he must send you a notice by mail and he did that here. 
    And they got that notice. 
    That is, the bookkeeper got it.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="3608.323" stopTime="3610.540">

speaker="seymour_b_quel" startTime="3610.540" stopTime="3611.635">
    Mr. Seymour B. Quel 
    Yes, Your Honor.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="3611.635" stopTime="3616.573">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Is that a -- a routine matter that if you pay a tax and they register your name?
speaker="seymour_b_quel" startTime="3616.573" stopTime="3617.868">
    Mr. Seymour B. Quel 
    No. 
    No, you -- you were --
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="3617.868" stopTime="3618.033">
    Unknown Speaker 
    (Inaudible)
speaker="seymour_b_quel" startTime="3618.033" stopTime="3886.418">
    Mr. Seymour B. Quel 
    -- it's optional and as a matter of fact, if the -- if the -- if you don't do it that the treasurer hasn't got your address. 
    Of course, you can't mail that notice and he makes an affidavit to that effect. 
    But where you register your name with them, he'll -- he sends you this notice. 
    He must under the statute and there's no claim here that he didn't. 
    In fact, it's admitted that he did. 
    That they -- what -- what they say in essence is the notices were sent. 
    The bookkeeper got them and he never called the notices of the foreclosure suit to the attention of the trustee. 
    Now, they do say however, that during this period of time and this all comes from Mr. Nelson's affidavit without any attempt on our part to go into the facts which we accepted is true. 
    He said that for a period of years, the bookkeeper used to present the tax bill and he used to make out a check and he used to pay the tax bills. 
    Now, if Your Honors will turn to page 36 of the record, a sample of one of the tax bills is -- is there reproduced. 
    And Your Honors, and this -- this relates to the -- to the 45th Avenue property and Your Honors will see that on about the middle of the page and slightly to the right, after giving the amount of the taxes, the amount of the taxes $196.20, incidentally, Your Honors will note the address of the appellant's, estate of William Nelson, 36 West 44th and so forth. 
    Now, the amount of the taxes, $196.20, the first half is $98.10.The second half is $98.10. 
    And thereafter, there appears the word "arrears". 
    And in -- underneath, there appears the legend. 
    The word "arrears" as it appears on the space indicated by the arrow, which is the arrow which appears right underneath "arrears" means that as of June 30, 1950, previous taxes, assessments or water charges have not been reported as paid. 
    If these have not been paid since June 30 of 1950, payment should be made immediately. 
    Now, for a period of some seven or eight years, the trustee got those of that character. 
    He made out the check for the current taxes. 
    He never bothered to find out what the word "arrears" meant or what it stood for. 
    I don't see how within the limits of reasonable procedure, if you have any kind of an in rem proceeding, you could hardly give more notice than was given here. 
    The fault as I say, lies in the dishonesty of the bookkeeper. 
    Now, some questions were raised during the course of Mr. Jones' argument with reference to the right of redemption under the existing Administrative Code provisions. 
    Now, that statute provides, but after the treasurer shall have filed his list and published and mailed notice and so forth. 
    Well, he have to publish as I recall it once a week for -- for six successive weeks and then you have 20 days to answer. 
    And the -- excuse me, the appellate division of the New York Supreme Court has held that if you have any -- of course, you can come in and pay your taxes which is one way of getting your property back. 
    But in -- in addition to that, you can if you wish, file an answer which says in effect. 
    “Well, I don't want to pay my taxes, but please sell my property separately and put aside any surplus for me.” 
    And under the Chapman Docks case which is cited in my brief, you can do that so that if you have an equity on the property or you (Inaudible) substantial equity in the property, you may, if you wish preserve that equity in that manner.

    There isn't any question irrespective of the opinion on the Chapman Dock's case, that if you have a defense or if you want to pay your taxes, you can come in and pay them before the expiration period of 20 days. 
    So, the statute clearly says that on its face. 
    The Chapman Dock's case was concerned with the different situation with the situation where a man for instance said, “I owe taxes on this property. 
    I do not want to pay, but I want you to take that property out of the general list and sell it at a separate sale so that any surplus from such sale redound to my benefit.”

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    I haven't read that opinion. 
    I have sent words, but I assume it's not too difficult to see the process by which the Court arrived to that inasmuch as a man may come in and pay $623. 
    He comes in and says, “This is my property. 
    That's a fund.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    That what --

    Mr. Seymour B. Quel 
    Well, I would say this that there was some doubt as to what the statute meant before the Chapman Docks case and that doubt has been resolved by the decision therein. 
    But you see, Your Honor, in this case, the trouble again was the bookkeeper.He just pocketed these notices of before of the in rem foreclosure and the trustee says that he never got the notices. 
    And, of course, we accept that statement as true, but now however unfortunate that result may be. 
    So far as the question of due process is concerned, it's difficult to see what more we could have done here. 
    You just can't show a personal service which has never been told to be a prerequisite to due process in an in rem foreclosure suit. 
    There are all kinds of tax statutes where you get judgments against property, all sorts of instances of notices by publication, which is the only notice, which have been held to satisfy the requirements of due process. 
    Now, short of actually personally serving these trustees, it's difficult to see what more we could have done in this case.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    I notice in as I now, fairly rapidly looked at the small type in the Chapman Docks opinion and I notice they say that if a party says and so on, the Court should inquire as the case of the proper for directly of sale so that surplus moneys may be available to the answering party. 
    And I noticed they were confronted with the -- the Village of Mamaroneck -- Mamaroneck case 273 App. Div. (Inaudible) 
    Anyhow, they have that opinion staring them in the face and they distinguished that case because they said in that case the owner -- merely the owner didn't say the property was worth more. 
    He didn't claim a sale. 
    He didn't claim a surplus interest so that presumably this is a moot and has been a mooted question in New York and then they go on and say, “the -- if it -- it be intended that as an owner who has answer and property has a value substantially exceeding the amount of the tax liens is to be deprived of an equitable right to surplus money, the statute must so state or so indicate clearly.”

    I would like to mention one other thing, Your Honor, which I overlooked when I was discussing the question as to whether or not the appeal was moot with respect to the larger parcel. 
    The ameliorative statute vests discretions in the Board of Estimate. 
    However, so far, that -- there have been 191 applications for the return of parcels which were taken. 
    We have granted 157. 
    We have not rejected any. 
    The only reason that the others haven't been granted is that we're still investigating when they're being processed. 
    And in the letters which I'm going to hand up to, Your Honors, there is the statement by the Director of the Bureau of Real Estate that he will recommend to the Board of Estimate that the application be granted. 
    Now, I think that -- that I can assure the Court that this application will be granted. 
    I mean, I wouldn't ask the Court to dismiss the appeal as academic as to that parcel on any theory that the Board of Estimate still had any discretion.

    Mr. Seymour B. Quel

    Now, Your Honors, I -- I've tried to outline the procedure here. 
    The only thing I can say in conclusion is that the constitutionality of the statute of this character has to be viewed in the light of the problem involved. 
    We have 834,000 separate parcels of real estate in New York City. 
    And at the time that the affidavits were presented here, we had foreclosed against something like 40,000 for delinquent taxes and I'm advised that we have proceeded against up to date, against something like 57,000 parcels and have acquired title to them. 
    Now, Your Honors must realize also that in many instances, arrears of taxes are relatively small. 
    There is no practicable way of collecting these taxes by the old Title A method, because by the time you or it would take years and years and years to conduct the necessary title searches on all the various parcels involved. 
    We have devised by this method what we think is an expeditious way of collecting these taxes which we think satisfies the requirements of due process.

    And since the ameliorative statute was passed which was early this year, there had been 191 applications for the return of properties. 
    I might say that under the ameliorative provision, we may not dispose of the property for a period of four months with reference to the future. 
    And within that four-month period, any owner can come in and make application for the return of the property upon the payment of the back taxes, as was done here in the incidence of the Powell Street property.

    I'd like to correct, as soon as I can, some misimpressions about the Chapman case that may have -- had left with you. 
    The Chapman case was decided long after this case that we're trying now was decided and long after, of course, this case has begun. 
    Of course, this case also was begun after any opportunity to make use of the answer in this foreclosure action had expired and the -- and the Chapman interpretation of that section is only good for a taxpayer whose time to answer hasn't expired.

    He thought that the statute was in itself without construction and he was alerted to think so by the discussion of Mamaroneck case.

    Then, you'll have certain rights that you don't have when you don't file an answer to that.

    In addition to that --

    Mr. William P. Jones 
    I have only a few minutes left and I would like to point out something that I didn't get to in my main argument. 
    That when the City resorted to this stringent method of collecting the taxes, there was available to it existing in as part of their tax law, the method under Title A which was the well-accepted method of selling a tax lien. 
    And then, the purchaser of the tax lien forecloses the tax lien and the owner gets surplus. 
    Now, that method was available and it was an alternative method. 
    This wasn't a mandatory method in rem. 
    They had a choice. 
    They had an alternative. 
    But they chose to use the -- the abrupt, the confiscatory method because the -- the record undoubtedly showed here that this taxpayer didn't know what was going on and that this was the -- a sure windfall that was brought in to the in rem proceeding which it turned out to be some $51,000 of windfall property. 
    Also, there's the clearly expressed intent of the legislature contained in the Governor's Bill Jacket which says that the in rem method was intended to get back on the tax rules, heavily encumbered properties whose -- where the taxes had -- had practically doubled up the economic value. 
    And that Title A, this is the corresponding title in the state statute, was intended to be applied to improve properties. 
    Now, I -- I submit that the -- that under the circumstances of this case that the action of the City violated the appellant's constitutional rights. 
    It isn't necessary to knock out the entire statute. 
    We claim that only as applied to the appellants in this case. 
    However, it would be within the scope of the Court if they saw so fit. 
    We urge that the order be reversed with cause.
