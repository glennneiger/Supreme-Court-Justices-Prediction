    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Thank you, Mr. Justice Marshall. 
    I have the opinion for the Court in number 72-5839, Patterson against Warner. 
    For reasons stated in an opinion filed this morning, the judgment of the District Court is vacated and the case is remanded for reconsideration in the light of a later case in the state courts.
