    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    In this case, police officers threatened the petitioner with prosecution under Georgia's criminal trespass law if he didn't stop handbilling at a Georgia shopping center to protest our involvement in Vietnam. 
    Petitioner thereupon, following the treat, brought this action in federal district of Georgia for judgment declaring that application to him on the Georgia trespass of law would violate his First and Fourteenth Amendment rights. 
    District Court dismissed the suit on the ground that in the absence of proof that the police had or would act in bad faith, this Court's 1971 decisions in Younger v. Harris and related cases forbade the District Court from entertaining the suit and the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed. 
    We reverse. 
    We hold that federal declaratory relief is not precluded, when a prosecution based upon an assertedly unconstitutional state statute, although threatened, is not in fact begun and therefore is not pending even if a showing of bad faith enforcement or other special circumstances has not been made. 
    Mr. Justice Stewart joined by the Chief Justice, Mr. Justice Rehnquist also joined by the Chief Justice and Mr. Justice White although all joining the court's opinion, have also filed concurring opinions.
