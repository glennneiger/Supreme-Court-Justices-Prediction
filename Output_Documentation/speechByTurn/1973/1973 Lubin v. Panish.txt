Lubin v. Panish
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="0.000" stopTime="88.339">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    I have the opinion to announce in number 71-6852. 
    Lubin against Panish, the registrar of Los Angles County. 
    The petitioner, an indigent wanted to file for election as county supervisor and the filing fee was $400. 
    He filed an affidavit of indigency that he had no income and no assets. 
    We hold that absent some reasonable alternative means of getting on the ballot, a state may not, consistent with constitutional standards, require from an indigent candidate filing fees as a condition to being put on the ballot. 
    The judgment under review is, therefore, reversed and the case us remanded for further proceedings, not inconsistent with this opinion of the Court. 
    We will resume arguments in Central Tablet, oh, excuse me. 
    Mr. Justice Douglas filed a concurring opinion in Lubin against Panish. 
    Mr. Justice Blackmun with whom Mr. Justice Rehnquist joined, filed an opinion concurring in part.
