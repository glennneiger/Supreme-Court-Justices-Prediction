    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    In the second case, Sealand, the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit held that a recovery of damages by a longshoreman in his life time for injury suffered in a maritime accident did not bar his widow after his death for maintaining a wrongful death action based on allegations that his death was caused by his injury. 
    We affirm. 
    Mr. Justice Powell joined by the Chief Justice, Mr. Justice Stewart and Mr. Justice Rehnquist, dissents, and has filed a dissenting opinion.
