    Justice Byron R. White 
    This case began when two Oneida Indian tribes sued to recover the rental value of certain lands that they alleged has been illegally taken from them by the State of New York very early in the history as nations. 
    They claimed that their rights were rooted in aboriginal possession in various treaties and in a Federal statute. 
    The District Court dismissed the case for want of jurisdiction, holding that the case could not arise under Federal Law in the meaning of Sections 1331, the in general federal question section, or within the meaning of Section 1362, a special jurisdictional section with respect to Indian tribe litigation. 
    The Court of Appeals affirm the dismissal, we have a different view. 
    We hold for the reasons we stated at greater length in opinion and filed with the clerk that this litigation did arise under Federal law, and that the case should have been entertained in the District Court. 
    The judgment of the Court of Appeals is therefore reversed. 
    Mr. Justice Rehnquist joined by Mr. Justice Powell has filed a concurring opinion.
