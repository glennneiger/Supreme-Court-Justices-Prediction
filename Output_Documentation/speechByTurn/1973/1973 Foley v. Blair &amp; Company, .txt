    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Thank you Mr. Douglas. 
    I have the opinion -- judgment and opinion of the Court to announce in Foley against Blair &amp; Co., 72-1154. 
    And for reasons stated in an opinion filed this morning, we vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case to that court to consider whether or not the case has become moot.
