    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    In this case we reverse appellant's convictions under New Orleans ordinance for addressing vulgar spoken words to a New Orleans police officer. 
    We hold that the New Orleans ordinance is facially unconstitutional because as construed by the Louisiana Supreme Court, it's over broad and it's not limited to punishing fighting words as defined in our decisions in Chaplinsky and Gooding. 
    Mr. Justice Powell concurs in the result, he has filed a concurring opinion. 
    Mr. Justice Blackmun joined by the Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Rehnquist dissents and has filed a dissenting opinion.
