Spomer v. Littleton

    Justice Byron R. White 
    In the Spomer case, it appears that after the judgment of the Court of Appeals was filed, the prosecuting attorney named in the complaint was succeeded by another as a result of the 1972 elections. 
    We accordingly vacate the judgment and amend the case to the Court of Appeals to determine in the light of this fact whether there’s still a live controversy in this case. 
    In the O'Shea case, Mr. Justice Blackmun has filed an opinion concurring in the judgment and in part one of the court’s opinion. 
    Mr. Justice Douglas has filed a dissenting opinion, in which Justices Brennan and Marshall have joined.
