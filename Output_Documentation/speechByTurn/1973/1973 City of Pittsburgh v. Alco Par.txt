    Justice Byron R. White 
    The Pittsburgh case comes here from the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania. 
    That court invalidated a taxing ordinance in the city of Pittsburgh. 
    The ordinance placed a special tax on off-street parking transactions. 
    The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania held that the tax was unduly high and that when combined with some other stiff competition from the city zone parking lots, the tax wasnâ€™t equivalent to an uncompensated confiscation of the property contrary to the Fourteenth Amendment. 
    We reverse the judgment of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania. 
    Under our prior cases, we do not think the city of Pittsburgh exceeded its powers under the Fourteenth Amendment. 
    Mr. Justice Powell has filed a concurring opinion in this case.
