    Justice Byron R. White 
    I should deal with Taylor against Hayes first, number 73-473. 
    This case involves a judgment of contempt entered against the defense attorney. 
    The judgment being entered as the conclusion of the criminal file, and granting the attorney guilty of several acts of contempt, occurring during the trial. 
    We reverse that judgment. 
    As explained in the opinion we have filed, it is our view that the hearing afforded the attorney did not satisfy the requirements of due process. 
    Furthermore, based on our reading of this record, the trial judge of a criminal trial should have recused himself and permitted another judge conduct the post trial contempt proceeding. 
    I have filed an opinion for the Court in which the Chief Justice and Justices Brennan, Stewart, Blackmun and Powell have joined. 
    Mr. Justice Douglas and Mr. Justice Marshall have joined parts 2 and 3 of the opinion. 
    Mr. Justice Marshall has filed an opinion dissenting from part 1; Mr. Justice Rehnquist has filed a dissenting opinion.
