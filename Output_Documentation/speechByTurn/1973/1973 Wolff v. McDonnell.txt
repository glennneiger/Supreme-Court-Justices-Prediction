Wolff v. McDonnell

    Justice Byron R. White 
    The third case I have is Wolff against McDonnell, which is here from the Eighth Circuit on writ of certiorari. 
    This case involves three questions, first is the constitutionality of procedures which are employed at disciplinary hearings in the Nebraska Prison System where the misconduct charge, it is serious and the sanction that maybe imposed involves the possible laws of so-called good-time credits. 
    Second question is the handling of mail addressed to inmates by their attorneys. 
    The third question relates to whether or not legal help of some kind should be made available to inmates for the preparation of civil rights complaints. 
    The Court of Appeals addressed itself to these questions and it would not pay I don't think to attempt to summarize these holdings in any detail. 
    I should simply say that we agree in part with the Court of Appeals, but disagree in other respects. 
    Principle difference being with the holding of the Court of Appeals that the principles and procedures of Morrissey against Brewer and Gagnon against Scarpelli, two recent decisions in this Court are to be generally applied to prison disciplinary procedures. 
    The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed in part and reversed in part. 
    Mr. Justice Douglas has filed a dissenting opinion, Mr. Justice Marshall has also filed a dissenting opinion in which Mr. Justice Brennan has joined.
