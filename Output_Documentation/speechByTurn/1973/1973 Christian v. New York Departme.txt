    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    In the Christian case, first one, two discharged federal probationary employees claimed that in violation of statue and the constitutional process, they were denied unemployment compensation without a hearing on the question of the factual basis for their discharges. 
    A three-judge court of the Southern district of New York dismissed the suit without addressing the statutory or constitutional claims. 
    We vacate the dismissal and remand to the District Court for determination whether appellants should be permitted to invoke administrative procedure for the review of the factual basis for their discharges, these procedures being provided by regulation of the Secretary of Labor.
