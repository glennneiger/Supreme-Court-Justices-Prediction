    Justice William O. Douglas 
    I have number 73-78, Kahn versus Shevin here on certiorari to the Supreme Court of Florida. 
    Florida has a statute that grants windows an annual $500 property tax exemption, but it does not extend that exemption to widowers and the appellant is a widower who brought the suit asking for a declaratory judgment and from the Florida Court saying that the statute violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. 
    The Court held contrary to the claim of the widower and we affirm that judgment finding no invidious discrimination. 
    Mr. Justice Brennan has filed a dissenting opinion in which Mr. Justice Marshall has joined and Mr. Justice White has filed a dissenting opinion.
