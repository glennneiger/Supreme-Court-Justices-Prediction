    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    In Gustafson, which is a companion case to Robinson, the Supreme Court of Florida upheld a conviction of petitioner Gustafson for possession of marijuana. 
    Under somewhat different circumstances Gustafson was arrested and taken into custody following his arrest and searched, after having been taken into custody. 
    On the basis of the reasoning in Robinson, we affirm the judgment of the Supreme Court of Florida, which had affirmed Gustafson's conviction. 
    Mr. Justice Stewart and Mr. Justice Powell having joined the opinion of the Court and filed separate concurring opinions. 
    Mr. Justice Marshall with whom Mr. Justice Douglas and Mr. Justice Brennan concurred, filed a dissenting opinion.
