    Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. 
    This case comes to us on writ of certiorari from the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. 
    It involves a libel action by a reputable attorney against a magazine that’s falsely libeled him of Leninist and a communist fronter. 
    The district court denying recovery, held that the subject of the magazine article was a matter of public interest. 
    The court therefore applied the strict standard of New York Times against Sullivan, a case decided here in 1964. 
    The Court of Appeals affirmed. 
    In the New York Times case, this Court held for the first time that where a public official was a plaintiff in a libel case, it was necessary for him to prove knowledge of falsity or reckless disregard of truth. 
    The New York Times standard subsequently was extended to apply it to public figures as well as public officials. 
    The rationale of this line of cases is grounded of course in the First Amendment. 
    We decline today to extend New York Times to a case where neither a public official nor a public figure is a plaintiff, merely because the publication is thought to be a matter of public interest. 
    We recognize the state’s interest in protecting the reputation of private individuals must be balanced against the First Amendment interest. 
    Accordingly we hold that the states may allow compensatory damages, for libel which causes injury to the reputation of private individuals without applying the strict New York Times test. 
    But we would not approve the imposition of liability without fault as we think this would unduly burden a free press. 
    Thus with regard to libel suits by private individuals, the states will be free to apply any standard which does not impose liability without fault, such as of negligence standard. 
    Accordingly we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case for a new trial. 
    Mr. Justice Blackmun has filed a concurring opinion. 
    The Chief Justice, Mr. Justice Douglas, Mr. Justice Brennan and Mr. Justice White each has filed a dissenting opinion.
