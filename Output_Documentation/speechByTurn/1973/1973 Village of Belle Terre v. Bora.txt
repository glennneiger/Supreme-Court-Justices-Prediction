    Justice William O. Douglas 
    This case involves questions under a village ordinance enacted in New York villages, Village of Belle Terre on Long Island. 
    It is a small village of about 700 people. 
    It has an ordinance that restricts an area to family resident roots. 
    It includes in the definition of the word ‘family’, one or more persons related by blood, adoption or marriage, and also two unrelated persons living and cooking together as a single housekeeping unit. 
    The owner of the house in question, leased it to six college students who were not related, and the proceeding is brought ahead for violation, starting the violation of the ordinance. 
    Hence, this action was then brought to declare the ordinance unconstitutional if violative of the Equal Protection Clause and other constitutional rights. 
    The District court held the ordinance unconstitutional and the Court of Appeals affirmed. 
    We have reversed the Court of Appeals holding that this zoning ordinance is lower than the limits of the police power. 
    It’s not countered upon the racial basis and not involving a discrimination in a constitutional sense. 
    The views are expressed in an opinion filed with the clerk. 
    Mr. Justice Brennan has filed a dissenting opinion and Mr. Justice Marshall has filed a separated dissenting opinion.
