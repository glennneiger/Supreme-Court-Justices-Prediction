    Justice Byron R. White 
    This case comes to here from the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. 
    The petitioner has brought this case, challenging certain New York State welfare regulations on the grounds that the regulations violated Equal Protection Clause and were also inconsistent with the Social Security Act and various implementing regulations. 
    They ask for a declaratory judgment and an injunction. 
    A single district judge did not pass on the constitutional claim, but did sustain the supremacy clause claim, that is the claim that the regulations were in conflict with federal law. 
    The Court Appeals reversed, holding that the constitutional claim was not substantial and that therefore the district court had no jurisdiction whatsoever over either the constitutional claim or the statutory conflict claim. 
    We granted the petition for cert and we now reverse the Court of Appeals. 
    We hold that the constitutional claim was sufficient to support the jurisdiction of the District Court and that it was proper for the single district judge to proceed, to consider the so called statutory claim. 
    Accordingly the judgment the Court of Appeals is reversed. 
    Mr. Justice Powell has filed a dissenting opinion, joined by Mr. Justice Rehnquist and Mr. Justice Rehnquist has filed the dissenting opinion joined by the Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Powell.
