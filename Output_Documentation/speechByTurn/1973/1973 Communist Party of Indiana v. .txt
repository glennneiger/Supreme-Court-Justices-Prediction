    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    In this case, a three-judge District Court for the Northern District of Indiana sustained the constitutionality of an Indiana statute which denied a new political party a place on the ballot, unless its officers filed an affidavit that the party does not advocate the overthrow of local state or national government by force or violence. 
    We reverse. 
    We hold that the Indiana statute is unconstitutional. 
    Mr. Justice Powell joined by the Chief Justice, Mr. Justice Blackmun and Mr. Justice Rehnquist, has filed an opinion concurring in the reversal, but on a different ground.
