American Party of Texas v. White

    Justice Byron R. White 
    In 72-887 and 72-942, the American Party and Hainsworth cases, we have somewhat similar challenges raised to the provisions of the Election Code in Texas. 
    This time, both new or small parties are involved as well as independent candidates. 
    Insofar, as the provision regulates the access to the ballot by the new parties and independent candidates, we affirm the judgment below which sustained the statutes. 
    We also think that District Court dealt with the challenge to the Texas campaign-financing law satisfactorily and that court sustained it and we affirm in that respect. 
    But the Texas statutes also deny the benefits of the absentee ballot to new or minority parties and in this respect, we think the judgment below should be vacated before further proceedings are consistent with the principle stated in the opinion that we have filed today. 
    Mr. Justice Douglas has filed a dissenting opinion.
