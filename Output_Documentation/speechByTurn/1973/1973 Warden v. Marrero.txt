    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    In this case, the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit held that the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970, which became effective on May 1, 1971 had repealed provisions of trial law under which drug offenders sentenced before May 1, 1971 were ineligible for consideration for parole. 
    We disagree and hold that the provisions of the old law are preserved by Section 1103 (a) of a new law and by the general saving statute 1 U.S.C, Section 109. 
    We therefore reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals. 
    Mr. Justice Blackmun, joined by Justice Douglas and Justice Marshall dissents and have filed their dissenting opinion.
