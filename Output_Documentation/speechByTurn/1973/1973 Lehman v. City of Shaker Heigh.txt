    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    This case comes to us by certiorari from the Supreme Court of the State of Ohio. 
    It involves basically the right of a candidate for political office to command advertising space in car cards on vehicles of public transportation. 
    The petitioner, who was a candidate for the Ohio House of Representatives, was refused available advertising space on the transit system of the City of Shaker Heights, a Cleveland suburb. 
    He brought this suit, challenging the constitutionality of the municipal policy which refuse political advertising but did allow other types of public transit advertising. 
    The state courts declined to give the petitioner relief and the Ohio Supreme Court, by a four-to-three vote, held specifically that the cityâ€™s refusal did not violate a candidate's free speech or equal protection rights. 
    We affirm that judgment. 
    I have filed a plurality opinion, joined by the Chief justice, Mr. Justice White and Mr. Justice Rehnquist. 
    We conclude that car card space is a not a First Amendment forum and that a city may exercise some discretion with respect to the type of advertising that may be displayed in its vehicles. 
    We also conclude that here the decision to limit these transit advertisements to innocuous and less controversial commercial and service-oriented advertising serves to minimize chances of abuse or the appearance of political favoritism and the risk of imposing upon a captive audience, and that this involve no First or Fourteenth Amendment violation. 
    The opinion as I have noted is a plurality one only but not a majority opinion. 
    Mr. Justice Douglas has filed a separate opinion concluding that the petitioner, although free to express his views to a willing audience, has no constitutional right to force his message upon a captive audience which uses public transit vehicles as a means of transport, not as a place for discussion. 
    Mr. Justice Brennan has filed a dissenting opinion and he is joined in that opinion by Mr. Justice Stewart, Mr. Justice Marshall and Mr. Justice Powell.
