    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    In the first, the Beasley case, the Supreme Court of North Carolina held that supervisors discharged for union membership, could not sue their employer for damages under a state statute, creating a right or action for damages for persons discharged for union membership. 
    The Supreme Court of North Carolina held that the enforcement of the state law in favor of discharged supervisors was barred by a provision of Section 14 (a) of the Taft-Hartley Act that provides, “No employer shall be compelled to being supervisors as employees for the purpose of any law, even national or local, relating to collective bargains.” 
    We agree with the holding of the North Carolina Supreme Court and unanimously affirm.
