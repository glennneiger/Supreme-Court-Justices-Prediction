    Justice Byron R. White 
    The Giordano case number 72-1057 comes here from the Fourth Circuit on certiorari, and Chavez from the Ninth Circuit on -- also on certiorari. 
    These two cases raise related questions under the Federal Statute, authorizing official wiretapping under a court order. 
    Under the statute only the Attorney General or an assistant Attorney General, specially authorized by him is permitted to approve an application or a wiretap order. 
    In the Giordano case, the Attorney General had authorized his executive assistant to approve wiretap applications, in the name of the Attorney General when that officer was absent from the city. 
    The question is whether that procedure comports with the Act, and if it is not whether the evidence obtained from a wiretap under an order that was so authorized is admissible or inadmissible. 
    We hold that an application approved in that manner does not comply with the Act, and that evidence obtained from a wiretap under such an order, where the application has been so approved, is admissible in evidence. 
    The Court of Appeals had arrived at the same conclusion, and so we affirm the Court of Appeals. 
    Mr. Justice Douglas has filed a concurring opinion in which Mr. Justice Brennan, Mr. Justice Stewart and Mr. Justice Marshall has joined. 
    Mr. Justice Powell has filed an opinion dissenting from part four of the opinion. 
    He is joined by the Chief Justice, Mr. Justice Black and Mr. Justice Rehnquist, otherwise he concurs in the opinion.
