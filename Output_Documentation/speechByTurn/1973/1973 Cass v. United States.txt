    Justice Byron R. White 
    These cases come here on certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. 
    That court disagreed with court of claims on the interpretation of a Federal Statute granting readjustment paid to certain reserve officers when they are involuntarily released from the service. 
    The question is the length of time that an officer must serve before qualifying for readjustment to pay. 
    For the reasons stated in an opinion we have filed, we agree with Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit and therefore affirm the judgment. 
    Mr. Justice Douglas dissents. 
    He agrees with the Court of Claims and would reverse of Court of Appeals.
