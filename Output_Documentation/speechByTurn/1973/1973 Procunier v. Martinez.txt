    Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. 
    This case is here on appeal from a Three-Judge District Court from the Northern District of California. 
    The appellees, California prison inmates, brought a class action suit challenging regulations with respect to the censorship of inmate correspondence. 
    The regulation prohibited correspondence that magnified grievances, unduly complained or that expressed inflammatory views, or that otherwise contained inappropriate information. 
    The censorship of personal correspondence involves incidental restrictions on the right to free speech of prison inmates and also of those who correspond with them. 
    Censorship is justified only if the following criteria are met. 
    It must first further one or more of the substantial governmental interests, implicated in Prison Administration. 
    These are maintenance of security and order and the rehabilitation of inmates. 
    Also, the restrictions on correspondence must be no greater than is necessary to further the legitimate governmental interest involved. 
    We hold that the California regulations in question do not need that foregoing criteria and therefore, they unduly burden the right of free speech. 
    The case presented several other questions with respect to prison regulations which we have addressed in our opinion filed today with a click. 
    We think that the District Courtâ€™s disposition of all issues was correct and accordingly its judgment is affirmed. 
    Mr. Justice Douglas filed an opinion concurring in the results in which he was joined by Mr. Justice Brennan and Mr. Justice Marshall. 
    Mr. Justice Marshall filed a concurring opinion in which Mr. Justice Brennan joined and in part two of which Mr. Justice Douglas joined.
