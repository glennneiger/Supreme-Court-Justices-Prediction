    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Finally I am authorized to announce the opinion and judgment in the Court in 73-1265, William B. Saxbe, Attorney General of the United State versus the Washington Post Company, a case which is here writ of certiorari to the United State Court of Appeal for the District of Columbia Circuit. 
    The respondents are a major metropolitan newspaper and one of its reporters. 
    They initiated this litigation to challenge the constitutionality of a rule of the Federal Bureau of Prisons, which prohibits personal interviews between newsmen and individually designated federal prison inmates except in minimum security institution. 
    The District Court for the District of Columbia held that this federal prison rule is constitutionally invalid and its judgment was affirmed by the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. 
    For the reasons set out in the Court opinion filed today and amplified in the court opinion in the California prison case that I have just announced, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals. 
    Mr. Justice Douglas has filed a dissenting opinion which Mr. Justice Brennan and Mr. Justice Marshall have joined. 
    Mr. Justice Powell has, likewise, filed a dissenting opinion which Mr. Justice Brennan and Mr. Justice Marshall have also joined.
