    Mr. William J. Janklow 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    I -- I would like to draw a correction, if I may, to some of the facts that I stated this morning, I think, in response to Mr. Justice Stevens' questions. 
    I draw your attention to three pages in the appendix, pages 31, 25 and 13. 
    It deals with what the policy is of the Cement Plant Commission, and I'll read it.

    Mr. William J. Janklow 
    On pages 31, 20 -- 24 and 13 of the appendix. 
    It's been stated three times historically. 
    The first time was in 1920 where they said, and I quote, “That there would be a ready market for the entire output of the State within the State. 
    In case there is a surplus, a ready market is available in adjoining States.” 
    Then in 1974, the Commission in its minutes, and I quote from the minutes, “The Commission expressed its desire that South Dakota customers and South Dakota contracts, not residents, but South Dakota customers and South Dakota contracts be given preference in compliance with the constitutional statutes of the States,” and finally in 1978 --

    Thank you.

    Mr. William J. Janklow 
    And finally, on page 13 under the Commission meeting minutes of 1978 of June 1st, and I quote, “The Commission discussed the plant's major commitments requiring approximately 218,000 tons of cement for 1978 paving projects only.” 
    After discussing all these matters at considerable length, the Commission reaffirmed its policy of supplying all South Dakota customers first and to honor all contract commitments with the remaining volume allocated on a first come, first served basis. 
    So to be correct, we should state that what we are not giving preference to residents but to customers in South Dakota and contractual commitments across the board.

    And there were arguments of counsel with no testimony, it all came on affidavits. 
    But in some of the discussion, the testimony from the trial court, from the hearing on the TRO, you can see where the discussion was made where the State's counsel said that a South Dakotan could even buy the cement and -- and we couldn't prohibit them from showing it to Mr. Reeves.

    Now, supposing that Peter Kiewit which when I was I practicing, was located in Omaha, came up and bid on a South -- on a facility to be erected in South Dakota, would that be a South Dakota contract?
speaker="william_j_janklow" startTime="324.532" stopTime="331.621">
    Mr. William J. Janklow 
    Yes, I believe it would be. 
    That would be a South Dakota contract. 
    There's no other way that define the term contract as it's used in this context.

    Or else it's a customer.

    Mr. William J. Janklow 
    That's correct.

    And even the appellants in this case agree that that case isn't -- doesn't apply and they try and evade it.

    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Let me ask you one other question, Governor. 
    Are there -- are there quarry lands available in private hands in South Dakota, does the record show? 
    Or does the State condemn and purchase up all of the quarry lands from which cement material is obtained?
speaker="william_j_janklow" startTime="420.898" stopTime="456.691">
    Mr. William J. Janklow 
    Our public records would show that virtually, the entire State of South Dakota can be used for making cement and the State of Wyoming. 
    Its limestone, coal that you get from the Powder River Basin, they have part of the ingredients and -- and aggregate -- the materials that are readily available virtually all of America, west of the Mississippi River. 
    There is nothing unique about these particular spots that we happen to be have our plant located. 
    Our original cement plant was in Yankton, South Dakota, 300 miles east -- 400 miles east and was moved to Rapid City. 
    You could put them up any place. 
    Minnesota is considering doing it right now over in Pike Stone area. 
    Thank you. 
   
   
   
   Argument of Dennis M. Kirven

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Mr. Kirven, you may have heard the question I just put to the Governor.

speaker="dennis_m_kirven" startTime="471.385" stopTime="496.432">
    Mr. Dennis M. Kirven 
    Yes, Your Honor, I do. 
    The question -- the -- the policy being enforced at any time is -- and that South Dakota declares there is a shortage, it has an immediate effect on my client. 
    In that effect, any period of time which it takes to have that matter resolved is going to cause my client money. 
    And --
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="496.432" stopTime="501.847">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Well, that's -- that -- that alone is not enough reason to keep the case alive.

    Mr. Dennis M. Kirven 
    There's no assurance that the policy won't be enforced against Reeves in the policy again as soon as a shortage occurs. 
    In fact, in May of 1979, the policy was enforced against Reeves. 
    And Reeves received an allocation formula based on expected needs of South Dakota being met first and then Reeves received an allocation in May of 1979, Your Honor, after 1978 when the shortage occurred. 
    So it's obvious that they intend, in all probability will, have or enforce the policy the next time --

    I would assume that during the summer of this year with the economic condition in the housing industry and with the demand being less that there will be no problem this year. 
    But the problem arises is -- is in Wyoming with the short construction season, the critical point for my client. 
    In that period of time, if that policy is enforced again, the -- even the time that was lost in this suit which was only 19 or 21 days or actually it's about 30 days, that my client, it's -- the harm is tremendous.

    Mr. Dennis M. Kirven 
    Well, I -- I don't know that I wouldn't have any case. 
    I don't -- the -- the assumption that private enterprise would be able to do this carries only so long as they do it absent anticompetitive motives because that private enterprise is covered by Sherman Antitrust Act.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    As a single -- a single defendant here, you don't have any possibility of a conspiracy or in agreement with anybody else.

    Unless it's --

    Well, I don't know if there hasn't been a conspiracy among the citizens in South Dakota and its State to keep this --

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well, if you had a private enterprise, how could you have a conspiracy among the citizens of South Dakota?

    Well --

    A private enterprise, it might be a conspiracy among their directors and officers to sell -- not to sell to you but that -- that's no violation of the antitrust laws.

    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    I should think a private seller could refuse to sell you because he didn't like your necktie.

    Exactly.

    Mr. Dennis M. Kirven 
    Well, that's true. 
    My only statement was that -- is -- if -- if there is a violation of the Sherman Act, which I don't know that that there isn't a conspiracy with the citizens, this -- the Governor went into state court representing not only the State but the South Dakota general contractors of that State to have the 50% allocation policy enjoined.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well, but when you say therefore, that state ownership doesn't immunize this from the antitrust law, you're implying that -- that a private cement mill would be violating the -- the antitrust law if it did this. 
    It wouldn't at all, would it?

    I wonder if there's a violation of that, Mr. Kirven, isn't really your point that -- no reason why a private seller would restrict its sales for a governmental purpose.
