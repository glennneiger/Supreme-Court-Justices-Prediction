United States v. Salvucci

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Mr. McBride, you may pick up where you left off.
speaker="john_c_mcbride" startTime="15.071" stopTime="43.701">
    Mr. John C. McBride 
    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court. 
    Before the luncheon recess, I was addressing myself to the cases of Rakas, Simmons and Brown. 
    I submit most respectfully that those three cases do not undercut Jones v. United States. 
    Jones is viable now. 
    Those cases, especially the Rakas case is limited to its facts.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="43.701" stopTime="53.609">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Why do you think then that Rakas expressly reserved the question as to whether Jones was still good law?
speaker="john_c_mcbride" startTime="53.609" stopTime="84.751">
    Mr. John C. McBride 
    Because in that case, Your Honor, the limitation of the facts, namely the defendants being arrested for the crime of armed robbery. 
    The footnote in the opinion reserved decision on that because of the different array of decisions in the federal circuits concerning the viability of Jones. 
    And I think this case gives this Court the power to once again reaffirm Jones.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="84.751" stopTime="86.934">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Or to overrule it.
speaker="john_c_mcbride" startTime="86.934" stopTime="141.368">
    Mr. John C. McBride 
    I agree wholeheartedly, Your Honor, but the point that has not been raised or has been raised but not directly answered by my brother is the issue of the prosecutorial self-contradiction. 
    In this particular case, the government would seem to have the best of both worlds. 
    At one point in time, they are saying that defendant Zackular does not have standing to attack the validity of the search because he was not in possession or had no reasonable expectation of privacy at his mother's house; and on the other hand they are saying -- and contradictory, just as Justice Frankfurter had pointed out in Jones, that on the other hand he clearly had possession enough to find him guilty before a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="141.368" stopTime="164.511">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well, what is your answer to Justice White's question to your colleague that the defendant is also talking out of both sides of his mouth when he asserts possession for purposes of a suppression motion, whether it be the substantive Fourth Amendment issue or standing query, and then enters a plea of not guilty, which means a general denial to all of the allegations?
speaker="john_c_mcbride" startTime="164.511" stopTime="167.433">
    Mr. John C. McBride 
    Automatic standing protects the defendant, Your Honor.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="167.433" stopTime="167.934">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well, why should it?
speaker="john_c_mcbride" startTime="167.934" stopTime="246.062">
    Mr. John C. McBride 
    The answer to your question is the defendant, especially my defendant, Mr. Zackular, did not testify at the motion to suppress hearing because I felt at the time, in reliance upon Jones, that we had automatic standing to assert a violation of our rights. 
    I did not want Mr. Zackular to make a statement at the motion to suppress hearing, full well knowing that under a Simmons context it couldn't be used against him substantively on the issue of guilt or innocence but in light of Jones we were constricted at that time by a search pursuant to a warrant that was governed by the four corners of the affidavit in the search warrant at that time, and in light of Jones I felt strongly that my client should absolutely exercise his right to remain silent and not say anything because he was given the benefit of the automatic standing rule enunciated by Judge Frankfurter in Jones. 
    In terms of speaking out of both sides of his mouth, if you advocate the prosecutor's position, in answer to your question, Your Honor, then the prosecutor would have my client get on the witness stand and testify yes, I lived with my mother, or yes I had some type of proprietary or possessory interest in the house in Melrose where the checks were found. 
    Clearly, if he testified at trial, he has to testify consistently with this.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="246.062" stopTime="260.105">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well, your client doesn't have to testify at all at trial, as I understood the response to Mr. Justice White's question. 
    Simply by pleading not guilty, he puts in issue, that is he denies the allegation of possession.
speaker="john_c_mcbride" startTime="260.105" stopTime="263.328">
    Mr. John C. McBride 
    But he has got the right to testify if he so elects, Your Honor, and --
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="263.328" stopTime="266.761">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Exactly, and then that is his problem, not the government's.
speaker="john_c_mcbride" startTime="266.761" stopTime="280.581">
    Mr. John C. McBride 
    But the dilemma that is posed against him at this particular juncture is he, if you advocate the government's position, would have to get on the witness stand at the motion to suppress hearing and purge himself, yes, I owned those particular pieces of mail.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="280.581" stopTime="284.067">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well, there are lots of dilemmas in criminal trials that defendants face.
speaker="john_c_mcbride" startTime="284.067" stopTime="300.062">
    Mr. John C. McBride 
    An automatic standing solves the dilemma, Your Honor. 
    What it does is it allows the defendant to remain silent and it allows the defendant to assert a violation of a Fourth Amendment right by remaining silent and gaining the benefit of Jones and the Fourth Amendment.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="300.062" stopTime="305.876">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Do you think it helps the jury or judge to determine the truth of the charges brought against the defendant?
speaker="john_c_mcbride" startTime="305.876" stopTime="316.375">
    Mr. John C. McBride 
    Well, that is not the purpose of a motion to suppress, to determine the truth. 
    The judge at this juncture doesn't determine truth, as you well know, Your Honor. 
    He determines whether or not the exclusionary rule has been violated.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="316.375" stopTime="324.477">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Do you think the automatic standing rule helps in the long run a jury or fact-finder to determine the truth of the charges brought?
speaker="john_c_mcbride" startTime="324.477" stopTime="334.612">
    Mr. John C. McBride 
    It may not help a jury but the automatic standing rule is not for the jury to assess. 
    It is up to the judge at pretrial to dispose of an issue and determine whether the exclusionary rule has been violated.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="334.612" stopTime="342.071">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    But the automatic standing rule does permit the defendant to take advantage of a violation of somebody else's Fourth Amendment rights.
speaker="john_c_mcbride" startTime="342.071" stopTime="345.289">
    Mr. John C. McBride 
    I agree, Your Honor, especially in a case like this.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="345.289" stopTime="364.192">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Yes, and the only reason that was ever given for it is that the evidence that he might give at the suppression hearing might be used against him at the trial. 
    That is the only meaningful reason it has ever been used, ever been given.
speaker="john_c_mcbride" startTime="364.192" stopTime="378.838">
    Mr. John C. McBride 
    Well, Judge Frankfurter said, Your Honor, that the defendant isn't given the unjust advantage at that time, the prosecution was given the unjust advantage by getting the best of both worlds and they should not have the benefit of the best of both worlds.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="378.838" stopTime="413.690">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    That may be, but the reason that the defendant could rely on the violation of somebody else's rights is that they didn't want to put him to the trouble of claiming his own right, because it could be used against him at the trial. 
    If he claimed that he himself had an interest in the premises or he himself had an interest in the goods seized, that might be used against him at the trial and he shouldn't be put in that dilemma. 
    Isn't that the reason it was done?
speaker="john_c_mcbride" startTime="413.690" stopTime="423.308">
    Mr. John C. McBride 
    That's correct, Your Honor, but we are not in an Alderman-type situation in this particular case.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="423.308" stopTime="424.810">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    How do you know?
speaker="john_c_mcbride" startTime="424.810" stopTime="433.659">
    Mr. John C. McBride 
    Because the defendant is charged with a possessory crime here, unlike the situation in Alderman where the defendant --
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="433.659" stopTime="448.799">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    The automatic standing rule prevents you from knowing whether you are in an Alderman situation or not. 
    You just don't even inquire. 
    Whosever rights were violate, the defendant gets the advantage of it by the automatic standing rule. 
    That's the purpose of it, isn't it?
speaker="john_c_mcbride" startTime="448.799" stopTime="452.195">
    Mr. John C. McBride 
    Clearly.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="452.195" stopTime="465.239">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    I am a little puzzled by this "who guessed the special advantage." 
    Isn't a motion to suppress evidence inherently a motion to suppress the truth? 
    Isn't that the very function of it?
speaker="john_c_mcbride" startTime="465.239" stopTime="473.061">
    Mr. John C. McBride 
    The very function, I submit, of a motion to suppress is to insure and make sure that the police do not violate constitutional rights.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="473.061" stopTime="493.787">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    That is not what I was addressing myself to. 
    The operational function of it is to suppress some of the truth that is likely to be or may be used against him. 
    It isn't necessarily all of the truth, but it is some truth that he does not, the defendant does not want the jury to know about, otherwise he wouldn't move to suppress, would he?
speaker="john_c_mcbride" startTime="493.787" stopTime="512.952">
    Mr. John C. McBride 
    Mr. Chief Justice, I have trouble with your question because you say that a motion to suppress is seeking to suppress the truth. 
    I don't say for a minute that a motion to suppress is used to suppress the truth. 
    I say that it is being used to suppress constitutional violations of the defendant's Fourth Amendment rights.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="512.952" stopTime="523.328">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    But the purpose of it is to prevent the evidence from being adduced at trial, so presumably you wouldn't do it unless you thought the evidence was relevant and material and probative.
speaker="john_c_mcbride" startTime="523.328" stopTime="546.603">
    Mr. John C. McBride 
    It certainly could be relevant and material, in this case especially, since there were fingerprints found, latent fingerprints found on the checks that were discovered at the mother's house. 
    It certainly could be probative of the defendant's guilt or innocence, but that is for a jury to assess, not a judge at a pretrial motion to suppress, Your Honor, which --
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="546.603" stopTime="552.965">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    The judge doesn't make any decision at the pretrial except whether it will or will not be admitted in evidence.
speaker="john_c_mcbride" startTime="552.965" stopTime="553.799">
    Mr. John C. McBride 
    Clearly.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="553.799" stopTime="556.823">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    He isn't making any judgment about the case, is he?
speaker="john_c_mcbride" startTime="556.823" stopTime="571.630">
    Mr. John C. McBride 
    He is not making a judgment about the case. 
    In this case he is deciding that the government does not have any evidence to use against the defendant because the only evidence that the state police had at that time were the checks taken from Zackular's mother's house --
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="571.630" stopTime="573.327">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    How many checks were there altogether?
speaker="john_c_mcbride" startTime="573.327" stopTime="576.315">
    Mr. John C. McBride 
    There were a multitude of checks, Your Honor, some --
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="576.315" stopTime="577.051">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Several hundred?
speaker="john_c_mcbride" startTime="577.051" stopTime="633.051">
    Mr. John C. McBride 
    Yes, several hundred, I believe, and there were some that had latent fingerprints of the defendant on the checks, but Mr. Zackular's mother was arrested also, and I submit that clearly Judge Garrity was correct at the motion stage in ruling that, number one, the search warrant was invalid, and there is no question about that; and, number two, that the defendants, Mr. Zackular and Mr. Salvucci, had standing to assert a violation of their Fourth Amendment rights. 
    It may have been done vicariously. 
    The search may have violated Mrs. Zackular's rights to her reasonable expectation of privacy, but the very nature of the charge, i.e., unlawful possession of checks stolen from the mail, most respectfully confers automatic standing on the defendants to assert a violation of his motion to suppress.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="633.051" stopTime="639.839">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    May I ask you, in a case like this, how does a motion to suppress proceed?
speaker="john_c_mcbride" startTime="639.839" stopTime="646.997">
    Mr. John C. McBride 
    Well, when we were up before Judge Garrity in Boston, Your Honor, the judge was bound to --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="646.997" stopTime="648.415">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    You made the motion to suppress?
speaker="john_c_mcbride" startTime="648.415" stopTime="649.103">
    Mr. John C. McBride 
    Yes, sir.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="649.103" stopTime="650.138">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Then what happened?
speaker="john_c_mcbride" startTime="650.138" stopTime="666.214">
    Mr. John C. McBride 
    And we went before Judge Garrity and the judge was bound by the four corners of the affidavit. 
    At the very motion to suppress, nothing was brought up concerning the defendant's standing to assert a violation of the motion to suppress. 
    There was argument made --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="666.214" stopTime="668.108">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Did the defendant ever take the stand at that --
speaker="john_c_mcbride" startTime="668.108" stopTime="692.904">
    Mr. John C. McBride 
    No, sir. 
    The prosecutor and the defendants simply argued on the basis of the affidavit and produced the affiant, Trooper Bellanti, who testified to certain facts, but basically Judge Garrity found, as you can see from a reading of the appendix, that the affidavit did not contain probable cause. 
    And only after, at a later did, approximately three to four weeks later did the government --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="692.904" stopTime="716.799">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Do you think that Jones, if the Jones case had involved facts like these, the Court would ever have decided it the way it did, where the defendant wasn't going to say a thing or ever admit a thing, just on the four corners of a -- there wouldn't have been any occasion to say anything like what they said in Jones, would there?
speaker="john_c_mcbride" startTime="716.799" stopTime="721.868">
    Mr. John C. McBride 
    Well, that is because Jones was limited to its expressed facts, namely Mr. Jones being present --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="721.868" stopTime="762.082">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    I know, but the danger that Jones averted to was something the defendant might say at the suppression hearing that might be used against him at the trial. 
    Here you make the motion and say the warrant was deficient. 
    He doesn't testify, and nothing can be used against him at the trial. 
    Do you think Jones would ever have set automatic standing in a situation like that? 
    I would have thought they would have said this affidavit-warrant doesn't relate to any property that -- it relates to your mother's property or your brother's property or your friend's property.
speaker="john_c_mcbride" startTime="762.082" stopTime="822.942">
    Mr. John C. McBride 
    Again, Your Honor, my answer to that is Jones was limited to the case where a person on the premises, as long as he was reasonably on the premises, had a right to assert a motion to suppress. 
    Rakas, of course, the test in Rakas is whether you had a legitimate expectation of privacy in that particular case as passengers in an automobile. 
    Here we are in a different position because the crime charged is a different crime. 
    It is possession, Your Honor. 
    Again, the vice that this Court can protect against is the vice of prosecutorial self-contradiction, Your Honor, and I submit that to overturn Jones would be to give the government the best of both worlds in saying on the one hand that Mr. Zackular has no standing because he has not shown any possessory interest, and on the other hand to say that he is guilty of unlawful possession of checks found at his mother's house.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="822.942" stopTime="845.972">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Mr. McBride, how do you respond to the alternative argument the government makes that standing as we use the term doesn't really turn on possession at all, it turns on invasion of a privacy area rather than even if you had ownership of the article you would not have standing, according to their alternative argument, to object to an invasion of the home in which you have no privacy interest.
speaker="john_c_mcbride" startTime="845.972" stopTime="849.111">
    Mr. John C. McBride 
    Well, I submit -- I disagree with that one-hundred percent.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="849.111" stopTime="857.604">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Is there any case holding that ownership of an item is sufficient to give you standing to object to a search of premises in which you have no privacy interest?
speaker="john_c_mcbride" startTime="857.604" stopTime="860.167">
    Mr. John C. McBride 
    Well --
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="860.167" stopTime="866.378">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    If ownership isn't enough, then it would seem to follow a fortiori that possession wouldn't be enough.
speaker="john_c_mcbride" startTime="866.378" stopTime="872.410">
    Mr. John C. McBride 
    The case that comes to mind for me, Your Honor, is United States v. Chadwick, where --
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="872.410" stopTime="880.232">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    He had a privacy interest in the trunk, rather, the container in which the goods were found.
speaker="john_c_mcbride" startTime="880.232" stopTime="887.907">
    Mr. John C. McBride 
    There is another case that I can't put my hand on now, Your Honor, where a fellow was in a cab and had a suitcase with drugs in it --

    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Arkansas v. Sanders, yes.

    Arkansas v. Sanders -- and he could --
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="892.991" stopTime="910.933">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    You see, those don't reach my question which is you have either a possessory or a legal or any kind of an interest in the item seized but no claim to privacy in the location in which the item happened to be found by the police, and I don't know of any case that really squarely meets that issue.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="910.933" stopTime="924.919">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    There are plenty of cases that say that if the officers are lawfully where they are when they find the evidence of crime, they can seize it. 
    What if they had found whatever was seized here in the street?
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="924.919" stopTime="929.400">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    My issue is whether they are unlawfully there. 
    There aren't any on that point, as far as I know.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="929.400" stopTime="946.510">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    I think there are cases that say that if the officers are lawfully where they are supposed to be, they can -- for example, if they are lawfully on the premises, they can seize items that they see in plain sight, even though they are not listed in the warrant.
speaker="john_c_mcbride" startTime="946.510" stopTime="955.282">
    Mr. John C. McBride 
    I agree, Your Honor, as long as they are evidence of contraband or crime, and possibly under Warden v. Hayden mere evidence of a crime, but this isn't that type of case.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="955.282" stopTime="967.264">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    And certainly here if the warrant had been good, the fact that you had an interest, even if you owned the property that was seized, you couldn't have objected to it, to the seizure?

    No, no, say if the warrant was good, say the warrant was good, it was a good warrant, nothing wrong with the warrant.

    The fact that still sticks out in Jones is the protection against the prosecutorial self-contradiction and with that argument in mind I would ask this Court to affirm the ruling on the motion to suppress by Judge Garrity and to affirm the opinion of the First Circuit Court of Appeals in Boston.

   Argument of Mark I. Levy
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1126.433" stopTime="1129.145">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Mr. Levy, do you have anything further?
speaker="mark_i_levy" startTime="1129.145" stopTime="1158.446">
    Mr. Mark I. Levy 
    Just a couple of points, Mr. Chief Justice. 
    First, we think that the Fourth Amendment situation has changed since Jones. 
    At that time, the doctrine of standing and the now settled limitation of standing to defendants whose personal Fourth Amendment rights were violated was not yet fully developed by the Court. 
    Secondly, the privacy formulation of Fourth Amendment rights exemplified in later decisions, such as Katz, Alderman and Rakas, was --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="1158.446" stopTime="1194.710">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Could I ask you, suppose in this case where the warrant was presented, the motion was made to suppress, the warrant was presented and the government said to the judge, "Judge, we have evidence to show you that this defendant had no interest whatsoever in this house," and you put on evidence to show absolutely that he had no interest in the house. 
    He wasn't a guest, he didn't own it, had no property interest -- why should there be automatic standing?
speaker="mark_i_levy" startTime="1194.710" stopTime="1196.409">
    Mr. Mark I. Levy 
    We don't believe that there should be, Your Honor.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="1196.409" stopTime="1199.191">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    I know, but under Jones would there be?
speaker="mark_i_levy" startTime="1199.191" stopTime="1208.428">
    Mr. Mark I. Levy 
    I believe so, as long as the defendant were simply charged with the possessory offense, where possession was charged at the time of the search, then there would be automatic standing under Jones.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="1208.428" stopTime="1216.217">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    On account of how the government might want to say, well, he made a motion to suppress which in itself is an assertion of property interest?
speaker="mark_i_levy" startTime="1216.217" stopTime="1223.032">
    Mr. Mark I. Levy 
    Well, I think the more substantial reasoning of Jones was the self-incrimination dilemma as it has come to be called, and that was eliminated in Simmons.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1223.032" stopTime="1229.145">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Where he does not testify as here? 
    He did not testify at the suppression hearing, did he?
speaker="mark_i_levy" startTime="1229.145" stopTime="1230.386">
    Mr. Mark I. Levy 
    No, he did not.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1230.386" stopTime="1235.005">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Then there wasn't any possibility of self-incrimination, compelled self-incrimination.
speaker="mark_i_levy" startTime="1235.005" stopTime="1236.380">
    Mr. Mark I. Levy 
    That's correct.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1236.380" stopTime="1242.944">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    He wasn't compelled to assert the ownership, the automatic standing had taken the place of that.
speaker="mark_i_levy" startTime="1242.944" stopTime="1244.099">
    Mr. Mark I. Levy 
    That's correct.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1244.099" stopTime="1262.014">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    The only reason for the automatic standing rule was to protect the defendant so that he could assert the ownership for purposes of suppression without jeopardizing his -- without incriminating himself by having that very testimony thrown in his face before the jury. 
    Wasn't that it?
speaker="mark_i_levy" startTime="1262.014" stopTime="1264.135">
    Mr. Mark I. Levy 
    That was one of the rationales relied on in Jones, that's right.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1264.135" stopTime="1265.504">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Isn't that the basic rationale?

    Mr. Mark I. Levy 
    We believe it is.

    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    What did the motion say in this case to suppress?
speaker="mark_i_levy" startTime="1269.918" stopTime="1274.446">
    Mr. Mark I. Levy 
    The motion as I recall was very brief and simply alleged that the warrant was invalid on its face.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1274.446" stopTime="1288.737">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Of course, the motion itself against our ordinary Fourth Amendment cases is in itself an assertion that I am entitled to suppress this evidence.
speaker="mark_i_levy" startTime="1288.737" stopTime="1294.685">
    Mr. Mark I. Levy 
    I think that would be inherent as part of the filing of a motion.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1294.685" stopTime="1300.073">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    But that assertion can't be used, even that limited assertion can't be used against him at trial.
speaker="mark_i_levy" startTime="1300.073" stopTime="1303.853">
    Mr. Mark I. Levy 
    Not as part of the prosecution's direct case on the issue of guilt or innocence, that is the holding in --
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1303.853" stopTime="1306.539">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Under Harris and the others it could be used to impeach him perhaps.
speaker="mark_i_levy" startTime="1306.539" stopTime="1316.074">
    Mr. Mark I. Levy 
    We believe that is correct, but even if that it is correct it does not reimpose the self-incrimination dilemma that was of concern to the Court in Jones. 
    I also note that at the time --

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Mr. Levy, may I ask you a question. 
    We've talked a lot about Rakas, in your view is your position consistent with the position taken by the dissenters in Rakas?
speaker="mark_i_levy" startTime="1324.287" stopTime="1328.298">
    Mr. Mark I. Levy 
    I believe it is. 
    I think there was no disagreement on the Court about the test to be applied.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="1328.298" stopTime="1332.932">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Because the dissenters placed stress on the privacy aspect, the expectation of privacy, is that right?
speaker="mark_i_levy" startTime="1332.932" stopTime="1334.039">
    Mr. Mark I. Levy 
    That's correct.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="1334.039" stopTime="1342.223">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    There is no claim in this case of that which the dissent in Rakas focused on, there is no privacy claim in this case.

    That's correct.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="1346.842" stopTime="1355.589">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Is it not a fact that the majority in Rakas, unlike the dissenters, attach significance to the absence of a property interest in the automobile?
speaker="mark_i_levy" startTime="1355.589" stopTime="1355.679">
    Mr. Mark I. Levy 
    Well --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="1355.679" stopTime="1361.281">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    So doesn't the majority actually cut more against you than the dissent does in the Rakas case?
speaker="mark_i_levy" startTime="1361.281" stopTime="1367.954">
    Mr. Mark I. Levy 
    I don't believe so. 
    I think our position is consistent in both the majority and the dissent because as I read the majority opinion in Rakas, the --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="1367.954" stopTime="1375.834">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    But the extent that you contend that a property interest in the property is irrelevant. 
    There is language in the majority opinion that is inconsistent with your view.
speaker="mark_i_levy" startTime="1375.834" stopTime="1382.733">
    Mr. Mark I. Levy 
    I don't believe our position is that it is totally irrelevant. 
    Our position is that it is not sufficient. 
    I think there may be circumstances in which the property --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="1382.733" stopTime="1390.635">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    How could it ever be relevant to the legality of the invasion of privacy which is caused by an improper search?
speaker="mark_i_levy" startTime="1390.635" stopTime="1410.294">
    Mr. Mark I. Levy 
    One consideration in assessing the expectation of privacy is how the property was used. 
    To the extent it was used to store one's possessions, then that is a factor to be taken into account in assessing the privacy interest. 
    It is not a dispositive factor, but I think it is one factor among many that could be considered by the Court in evaluating the defendant's expectation of privacy.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1410.294" stopTime="1418.179">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    You would agree that the majority attached greater significance to property than the dissenters did in Rakas?
speaker="mark_i_levy" startTime="1418.179" stopTime="1424.556">
    Mr. Mark I. Levy 
    I read the Rakas majority simply to leave open the question of the effect of a property interest --
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1424.556" stopTime="1430.342">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Well, you don't think that the passenger in Rakas had been a part owner of the car, that he would have had standing?
speaker="mark_i_levy" startTime="1430.342" stopTime="1431.233">
    Mr. Mark I. Levy 
    I'm sorry, I didn't understand.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1431.233" stopTime="1439.865">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Suppose the passenger in Rakas had been a part-owner of the car, would you have thought he still did not have standing? You only have standing for the driver, would that be your view?
speaker="mark_i_levy" startTime="1439.865" stopTime="1451.277">
    Mr. Mark I. Levy 
    No, he might have standing in that case, but that goes to a different property interest. 
    That is the property interest in the area that is searched, like the suitcase in Arkansas v. Sanders. 
    That does not go to a property interest in the items that are seized, and that is the basis --
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1451.277" stopTime="1465.356">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Well, wouldn't that have been the critical fact as in Rakas the passenger did not have standing, but if he had been a part owner of the car, presumably he would have had standing so therefore doesn't that make ownership the critical test under the Rakas approach on which you seem to rely?
speaker="mark_i_levy" startTime="1465.356" stopTime="1499.015">
    Mr. Mark I. Levy 
    Well, I don't think that Rakas goes that far. 
    But in any event, Rakas was concerned only with the property interest in the area that was searched. 
    I think that is an entirely different question than a property interest in the item seized as a basis for suppressing the evidence obtained during the search. 
    In answer to your question before, Mr. Justice Stevens, there is only one case of which I am aware, United States v. Mazzelli, from the Ninth Circuit, that deals with the question of a possessory interest in the item seized as a sufficient basis for challenging -- that holds that a possessory interest in the item seized is a sufficient basis for challenging the search.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="1499.015" stopTime="1500.924">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    There is another case, you know, that deals with the problem.
speaker="mark_i_levy" startTime="1500.924" stopTime="1558.941">
    Mr. Mark I. Levy 
    There are many cases that deal with it, including your opinion in United States v. Lisk. 
    Mazzelli is the only one of which I am aware that goes the other way, and that is presently pending before the Court on our petition for certiorari under the name of Conway. 
    Other than that, I am not aware of any cases that have so held. 
    We would also like to emphasize that the arguments that we present in our reply brief are applicable not only to the automatic standing issue that is presented in this case but are also fully applicable in cases where the defendant claims actual standing. 
    In particular, we believe that the defendant in Rawlings v. Kentucky, which is to be argued in tandem with the instant case today, does not have actual standing simply because his property interest in the items that were seized from his companion's purse, that basis by itself in our view does not suffice to establish his Fourth Amendment standing for the reasons set forth in our reply brief.
