    Mr. Levander, you may continue.

    Mr. Andrew J. Levander 
    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    The Court of Appeals concluded and the respondent agrees that the due process clause requires either that the district judge defer to the magistrate's proposed findings of fact or to rehear the testimony, but this analysis doesn't make any sense in the facts of this case. 
    Here the District Court adopted the magistrate's findings. 
    If the District Court had merely deferred to the magistrate's findings, it would have again denied the motion. 
    That it made a more thorough review and did not defer could not possibly have deprived the respondent of any kind of procedural protections. 
    In fact, he received more protection because he got a more thorough review. 
    We also believe that the Court of Appeals analysis is flawed in failing to consider the three facts that this Court has set forth which should be considered in determining what process is due in a particular circumstance. 
    That is the personal interest involved, the risk of erroneous deprivation of that interest, and the government's administrative and financial interests in adhering to the procedure set forth.

    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Counsel, supposing the magistrate had decided the other way and on review, that is had held that the statement should be suppressed, and on review at the instance of the government, without taking any additional evidence, the court had overruled that determination, would you say it still would be just a -- there would be no purpose to having -- then would you say the standard didn't make any difference?
speaker="andrew_j_levander" startTime="108.733" stopTime="120.625">
    Mr. Andrew J. Levander 
    No, the standard would certainly be different because he would be able to review and overturn him, that is the District Court would be able to overturn the magistrate even though the findings of fact were not "clearly erroneous." 
    He would be able to overturn --
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="120.625" stopTime="122.589">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    He could do it without taking any additional evidence?
speaker="andrew_j_levander" startTime="122.589" stopTime="124.426">
    Mr. Andrew J. Levander 
    That's right. 
    Now --
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="124.426" stopTime="132.757">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    But you said the defendant really doesn't get hurt by the Court of Appeals position but he might be hurt if it had gone the other way for the magistrate, is what I am saying.
speaker="andrew_j_levander" startTime="132.757" stopTime="163.456">
    Mr. Andrew J. Levander 
    But I think in this criminal case the respondent can't raise the deprivation that might occur to others. 
    Here in this case, he had a full and fair hearing before the magistrate. 
    The magistrate made proposed findings of fact against him. 
    Those findings have ample support in the record and the District Court, upon making a thorough review of that record, the magistrate's report and the submissions of the parties concluded that the motion should be denied. 
    The case would be a more difficult one perhaps where it was purely a swearing contest between a defendant and a --
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="163.456" stopTime="182.381">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    But your view of the procedure -- now you are saying he doesn't have standing to make this argument, and I have to think that through -- but your view of the procedure is that even if it is a swearing contest between the officer and the defendant, the district judge may nevertheless in its so-called de novo review reverse the finding of the magistrate without hearing any additional evidence.
speaker="andrew_j_levander" startTime="182.381" stopTime="187.530">
    Mr. Andrew J. Levander 
    That is a much more difficult question. 
    When it is purely a swearing contest -- and the evidence is equally balanced --
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="187.530" stopTime="191.414">

    You have to --
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="205.441" stopTime="221.255">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Or to reverse them, on the hypothetical that Justice Stevens has just posed. 
    Is it not one thing to affirm credibility findings on a cold record and quite another to reverse them on a cold record?
speaker="andrew_j_levander" startTime="221.255" stopTime="299.686">
    Mr. Andrew J. Levander 
    Yes, it is, Mr. Chief Justice, and that is why we say in our brief that the District Court could reverse the magistrate's proposed findings in a case like this one, for example, where there are objective factors in the record to support the magistrate, what the magistrate actually concluded. 
    But let's assume that the magistrate concluded that he believed respondent, well, there are various objective factors in this record which make respondent's testimony fairly incredible at points, from which upon reading from the cold record you can tell that the respondent -- he admitted that he lied on November 19th, his August 8th -- he claims he made no statement on August 8th, yet that statement that is attributed to him by the Chicago police and appears in the arrest report is the same statement that he admits having made on January 12th. 
    And it is just inherently incredible that the Chicago police made up a statement which respondent admits that he subsequently made in January following his arrest. 
    So in this kind of a case, where there are objective factors aside from the just a pure swearing contest, the District Court in making its de novo determination could reverse the magistrate. 
    Obviously, the District Court is on shaky ground in those circumstances where it is purely a swearing contest and he simply reverses the magistrate, and that is a much more --
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="299.686" stopTime="305.446">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    He believes that the trier of facts disbelieve, is that the kind of a case you are posing?
speaker="andrew_j_levander" startTime="305.446" stopTime="310.827">
    Mr. Andrew J. Levander 
    Well, that would be difficult to do, but here we don't have that problem, of course, because he adopted the magistrate's findings.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="310.827" stopTime="315.016">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Was it not difficult under the statute?

    Mr. Andrew J. Levander 
    That's correct.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="317.159" stopTime="319.501">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    The statute makes no distinction.
speaker="andrew_j_levander" startTime="319.501" stopTime="339.276">
    Mr. Andrew J. Levander 
    That's correct, but due process may come into play at some point where it is purely a swearing contest and the District Court reverses the magistrate. 
    Of course, as I said before, that did not happen here. 
    The magistrate evaluated the respondent's testimony and he found it not to be credible and the District Court adopted those findings.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="339.276" stopTime="367.302">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Let me test that out with this hypothetical. 
    Suppose the magistrate made careful and detailed findings that he believed the defendant and disbelieved the officers and therefore recommended the suppression of the testimony. 
    Now, the District Judge reading the record and nothing more reverses the district judge on the credibility finding, do you mean that would give rise to due process questions?
speaker="andrew_j_levander" startTime="367.302" stopTime="420.334">
    Mr. Andrew J. Levander 
    Yes, although that would be similar to what happens in agency proceedings. 
    The same kind of relationship that exists between the magistrate and the District Court exists in agency proceedings, in the British special master situation, in special masters in original cases in this Court, and normally the reviewing court or the court that has the power to enter the judgment does not simply toss aside the magistrate's findings, and it normally would give them credit for what are worth based on his independent review of the record. 
    And when the reviewing court reviews, let's say, the SEC's determination of something, it may be that the ALJ concluded adversely to the agency's finding of fact, and that is something again under Universal Camera Corp., this Court's decision in Universal Camera Corp., that the reviewing court can take into account as to whether there is substantial evidence in the record or whether the District Court's determination is erroneous.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="420.334" stopTime="430.843">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    But don't you take into account the difference between findings of fact generally and findings of fact based entirely on credibility of the speaker?
speaker="andrew_j_levander" startTime="430.843" stopTime="458.843">
    Mr. Andrew J. Levander 
    That is absolutely correct. 
    And where, of course, the only issue is credibility, the District Court, if you wanted to reverse the magistrate and the only issue was credibility and the evidence was equipoised between the defendant and the police officer, then the District Court cannot simply ignore the magistrate's determination of credibility. 
    If you wish to reverse the magistrate in that circumstance, he would probably have to rehear the testimony or recommit it back to the magistrate for further findings.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="458.843" stopTime="462.730">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    You say he would probably have to do that. 
    What would require him to do it?
speaker="andrew_j_levander" startTime="462.730" stopTime="463.921">
    Mr. Andrew J. Levander 
    Due process.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="463.921" stopTime="467.212">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Do you think the Constitution would require him to do that?
speaker="andrew_j_levander" startTime="467.212" stopTime="470.998">
    Mr. Andrew J. Levander 
    Because in the case in which there was solely credibility at issue --
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="470.998" stopTime="478.692">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Isn't that about what Judge Sprecher said this case was, that you have a credibility determination and therefore due process requires the judge hear the evidence himself?
speaker="andrew_j_levander" startTime="478.692" stopTime="478.973">
    Mr. Andrew J. Levander 
    Well --
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="478.973" stopTime="481.133">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    It just that they are affirming instead of reversing.
speaker="andrew_j_levander" startTime="481.133" stopTime="500.152">
    Mr. Andrew J. Levander 
    But that is a big difference because here an impartial neutral Article 3 adjunct has evaluated the credibility and made specific findings about that credibility and the District Court has credited those findings based on his independent review of the record, so therefore, just like an --
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="500.152" stopTime="514.232">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    What if he says on the review, well, I really can't tell because you've got a swearing contest here, but even though the statute directs me to give a de novo hearing, there is really no way to do it but I will just assume they are probably right. 
    Could he have done that?
speaker="andrew_j_levander" startTime="514.232" stopTime="536.447">
    Mr. Andrew J. Levander 
    Yes, and then he would be giving the magistrate's report that credibility which it is due. 
    He would say I trust the magistrate, the magistrate has made a finding, having viewed credibility, the magistrate is equally competent as the district judge to evaluate a simple matter of credibility. 
    Juries are entrusted in our system to evaluate credibility, and it doesn't take a --

    What do the words de novo determination mean then?

    Mr. Andrew J. Levander 
    A much more thorough review than a simple clearly erroneous standard.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="546.622" stopTime="556.136">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well, de novo doesn't -- doesn't de novo ordinarily mean you are privileged to submit additional evidence to the reviewer?

    Mr. Andrew J. Levander 
    When it says de novo hearing or de novo review. 
    This is a de novo determination of the magistrate's report. 
    That is what the statute says, and the legislative history makes quite clear that Congress did not intend the District Courts to rehear testimony on contested issues. 
    That statement appears over and over again in the legislative history.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="572.900" stopTime="574.697">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Then why do they use the words de novo?
speaker="andrew_j_levander" startTime="574.697" stopTime="670.674">
    Mr. Andrew J. Levander 
    To contrast it to subsection (a) in which the magistrate hears and determines motions and the District Court must give deference on a clearly erroneous standard to the magistrate's findings. 
    The Court of Appeals in our view simply misevaluated the three factors underlying the due process analysis. 
    In Lego v. Twomey, this Court made clear that a suppression hearing does not implicate the important issue of guilt or innocence, it is simply a matter of the conduct of the police that is in question and the question is whether or not evidence which is wholly probative and relevant shall be kept out because of the conduct of the police. 
    Second, the Court of Appeals viewed this to be a very -- have a high risk of erroneous deprivation, yet this same kind of proceeding has been used in England for many years, it is used in all of the administrative agencies, and it is used by this Court in its original jurisdiction cases. 
    And finally, the Court of Appeals did not at all address the government's substantial interests in using magistrates. 
    There is a terrible problem of congested litigation and magistrates in a recent article appearing in 16 Harvard Journal of Legislation, it has been shown that a study shows that the use of magistrates has increased by a third the ability of District Courts to dispose of cases. 
    In 1979, over 3,000 evidentiary hearings were conducted by magistrates under section 636(b)(1)(B), a considerable saving of time. 
    And these things were not addressed by the Court of Appeals at all. 
    I would like to reserve the rest of my time, if I might.

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Very well.

    Ms. Joan B. Gottschall 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court. 
    As the government stated this morning, the Magistrates Act not only withholds from the magistrate decision-making power with respect to case dispositive motions, but it expressly provides that if any party objects to any finding or any recommendation of the magistrate "a judge of the court shall make a de novo determination of those portions of the report or specified proposed findings to which objection is made."
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="706.360" stopTime="727.599">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Laying aside for a moment what differences if any there may be between de novo determination and a de novo hearing, would you -- do you think there is a difference between a district judge affirming a magistrate's finding on credibility and reversing a finding on credibility?
speaker="joan_b_gottschall" startTime="727.599" stopTime="753.296">
    Ms. Joan B. Gottschall 
    I do not. 
    I think that the question is whether the district judge is in a position to make an independent determination. 
    If all the district judge does is looks at what the magistrate has done and says, well, this is a credibility finding, I obviously don't have the evidence before me to reevaluate that, I don't see how that can possibly be explained as any kind of a de novo determination of anything, and I think that is the difference between what the Court of Appeals felt and the position that the government is urging now.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="753.296" stopTime="758.959">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    What do you think is the difference between a de novo determination and a de novo hearing?
speaker="joan_b_gottschall" startTime="758.959" stopTime="817.561">
    Ms. Joan B. Gottschall 
    I don't believe there is any difference, and I think that the prior decisions of this Court established that very clearly. 
    First of all, let me just point out that this act does not use the word hearing the way the government suggests, that is an evidentiary hearing. 
    This act speaks of hearing motions for summary judgment and motions to dismiss complaints and all kinds of things that are not evidentiary. 
    And this Court, in the case of United States v. First City National Bank, had virtually an identical argument before it, where a party claimed that because a statute spoke of de novo review rather than trial de novo that there was to be more limited judicial review, and the Court rejected that. 
    It said that the critical concept is de novo and what de novo means is that there has to be an independent determination of the issue. 
    And I would just suggest that in many decisions of this Court, virtually all the decisions of this Court talk about de novo, all of these terms are used interchangeably. 
    I think this is quite clearly a distinction without a difference.

    I don't believe so, Mr. Justice Marshall. 
    I think that what it appears that the act contemplated was that the district judge would be able to evaluate on what issues it would be necessary for him to rehear evidence in order to make a de novo determination. 
    Now, the case is established that one of those issues is credibility.

    Ms. Joan B. Gottschall 
    Do you think Congress meant to establish another hearing, an extra hearing?
speaker="joan_b_gottschall" startTime="855.845" stopTime="920.944">
    Ms. Joan B. Gottschall 
    What I believe the Congress was trying to do was to take some of these motions away from district judges to the extent possible, while preserving the district judge's ability to make a decision of those issues. 
    And I think that the suggestion that the statute is rendered useless because in cases where credibility was critical or some other source of evidence that wasn't included in the record required rehearing, I don't think that is true. 
    I would expect that there area great many matters where if there is an initial hearing before a judicial magistrate, there can be a stipulated record developed, a question of law can surface, and many different things can happen that will avoid the necessity of having to rehear the evidence. 
    I would suggest that a real swearing contest such as occurred in this case is really rather unusual. 
    Perhaps not in confession cases -- the Court has noted the confession cases typically involve this kind of thing, but in all the great variety of matters that are covered by section 636(b)(1)(B), I would expect that credibility would not be the critical issue in that many cases.

    Ms. Joan B. Gottschall

    Ms. Joan B. Gottschall 
    I would think that is right because in that situation the independence of a decision-maker is critically important. 
    I would point out that I think the legislative history is very clear that credibility findings and findings of fact in which credibility figured were very clearly covered by the de novo review provision. 
    There is really no question on the basis of this legislative history that Congress contemplated that credibility issues would be redetermined just like any other issues, that any finding of fact of the magistrate would be subject to this de novo review provision.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1056.138" stopTime="1070.220">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well, I would have reached almost the opposite conclusion from hearing the government's argument that the statutory language probably is in your favor, but that the legislative history is against you.
speaker="joan_b_gottschall" startTime="1070.220" stopTime="1146.984">
    Ms. Joan B. Gottschall 
    I think there are two questions, Mr. Justice Rehnquist. 
    The first question is the standard of review when a finding is objected to, and I don't believe that there is any conflict between the parties in this case that the judge is supposed to make an independent determination of the issue. 
    The government states in its brief that the judge would be violating the statue if he deferred to the magistrate on fact-findings. 
    So I think on that point there is agreement. 
    The problem arises on the question of what procedures the judge has to follow in evaluating the magistrate's recommendations. 
    And what the legislative history says, it is true that the statement that the government has quoted consistently in its brief, the use of the words de novo determination is not intended to require the judge to actually conduct a new hearing on contested issues, that is true. 
    But the government consistently omits the two explanatory sentences which follow, which state that normally the judge upon application would consider the record which has been developed before the magistrate and make his own determination on the basis of that record. 
    But in some specific instances, however, it may be necessary for the judge to modify or reject the findings of the magistrate, take additional evidence, to recall witnesses or to recommit the matter to the magistrate for further proceedings. 
    There is no question that Congress contemplated that rehearing would be necessary in some cases. 
    And from the cases that Congress cited --

    Well, the government seems to --

    Justice Byron R. White 
    I asked specifically if that was one of the options that was open to the judge, and the government said yes, that occasionally he would have a hearing himself.

    Ms. Joan B. Gottschall 
    The government suggests though a completely unreviewable standard of discretion, that whether the judge decides to hear evidence or decides not to hear evidence is completely unreviewable. 
    It depends on how the judge feels that particular day. 
    That can't possibly be the law.

    I think the question is whether the judge has to put himself in a position where he can fulfill the statutory requirement that he make a de novo determination. 
    The government's argument is basically saying that all the process that an objecting party is entitled to is to have the magistrate affirm. 
    If you objected to the magistrate's findings and if the judge affirmed the magistrate, there would be no problem. 
    But if you objected to the magistrate's findings and the district judge reversed the magistrate, well then there would be due process constraints on that

    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    What is your position with respect to say the magistrate granting a motion for summary judgment? 
    You don't have those in criminal cases, but suppose in a civil case, and it comes before the District Court, do you say that the judge -- there are affidavits on both sides so you call it a swearing contest, do you say the district judge must as a matter of law under this act hear the witnesses or at least read the affidavits himself?

    Absolutely not. 
    I think that that case is covered by this Court's decision in Matthews v. Weber, where the parties can focus the judge's attention on the problems that they have with the magistrate's recommendation and the judge can go to the record and he has the evidence before him, it was before the magistrate, and with the guidance of the parties he can make an independent determination of whether or not the magistrate was correct.

    I think that in, for instance, the Fourth Amendment context which Mr. Chief Justice Burger mentioned, the analysis might be different. 
    For instance, in the summary judgment context, in considering for instance summary judgment in a case that was going to be tried to the bench rather than to a jury, so they weren't jury trial issues, the judge would have somewhat more latitude in resolving factual questions on the basis of affidavits than he would in some other context. 
    So whether, for instance, if at the hearing before the magistrate there was no conflicting testimony but there was a question of credibility, perhaps then a determination of which party had the burden might be relevant. 
    I think that that gets into a much more complicated situation. 
    But certainly where there is a swearing contest, the trial judge had no reasonable basis for making a de novo decision of the factual matters, and that was the basis for the Seventh Circuit's opinion. 
    The Seventh Circuit read the record and their conclusion was that it was simply impossible to determine the truth from that written record.

    Ms. Joan B. Gottschall 
    There is de novo language in old statutes and old cases that indicate that what de novo means is to begin from scratch and do it all again, as if nothing had ever happened. 
    The more recent federal authorities seem to be working on some standard for de novo which give more play to the possibility of eliminating some issues than those old cases did. 
    We could have argued that the judge was required to redo it. 
    It seemed that in view of the purposes of the legislation and the statements in the congressional history that the proper approach was the approach taken by some of these recent federal decisions which indicate that de novo requires reconsideration of live evidence only to the extent that issues like credibility, motivation, veracity and those kinds of issues were present. 
    Apart from that, the district judge has a great deal of discretion to try to work out stipulations, to admit the prior record, and engage in a number of duplication-saving devices as long as he puts himself in a position to make a truly independent decision on the credibility questions. 
    I would like to speak for a minute, because I think that the government's position comes down largely to the question of the costs of rehearing and the costs in terms of economic and administrative considerations of, number one, not sending the motions to suppress to magistrates and, number two, requiring the judge to hear selected evidence rather than reading the transcript. 
    We have included in our brief some recent statistics that indicate that the whole issue of suppression motions, the hearing of suppression motions are not in any event a very substantial part of the workload of district judges or magistrates. 
    But beyond that, it seems to me that the best answer to that argument is the docket sheet in this case. 
    The government says that the interests of judicial efficiency has been saved by this procedure. 
    Well, all there was was a reading of the record. 
    But I would like to suggest that this motion to suppress would in all likelihood have been heard by a district judge in a day and ruled on from the bench. 
    What in fact happened was that it took five months, and the reason it took five months was because first the magistrate had to hold a hearing and then a transcript had to be prepared, which is not that common in most motions to suppress that I have been involved in if there is not going to be an appeal. 
    The parties, the lawyers, both of whom were government lawyers, had to prepare proposed factfindings and recommendations, the magistrate had to review all of this material and write a report to the district judge with proposed fact-findings, the parties had to file objections to the magistrate's report, the district judge had to read all of this record which by this time included a voluminous transcript, presumably in many cases he would hear oral argument and then he had to go about the process of trying to decide from the transcript with all this conflicting testimony what in fact happened. 
    Now, if any time were to be saved by having the district judge rehear selected testimony rather than reading this transcript. 
    I would submit that it would be a very minimal savings at best. 
    And we have included in our brief some references to some recent congressional hearings in which district judges have begged Congress not to give them appellate-type duties with respect to magistrate civil trial jurisdiction because they find that it is quicker for them to hear the issues again rather than reading through a transcript.

speaker="joan_b_gottschall" startTime="2396.707" stopTime="2427.004">
    Ms. Joan B. Gottschall 
    I think when it comes down to the question of whether rehearing selected testimony is going to frustrate the purposes of this legislation, it has got to be considered in reference to the alternative and what the alternative is, the government's position is that the alternative is reading a transcript. 
    The Ninth Circuit's alternative is that a tape recording has to be prepared. 
    As I understand it, the Sixth Circuit still holds to its old Wedding v. Wingo rules which still represent the condition they were in at the time of Wingo v. Wedding, that a tape recording has to be prepared.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="2427.004" stopTime="2432.729">

    Ms. Joan B. Gottschall 
    The most recent discussion of that was in the Orand case which the government has cited in its brief, and the -- I think it was a habeas corpus situation, and the Ninth Circuit reversed the District Court stating that in that case he hadn't even had a transcript. 
    The Ninth Circuit noted that he also hadn't had a tape recording which was still the prevailing law of the circuit, and that it was remanded for him to reconsider whether he ought to have a tape recording. 
    They cited Campbell, they cited this case, so I don't think the requirements are really fixed yet. 
    But it is obvious under the statute that something has to be written in so that the judge has some basis for making his decision.

    That's correct.

    Justice Byron R. White 
    So I didn't over-speak myself.
speaker="andrew_j_levander" startTime="2529.743" stopTime="2580.631">
    Mr. Andrew J. Levander 
    The de novo language in this case, in this statute is much different than the de novo language that Mr. Justice Rehnquist was thinking about and which -- and the cases the respondent relies on. 
    This is not a de novo hearing, it is a de novo determination, and in the act itself Congress uses the words "hear" and "determine" and when it wants the District Court to do, and it enabled the magistrate to do so. 
    So therefore in contrasting that language, it seems quite clear that even in the language of the act, much less the legislative history, does support the government's position. 
    Second, respondent's position as to the due process point would render suspect numerous kinds of proceedings in which the original initial trier of fact, the person who evaluates credibility is not the person who makes a determination of fact. 
    That is, in agency proceedings --
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="2580.631" stopTime="2588.319">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Mr. Levander, none of those cases are cases in which the court is directed to make a de novo determination.
speaker="andrew_j_levander" startTime="2588.319" stopTime="2588.480">
    Mr. Andrew J. Levander 
    Well, in --
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="2588.480" stopTime="2598.272">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    I understand Judge Sprecher's argument to be that when a de novo determination must be made and credibility is an issue, that then due process requires that the witnesses be heard.
speaker="andrew_j_levander" startTime="2598.272" stopTime="2649.543">
    Mr. Andrew J. Levander 
    Well, in Mildner v. Gulotta, the case involved bar proceeding, disbarment proceedings in the State of New York, precisely like the sort of situation. 
    It was a referee who conducted the official kind of proceeding, evaluated the witness's credibility, the lawyer's testimony against complaining witnesses, and his decision was not determinative. 
    He had no power to determine. 
    Thereafter the appellate division court in reviewing the record made the de novo determination, and the language is in the case. 
    The three-judge court upheld that statute, this Court summarily affirmed, and it seems to me that case is fairly dispositive of the due process point that is argued here by respondent. 
    And in that case there was some suggestion that the appellate courts were reversing the referee's findings. 
    Here, of course, the District Court has affirmed and adopted the magistrate's finding, the person who has evaluated the credibility.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="2649.543" stopTime="2664.403">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Well, on that point of affirming versus reversing, do I correctly understand you to suggest that in making the de novo determination the judge may give some deference to the views of the magistrate?
speaker="andrew_j_levander" startTime="2664.403" stopTime="2666.033">
    Mr. Andrew J. Levander 
    He is to credit it for what it is worth.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="2666.033" stopTime="2670.540">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Well, that means he may give some deference to it, so it is not really a hundred percent de novo, it is like 99.5 percent.
speaker="andrew_j_levander" startTime="2670.540" stopTime="2674.766">
    Mr. Andrew J. Levander 
    No, he first makes a de novo determination, a thorough review and he has to make the thorough review --
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="2674.766" stopTime="2685.922">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Well, his thorough review is that the evidence is in conflict, it depends on whether I believe (a) or (b), I really don't know without seeing them, so the only thing I can go on is that the magistrate believed (a). 
    Can he affirm on that basis?
speaker="andrew_j_levander" startTime="2685.922" stopTime="2686.419">
    Mr. Andrew J. Levander 
    He can.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="2686.419" stopTime="2688.289">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    So he can give some deference to the determination?
speaker="andrew_j_levander" startTime="2688.289" stopTime="2688.809">
    Mr. Andrew J. Levander 
    Correct.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="2688.809" stopTime="2691.539">

    But preceding his determination to credit the magistrate --
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="2694.565" stopTime="2695.651">

    He could be 50-50.

    -- there must be a de novo determination and the -- I see my time is up, but if I could just finish this one answer.

    Mr. Andrew J. Levander 
    Where he is reversing, where there is a pure swearing contest and he is reversing, it may be an abuse of discretion under the statute for him to simply ignore the credibility findings of the magistrate. 
    Again, he gives it some value. 
    He must give it some value, and if it is purely a swearing contest, he has abused his discretion in either not affirming the magistrate's evaluation or in rehearing the testimony.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="2725.103" stopTime="2733.110">

    Mr. Andrew J. Levander

    He can always choose to rehear the --
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="2739.802" stopTime="2744.687">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Well, if he can, the language of the statute is mandatory -- it says he shall make a de novo determination.

    That's right.

    Mr. Andrew J. Levander 
    He doesn't give deference to the magistrate insofar --

    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Well, he can affirm but he can't reverse, if the evidence is evenly balanced.

    Then the only difference between the cases of affirming and reversing is that in one case he gives deference to the magistrate and in the other he doesn't.
