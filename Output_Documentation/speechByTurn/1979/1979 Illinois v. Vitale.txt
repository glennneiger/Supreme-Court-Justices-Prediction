    Mr. Veldman, you may resume whenever you are ready.

    Mr. James S. Veldman 
    Thank you, Your Honor. 
    At the time of the luncheon recess, I was attempting to answer a question by one of the Members of the Court. 
    Mr. Justice Dooley, at page A7 of his opinion as it appears in the petition for certiorari seems to be defining lesser included offense under the concept of double jeopardy, and I submit to you that one of his errors is that he misdefines it. 
    He speaks in terms of what the fact of the lesser offense must usually contain and no element not found in the greater. 
    And I would submit to this Honorable Court that it is abundantly clear from the cases such as Brown v. Ohio, such as, for example, Virgin Islands v. Acquino in the intermediate appellate court, that for double jeopardy purposes the lesser included offense situation is thusly defined. 
    The greater offense will always and of necessity include all of the elements of the lesser.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="103.880" stopTime="110.080">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Could you cite where on page A7 he says that it is usually included?
speaker="james_s_veldman" startTime="110.080" stopTime="123.906">
    Mr. James S. Veldman 
    He says -- if Your Honor will bear with me for just a moment. 
    On page A7, three lines from the bottom, a new paragraph begins.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="123.906" stopTime="128.402">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well, it says, "As is usually the situation between greater and lesser included offenses."
speaker="james_s_veldman" startTime="128.402" stopTime="146.091">
    Mr. James S. Veldman 
    "... the lesser offense, failing to reduce..." -- but, you see, he says, Your Honor, it is usually the situation, and I think, unless I misinterpret his language, I believe that that indicates that he has misapprehended the rule, the rule of the definition there.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="146.091" stopTime="156.785">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well, he says, in any event, in this case the lesser offense requires no proof beyond that which is necessary for a conviction of the greater.
speaker="james_s_veldman" startTime="156.785" stopTime="160.283">
    Mr. James S. Veldman 
    Which, of course, I submit to this Court is totally not true.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="160.283" stopTime="173.977">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Certainly the corollary is not true, that the manslaughter charge requires proof of the homicide, whereas the lesser included offense doesn't to have a homicide or even an accident.
speaker="james_s_veldman" startTime="173.977" stopTime="216.591">
    Mr. James S. Veldman 
    Yes, the so-called lesser included offense involves no element of death, it doesn't even necessarily involve an element of collision with any person. 
    The so-called greater offense, on the other hand, can be easily proven in a number of instances without proving the lesser, since voluntary manslaughter, as Your Honors can see defined statutorily, and I have set it out at page 16 of our principal brief, clearly you can commit involuntary manslaughter in Illinois easily without the use of an automobile and therefore under no stretch of the imagination.
speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="216.591" stopTime="240.894">
    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    I have two problems with your argument and I would like you to perhaps comment on it. 
    First of all, in the statute which is set out at page A6 in the petition, there is an "(a)" on the manslaughter and there is a "(b)" that says, "If the acts which cause the death consist of the driving of a motor vehicle," and then it goes on, which is I take it a sub-category of the voluntary manslaughter.
speaker="james_s_veldman" startTime="240.894" stopTime="241.829">
    Mr. James S. Veldman 
    It is --
speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="241.829" stopTime="244.723">
    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    Which is, of course, the sub-category we have here.
speaker="james_s_veldman" startTime="244.723" stopTime="248.869">
    Mr. James S. Veldman 
    It is the offense which is known in Illinois as reckless homicide.
speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="248.869" stopTime="253.122">
    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    Right. 
    Which is, I gather, a lesser included offense within--
speaker="james_s_veldman" startTime="253.122" stopTime="259.771">
    Mr. James S. Veldman 
    It is characterized in the statute, if you will notice, as an included offense.
speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="259.771" stopTime="271.463">
    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    Now, would you say that the reckless driving of a vehicle is a lesser included offense within the offense of reckless homicide?
speaker="james_s_veldman" startTime="271.463" stopTime="276.065">
    Mr. James S. Veldman 
    Would I say that --
speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="276.065" stopTime="294.591">
    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    In other words, what I am suggesting is a sort of a pyramid, the broadest category is the involuntary manslaughter, included within that category is the species reckless homicide and an even lesser within that category is the reckless driving of the vehicle. 
    Each is lesser of the next step up.
speaker="james_s_veldman" startTime="294.591" stopTime="345.264">
    Mr. James S. Veldman 
    Well, perhaps if we had the reckless driving of the vehicle, you might have an instance where it might be an included offense, but what I think you cannot -- even in Your Honor's pyramid of setting up sub-categories, you cannot make failing to reduce speed a lesser included offense even a reckless homicide because all that you are talking about in failure to reduce speed is a simple violation of due care by not reducing speed even to avoid, say, an empty wagon which on the highway.
speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="345.264" stopTime="359.179">
    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    But the statutory definition of failure to reduce speed is not limited to cases of failure to reduce speed but also include driving at a speed that is greater than reasonable and proper and so forth. 
    There are a lot of --
speaker="james_s_veldman" startTime="359.179" stopTime="379.031">
    Mr. James S. Veldman 
    Well, I think a great many things, as Your Honor can see at page 17 in the people's principal brief, there are a great many things which are included within this particular section of the Illinois Vehicle Code. 
    And I think there are a number of separate and distinct offenses which might be committed under this section.
speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="379.031" stopTime="407.070">
    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    Right. 
    The question is, I suppose -- let me put it a little differently -- the indictment for manslaughter that is quoted on page 4 of the appendix alleges that John M. Vitale has on or about so-and-so committed the offense of involuntary manslaughter. 
    In that, he without lawful justification, while recklessly driving a motor vehicle, caused the death of George Kech. 
    Could they prove that charge without also proving a violation of failing to reduce speed?
speaker="james_s_veldman" startTime="407.070" stopTime="446.427">
    Mr. James S. Veldman 
    I don't think that is clear as the case in the posture in which this case comes before this Court. 
    There was a police report which indicated that Vitale had violate a number of Illinois traffic laws. 
    We don't -- I don't think that at this juncture, as the case presently comes before the Court, that we can say -- and I certainly personally cannot say -- whether the proof of the involuntary manslaughter would have involved the failure to reduce speed necessarily or not. 
    I think that had the case not been --
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="446.427" stopTime="462.462">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Wouldn't it necessarily have proved that he was driving recklessly and without proper regard to traffic conditions and the use of the highway in a way that endangered the safety of any person or property? 
    Wouldn't it necessarily prove that he endangered the safety of the person he killed?
speaker="james_s_veldman" startTime="462.462" stopTime="463.768">

    Oh, it would --

speaker="james_s_veldman" startTime="467.976" stopTime="473.080">
    Mr. James S. Veldman 
    But do you notice, Your Honor, that the statute -- the statute begins -- we are talking about traffic statute --

    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Right.
speaker="james_s_veldman" startTime="473.699" stopTime="490.817">
    Mr. James S. Veldman 
    The statute begins, "No vehicle may be driven upon a highway of this state at a speed which is greater than reasonable," et cetera, and it goes on and it makes a number of what I would consider to be possibly separate and distinct traffic offenses, one of which is failure to reduce speed.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="490.817" stopTime="491.047">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Yes.
speaker="james_s_veldman" startTime="491.047" stopTime="513.558">
    Mr. James S. Veldman 
    And I think Mr. Justice Underwood commented in his dissenting opinion on this very subject, that it was impossible to know which of the number of possible violations committed under this or other sections might have been the basic proof in the involuntary manslaughter.

    The way the case came, if Your Honor will note appendix B of the petition for certiorari, the way that the cause came to the Supreme Court of Illinois, the Appellate Court of Illinois for the First District had decided that they had not said much or anything about the double jeopardy question involved in the case. 
    They had simply based it on an Illinois statute. 
    Mr. Justice Dooley and the majority of the Illinois Supreme Court in their opinion said we find an even more compelling rationale in the Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution. 
    This forum, the forum before this Honorable Court is really the first time in which a full-fledged argument on the double jeopardy aspects of this case has been made, as I see it.

speaker="james_s_veldman" startTime="643.190" stopTime="705.343">
    Mr. James S. Veldman 
    Basically the people's brief which is in the Supreme Court of Illinois, which I might point I did not either write or argue -- dealt basically with the state law question which came up from the Appellate Court. 
    We have the procedure in Illinois of leave to appeal, and one's petition for leave to appeal is normally limited to those questions in the Appellate Court which are considered error by the petitioner. 
    So we were somewhat limited in what we could argue before the Supreme Court of Illinois. 
    And the briefs for respondent in the Supreme Court of Illinois really did not bring out the double jeopardy question which under Illinois court procedure, again, limited the people in that we were compelled basically to keep our answer within the bounds raised by the party appellee there.

    Mr. James S. Veldman 
    The so-called compulsory joinder statute in Illinois. 
    The Appellate Court opinion I think can be pretty much condensed down to the fact that this prosecution violated sections 3-3 and 3-4 of chapter 38 of the Illinois Revised Statutes in that all of these offenses could have and should have been joined before a single court for trial. 
    The Supreme Court of Illinois totally departed from that rationale.

    But Mr. Vitale has been found guilty and he did not plead guilty. 
    He was found guilty in the traffic proceeding and was fined in the sum of $15.

speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="790.880" stopTime="823.354">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Mr. Veldman, it occurs to me that as a matter of Illinois law, we do have an opinion of the intermediate, the Appellate Court to the effect that these two offenses are the same offense within the meaning of the Illinois Criminal Code. 
    That holding was not reviewed by the Illinois Supreme Court which apparently went on federal grounds. 
    But the highest court of the state which has spoken to the issue has told us that as a matter of Illinois law we have the same offense, isn't that true?

    And aren't we bound by the teaching of the highest court of Illinois that tells us anything about a state law issue?

    Mr. James S. Veldman 
    You do not have a final determination of that issue by the highest reviewing court.

    But it is unreversed at least.

    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    In other words, the Illinois Supreme Court may have merely said yes and, oh, by the way, it also violates the federal Constitution.
speaker="james_s_veldman" startTime="854.240" stopTime="920.008">
    Mr. James S. Veldman 
    No, but they did not say that, Your Honor. 
    They specifically, in answer to our petition for certiorari 78-2, when this Honorable Court sent the case back, the Supreme Court of Illinois specified that its opinion was based on the Firth Amendment, so they declined to decide the issue, and I can understand that because the committee comments appended to section 3-3 and 3-4 -- and those committee comments in Illinois are proper source of legislative intent -- indicate that what those sections were basically meant to cover was an instance involving multiple prosecutions under a single act or a series of acts which were not covered or barred by the concept of double jeopardy in the Fifth Amendment, and it may have very well been that finding, as they did, that the Fifth Amendment barred the prosecution, that the Supreme Court of Illinois thought it superfluous to discuss the Illinois statute under those conditions.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="920.008" stopTime="948.238">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Suppose, Mr. Veldman, hypothetically -- this is a further hypothetical -- you could persuade us that there was some basis for reversing the Supreme Court of Illinois on their federal holding, would there be anything to prevent that court when the case was remanded from in effect adopting the Court of Appeals opinion and putting it on state grounds and therefore impervious to any challenge?
speaker="james_s_veldman" startTime="948.238" stopTime="966.013">
    Mr. James S. Veldman 
    I think that having determined that in the basis of its opinion was purely federal constitutional grounds, that the Supreme Court of Illinois would be precluded from so doing. 
    I should think that --

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    How could anyone preclude them from saying, as Mr. Justice Stevens just suggested, the inverse of what you suggested, as a matter of fact, that if the is the attitude of the Supreme Court of the United States, all right, we will decide it on state grounds and then decide it just the way the Court of Appeals did.
speaker="james_s_veldman" startTime="985.831" stopTime="1045.271">
    Mr. James S. Veldman 
    Well, I suppose that in theory there is nothing to prevent them from doing it, but I think that in actuality the proper remedy -- and I think that if I were before the Supreme Court of Illinois, I would argue that the proper remedy, having decided it on federal constitutional grounds and been then reversed, would be to return the case to the Unified Circuit Court of Cook County for further proceedings under this indictment, and the question there, I think we would then have perhaps the question of the applicability of the statute but I think it would be raised properly in the trial court. 
    I think it would ill-behoove the Supreme Court of Illinois to say, well, we decided our opinion was on one rationale but since they won't buy that we will just go 180 degrees the other way, and I cannot conceive, being somewhat familiar with the Justices on the Supreme Court of Illinois, that they would do that.

    Mr. James S. Veldman 
    Yes, if nothing else. 
    And as I have said, their specific answer to the inquiry of this Court under the petition for certiorari, the original petition for certiorari in this case was, the question presented to the Supreme Court of Illinois was have you decided this case on state grounds, federal grounds or both, and the answer was federal grounds alone.

speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1122.952" stopTime="1175.432">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Mr. Veldman, is that really quite correct? 
    At page A3 of the petition, after reviewing the proceeding in the Appellate Court, they conclude that that court had concluded that the Appellate Court concluded that the acts in both the offense of failure to reduce speed and the offense of involuntary manslaughter were identical with the exception in the manslaughter offense a death was involved. 
    Then they said it follows from that that under the Illinois statute 3(b), since the prosecutor knew about both at the same time, as a matter of state law dismissal was required. 
    Then they said after that there is an even more compelling reason for dismissal giving this hypothesis, that is that the double jeopardy clause of the Federal Constitution also requires dismissal. 
    Now, what is the federal error in that analysis?

    The federal error in the analysis of the state statute?

    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    What federal error did the Illinois Supreme Court commit, given the identity of the offenses which the Appellate Court had found and which the Supreme Court of Illinois did not disagree with but merely said we need not rely on the state statute that requires dismissal when identical offenses are involved, we can rely on the federal Constitution that requires dismissal when identical offenses are involved. 
    What is the federal error that that court committed?
speaker="james_s_veldman" startTime="1206.624" stopTime="1220.377">
    Mr. James S. Veldman

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    If as a matter of state law first degree murder includes manslaughter, say, how is that affected one way or the other by the federal Constitution?

    Mr. James S. Veldman 
    Because unless I misread the position taken by Mr. Justice Dooley and the majority of the Supreme Court of Illinois, their position was that the offenses were the same offense for double jeopardy purposes but then the statute barred them. 
    It would have barred them in Illinois too had they --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1292.354" stopTime="1297.046">

    Yes.

    The Blockburger original test was not a double jeopardy case.

    Mr. James S. Veldman 
    But what I am saying here is that I think that as you not believe that this court can be bound by what is a total erroneous interpretation of what is a lesser included offense because if this court is so bound then in fact the Illinois supreme court by determining an Illinois question would be detecting the applicapabilty of Brown v. Ohio in this court --

    Mr. James S. Veldman 
    For example, one could have -- one could be convicted of murder. 
    Take an extreme example. 
    Suppose someone were charged with murder and then were convicted of armed robbery on the evidence presented and the legislature said, well, armed robbery may be a lesser included offense of murder, and this Court -- now, that is reduxio absurda, I grant you, it would never be that extreme.

   Argument of Lawrence G. Dirksen
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1480.596" stopTime="1485.354">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Mr. Dirksen.
speaker="lawrence_g_dirksen" startTime="1485.354" stopTime="1591.693">
    Mr. Lawrence G. Dirksen 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court. 
    My name is Lawrence Dirksen, and I represent the respondent, John Vitale. 
    Your Honors, I believe, to clarify some of the questions that first came out, I can probably fill the Court in a little bit on the history of this case because this is the first time that double jeopardy really has ever become an issue. 
    This case has been all over and every conceivable argument that could have been made against John Vitale by the State of Illinois has been made. 
    Originally, they challenged us on jurisdiction. 
    Just to take a step backwards John Vitale was tried on the minor traffic violation. 
    His uncle represented him on that matter. 
    He was tried in the suburban court not too far outside of Chicago. 
    From the conversation I had with his uncle, there was a full trial. 
    Not only did the witnesses testify against John Vitale, John Vitale testified himself, which is neither here nor there. 
    But if I had been representing him, I certainly would not have allowed him to take the stand, but he did testify, so it was a full trial. 
    As I see this case, I have absolutely no argument -- in fact, I entirely agree with Judge Dooley's opinion. 
    But really what we would be talking about here would be multiple trials if the state would prevail on this final argument because as I say, they had gone from jurisdiction originally. 
    That didn't work. 
    They said we can do one thing in the traffic court and we can do something else in the juvenile. 
    Well, John Vitale is no longer a juvenile, but in those days they thought that they could prosecute him on traffic here and perhaps on the manslaughter over in the juvenile court. 
    The fact of the matter is that they couldn't do it as an adult. 
    I raised that question in the Circuit Court, I raise it in the Appellate Court, and I asked the state in front of the Illinois Supreme Court.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1591.693" stopTime="1595.216">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    You raised that on state grounds?
speaker="lawrence_g_dirksen" startTime="1595.216" stopTime="1605.661">
    Mr. Lawrence G. Dirksen 
    Your Honor, my original motion was to dismiss the petition for adjudication of delinquency and it was based on statutory and/or constitutional grounds of double jeopardy which had compulsory joinder statutes --
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1605.661" stopTime="1607.180">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Federal double jeopardy?

speaker="lawrence_g_dirksen" startTime="1609.161" stopTime="1627.453">
    Mr. Lawrence G. Dirksen 
    It was a joint motion, yes. 
    I won both ways. 
    The Circuit Court ruled on the compulsory joinder statutes that the matter should have been joined in one trial, one proceeding. 
    The Appellate Court said the same thing and they further reiterated that --
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1627.453" stopTime="1632.765">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Could I ask you a question about the argument in the Illinois Appellate Court. 
    I gather you did represent --
speaker="lawrence_g_dirksen" startTime="1632.765" stopTime="1635.142">
    Mr. Lawrence G. Dirksen 
    Yes, Your Honor, I represented him since the juvenile court.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1635.142" stopTime="1654.240">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Did the state argue that even on the assumption that the offenses are identical, one being included within the other, nevertheless the Illinois state compulsory joinder statute is not applicable because it doesn't apply to juvenile proceedings or doesn't apply to traffic offenses or something of that character?
speaker="lawrence_g_dirksen" startTime="1654.240" stopTime="1660.014">
    Mr. Lawrence G. Dirksen 
    No, I think it was very clear, there was never a question that it did not apply to juveniles. 
    The state argued that but the court --
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1660.014" stopTime="1661.765">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    The state argued that it did not apply then?
speaker="lawrence_g_dirksen" startTime="1661.765" stopTime="1663.002">
    Mr. Lawrence G. Dirksen 
    Right.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1663.002" stopTime="1679.091">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    And so is it possible that what the Supreme Court of Illinois was saying is, well, we have identical offenses here, we don't have to decide whether the state compulsory joinder statute applies because in any event when you've got the same offenses you've got the protection under the federal Constitution.
speaker="lawrence_g_dirksen" startTime="1679.091" stopTime="1699.210">
    Mr. Lawrence G. Dirksen 
    I believe that is correct, Your Honor. 
    A juvenile issue was entirely dismissed because I think we all recognize, and everybody did in the courts, the nine judges from the State of Illinois thus far, that juveniles have all the same rights as adults and that is what I was saying when I back-tracked, the state abandoned that argument. 
    They said, okay, forget about the juvenile question.

    You see, here we are not talking about the amount of speed, we are talking about the fact that he failed to reduce it, the fact that he failed to reduce speed resulted in a collision with a person, and the death of that person resulted in another charge or two other charges being filed against that same man, those charges being involuntary manslaughter.

    Mr. Lawrence G. Dirksen 
    I say I simply think the state in this case, they simply erred and they are coming before this Court and saying would you please rectify our error because we don't want to set a bad precedent in Illinois. 
    This wouldn't happen in an adult case. 
    It would not have happened if the state had kept its eye on things. 
    After all, this young man was charged on November 20, 1974, with a traffic offense. 
    He was tried a month later. 
    They had plenty of time. 
    The juvenile officer in South Holland necessarily had to go to the juvenile court, which is loaded with states attorneys, get the necessary petitions to file for an adjudication of delinquency, he obviously had those in his -- I mean this is supposition, but he had to have them at least the next day after the trial because we are talking about a trial that John Vitale went through, and now the state is saying we want another trial because he only had a $15 fine.

    No, Your Honor. 
    I don't have the argument with the offenses, I have the argument with the multiple trials.

    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    You think it is double jeopardy. 
    But you would say that there is a one transaction test, or don't you?

    Mr. Lawrence G. Dirksen 
    No, Your Honor, I don't think we need to go that far. 
    I am very aware of Mr. Justice Brennan's and Mr. Justice Marshall's transaction test. 
    I don't think we even need go that far. 
    I agree with them but I don't think we need to go that far because we are not talking about one transaction, we are talking about one act. 
    There was an act of an accident, that accident resulted in a traffic charge and two deaths. 
    And as I pointed out in my brief, if you can take that one act, you could create not only the offense of failing to reduce speed to avoid an accident, you could also create involuntary manslaughter, you could create reckless homicide, you could create reckless conduct, reckless driving, failing --

    You are asking them for a principle that has never been enunciated by this Court if for one act you can only be charged once. 
    Certainly, Brown v. Ohio doesn't say that.

    Mr. Lawrence G. Dirksen 
    No, I'm not saying that, Your Honor.

    Justice Byron R. White 
    You at least say you must abandon the offense test.

    Your Honor, all I am saying --

    Justice Byron R. White 
    You suggest that even if the offenses are different, and even if to prove the one you don't need to prove something that is involved in the other --
speaker="lawrence_g_dirksen" startTime="2185.617" stopTime="2191.082">
    Mr. Lawrence G. Dirksen 
    No, I say you could prosecute those offenses but you have to do it in one trial. 
    You can't take one after the other.

    I know you do, but that has not been the rule --

    Mr. Lawrence G. Dirksen 
    No, that is what I started with, Your Honor, in our own compulsory joinder statute.

    Justice Byron R. White 
    I know, but I want to know, aside from your compulsory joinder statute.

    Mr. Lawrence G. Dirksen 
    I still think all charges that arise out of one act, the separate offenses can be tried but they have to be tried together.

    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    What case do you rely on from this Court for that proposition?

    Mr. Lawrence G. Dirksen 
    Well, our compulsory joinder statute does provide that, so that is a good place to start. 
    I mean, it --

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    It is a good idea to abandon also, because that is a matter of your state law. 
    That has never been held here as a matter of constitutional double jeopardy law.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Or the other hand, Brown v. Ohio was decided by this Court under the double jeopardy provision as applied to the states for the Fourteenth Amendment and that involved lesser included offenses, and I would think that your argument would be based squarely on that case.

    Your Honor, I couldn't more agree with you. 
    I am simply stating my position philosophically, but I do agree with the decision of Justice Dooley.

    Mr. Dirksen, can I ask you, under the failing to reduce speed statute in Illinois, I notice your client was only fined $15. 
    What was the maximum penalty under that statute?

    Mr. Lawrence G. Dirksen 
    Your Honor, it was a Class C misdemeanor, it could have carried up to a $500 fine and 30 days in jail.

    Thirty days.
