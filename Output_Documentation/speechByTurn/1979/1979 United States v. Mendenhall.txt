United States v. Mendenhall

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    We will hear arguments first this morning in 78-1821, United States v. Mendenhall. 
    Mr. Frey, you may proceed whenever you are ready.

    Mr. Andrew L. Frey 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court. 
    This case is here on writ of certiorari to review a judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, reversing respondent's conviction for possession of heroin on the ground that the heroin in question had been discovered as a result of an illegal search. 
    The case began when two trained DEA agents assigned to the Detroit Airport observed respondent deplane from an early morning flight from Los Angeles which they knew to be a major source city for heroin. 
    The agents became suspicious when she exhibited unusual nervousness and scanned the terminal area as though looking for surveillance. 
    After following her through the airport and having their suspicions reinforced, they approached her as she was proceeding down the concourse toward the gate for an Eastern Airlines flight to Pittsburgh. 
    They identified themselves as federal agents and asked if she would show them some identification and her ticket. 
    She did so and they discovered that she was traveling under an assumed name. 
    After several more questions, they asked if she would accompany them to the nearby DEA office for further questioning, which she did. 
    Once inside the office, the agents asked respondent if she would consent to a search of her pocketbook and of her person, informing her that she had a right to refuse consent to the search. 
    She consented and the ensuing search disclosed over half a pound of heroin. 
    The entire encounter took about ten minutes. 
    The District Court found that the agents had a reasonable --

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    You mean preceding the search?
speaker="andrew_l_frey" startTime="113.960" stopTime="124.120">
    Mr. Andrew L. Frey 
    The initial encounter in the airport concourse took about two or three minutes, and then the further events in the DEA office took another five to ten minutes.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="124.120" stopTime="126.050">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Including the search?
speaker="andrew_l_frey" startTime="126.050" stopTime="159.117">
    Mr. Andrew L. Frey 
    I believe that is what the evidence was. 
    In any event, up to the point where the consent was given to the search was a relatively brief period of only a few minutes. 
    The District Court found that the agents had a reasonable suspicion that respondent was engaged in criminal activities at the time they first approached her, that she went to the office with the agents voluntarily in a spirit of apparent cooperation, and that she thereafter voluntarily consented to the search.

    Justice Byron R. White 
    Mr. Frey, do you think that when you say there was a reasonable suspicion from the outset, are you talking in Terry terms or not?
speaker="andrew_l_frey" startTime="169.700" stopTime="171.776">
    Mr. Andrew L. Frey 
    The District Court I think was talking in Terry terms.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="171.776" stopTime="175.309">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    How about you?
speaker="andrew_l_frey" startTime="175.309" stopTime="185.413">
    Mr. Andrew L. Frey 
    Well, I intend to devote most of my argument to the question of whether this was a Terry stop and if so whether the quantum of suspicion was sufficient to --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="185.413" stopTime="187.516">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    For the moment, you are telling us what the District Court held?
speaker="andrew_l_frey" startTime="187.516" stopTime="200.414">
    Mr. Andrew L. Frey 
    I am telling you what the District Court held, that's correct. 
    I think ultimately my answer is probably no, that the standard is not the same as Terry but, rather, the lesser standard that --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="200.414" stopTime="210.521">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    So you don't think that at the time they first spoke to her that they had a right to pat her down?
speaker="andrew_l_frey" startTime="210.521" stopTime="219.362">
    Mr. Andrew L. Frey 
    No, I don't think they had a right to pat her down and frisk her but that relates to the reasonable perception that she might be dangerous, which I don't think they had.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="219.362" stopTime="224.337">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    But it also depends on whether there was a reasonable suspicion of criminal activity.
speaker="andrew_l_frey" startTime="224.337" stopTime="236.069">
    Mr. Andrew L. Frey 
    It does and I do think they had a right to detain her at the time they first spoke to her, that is to stop her. 
    I'm not asserting that they had a right to frisk her and they didn't frisk her.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="236.069" stopTime="240.473">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    You rely on the Mimm standard, do you?
speaker="andrew_l_frey" startTime="240.473" stopTime="279.167">
    Mr. Andrew L. Frey 
    No, I intended to rely on Martinez-Fuerte for that proposition, because in Martinez-Fuerte, as I will get to, the Court suggested that the quantum of suspicion that was needed for a roving patrol stop in Brignoni-Ponce was not necessary for a referral to the secondary inspection area for questioning in Martinez-Fuerte, and I think -- while I think they had enough suspicion to meet the normal Brignoni-Ponce standard in this case, I think the minimal nature of the intrusion required even less suspicion than that.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="279.167" stopTime="283.037">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    In other words, there is a standard below Terry that you rely on for that?
speaker="andrew_l_frey" startTime="283.037" stopTime="313.369">
    Mr. Andrew L. Frey 
    Well, it is difficult to say whether Terry -- Terry enunciated a standard on the facts of Terry and held that what was known to the officer justified the action that he took in Terry. 
    I think that the Court's ensuing cases have made clear that the inquiry is a measurement of the degree of intrusion involved in the particular police action weighed against the degree of suspicion, the basis for the officer's action in the law enforcement needs.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="313.369" stopTime="324.842">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    You are taking the position -- I don't want to take too much of your time -- you are taking the position that something less than Terry can in some circumstances justify a detention against the will of the person detained?
speaker="andrew_l_frey" startTime="324.842" stopTime="337.843">
    Mr. Andrew L. Frey 
    Well, I am saying that the kind of encounter that incurred in the airport between the agents and respondent Mendenhall, which we first contend was not a seizure of her person at all --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="337.843" stopTime="338.361">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    I understand that.
speaker="andrew_l_frey" startTime="338.361" stopTime="365.979">
    Mr. Andrew L. Frey 
    -- if the Court disagrees with that contention and holds that it is a seizure, I am contending next that some suspicion that might not justify the stop of an automobile or a frisk would justify going up to somebody and asking them questions as was done here. 
    And I am further contending that even if the Court disagrees with that, that what existed here was enough for a Terry stop.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="365.979" stopTime="366.682">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    I understand.

    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Mr. Frey, you've been here often enough so that you will understand this question may be repetitious. 
    Is my understanding that your first contention is that a simple approach by a police officer to someone and say I'd like to ask you a question is not a detention at all --
speaker="andrew_l_frey" startTime="389.476" stopTime="390.748">
    Mr. Andrew L. Frey 
    Not a seizure of the person under the Fourth Amendment.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="390.748" stopTime="393.240">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Not a seizure of the person under the Fourth Amendment.
speaker="andrew_l_frey" startTime="393.240" stopTime="394.337">
    Mr. Andrew L. Frey 
    That is our first contention.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="394.337" stopTime="404.771">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Are you contending -- I will move now into the drug office -- are you depending on her consent to a search?
speaker="andrew_l_frey" startTime="404.771" stopTime="424.248">
    Mr. Andrew L. Frey 
    We are making two alternative arguments, either of which would justify a reversal of the Court of Appeals decision, the first that it was supported by her consent and therefore did not have to meet other Fourth Amendment requirements, and the second that it did satisfy the requirements of the Fourth Amendment, assuming that the consent was not sufficient.

    Why do you need the second one if you have the first one?

    Mr. Andrew L. Frey 
    Well, I'm not sure that you will agree with the first one and therefore --

    I'm not sure I understand.

    No, our --
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="440.641" stopTime="446.284">

    So that somebody else who doesn't consent will be forcedly held.
speaker="andrew_l_frey" startTime="446.284" stopTime="446.406">
    Mr. Andrew L. Frey 
    No.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="446.406" stopTime="447.849">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Isn't that what you want us to do?
speaker="andrew_l_frey" startTime="447.849" stopTime="451.385">
    Mr. Andrew L. Frey 
    I believe that what you would do logically would be to first --
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="451.385" stopTime="453.693">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Well, why would we have to do the second one?
speaker="andrew_l_frey" startTime="453.693" stopTime="470.099">
    Mr. Andrew L. Frey 
    You don't have to reach the second issue if you agree with us on the first with regard to the move to the office. 
    The District Court sustained the move to the office on the ground of respondent's consent to go to the office. 
    If that finding is not clearly erroneous and --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="470.099" stopTime="471.871">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    You were telling us what the District Court did --
speaker="andrew_l_frey" startTime="471.871" stopTime="472.465">
    Mr. Andrew L. Frey 
    That is our argument.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="472.465" stopTime="476.498">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    -- and you were half-way through that and you haven't even got to the Court of Appeals yet.
speaker="andrew_l_frey" startTime="476.498" stopTime="484.253">
    Mr. Andrew L. Frey 
    That's correct. 
    I'm not sure I have answered Justice Marshall's question, but --
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="484.253" stopTime="488.313">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    It doesn't matter to me.
speaker="andrew_l_frey" startTime="488.313" stopTime="572.701">
    Mr. Andrew L. Frey 
    We are not insisting that you reach the second issue about whether this would be permissible in the absence of her consent, but if you find that there was not a valid consent then we do present that second issue for your decision. 
    Now, the Court of Appeals reversed and in essence the court held that the factors relied upon to justify the initial encounter with respondent did not give rise to a reasonable suspicion of criminal activity because respondent's actions as observed by the agents were consistent with innocent behavior. 
    It further held that asking respondent to accompany the agents to the DEA office constituted an arrest requiring probable cause on the ground that respondent was not free to leave at the time this occurred. 
    Finally, the court held that the consent to the search was not valid. 
    Present for decision by this Court are three questions, each of which has two sub-issues. 
    The first question concerns the initial encounter between the agents and the respondent and whether that violated her Fourth Amendment rights. 
    And as I have mentioned, we contend that it did not, for two reasons First, we contend that it was not a seizure of her person within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment; and, secondly, we contend that if it was, it was supported by the necessary degree of suspicion to justify the particular minimal intrusive encounterment.

    Mr. Andrew L. Frey 
    Well, I would also --
speaker="lewis_f_powell_jr" startTime="580.159" stopTime="583.764">
    Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. 
    -- and it was there that she was --
speaker="andrew_l_frey" startTime="583.764" stopTime="640.012">
    Mr. Andrew L. Frey 
    Well, I can get into that some detail, if you would like. 
    The facts or which the agents relied were first that she came from Los Angeles which -- they were watching the flight from Los Angeles because it was known by them to be a source city of Mexican heroin. 
    When she got off the plane, she got off last, but I think that is a sub-category of the fact that she looked around as though locking for surveillance and seemed unusually nervous, and that I think is quite clear is what triggered the agents' suspicion of her, and indeed I will argue that that in itself, because of the nature of the agents' experience would be sufficient to justify what the agents thereafter did. 
    They in fact followed her as she went down to the baggage area, didn't picked up any baggage--
speaker="lewis_f_powell_jr" startTime="640.012" stopTime="642.189">
    Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr.

    Mr. Andrew L. Frey

speaker="andrew_l_frey" startTime="647.270" stopTime="691.801">
    Mr. Andrew L. Frey 
    I am telling you what occurred. 
    The agent had no idea at that point whether she was getting off at Detroit or making a connection some place else. 
    So as he described it in his testimony initially, he followed her down to the baggage area she didn't picked up any baggage. 
    It would have been suspicious if she have been getting off at Detroit. 
    She then went back up-stairs to the Eastern Airlines counter and appeared to the agent, asked the ticket agent at the Eastern counter for a ticket on an Eastern flight to Pittsburgh. 
    It appeared to the agent that she was changing her flight from some other carrier to Eastern.

    Mr. Andrew L. Frey 
    The record does not clearly show what carrier.

    Mr. Andrew L. Frey 
    Well, you say that and I accept that as true, but I'm not sure what the significance of that is in terms of -- the question is not whether the agent was right that she had originally been booked on American Airlines to Pittsburgh. 
    We simply don't know --
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="738.976" stopTime="742.344">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well, there was an agent at that airport, wasn't he?
speaker="andrew_l_frey" startTime="742.344" stopTime="744.258">
    Mr. Andrew L. Frey 
    That's true, but one would presume that --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="744.258" stopTime="748.180">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    One would presume that they would know where the various airlines went to.

    Mr. Andrew L. Frey 
    I'm not sure that that is a fair question to presume. 
    I think that is a subject which should have been explored on cross-examination. 
    In any event, there is nothing in the record to suggest whether or not she was changing from some other carrier to Eastern. 
    The testimony is "I stood in line directly behind her, she retrieved an airline ticket from her purse, presented that to the Eastern ticket agent and asked for a ticket, an Eastern ticket to be used on her flight from Detroit to Pittsburgh." 
    Now, I don't think our case is dependent on the ultimate accuracy of this observation.

    And that was the first time there was a direct --
speaker="andrew_l_frey" startTime="810.890" stopTime="811.929">
    Mr. Andrew L. Frey 
    That was the first contact --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="811.929" stopTime="812.952">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    -- communication with her?
speaker="andrew_l_frey" startTime="812.952" stopTime="815.667">
    Mr. Andrew L. Frey 
    That's correct.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="815.667" stopTime="818.364">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    As she was going down toward the gate --

    Mr. Andrew L. Frey 
    Down the concourse.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="819.313" stopTime="821.688">

    -- toward the Eastern gate to Pittsburgh?
speaker="andrew_l_frey" startTime="821.688" stopTime="871.166">
    Mr. Andrew L. Frey 
    That's correct. 
    In any event, in terms of my statement of the issues that are presented before I get into the discussion of the issues, the second issue is the validity of the transfer of the situs of the interviewer encounter from the airport concourse to the DEA terminal office. 
    And as I suggested, we have two arguments there. 
    One, that it was supported by her voluntary consent and the second, that it was in any event a reasonable limited extension of a Terry stop. 
    By the way, at the point they went to the airport office, there is no question, I don't think it is disputed, that they had at least Terry-type reasonable suspicion because they then --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="871.166" stopTime="874.658">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    They had reasonable suspicion that she was armed?
speaker="andrew_l_frey" startTime="874.658" stopTime="874.780">
    Mr. Andrew L. Frey 
    No
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="874.780" stopTime="876.736">

    That is what Terry has to do with.
speaker="andrew_l_frey" startTime="876.736" stopTime="936.730">
    Mr. Andrew L. Frey 
    Well, let us say Prignoni-Ponce reasonable suspicion. 
    Whatever the constitutional -- however high the Court chooses to set the constitutional floor for a stop based on reasonable suspicion, less than probable cause, a seizure of the person, not a frisk but a seizure of the person, a detention, this case satisfied it once the agents talked to her and found out she was traveling under an alias, because we are now close to if not over the line of probable cause, and I'm sure that constitutes suspicion or reasonable suspicion in anybody's book to justify the stop. 
    And I don't understand the Court of Appeals to have said that there was not reasonable suspicion at that point, and I just want to make it clear that when they moved to the office, we have now shifted our debate to whether they needed probable cause to justify that movement, and that is what the Court of Appeals held, that probable cause was necessary to support that.

    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well, what did the Court of Appeals do with Judge DeMascio's finding that before the actual search was made there was probable cause? 
    As I read the Court of Appeals opinion, it did nothing with it.
speaker="andrew_l_frey" startTime="950.194" stopTime="957.382">
    Mr. Andrew L. Frey 
    Well, I think it is plain that they disagreed with it. 
    The opinion is rather succinct and it --

    Mr. Andrew L. Frey 
    Well, perhaps -- and it is difficult to tell, but I think one can only conclude that they did not agree with his finding that there was probable cause and that I think essentially is -- it is not something we have contended here because in our view it is not -- probable cause is not necessary for what occurred.

    Mr. Andrew L. Frey 
    At the time of the search, I think it is quite arguable, because at the time of the search of her person which disclosed the heroin, they not only knew that she had been traveling under one alias coming back from Los Angeles but that she had traveled on yet a different alias and going on yet a different carrier going out from Pittsburgh to Los Angeles which I would suppose is consistent with an evasive pattern that drug couriers --

    Mr. Andrew L. Frey 
    We rely -- we don't ask you to decide whether this was supportable as a probable cause search. 
    We rely on her consent, which the District Court found to be voluntary and which I don't believe the Court of Appeals questioned the voluntariness of. 
    And if she was legally detained at the time she consented, then I think there is no basis for striking down the search. 
    If she was illegally detained, than that raises the issue of whether the taint of the illegal detention was attenuated by --

    He is describing the -- this is at page 18 and 19 of the appendix -- and he says they looked at her license and they had reason to believe that she was Sylvia Mendenhall. 
    And then the question, had she put that identification in her purse and walked away from you, you would have stopped her, wouldn't you, because you wanted to ask her some more questions, and he says yes.

    Mr. Andrew L. Frey 
    Yes, absolutely.

    I missed it.
speaker="andrew_l_frey" startTime="1471.496" stopTime="1602.571">
    Mr. Andrew L. Frey 
    It is quite clear. 
    In fact, he is asked to recite in specific words the words that he used. 
    Now, let me turn briefly to the question of whether what happened here was a seizure. 
    The position of respondent and of the ACLU essentially is that when a police officer approaches someone whom he finds suspicious and asks that person questions, that ought to be presumptively a seizure in the absence of a statement to the individual that they have a right to leave. 
    Now, as Terry makes clear, seizure is an actual restraint upon the individual's freedom to walk away. 
    Accordingly, we agree with Professor LaFave's analysis of the problem and we quote from him in our brief, that this kind of encounter is only properly deemed a seizure if the officer is engaged in some additional conduct beyond the approach and the inquiry, whether by action or by statement that would indicate to the individual that his freedom of movement has been curtailed. 
    Now, the Court has not squarely decided this issue, but we do think Terry indicates the Court's view on it, and I refer to Footnote 16 in Terry, where the Court, in talking about whether the initial contact between the officer and Terry at which he walked up to him and asked him for identification was a seizure, saying that it didn't have to, wasn't going to decide that, the Court said obviously not all personal intercourse between policemen and citizens involve seizures of persons, only when the officer by means of physical force or show of authority has in some way restrained the liberty of a citizen may we conclude that a seizure has occurred. 
    We cannot tell with any certainty upon this record whether any such seizure took place here prior to Officer McFadden's initiation of physical contact for the purpose of searching Terry for weapons. 
    Now, of course, if the view of respondent were correct, they could have told perfectly well that there had been a seizure because --
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1602.571" stopTime="1623.295">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Mr. Frey, I take it your basic position is that an officer could just at random pick out somebody in an airport and do exactly -- and the same events that happened here transpired and you would say there was no violation of law.
speaker="andrew_l_frey" startTime="1623.295" stopTime="1629.414">
    Mr. Andrew L. Frey 
    Well, I think that is our position, that there would not be a seizure but I do think --

    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    And no violation of the Fourth Amendment in any of these -- as a result of any of these events --

    Mr. Andrew L. Frey 
    Now, let me just -- I just want to emphasize again Martinez-Fuerte because I don't think we made this point quite clear in our brief. 
    But in Martinez-Fuerte what was involved was an initial stop at a check-point followed by a referral to a secondary inspection area based essentially on the officer's suspicion and nothing more than an indication of Mexican ancestry on the part of the passengers of the car. 
    That unquestionably is a seizure of the occupants of the car within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment, and yet the Supreme Court upheld that on the basis of suspicion that they said was not to satisfy the requirements for stopping an automobile in Brignoni-Ponce. 
    Now, in this case what everyone may conclude about the suspicion that existed on the part of the officers, I think there was a great deal more than the suspicion that was considered satisfactory in Martinez-Fuerte. 
    I would like to reserve the balance of my time. 
    Thank you. 
   
   
   
   Argument of F. Randall Karfonta
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1774.963" stopTime="1777.326">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Mr. Karfonta.
speaker="f_randall_karfonta" startTime="1777.326" stopTime="2002.622">
    Mr. F. Randall Karfonta 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court. 
    I am Randall Karfonta, representing Sylvia Mendenhall in this case. 
    Initially, I would briefly like to clarify some of the facts on this record. 
    First of all, the agents were looking for basically any citizen to stop. 
    There was no information that any specific heroin was coming to Detroit, nor were they looking for any specific individual. 
    As far as the lack of baggage factor goes, a close reading of the record will show that at the hearing the agent didn't contend that this was of continuing significance; rather, the government has continued to argue it in their briefs. 
    As far as the detention in the office, the record contains no written or oral consent. 
    It is absolutely barren of any consent to going to that office. 
    Once Sylvia Mendenhall was in that office, she was asked to take a seat and then for the first time the matter of a search was raised. The matter of a strip search was first raised after the consent was allegedly given, and at that point Sylvia Mendenhall said I have to catch my plane, I've got got to leave, and she was told that she would be free to leave if she had nothing on her. 
    She kept repeating that and, as the testimony states, then began taking her clothes off, taking her time. 
    As to the matter of time that was raised during the prosecutor's argument, the time as is reflected on the record was five to six minutes until the consent to search was given, but the record does not reflect how long it took to call the female officer for the female officer to come to the office and for the actual search itself to begin. 
    Our first contention is that the defendant was arrested within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment when she was in that private locked DEA office for the purpose of a search of her body. 
    The entire transaction, the design and execution was for an investigatory seizure to search Sylvia Mendenhall. 
    A reasonable person in those circumstances could only believe that they were under arrest. 
    She was not told she was free to leave. 
    She was not asked when her plane was leaving, and the setting of the office itself makes that clear. 
    The facts in this case are nothing like any of the stop facts this Court has discussed. 
    I believe as far as this Court has gone was in United States v. Brignoni-Ponce, and in that case we are talking about searches that were usually -- or stops, rather, that were usually a minute in duration and involved a visual inspection. 
    There were no exigencies present in this case. 
    Rather, the detention in this case is much more and is merely exactly like the detention in Dunaway v. New York, where Dunaway was transported to a police station, placed in an interrogation room and was not informed that he was free to leave. 
    The only difference here was that Sylvia Mendenhall was also being held in communicado. 
    We have examined the case law of this Court and we have found three criteria for determining the point of arrest -- freedom of movement, the purpose of the detention, and the duration of the detention.

    The government has referred to Mr. LaFave's treatise and I know that in his treatise he makes the differentiation between an adversarial contact, which is how I would characterize this case, and seeking information from citizens in general regarding community matters.

    I think the argument I am trying to make is that here the testimony was that the point this consent, this alleged consent to the detention was given, Sylvia Mendenhall was so nervous she was unable to speak, barely able to put her license in her purse, back in her purse, and I think that Schneckloth says that the subjective state of mind of an individual is very important in determining the consent,

    Probably arrested then.
speaker="f_randall_karfonta" startTime="2306.231" stopTime="2444.719">
    Mr. F. Randall Karfonta 
    As I was first discussing, in Dunaway v. New York the Court held that freedom of movement is a controlling factor in determining the point of arrest. 
    Here I believe the objective circumstances, the fact that Sylvia Mendenhall was not told she was free to go, and the fact that in fact she was not free to go indicate satisfaction of that factor. 
    Secondly, we look to the purpose of the detention. 
    Here the purpose of the detention was not to maintain the status quo, it was not for identification purposes. 
    The officer testified that on the concourse he was satisfied that this person was Sylvia Mendenhall. 
    Rather, the only purpose in going to that office was to search for narcotics, and Sbron v. New York and Ybarra v. Illinois indicate that when the purpose is to search for narcotics that probable cause is required because that situation is an arrest. 
    Finally, the length of the detention, United States v. Brignoni-Ponce says detention must be brief. 
    In that case, the detentions were ordinarily about a minute. 
    Here, Sylvia Mendenhall was not told she was free to leave. 
    In their Court of Appeals pleadings, the government has indicated that if a person refuses consent in the DEA office, DEA then seeks a search warrant. 
    In the companion case, in an en banc hearing in this case, the officer testified "well, then we told Mr. Camacho that it would take us an hour or three or four hours to obtain this search warrant." 
    No time was ever specified in this case. 
    It was a potentially indefinite detention. 
    I think the law of this Court is clear, that once Sylvia Mendenhall was in that interrogation office, the situation was an arrest; and, further, I think common sense indicates that this is an arrest situation. 
    There was no consent to that detention. 
    As I have indicated, the record is barren of any verbal or written consent to that detention. 
    Sylvia Mendenhall was not told she had any choice about going to that office.

    No, you're not. 
    What I would indicate though is that this record is totally barren of anything indicating consent to the detention, therefore the finding of the District Court is easily clearly erroneous, there is nothing on this record indicating that. 
    Further, the burden is on the prosecution, there is no reason to think that she would have chosen this in communicado detention, she was extremely nervous, facts ate all these facts militate a free and voluntary consent. 
    But most importantly, there is nothing on this record stating any consent to a detention.

    I thing that is the entire part of the defense's contention in this case, is on the kinds of factors, this person was stopped and then arrested, it could apply to the search of anyone anywhere on just basically nothing. 
    I think that is the point, that the Fourth Amendment doesn't allow these kinds of wholesale intrusions.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="2647.858" stopTime="2655.525">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger

    Mr. F. Randall Karfonta 
    I definitely do.

speaker="f_randall_karfonta" startTime="2660.153" stopTime="2711.714">
    Mr. F. Randall Karfonta 
    I believe what the Court of Appeals said was that there was no consent to the search in this case within the meaning of United States v. McCaleb. 
    Just one more point on the consent to the detention, and that is that Bumper v. North Carolina also makes it very clear that mere acquiescence in the face of authority is not the kind of free and voluntary consent that is required. 
    Secondly, we contend that there was no reasonable suspicion for the stop when all the agents knew that the point of the stop was that Sylvia Mendenhall had flown from Los Angeles to Detroit, was the last person off the airplane and noticed the agents. 
    Now, the government has argued --
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="2711.714" stopTime="2715.518">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    And was traveling under an assumed name.
speaker="f_randall_karfonta" startTime="2715.518" stopTime="2827.100">
    Mr. F. Randall Karfonta 
    I was speaking of the point of the initial search, Your Honor. 
    The government has additionally argued two factors, transfer of airline plans and lack of baggage. 
    Those both are facts that evaporated prior to the stop in this case. 
    Great emphasis has been placed in these cases, these airport profile cases on the experience of the agents, but I think that in order to -- that experience is a two-way street, that when the agents see something that negates suspicion, that should stop them from detaining a citizen. 
    Here the agents proceeded proceeded to detain the citizen even though there was no transfer of airlines factor in this case. 
    The government has argued that these experienced agents are familiar with all the airline schedules. 
    Well, in this case the agent testified on the record that he was not familiar with the relevant airline schedules. 
    Further, there is no showing on this record that would support his conclusion that she was changing airlines. 
    This experienced agent should have known that when she went to that Eastern counter and they said all you need to get on that plane is a boarding pass, that she was already scheduled on that flight. 
    Further, had he known the airline's schedule or taken a moment to check it, he would have found that there was no American flight from Detroit to Pittsburgh. 
    This transferred airlines factor has appeared in no other case. 
    In fact, in other arrests in reported opinions that occurred at Detroit Metropolitan Airport, using direct flights was the factor in those cases. 
    Second --
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2827.100" stopTime="2859.827">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    What if in this case she had been booked from Los Angeles to Minneapolis, she immediately arrives in Minneapolis, goes to the counter of an airline that has a flight from Minneapolis to New York and switches her ticket or perhaps buys a ticket from Minneapolis to New York, and the agent says that's unusual because you could have easily booked directly out of Los Angeles to New York without going to Minneapolis. 
    Is that a permissible profile factor to consider?
speaker="f_randall_karfonta" startTime="2859.827" stopTime="2880.035">
    Mr. F. Randall Karfonta 
    Well, Judge, Your Honor, I believe that you have to consider everything that the agent actually knew and in our brief we contend that the profile itself does not arise reasonable suspicion and none of the Courts of Appeals have held it has.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2880.035" stopTime="2887.972">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    You think nothing short of probable cause then is sufficient to even warrant further interrogation?
speaker="f_randall_karfonta" startTime="2887.972" stopTime="2904.680">
    Mr. F. Randall Karfonta 
    No, I believe that when there is reasonable suspicion and there are Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals and Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals cases that have found reasonable suspicion, but then a proper stop, an investigatorial stop and reasonable suspicion is proper.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2904.680" stopTime="2918.503">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    But you don't think that any rather strange conduct in airline routing and sudden changes of destinations are permissible factors in a profile?
speaker="f_randall_karfonta" startTime="2918.503" stopTime="2999.428">
    Mr. F. Randall Karfonta 
    Oh, yes. 
    I do because I think that it is common law that such things as flight can be considered in arrest situations, and so I think all factors can be considered. 
    I think that is a very elusive factor, but certainly all factors ought to be considered. 
    As I indicated, the lack of baggage factor also evaporated prior to the stop in this case. 
    The agent didn't even contend that it was of continuing significance to him; rather, the government has continued to argue it. 
    At any rate, once he knew she was going on to Pittsburgh, through common sense or through the airline regulations he should have realized that she would have no baggage with her. 
    Proper police practice in this case I believe would have been to continue the surveillance, as has been done in a number of Second Circuit cases, such as United States v. Cates. 
    They knew she wasn't leaving the airport, they could have called ahead to Pittsburgh if they wanted to watch her and set up a proceeding to detain a citizen. 
    Looking quickly at the factors they did know, the flight from Los Angeles to Detroit, it seems that in these profile cases the government has virtually characterized almost every city as being a source or a place you go through or destination --

    Mr. F. Randall Karfonta 
    That's correct, Your Honor, but I used the example of the United States v. Oates, when they got to Pittsburgh, a bulge mysteriously appeared, that he had talked with a known narcotics dealer, the traveling companion was a known narcotics addict --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3023.282" stopTime="3047.481">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    But in this case you are suggesting, well, it is very easy, the government just could have wired ahead or telephoned ahead to Pittsburgh. 
    But if you are correct, that there is no probable cause, there is no probable cause. 
    If this seizure and search violated the constitutional rights of your client in Detroit, a seizure and search would equally have violated those rights in Pittsburgh, would it not?

    Mr. F. Randall Karfonta

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    You mean, for example, if they got to Pittsburgh they might have telephoned Pittsburgh and said watch this woman when she gets off; if, one, she is last to leave the plane, and, two, she looks nervous, and, three, she doesn't in fact have any luggage to pick up, then stop her and arrest her, something like that?

speaker="f_randall_karfonta" startTime="3139.104" stopTime="3151.780">
    Mr. F. Randall Karfonta 
    The point of my suggestion was that very often in continuing an investigation additional factors do turn up and sometimes they don't, and then you cannot proceed to detain a citizen.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="3151.780" stopTime="3172.353">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Well, you said one of them would be that if on arrival in Pittsburgh she was met by a person known to the Pittsburgh agent as a drug dealer, of course, there you are so far over the line that you are leaving no room for any analysis at all, are you?
speaker="f_randall_karfonta" startTime="3172.353" stopTime="3226.226">
    Mr. F. Randall Karfonta 
    I don't believe that is true. 
    I think that in looking at the case law, the Sixth Circuit and the Second Circuit have both held that mysterious bulges such as in one case, a person was seen walking with an odd gait, with an odd bulge in the crotch are indicating that there was something concealed there, I think those kinds of factors can begin to create reasonable suspicion. 
    I don't think these totally innocuous things, where there is no tie-in with criminal activity, can present justification for stopping a citizen. 
    As to the nervousness factor, it is difficult to hypothesize on a more common characteristic to airline passengers than nervousness.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="3226.226" stopTime="3230.593">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    When they are getting on or when they are getting off?
speaker="f_randall_karfonta" startTime="3230.593" stopTime="3463.824">
    Mr. F. Randall Karfonta 
    As far as I personally, I would say that would be from the time I leave home until the time I arrive at my destination away from the airport. 
    Following the government's case here, I believe it is similar to Brown v. Texas as there is no tie-in with criminal activity. 
    In Spenell v. United States, Mr. Justice White wrote in concurrence, no one would suggest that just anyone getting off the 10:30 train dressed as Draper was, with a brisk walk and carrying a zipper bag, should be arrested for carrying narcotics. 
    I query whether Mr. Justice White would have felt differently had Draper been last off the train. 
    Other circuits have reviewed circumstances very similar to this case. 
    We cited United States v. Ballard, a Fifth Circuit case, in our brief, at pages 37 and 38. 
    And I recently last week sent a recent Second Circuit opinion, United States v. Buena Venture, and they reach the same obvious result, that this is not a sufficient cause for stopping a citizen. 
    The drug courier profile itself is an amorphous unwritten conglomeration of characteristics which the government characterizes as constantly changing. 
    Some courts have commented that the profile seems to change itself with the facts of each case. 
    In fact, if you look at the characteristics we have listed in our footnotes, you would see there would be a rare airline passenger that would not fit several of these characteristics, and this is particularly true given the agent's ability to find satisfaction of a profile factor, regardless of the facts. 
    There is no national profile, there is no Detroit Metropolitan Airport profile, and there is no Agent Anderson profile. 
    The Courts of Appeals have refused to uphold the stops of citizens based on this profile because of the recommendation of the power to do so would allow basic searches of citizens anywhere without cause. 
    I would like -- as far as any discretion reducing aspect of the profile, what the profile really is is a screen for the abuse of government power because the agents pick and choose among the many that it describes. 
    Finally -- I see my time is short -- the consent to the search in this case was not freely and voluntarily given. 
    Schneekloth speaks of a familiar territory case, where it is always very congenial, the defendant was with five or six friends, where the interrogation in a remote station house inapposite. 
    Here that is exactly the setting we have. 
    Sylvia Mendenhall was in that setting, she was quite shaken. 
    She was not told she was free to leave, she was not told she had any choice about the detention. 
    The first time anything about a search was mentioned was when she was inside that room. 
    The first time anything about a strip search was mentioned was after the alleged consent was given, and then she revoked the consent by saying, well, I have a plane to catch and she was told, well, if you don't have anything on you, you don't have anything to worry about. 
    She kept saying, well, I have a plane to catch and she was slow in taking her clothing off. 
    Finally, we would contend that the alleged consent here was also the product of an arrest without probable cause and a stop without reasonable suspicion and that taint was not removed.

    Mr. F. Randall Karfonta 
    We do not. 
    It is clear that for consent the burden is on the prosecution to show that consent was free and voluntary. 
    Like Brown v. Illinois and New York v. Dunaway, here there was a party of purposefulness and an expedition for evidence undertaken in the hope that something would turn up. 
    We contend that the methodology here was to cause -- and this has been characterized by the Eastern District of Michigan Court to cause surprise, fright and confusion. 
    I think the law of this Court is clear on each of these points and, moreover, I think common sense supports our contention, I think the contentions of the government would be basically to do away with the case by case approach in Fourth Amendment cases and this our Constitution does not allow.

    Mr. Karfonta, before you sit down, you take the position that had she refused -- that the record shows that if she had refused to go to the office, that the officers would have required her to do, that they had intended to detain her. 
    Do you have any position on what the record indicates would have happened if after the female officer had come into the room and told her to take her clothes off, that if she had refused to do that, what would have happened?

    You do say that she didn't realize until that happened that she was going to be -- that there was going to be a strip search.

speaker="f_randall_karfonta" startTime="3569.800" stopTime="3606.291">
    Mr. F. Randall Karfonta 
    I believe defense counsel cross-examined both the agent and the female officer as to each point -- was she free to go at the point of the stop, was she free to go at the point of arrest, was she free to go at the point of consent, and at each point the answer was no. 
    I would like to clarify one point of my position that you just mentioned in your question, and that was -- I'm not sure I can remember it, but our position on the consent to the detention is that the record is barren of any consent and therefore the District Court was clearly erroneous.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3606.291" stopTime="3625.329">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well, there is testimony at page 12 of the appendix by the officer that before she went to the office she gave some kind of consent, and I thought it read consent to the search of the purse and the person. 
    Am I wrong on that?

    Mr. F. Randall Karfonta 
    What it says here is, "I asked her to accompany myself and Agent Myhills to our office which was very nearby," but there is no indication that she was told she had any choice. 
    There is no indication of any written or oral consent and the record does show that she was so nervous at that point that she could hardly speak not return her identification to her purse.

    Mr. F. Randall Karfonta 
    The District Court actually -- and I'm glad you give me a chance to clarify this -- I think the District Court was wrong. 
    The District Court said that at the point they first reached the office, there was no probable cause. 
    Where the District Court found probable cause was after they went through her purse. 
    That is where the District Court found probable cause. 
    And although I disagree with that, the District Court specifically said no probable cause when they first got to the office.

   Rebuttal of Andrew L. Frey
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="3838.434" stopTime="3844.547">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Thank you. 
    Do you have anything further, Mr. Frey?
speaker="andrew_l_frey" startTime="3844.547" stopTime="3927.334">
    Mr. Andrew L. Frey 
    Yes, I have a couple of minor points and one I think of fairly major importance that I hope to be able to talk about. 
    The first point is on the question of where she was going, whether she was going on American Airlines. 
    You are being asked to take judicial notice of facts for the first time in the Supreme Court. 
    I think there is a lot of difficulty with doing that in a case where the respondent's own lawyer in the District Court was not aware of this supposedly obvious factor. 
    Indeed, everybody conceded in the District Court that she was changing her flight and the whole case was argued on that basis. 
    There was no exploration on cross-examination, and the Fourth Amendment does not require that he be right in his belief that she was changing flights but only that he have some basis that would add to his suspicion. 
    Now, with regard to Brown v. Texas, it has absolutely no bearing on this case because in Brown v. Texas, Brown was convicted of failing to give his identification after having been lawfully stopped. 
    It would have availed the State of Texas nothing to argue that he was not stopped in that case, since that would have been a confession of error, and the Court makes quite clear in its opinion that since the conviction can be sustained only if he was lawfully stopped, the question is whether the facts known justified a stop. 
    There was no occasion in Brown to discuss whether the initial encounter was a stop.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="3927.334" stopTime="3952.562">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well, Mr. Frey, on your direct argument, your initial argument you weren't talking any position or whether there was or was not probable cause to arrest, I take it then I walk judge the case on the assumption that there never was probable cause to arrest prior to the search?
speaker="andrew_l_frey" startTime="3952.562" stopTime="3966.809">
    Mr. Andrew L. Frey 
    Well, that raises the problem of what we've presented to the Court in our petition for certiorari and and whether you are free -- I mean the District Court did find that there was probable cause to arrest and search --
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="3966.809" stopTime="3970.599">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Do you defend that or not?
speaker="andrew_l_frey" startTime="3970.599" stopTime="3976.313">
    Mr. Andrew L. Frey 
    We haven't asked for review on that ground, but I would defend that. 
    I think --
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="3976.313" stopTime="3979.625">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well, the Court of Appeals thought there wasn't probable cause.
speaker="andrew_l_frey" startTime="3979.625" stopTime="3981.886">
    Mr. Andrew L. Frey 
    I understand that.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3981.886" stopTime="3990.025">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    So we judge the case on the assumption that the officers never validly acquired probable cause to arrest?
speaker="andrew_l_frey" startTime="3990.025" stopTime="4066.261">
    Mr. Andrew L. Frey 
    I think you would certainly be well within propriety to do so since we didn't challenge that conclusion of the District Court. 
    Now, let me get to the critical point in this case which is the question of whether there was a flimsy basis for the stop, assuming that the Court determines that this was a Fourth Amendment seizure of her person. 
    There is a wide gulf between the respondent's position and ours, and I think respondent's position is that you must have virtually probable cause in order to have a stop on founded suspicion, and his reference to Draper was extremely revealing because, of course, the question in Draper was probable cause and not founded suspicion. 
    Now, in the present case Agent Anderson had ten years of experience in drug enforcement and was many months stationed at the Detroit airport. 
    Now, during this period he received specialized training and he watched tens of thousands, probably hundreds of thousands of passengers and participated in a substantial number of drug arrests. 
    Now, when he saw respondent deplane and scan nervously, as though looking for surveillance, it does not strain credulity to accept that Agent Anderson knew the difference between the nervousness of people who are scared of flying, worried about missing a connection --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="4066.261" stopTime="4070.416">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Can you tell us how often he was wrong?
speaker="andrew_l_frey" startTime="4070.416" stopTime="4072.711">
    Mr. Andrew L. Frey 
    The record does not tell you.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="4072.711" stopTime="4077.686">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    He was right this time, but we don't know whether maybe one out of ten or nine out of ten.
speaker="andrew_l_frey" startTime="4077.686" stopTime="4110.042">
    Mr. Andrew L. Frey 
    But what we are talking about, the record does not indicate, although there is an opinion which does in the Garcia case in the Eastern District of New York which indicates that very few people are stopped. 
    In that particular case, they had watched nine flights come in during the day before they stopped a single -- approached a single person and in that case it was I think quite clearly a stop. 
    We are not talking about picking large numbers of people out. 
    We are not talking about an invidious selection of people for stopping.

    Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. 
    You're not, but if I understood your answer to Mr. Justice White, your position if sustained in this case would allow you to make virtually random stops if you could get the kind of sequence of events you got here.
speaker="andrew_l_frey" startTime="4125.178" stopTime="4135.412">
    Mr. Andrew L. Frey 
    The first position that this is not a seizure within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment would allow a police officer without violating the Fourth Amendment to approach somebody and ask a question, that's correct.

    Mr. Andrew L. Frey 
    You would have to decide it -- you have to decide with respect to the initial encounter in the airport concourse whether (a) it was not a Fourth Amendment seizure or (b) if it was it was lawful, because otherwise what ensued following that encounter was arguably a fruit of the initial illegality. 
    So the consents -- we are only relying on the consent in the sense that her voluntary cooperation at this stage in showing her identification --

    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, perhaps a combination of things.
