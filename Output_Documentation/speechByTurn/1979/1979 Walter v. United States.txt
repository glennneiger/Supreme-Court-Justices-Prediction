Walter v. United States
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="0.000" stopTime="13.673">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    We'll hear arguments first this morning in Walter against the United States and the consolidated case Sanders against the United States. 
    Mr. Zell, you may proceed whenever you're ready.
speaker="glenn_zell" startTime="13.673" stopTime="115.359">
    Mr. Glenn Zell 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    This is certiorari from the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals involving a conviction of two -- the two petitioners and two corporations for distribution of obscene materials in interstate commerce. 
    The issues that I will argue this morning involve search and seizure. 
    To outline the facts very quickly, the FBI was called to L'Eggs Company, it's a stocking manufacturer. 
    They'd received several boxes of films misdirected to them by Greyhound Bus terminal. 
    Upon opening the boxes by the L'Eggs Company, they discovered they were not stockings, but films, 871 and 25 different specific kinds of films. 
    They called the FBI. 
    The FBI came out. 
    Mr. Mandyk I think his name is, told them to hold it for him, came back in five days and seized the entire shipment, took it to the FBI office. 
    Thereafter, two months later, he viewed them in the office. 
    Approximately two years from the initial seizure, the petitioners went to trial. 
    No notification either by publication or directly, was given the petitioners, no warrant was ever gotten. 
    And of course, during the trial, the District Court overruled the motion to suppress based on several grounds. 
    The conviction -- the jury found the films obscene, found that petitioner is guilty, appealed to the Fifth Circuit. 
    There was a strong dissent by Judge Wisdom, which laid out our issues very clearly and succinctly and thereafter, we filed a certiorari to this Court.

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    When did the -- did your clients first to learn what the FBI had taken possession of the films?
speaker="glenn_zell" startTime="122.464" stopTime="154.049">
    Mr. Glenn Zell 
    Well, Your Honor, in the transcript, it appears that there was some information conveyed by one of the employees, Mr. Grassi to Mr. Sanders about a month or several days or several weeks after the initial seizure or after the FBI seized them. 
    Just in hearsay, and he said they heard or that was turned over to the FBI, but they weren't sure, there's no date in the record, and it was not verified or didn't know where to go, what to do and he turned over to his lawyer, which, of course, was me, at that time.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="154.049" stopTime="157.998">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Did your client ask for the return of the films?
speaker="glenn_zell" startTime="157.998" stopTime="177.393">
    Mr. Glenn Zell 
    No, he did not. 
    We didn't know where they were. 
    Mr. -- Mr. Walter testified, he didn't know where they were himself, he wasn't sure, he was never directly told. 
    (Inaudible) was just told in hearsay that the FBI might have had them. 
    He -- we never heard anything from the FBI until, of course, the indictment. 
    When the grand jury met, we were notified, and at that time, of course, we filled a motion to return the property.
speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="177.393" stopTime="184.681">
    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    I think that there is no issue as to the obscenity -- the obscene character of some of the films.
speaker="glenn_zell" startTime="184.681" stopTime="211.844">
    Mr. Glenn Zell 
    Well, I can see it as a -- a trial attorney that it's a factual disposition to the jury. 
    We litigated the case. 
    We presented several expert witnesses, and the jury after being out over a day, found against us on that issue apparently. 
    So, we did not raise the issue of obscenity in this case, not that we concede or agree with the jury verdict, but we argued it, we fought it, it was a factual determination, and I think that's -- that -- that rest that issue, I think, in this particular case, as far as it goes.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="211.844" stopTime="228.010">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Your client's shipment was -- was (Inaudible) type of thing. 
    Wasn't either a -- not the client's real name as sender and not the -- the consignee was not a real person?
speaker="glenn_zell" startTime="228.010" stopTime="302.511">
    Mr. Glenn Zell 
    That's correct. 
    On the box it said, “We'll call.” 
    And there was a clear -- and they hold it at the Greyhound terminal. 
    The reason for this is not that they were giving up their right of privacy as the Fifth Circuit alleged or argued, and the District Court found was that they -- in the testimony in the record from Walters and Sanders, that they had repeated shipments being stolen and missing. 
    Apparently, whenever a -- the Greyhound Bus terminal men sees the name of the sender or gets used to it, where it's going at a certain terminal warehouse, apparently, he's broken into and the -- and the shipment is taken or parts are taken out of it. 
    It might point out in U.S. versus Kelly, it was the same problem. 
    I think his last seven shipments had been missing or misdirected. 
    Apparently, the workers-employees at these common carriers get used to what the shipments are about, and I guess it's -- they've decided just pilfer for them. 
    So because of that problem, we didn't put the name of the sender or the -- who would pick it up the name because we felt the employees would find out about at the common carrier. 
    And that's been done as -- on a regular basis. 
    It had been done before with no problem. 
    Many people travel. 
    Movie stars under assumed names, not that they give it the right of privacy, because they want privacy. 
    And that's the reason why it was done.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="302.511" stopTime="307.740">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well, not many travel under the name L'Eggs.

    Mr. Glenn Zell 
    No. 
    No, that happened to be the nickname of the girl who was the manager of the warehouse in Atlanta where the shipment was destined for. 
    She's very tall girl, and that's where the nickname came from. 
    [Laughter]
speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="320.047" stopTime="324.323">
    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    You -- you used the -- the word "seized" several times --

    Mr. Glenn Zell 
    Yes.

    Mr. Glenn Zell 
    Yes.
speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="328.779" stopTime="337.979">
    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    Do I correctly have the impression that the outfit to whom -- the hosiery manufacturer to whom the delivery was made and they want her to get rid of the stuff?
speaker="glenn_zell" startTime="337.979" stopTime="339.062">
    Mr. Glenn Zell 
    That's correct.
speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="339.062" stopTime="342.887">
    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    And you equate that with the seizure by the FBI?
speaker="glenn_zell" startTime="342.887" stopTime="410.246">
    Mr. Glenn Zell 
    For this reason. 
    Apparently, the Fifth Circuit and this Court ruled in the Burdeau case versus McDowell about a third party. 
    That's true in contraband cases, involving marijuana, sawed-off shotguns. 
    But here, you have presumptively protected materials, reels of film that never been termed to be obscene. 
    They're perfectly legal at that point. 
    Now, the L'Eggs Company decides that they're not in that business, it's not theirs. 
    They don't have authority to consent to give it anyone. 
    They should return to the common carrier, they're perfectly legal materials, they're not contraband, because third party consent equates with plain view. 
    It's contraband, you see it and you take it, whether it be drugs or stolen goods or sawed-off shotgun, but here you have films. 
    So, the FBI had no right to take it, in order to seize it. 
    They would steal the property of the sender. 
    And all they could have done and should have done was when they saw the films and looked at the boxes, is they went to a magistrate to get a warrant to seize these films.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="410.246" stopTime="416.616">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Now, when do you say they were the property of the sender, why not the property of the consignee the recipient?
speaker="glenn_zell" startTime="416.616" stopTime="416.799">
    Mr. Glenn Zell 
    That's correct.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="416.799" stopTime="418.150">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    (Voice Overlap) well --
speaker="glenn_zell" startTime="418.150" stopTime="446.380">
    Mr. Glenn Zell 
    I would agree with that also. 
    Either way, they certainly weren't the property of L'Eggs Company and L'Eggs Company didn't even have the authority to give it to the FBI. 
    That was perfectly legal property such as other magazines, National Geographic or Carnal Knowledge, print of Carnal Knowledge. 
    It was held a -- a case litigated in this Court Jenkins versus Georgia. 
    As far as the FBI was concerned, those were legal materials and then they took them. 
    That was, in our opinion, we argue a seizure.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="446.380" stopTime="454.425">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well, what if they had been simply stolen by a thief in transit they certainly wouldn't have been the property of the thief even arguably.
speaker="glenn_zell" startTime="454.425" stopTime="455.657">
    Mr. Glenn Zell 
    That's correct.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="455.657" stopTime="465.693">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    And what if the thief had voluntary given them to the FBI? 
    Would you have a Fourth Amendment violation? 
    You'd have a larceny, but would you've had a constitutional violation?
speaker="glenn_zell" startTime="465.693" stopTime="469.866">
    Mr. Glenn Zell 
    Probably not because you don't have the First Amendment issue involved, which is --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="469.866" stopTime="472.000">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Just as much as you do here.
speaker="glenn_zell" startTime="472.000" stopTime="476.908">
    Mr. Glenn Zell 
    Well, the -- the goods are -- are stolen. 
    They're not presumptively protected. 
    They're not stolen as --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="476.908" stopTime="479.995">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well, the goods are presumptively protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendment.
speaker="glenn_zell" startTime="479.995" stopTime="481.454">
    Mr. Glenn Zell 
    Yes, these films are.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="481.454" stopTime="489.975">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Yes. 
    And that's true whether it's a thief who takes them or whether it was the L'Eggs, L-'-E-G-S -- E-G-G-S, that pronounced as L'Eggs, the stocking company.
speaker="glenn_zell" startTime="489.975" stopTime="515.883">
    Mr. Glenn Zell 
    That's correct. 
    And well, I would still argue that -- that they had nowhere to keep them, the FBI. 
    They either should've published by publication or attempting to notify the sender or the shipper. 
    They would turn it to the common carrier and easily found out because people -- the record shows people came by and asked for it. 
    Where was it? Can we pick it up? 
    And you've got 871 films and the FBI just sitting on them, involving 25 different prints. 
    As a matter of fact in the indictment, they only indicted on five films.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="515.883" stopTime="545.350">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Let me change slightly Mr. Justice Stewart's hypothetical theory. 
    Suppose they had been pilfered, as he suggested, by thieves in transit and then rather than having the thieves turn -- them over to the FBI, the thieves catch the -- the FBI catch these thieves for some other matter and find them in possession of this material. 
    Do you say that's a seizure by the FBI?
speaker="glenn_zell" startTime="545.350" stopTime="572.492">
    Mr. Glenn Zell 
    No, because -- well as a third party, I wouldn't consider that it's seizure under those facts. 
    But under the facts, we have presumptively protected materials and you have strict procedure requirements under Heller and Roaden, that would become a seizure. 
    The First Amendment is a fundamental amendment and to allow the FBI to sit on such a massive amount of material without going to a magistrate, I think, is a danger in a free society.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="572.492" stopTime="580.587">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Would your position be different if the FBI had to kept the 25 samples or the five and turn all the others over to your client?
speaker="glenn_zell" startTime="580.587" stopTime="585.968">
    Mr. Glenn Zell 
    Yes, I think the -- I think the procedural sequence requires that. 
    They don't need 871 films --
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="585.968" stopTime="585.993">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Well --
speaker="glenn_zell" startTime="585.993" stopTime="586.978">
    Mr. Glenn Zell 
    -- and 20 different kinds.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="586.978" stopTime="589.188">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    You -- you say then you wouldn't be here?
speaker="glenn_zell" startTime="589.188" stopTime="648.810">
    Mr. Glenn Zell 
    Well, if they had been properly notified, went to a magistrate to determine they're obscene so they could keep them, if they had then returned the films they didn't need and kept the only ones that they felt were obscene, of course that that's what I think as I understand it, your procedural safeguards the you've set on your opinions require -- in the Sherwin case for example, we -- that the Fifth Circuit cites the majority opinion. 
    There, the agents saw two magazines. 
    They didn't take the shipment or -- they took it to there office, they immediately went and got a warrant, there was very limited if any, prior restraint. 
    They came back with a warrant. 
    Now, in Kelly, they held it was this seizure from the common carrier, because there was a -- it was a seizure, it was First Amendment protecting materials and there was no procedural safeguards involved. 
    I think you read the First and the Fourth together. 
    I think it's a dangerous thing to allow this to happen. 
    And -- and as I point out in the indictment, there was only five films alleged to be obscene, 20 were not even alleged to be obscene.

    Mr. Glenn Zell 
    I know about pretty good idea. 
    We -- we did know where. 
    We thought they have been stolen first or at least my clients did, because they were used to pilferage.

    Mr. Glenn Zell 
    No. 
    To answer your question, no, they did not after or about a month or two they'd -- they thought it would turn out that some litigation or -- or it was just lost. 
    Usually, the clients take a negative act because of so much stealing and why use these fictitious names is that it's been -- it's been stolen. 
    That was their general attitude. 
    It happens so often before. 
    We just taken and get used to that occurrence as in Kelly where they point out seven of L'Eggs shipments have been stolen. 
    They just assume that it was stolen. 
    Didn't take it seriously, of whatever reason, of course, I don't know what's in their minds, but we thought they were just gone.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="728.063" stopTime="744.367">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    You made a point of distinction between films and firearms sawed-off shotguns. 
    Could many people think the Constitution, there was a presumptive constitutional protection to bare arms was this not -- not so?
speaker="glenn_zell" startTime="744.367" stopTime="767.018">
    Mr. Glenn Zell 
    That's frivolous. 
    That argument -- I think this Court has already decided that -- about protecting at the militia, that I think they've decided on the case, I think it was Miller versus United States. 
    You've already allowed gun laws and statutes to regulate different type of weapon so I find that argument, this was analogous and also it's been decided by this Court very clearly that the -- arms can be regulated by the State and federal governments.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="767.018" stopTime="772.745">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    In other words in each case, it's -- it's a presumptive protection with one little presumption that can be overcome.
speaker="glenn_zell" startTime="772.745" stopTime="780.763">
    Mr. Glenn Zell 
    Yes, in particularly where you have the First Amendment in expressing materials, in particular whether it entirely suppressed completely.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="780.763" stopTime="784.111">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    You -- you make that higher than the right to bare arms?
speaker="glenn_zell" startTime="784.111" stopTime="873.405">
    Mr. Glenn Zell 
    Well it's the First Amendment. 
    But no, I think -- I think in a free society, ideas, communication is fundamental -- so fundamental. 
    And the right to bare arms involves I think, a militia and I don't -- I -- I feel it's a -- the Government has the right to regulate weapons, I don't think there's any doubt it, these courts decided. 
    Not only in this -- in this Court, but in the State of Georgia decided in the Supreme Court of Georgia, so there's no problem with that. 
    Then -- then they view the films two months later. 
    There's no continuing search why did they get a warrant at that time? 
    Two months later, they've looked at the covers all can see for argument purposes, they have probable cause. 
    Why did they get a search warrant then? 
    It's like the case of Michigan versus Tyler, the fire case. 
    That police run the property, then later on, they came and they said let's go back again and search it. 
    This Court held a separate search. 
    So even if you assume it was not a seizure going a month or two months later, would have probable cause to get a warrant, they don't do it. 
    That is certainly a search of the films and they didn't do it. 
    There were no exigent circumstances. 
    Clearly as in the Haes case we cite in our brief, I think it was in the Eighth Circuit. 
    They held to view the films was a search and clearly the FBI could have got a warrant at that point. 
    And then we, of course, analogize this to the Arkansas versus Sanders and Chadwick versus United States. 
    Luggage, boxes, compartments, here was a compartment, 871 of them. 
    There's probable cause that they may be obscene. 
    Why would they require a warrant as you did on Chadwick and Sanders?

   Argument of W. Michael Mayock
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1014.893" stopTime="1018.382">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Mr. Mayock.
speaker="w_michael_mayock" startTime="1018.382" stopTime="1136.052">
    Mr. W. Michael Mayock 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    What I would like to do at this time is to address a couple of points which I believe should be brought to the Court's attention involving what I ascertain to be mistake -- misstatements of fact contained the Government's brief. 
    And one in particular, I think, is incredibly significant down on page 37 and -- and thereafter, wherein is -- it is indicated that the petitioners in this case had decided to return the films to a warehouse for storage. 
    In fact there is nothing in the record to indicate that the purpose of the shipment to Atlanta was for a storage. 
    It could well have been that the purpose of that transportation was in fact, to sell these particular films in Atlanta which as I understand, has the highest per capita homosexual population outside of San Francisco. 
    There are two other points that I like to bring to the Court's attention. 
    They relate to the film -- films themselves which are 8-millimeter film that are so small, they can -- they cannot be viewed by the naked eye. 
    There is apparent representation to the effect that people at L'Eggs Products Inc. have already ascertained what it was that was on these films when in fact, all they had ascertained was the nature of the box cover which contained a depiction in cartoon fashion of two nude males from the waist up, embracing and -- and kissing and a description purporting to represent, but not necessarily representing what it was that was contained in the films. 
    Obviously, the FBI did not believe that this was necessarily what was contained in the films because that was the very reason they screened them was to find out what it was that was contained on these films.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1136.052" stopTime="1141.908">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Was the description prepared by your clients that kind of cover for the films?
speaker="w_michael_mayock" startTime="1141.908" stopTime="1443.269">
    Mr. W. Michael Mayock 
    As it turned out, Your Honor, the -- the films as -- were pretty much as described in the blurb contained on the box covers. 
    The box covers incidentally were not charged as being obscene. 
    Only the films themselves which were later screened about two months subsequent to the time that they were initially taken by the FBI. 
    What I would like to do is to address rather briefly several points which I feel are significant, which have not been addressed at this point by Mr. Zell. 
    First of all, I would direct the Court's attention to the scienter issue. 
    Now, there was clearly ample proof provided that my client, Mr. Walter, was engaged in a business which dealt in sexually explicit material. 
    However, I would suggest to this Court that in accordance with the dictates of Hamlin and Smith, that there has to be some proof of knowledge showing that in fact, he had information of the nature, character and content of the particular films. 
    That he knew they were being shipped interstate and that he knew that a common carrier was being used for that purpose. 
    There is nothing other than a silent record to indicate that Mr. Walter was involved in this operation from a point in time, two months prior to this shipment, to a time, two months subsequent to it. 
    The Government has argued that there was evidence showing that he participated directly in the day to day affairs of this particular business. 
    However, there is no evidence showing that any of these other shipments purportedly made interstate involved obscene material. 
    And as this Court well knows Roaden versus Kentucky requires the presumption to be made that material not adjudicated to be obscene is to be presumed not obscene. 
    Hence, the only material properly brought before the Court and the jury in this case involved the films in question. 
    And as far as those films were concerned, there's nothing given any sort of nexus to Mr. Walter and those particular films as far as the element of scienter is required. 
    Turning to the point raised in the brief, in connection with the requirement that the Court instruct in accordance with the dictates of the Pinkus case that, “person” is to mean adult. 
    It need be pointed out that on at least five separate proposed jury instructions, the defendant sought to have that sort of definition be made known. 
    I think that it's clear to anyone who understands the English language that the word, “person” subsumes the class, “children” and accordingly, the instructions given by the Court were fatally defective for the reasons earlier enunciated in Pinkus. 
    And the only thing that we can do and this is what the Government would have us do, is to assume that obviously this jury forgot about children, because of the instructions given and only applied the attributes of the average person. 
    However, an average person includes people of all ages, hence that particular argument is not effective and moreover, to assume that the jury did not follow the directions of the Court and use the standard of the average person, would be to do an injustice to the jury and it's understanding of the Law as given it by the Court. 
    And moreover, since the jury verdict was a general one, there's no way that we can know that in fact that jury did not do exactly what was forbidden by Pinkus -- that being to include children within the community. 
    While we're talking about jurors, very briefly I would point out that insofar as one of the jurors was involved in this case there is testimony. 
    In fact, the record by the trial judge indicates that one of the jurors had to be directed to put away a book or magazine on the only occasion on which he viewed the film. 
    Subsequently, the jury did not see the film again in the jury room. 
    The trial judge observed that sufficient attention had been paid by this particular juror in that he observed that juror watching the film on 7 of 10 occasions. 
    There were proffers of proof made that members of the press in attendance of this trial would've observed that this particular juror did not watch the film for substantial periods of time.

    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Do you think it would be a ground for a reversal in this Court if there were a proffer of evidence that a juror had dozed off during the testimony of the witness in an -- the -- the case of perfectly orthodox tour or contract case?
speaker="w_michael_mayock" startTime="1461.134" stopTime="1492.402">
    Mr. W. Michael Mayock 
    I think if a sufficient record establishing that fact is made that that may well be the case. 
    But where we have an observation by the district judge saying that on 7 out of 10 times he watched -- in other words 70% of the time he was watching the film which the dictates of Miller versus California require that the work be, “Taken as a whole.”

    Mr. W. Michael Mayock 
    Well, Your Honor, I understand that's what we tried to do when we select a jury. 
    In fact one of the proffered voir dire questions to this panel was whether they could view this film with an open mind and open eyes. 
    And that proffered voir dire questions was not asked of the prospective panel and in fact it turned out to be very critical because this juror obviously chose not to view substantial parts of the film.

   Argument of Elliott Schulder
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1605.373" stopTime="1613.355">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Very well, Mr. Mayock. 
    Mr. Schulder.
speaker="elliott_schulder" startTime="1613.355" stopTime="1690.433">
    Mr. Elliott Schulder 
    Thank you. 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    I'd like first to respond to some of the factual questions from the bench and some of the statements by counsel concerning the facts of this case. 
    First of all, Chief Justice Burger asked when petitioners actually discovered that the FBI had the films. 
    On pages 8 and 9 of our brief, we refer to the record wherein we state that about two to three weeks after the transfer of the films from L'Eggs Hosiery Company to the FBI, codefendant Grassi -- Michael Grassi called the L'Eggs Company and discovered that the films had been transferred to FBI. 
    The record also shows that Grassi then informed petitioners, Walter and Sanders that the films were in the FBI's possession. 
    Furthermore, I believe petitioner Sanders testified or there was a testimony to the effect that petitioner Sanders informed the -- his employees to destroy any bills of lading or other documents that would connect him or the corporations to these films. 
    In response to Mr. Justice Powell's question --
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1690.433" stopTime="1697.089">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Do you -- do you suggest that there was some kind of a constructive abandonment --
speaker="elliott_schulder" startTime="1697.089" stopTime="1697.099">
    Mr. Elliott Schulder 
    Well, that --
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1697.099" stopTime="1698.892">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    -- as -- as on the basis of --
speaker="elliott_schulder" startTime="1698.892" stopTime="1775.900">
    Mr. Elliott Schulder 
    -- part of the Fourth Amendment argument is that petitioners essentially relinquished or abandoned any reasonable expectation of privacy in the shipment of films. 
    But we don't – we don't seek to -- to use their destruction of the bills of lading or other documents to support that because that occurred after the films were transferred to the Government. 
    Mr. Justice Powell asked whether there was any -- any evidence that petitioners made a conscious decision not to demand the films from the FBI. 
    Well, there may not be testimony to that effect, but I believe the record of the suppression hearing indicates that petitioner Sander's attorney, Mr. Zell, candidly explained to the District Court that the reason that petitioner did not come forward to claim the films was that he did not want to identify himself to the Government and connect himself with these films. 
    So that it seems clear that the failure to request an adversary hearing rests entirely on petitioners. 
    They had actual notice that the Government had the films. 
    And yet they didn't come forward and make any request either for return of the property or for an adversary judicial determination of obscenity.

    That's more of a civil law (Voice Overlap) --
speaker="elliott_schulder" startTime="1932.747" stopTime="2134.850">
    Mr. Elliott Schulder 
    That's correct. 
    That's correct, Your Honor. 
    I'd like to turn now to the suppression issue that -- that's been raised. 
    As far as the other issues, we've divided the questions in this case into two general categories for purposes of convenience. 
    The first deals with the question whether petitioners may seek suppression of the films because of alleged violations of the Fourth and First Amendments. 
    And the second category of issues we place within the District Court's conduct of the trial referring to the jury instructions, jury voir dire, the scienter issue. 
    And as to these latter issues we essentially rely on our brief. 
    We begin with the Fourth Amendment claims that were raised by petitioners. 
    They argue that the acquisition of the films from L'Eggs and the subsequent inspection of the films by the Government, violated their rights under the Fourth Amendment and require application of the exclusionary rule in this case. 
    At the outset, we would like to note that only the individual petitioners here Walter and Sanders may properly raise this issue before the Court. 
    As the Court of Appeals noted, the corporate petitioners, that is Trans World America and Gulf Coast News, never moved for suppression of these films from evidence in the District Court. 
    They therefore, waived any right to suppression under Rule 12 of the Rules of Criminal Procedure. 
    And we submit that they're foreclosed from raising the suppression issue here. 
    At least since this Court's decision in Katz versus United States, the touchstone of the Court's analysis in the Fourth Amendment area has been whether an individual's legitimate expectation of privacy has been invaded by an unreasonable governmental intrusion. 
    A recurrent theme of our Fourth Amendment analysis in this case is that petitioners Walter and Sanders did not have an expectation of privacy protected by the Fourth Amendment with respect to the packages of films. 
    What actually occurred here was that petitioners used a common carrier to ship a large quantity of pornographic films across state lines, using fictitious names for both the shipper and the consignee and giving a false address for the shipper and no address for the consignee. 
    Under these circumstances, we submit, petitioners knew or should have known that the shipment might inadvertently come into the possession of an innocent third party. 
    In this case a legitimate business, the L'Eggs Hosiery Company. 
    It was also foreseeable and petitioners assumed the risk that once L'Eggs inspected the contents of the packages, they would contact law enforcement authorities and on its own and on their own initiative, turn the shipment over to the Government for possible prosecution. 
    The fact that petitioners may have retained the property interest in these goods, does not affect the Fourth Amendment analysis in this particular case, because we submit, they had no legitimate expectation with risk of privacy with respect to the films. 
    Now, it may be that if petitioners had chosen to possess these films at home and to view them, they would be protected from --

    Mr. Elliott Schulder 
    If they had them in a commercial establishment for sale, they would know -- there would be no expectation of privacy in the contents of the film as necessarily.

    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Mr. Schulder can I ask you about your -- the argument that there is no expectation of privacy -- as I understand that you make two separate arguments on that point. 
    One it's because of the manner in which the packages were labeled. 
    There was never any expectation.They soon -- they waived their right because it was very probable that some third party will get access to them. 
    Now that's --

    Mr. Elliott Schulder 
    Well, we -- we have no specific authority with respect to precisely this type of situation, but we have analogized in our brief the other --

    Then your second theory which is -- is quite different is that -- that there were sufficient indicia of what the contents were on the outside of the box to -- to give up any expectation of privacy. 
    Now in that theory, I suppose if someone shipped a briefcase in which he said on the outside of it, “Records of transaction in a Swiss bank account between Mr. A and Mr. B” who had previously denied they ever had a Swiss bank account, you could open that without a warrant, because by the outside of it, you know the contents had something illegal in or you'd have probable cause to believe what it got --

    Well, then if you don't have probable cause you couldn't get a warrant so that absolutely removes the -- the requirement of a warrant from every inspecting parcels that come into your possession that you don't expect to get. 
    You'd never need a warrant.On the one hand, if you don't have probable cause, you can't get a warrant.

    Mr. Elliott Schulder 
    Well, our submission is that once the container clearly demonstrates or --
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="2634.789" stopTime="2655.567">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    By “clearly demonstrate,” do you mean that it demonstrates more clearly than just giving probable cause? 
    Clearly, it didn't have proof beyond reasonable doubt or you would never have had to view the films. 
    If you view them, they'll be sure they were what you thought they were and then there would be proof of guilt.

    Mr. Elliott Schulder 
    That's not exactly what we're saying.

    The probable cause here is that in labels on the packages themselves. 
    That's what – what I mean, you know, the cartons and all that -- that is what justifies as I understand your position. 
    You're opening like -- viewing them is just like opening other package I'd suppose. 
    I'm not quite clear. 
    I -- I'm not sure I understand your theory as to what boils down.

    Mr. Elliott Schulder 
    Well, there -- there are two related -- I've strains to what we're saying here. 
    The first is that film cartons generally are not like luggage -- not like a closed foot locker in Chadwick or a suitcase in Sanders. 
    They're not ordinarily repositories for personal effects. 
    And second the exteriors of these particular containers indicated clearly just as if they had been transparent bag showing what was inside, what exactly was contained within the containers.

    It was.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="3465.769" stopTime="3472.123">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Would you say it overstated or understated?
speaker="elliott_schulder" startTime="3472.123" stopTime="3595.433">
    Mr. Elliott Schulder 
    I suppose like anything else -- like the expression, “You can't judge a book by its cover.” 
    I think the film would have to speak for itself as to whether it was an overstatement or understatement. 
    Some may be and some might not be. 
    What I would like to address very briefly is the issue of the implied consent. 
    Suggest that the record bears ample evidence that the petitioners herein exercised every reasonable means to try to retrieve the particular films as soon as they discovered they had been misdirected. 
    First of all as far as their legitimate expectation of privacy in relationship to this, I must say that what we have is this a situation analogous to one sending a letter to oneself in that the same individuals are the consignor and the consignee in this particular situation. 
    That they wrapped the boxes very carefully, that they had made previous shipments using the same name L'Eggs Inc., that they had no reason to expect that a person who one claimed no entitlement to the shipment itself. 
    Second, refused to pay for it and so indicated as the testimony of Mr. Fox from L'Eggs Products, Inc. indicates, moreover, I would suggest that L'Eggs Products indicated that this was a rather unusual shipment. 
    Then we have a five-day hiatus between the Friday when the shipment is misdelivered to the Wednesday when the FBI finally stops by L'Eggs Products and picks them up. 
    During the intervening time, people from the petitioners' offices have gone to the various terminuses of Greyhound both the originating and ending terminus. 
    They have made contact with individuals trying to run down the packages.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="3595.433" stopTime="3606.562">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    They -- they left -- as I understand on the third call, the woman finally left her name, but on no calls, they leave their address where they could be reached.
speaker="elliott_schulder" startTime="3606.562" stopTime="3651.471">
    Mr. Elliott Schulder 
    That I believe, is what the record reflects, Mr. Justice Rehnquist. 
    But I would suggest that there is also evidence on the record indicating that the FBI was the one, in fact, supervising the activity that occurred in that they were telling people such as Mr. Askew at the Greyhound terminals to find out the names and addresses of these people. 
    That they were advising people at L'Eggs Products, Inc. not to tell the defendants in this case that in fact the FBI had acquired possession of the property. 
    And so, in some I think, what we have is a just a situation presenting an earnest, good faith attempt by the petitioners to try --
