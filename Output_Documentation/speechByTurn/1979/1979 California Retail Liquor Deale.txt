    Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. 
    This case comes to us from the California Court of Appeals. 
    California has a resale price maintenance statute for wine. 
    Under this statute a wine producer may set prices through a fair trade contract. 
    If this is not done, wholesalers must post a resale price schedule for that producer's brand. 
    Wine merchants are required to sell to retailers only at prices established in this manner. 
    Respondent charged with violating established prices successfully challenged the California system as violative of the Sherman Act. 
    We granted certiorari. 
    The California statute was defended in this Court on two grounds. 
    First, that its program is immune from federal antirust laws under the state action exception, an exception this Court created in Parker against Brown decided in 1943. 
    Secondly, it was argued that the Twenty-first Amendment that repealed the prohibition amendment authorized the states to regulate traffic in liquor. 
    For reasons stated in the Court's opinion, we reject both of these arguments. 
    Neither the state action doctrine of Parker against Brown nor the Twenty-first Amendment authorizes a state to delegate the private parties the right to fix prices in a manner that would violate federal antitrust laws. 
    We therefore affirmed the judgment of the California Court of Appeals. 
    Mr. Justice Brennan took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.
