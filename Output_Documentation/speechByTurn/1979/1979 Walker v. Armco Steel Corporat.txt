Walker v. Armco Steel Corporation
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="0.000" stopTime="56.895">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    We will hear arguments this afternoon in Fred N. Walker against ARMCO Steel Corporation. 
    Mr. Manners, I think you may proceed now.
speaker="don_manners" startTime="56.895" stopTime="103.309">
    Mr. Don Manners 
    Mr. Chief Justice and Members of This Honorable Court. 
    Fred Walker was a carpenter, and on August 22, 1975, he was driving an ARMCO nail into a piece of wood and it shattered, putting out his eye. 
    He came to my firm and eventually we filed a suit on August 19, 1977, within the two-year statute of limitation in the Federal Court. 
    And the summons were, what shall we say, lost? 
    We thought the marshal had them and the marshal thought the Clerk had them. 
    And we did a file review some 90 days later and we found them in our filing cabinet. 
    We took them down there. 
    I want to be square with you.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="103.309" stopTime="105.111">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    In your filing cabinet?
speaker="don_manners" startTime="105.111" stopTime="153.854">
    Mr. Don Manners 
    Yes, sir. 
    I can't find who -- no one will admit in the firm ever bringing them back but, anyway, we found them in an unmarked folder in the filing cabinet on a file review. 
    That's how we found out they didn't get to the marshal. 
    In any event, the summons are taken to the marshal and ARMCO is served some 104 days later. 
    Now, Oklahoma has a statute that they must be served within 60 days beyond the statute of limitation, part of their statute. 
    It's a question of whether or not it is procedural or substantive, I guess. 
    And, of course, under Rule 3, you don't have that problem. 
    Anyway, service was had and then the Ragan Case came like a falcon out of the skies and struck down our lawsuit, and here we are.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="153.854" stopTime="157.911">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    The Ragan Case was decided somewhat before your lawsuit, wasn't it?
speaker="don_manners" startTime="157.911" stopTime="168.302">
    Mr. Don Manners 
    Yes, sir. 
    The Hanna Case is a group barn burner on our side, but it didn't overrule Ragan.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="168.302" stopTime="173.233">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    There are only nine of us up here too.
speaker="don_manners" startTime="173.233" stopTime="218.954">
    Mr. Don Manners 
    Anyway, Judge Doyle of the Tenth Circuit, when he wrote his opinion, the last paragraph states, "The Supreme Court would perform a great service if it were to clear away the dilemma which exists as a result of the conflict between Ragan and Hanna." 
    He says, "We recognize that decisions are frequently allowed to die on the vine, so to speak. 
    We also recognize under such instances death does not, as a practical matter, take place. 
    If, however, Ragan was intended to die a natural death, it failed to happen." 
    So what we are here -- I am attempting to persuade--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="218.954" stopTime="221.289">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    You come not to praise Ragan, but to bury it, I take it?
speaker="don_manners" startTime="221.289" stopTime="236.123">
    Mr. Don Manners 
    I come to bury Ragan, if possible. 
    Now, Chief Justice Warren in the Hanna Case wrote a spectacular decision, well-reasoned, well thought out. 
    And Justice Harlan in his concurring --
speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="236.123" stopTime="238.103">
    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    And carefully saved Ragan.
speaker="don_manners" startTime="238.103" stopTime="239.903">
    Mr. Don Manners 
    And carefully saved Ragan.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="239.903" stopTime="240.767">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well thought out.
speaker="don_manners" startTime="240.767" stopTime="319.172">
    Mr. Don Manners 
    Well thought out; carefully saved Ragan. 
    But Justice Harlan stated in his concurring opinion that he thought Ragan was wrong. 
    And you know, going back at the beginning, under 28 -- Section 2072, when they enacted the Rules, the Federal Rules, it said, "All laws in conflict with such Rules should be a little further force or effect unless, of course, they invade the substantive portion." 
    So, really what we are talking about is whether or not the Federal Rules of commencement of an action in service are procedural or substantive. 
    You know, I am from Oklahoma and I don't like to say this. 
    Basically speaking, we've got an awful good State there, but I'm not much in favor of a service statute where your defendant can hide out for 61 days and you've lost your case. 
    If you can't find him in 61 days or prove he's out of the State, you're just dead in the water down there. 
    I don't think it was intended that the Federal Rules for the Courts of all the Federal Courts here, I don't think it was intended that the 60-day--
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="319.172" stopTime="328.888">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    I don't see why you put all that weight on distance. 
    I think you have a very hard time trying to find somebody in Manhattan, and that's a lot smaller than Oklahoma City.
speaker="don_manners" startTime="328.888" stopTime="355.145">
    Mr. Don Manners 
    We've got more brush down there in our country for them to hide in. 
    This is not the first time I have run afoul of the 60-day deal. 
    Sometimes you just can't find them, and you're dead. 
    But in this case I feel particularly bad because Mr. Walker had an injury and somehow or other, like something dropping from the skies, I find the summons in the filing cabinet back in the office on a file review.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="355.145" stopTime="362.113">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    You wouldn't be arguing this to any Oklahoma Court, would you, that you didn't like the law the legislature had enacted?
speaker="don_manners" startTime="362.113" stopTime="367.181">
    Mr. Don Manners 
    No, sir, because Oklahoma Courts are not covered by Rule 3.
speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="367.181" stopTime="368.304">
    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    This is a Federal question.
speaker="don_manners" startTime="368.304" stopTime="370.091">
    Mr. Don Manners 
    A Federal question, right.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="370.091" stopTime="373.316">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    What is the principle you want us to adopt?
speaker="don_manners" startTime="373.316" stopTime="377.905">
    Mr. Don Manners 
    I want you to adopt the principles elucidated in Hanna.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="377.905" stopTime="379.323">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    And what are those?
speaker="don_manners" startTime="379.323" stopTime="404.591">
    Mr. Don Manners 
    Those are for uniformity, the Federal Rules should govern service. 
    This case turns on Rule 4 1(d), which is where the statute requires that you thrust it directly in the hand of an executor and they left it with his wife. 
    And the Court held that under the Federal Rules, the Rule having to do with service would apply.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="404.591" stopTime="411.375">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    What if the Federal Rules had no provision which was a counterpart to Oklahoma's provision here?
speaker="don_manners" startTime="411.375" stopTime="416.584">
    Mr. Don Manners 
    What would I do? 
    I would be defending a case of malpractice; that's what I would be doing, probably.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="416.584" stopTime="421.414">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    You say that there must be an affirmative Federal Rule of Civil Procedure covering this point?
speaker="don_manners" startTime="421.414" stopTime="426.124">
    Mr. Don Manners 
    Without Federal Rule 3 and Federal Rule 4, I have no standing.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="426.124" stopTime="432.280">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    You don't urge us to go back to Swift against Tyson, or the days of the Federal common law?
speaker="don_manners" startTime="432.280" stopTime="479.317">
    Mr. Don Manners 
    No, sir. 
    The Federal Rules set up for the maintenance and the handling of Federal cases in this country, I think should be controlling of cases filed in the Federal Courts. 
    Now, I am embarrassed, and I should be that this matter happened at my law firm. 
    But I think under the pure question of law that Fred Walker is entitled to relief. 
    I think that the Federal Rules, Rule 3 should govern what commences an action. 
    The Federal Rule states it very succinctly. 
    It says, it's told when the case is filed, under Federal Rule 3. 
    Now, your Rule 4 --
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="479.317" stopTime="481.978">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Does Federal Rule 3 say "told"?
speaker="don_manners" startTime="481.978" stopTime="513.666">
    Mr. Don Manners 
    Let me get it exactly, Your Honor. 
    Rule 3, "A civil action is commenced by filing a complaint with the Court." 
    That is what it says specifically. 
    Rule 4 puts the burden upon the Clerk. 
    It says, "Upon filing of a complaint, the Clerk shall forthwith issue a summons and deliver it for service to the marshal or persons specially appointed to serve it.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="513.666" stopTime="529.431">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    What is there in the Rule though that says that the beginning of an action is just the filing of the complaint satisfies the State's statute of limitations? 
    I mean, it may start the action, but does it say that?
speaker="don_manners" startTime="529.431" stopTime="533.895">
    Mr. Don Manners 
    It says, "A civil action is commenced by filing a complaint with the Court."
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="533.895" stopTime="553.838">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    I know a civil action is commenced, but what makes -- why is that -- would that necessarily -- what if a State law said just specifically that, and by the way, we mean what we say, just the starting of an action does not satisfy our statute of limitations.
speaker="don_manners" startTime="553.838" stopTime="555.187">
    Mr. Don Manners 
    Your Honor --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="555.187" stopTime="559.783">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    It has to be some other event that happened before the statute of limitations is satisfied.
speaker="don_manners" startTime="559.783" stopTime="580.064">
    Mr. Don Manners 
    Oklahoma State law does provide that an action is commenced by the filing of the petition, but it has an additional statute, two sections down, that says if you can't get service with due diligence within 60 days that you're just through.
speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="580.064" stopTime="589.790">
    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    What is there in Rule 3 to prevent the State from having such a provision? 
    This is a matter of State law, a State statute of limitations law.
speaker="don_manners" startTime="589.790" stopTime="609.225">
    Mr. Don Manners 
    Excuse me, Your Honor. 
    There is nothing to prevent the State from having that law. 
    My position is that under the Federal Rules, Fred Walker is entitled to the Federal Rule law, under Hanna, which goes into Erie. 
    I am sure everybody is familiar -- I think you were on the Court when Hanna was decided.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="609.225" stopTime="612.718">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    I understand. 
    Ragan wasn't overruled.

    Mr. Don Manners 
    No, but a lot of people thought it was. 
    I've got a beautiful Second Circuit opinion here.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="620.088" stopTime="621.173">

    Yes, I know.

    Every citizen --

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    You don't have uniformity under substantive law in diversity cases.
speaker="don_manners" startTime="632.244" stopTime="634.755">
    Mr. Don Manners 
    I don't believe that it's substantive, Your Honor.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="634.755" stopTime="636.493">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    I say you don't under the substantive law.

    No, Sir.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="637.575" stopTime="643.514">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    What you want is the traditional, the Erie rule under substantive law but the Federal law on the procedural.
speaker="don_manners" startTime="643.514" stopTime="644.244">
    Mr. Don Manners 
    That's correct, Your Honor.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="644.244" stopTime="659.863">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    What's the virtue of uniformity, as you put it, on the procedural side when basically you are dealing with practitioners in Oklahoma City or Tulsa who practice in both the Federal and State Courts?
speaker="don_manners" startTime="659.863" stopTime="687.526">
    Mr. Don Manners 
    Well, it would make it a lot easier on the Circuit Courts, for one thing, because they would not have the higgledy-piggledly mess of each State having a different set of semi or quasi substantive or procedural law. 
    Procedural or substantive is a difficult question at best. 
    But, if you file a case in Court, you ought to go by that Court's procedures. 
    What commences an action, how service is made--
speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="687.526" stopTime="713.681">
    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    What if the statute of limitations in Oklahoma said that the statute of limitations will run until a complaint is served? 
    Unless the complaint is served within the period, the case is over. 
    Rule 3 wouldn't prevent that, would it?
speaker="don_manners" startTime="713.681" stopTime="716.556">
    Mr. Don Manners 
    Well, Rule 4 did in the Hanna Case.
speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="716.556" stopTime="720.832">
    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    Why? 
    No, it didn't. 
    That isn't what the Court said there.
speaker="don_manners" startTime="720.832" stopTime="752.395">
    Mr. Don Manners 
    Your Honor, they served the executor by leaving it with his wife. 
    The State statute provides that you had to serve the executor in hand. 
    And they held that the Federal Rules of Service circumvented the State Rule required that the executor be served in hand. 
    There is very little difference between that and the Rule 3, of following the Federal Rules so far as filing the case commencing it and the service being sent out by the Clerk to the marshal and served. 
    Rule 4 gives the Clerk the duty--
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="752.395" stopTime="774.354">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    But Hanna didn't say -- Hanna certainly didn't say that if the State law required service to toll the statute, that just the filing of the complaint will toll the statute too. 
    That isn't what Hanna held. 
    It didn't say that at all. 
    It said -- what you are suggesting to us is that that is what we should hold now.
speaker="don_manners" startTime="774.354" stopTime="783.089">
    Mr. Don Manners 
    No, sir, I am saying if you extend the Hanna rule to cover Rule 3, like the Second Circuit thinks it should be--
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="783.089" stopTime="788.917">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Does the Second Circuit think it should be, or do they think that's what Hanna did?

    Mr. Don Manners 
    They think that Hanna overruled Ragan.

speaker="don_manners" startTime="803.862" stopTime="816.867">
    Mr. Don Manners 
    Well, I guess the virtue would be that under the Federal Rules and under the Federal system to make them the same. 
    Each citizen and each State would have the same rights under the Federal law.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="816.867" stopTime="835.615">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well, that was the same justification that Justice Storey advanced for Swift against Tyson IN 1842, that the law does not lay down one rule in Athens and another rule in Rome; that the law should be uniform throughout the Federal Court System substantively. 
    You don't agree with that, I take it?

    Justice Byron R. White 
    That under Erie Railroad against Tompkins, Federal Courts and diversity actions are required to apply State substantive law. 
    It is equally well-settled that, as a matter of procedure, and everybody agrees that it is a matter of procedure, then there is a uniform Federal law applied in diversity cases, in Federal Courts as well as all other cases in Federal Courts.

    Mr. Don Manners

speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="889.286" stopTime="928.277">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Well, let's assume that Rule 3 does cover when an action is commenced for Federal purposes, and that there is nothing that the State can say that will change that, that if you file the complaint, the action is commenced, the State doesn't argue with you about that. 
    Your opponent doesn't have to worry about that. 
    He will just say, however, that that just isn't enough to start to toll the statute of limitations. 
    The State law says you have to do something else to give you 60 days. 
    They say our statute of limitations runs until you are served a complaint.
speaker="don_manners" startTime="928.277" stopTime="938.456">
    Mr. Don Manners

    Now, how does uniformity advance the idea of getting a neutral forum, one where citizens of another State were at least thought to have a better chance to get fair treatment in a Federal Court than a local court?

speaker="don_manners" startTime="1003.755" stopTime="1020.300">
    Mr. Don Manners 
    It would advance, each person would know from whence they hailed that the same rules applied insofar as procedure in their courthouse in Milwaukee would apply so far as procedures are concerned in the courthouse in Oklahoma City.

    Isn't it more than that, Mr. Manners?

    Gentlemen, I think I have used a lot of my time.

    A judge, named Judge Mills when I was a beginning lawyer said you didn't have to use all your time. 
    He said it reminded him of a picture of Lincoln. 
    A little boy asked the teacher, said, "How long shall I make Lincoln's legs"?

   Argument of Jay M. Galt
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1173.769" stopTime="1181.717">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Very well. 
    Mr. Galt, you may proceed whenever you are ready.
speaker="jay_m_galt" startTime="1181.717" stopTime="1355.936">
    Mr. Jay M. Galt 
    MR. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    I am Jay M. Galt, from the Law Firm of Looney, Nichols, Johnson &amp; Hayes, Oklahoma City, representing the Respondent ARMCO Steel Corporation, an Ohio corporation. 
    The facts of the case are much as outlined by Mr. Manners. 
    However, I would like to point out to the Court that ARMCO Steel Corporation retains a National Service Corporation as its resident agent in the State of Oklahoma, whose office is located within four blocks of the Federal Courthouse. 
    And when service was effected, 101 days after the statute of limitations had run, that was the very first notice, the first notice that ARMCO had received of any claim by Mr. Walker against ARMCO for injuries he allegedly sustained by reason of a defective nail. 
    The Petitioner in this case is a resident of the State of Oklahoma, took advantage of the diversity statute, and chose his forum in the Federal Court. 
    The Petitioner admits that had he filed this case in the State District Court, and, in fact, it might have been an after thought that he filed it in the Federal Court, his initial pleading is denominated a petition rather than a complaint, and in our State Court we would call our initial pleading a petition, he chose the Federal Court and has admitted that had he filed this in the State Court, and the same facts had existed, no service for 101 days, without question, his case would have been barred and dismissed. 
    But because he was fortuitous enough to file it in the Federal Court, we are now before this Honorable body today asking and questioning whether or not Ragan should prevail as the rule covering this case. 
    It is the position of the Respondent, obviously, that Ragan is good law and that if this Court were to reverse Ragan and hold that Hanna applied, and that the commencement of this action by filing with the Clerk tolled the statute of limitations.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1355.936" stopTime="1370.675">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    How can we -- How is a Federal matter, when you say that for State law purposes, the statute of limitations is tolled?
speaker="jay_m_galt" startTime="1370.675" stopTime="1385.778">
    Mr. Jay M. Galt 
    I don't think you can. 
    What the Petitioner in this case is asking that you do is rule that by filing under Rule 3, that mere act tolled the statute of limitations, and --
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1385.778" stopTime="1389.765">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    And that the State is incompetent to require another step.
speaker="jay_m_galt" startTime="1389.765" stopTime="1503.401">
    Mr. Jay M. Galt 
    That's correct. 
    And we honestly don't agree with that. 
    We think that Rule 3 does not apply. 
    State law applies, and the State law is very clear that if you file your action within the appropriate statute of limitations period, from the time that that statute runs, you then have 60 days to effect service. 
    And there is a case Taylor v. Taylor that Judge Doyle cites that is out of our Court of Appeals, that says that the filing commences the action, but there is one step more required to effect jurisdiction of the State District Court, and that is service on the Defendant. 
    And it sets that other step that the Petitioner in this case failed to take for reasons that he has been very honest with the Court about today. 
    The important thing that I see in this case is that should this Court decide that Rule 3 commences an action to toll the limitations, what happens to the diversity defendant who has the same case filed in the State Court, the same facts being present, no service for 101 days, and then mistakenly that diversity defendant to obtain the benefits of the diversity rule removes his case to the Federal Court, files his motion to dismiss and finds that it will be overruled. 
    Because had he stayed in the State Court, his motion to dismiss would have been sustained but because the Federal Court--

    So far as you know, Counsel, is there any provision in the Federal Rules that sets a time limit on actual service on the part of the Defendant once the complaint is filed? Suppose this complaint or summons hadn't been filed for six years after the complaint had been filed in Court, would the Federal Rules have nonetheless have held it to be a good complaint?

    Mr. Justice Rehnquist, the procedure in that case would be that had the summons not been issued for six years, we had no similar statute, the Defendant would most likely file a motion under Rule 41 to have the case dismissed for lack of diligent prosecution.

    That's not right, is it? 
    The action was not commenced, as a matter of Oklahoma law, as I read the statute.

    Justice Byron R. White 
    In other words, your view is that the action is commenced upon the date of service. 
    If that is true, I fail to see any relevance whatsoever to the 60-day provision in the Oklahoma statute. 
    It is either commenced when the complaint is filed, which the Federal Rule provides, and you disagree with it -- so does Ragan -- or, alternatively, it is commenced upon service, or attempt to make service. 
    You say it is the latter and your opponent says it's the former.

    Well --

    I can see where, for purposes of filing a responsive pleading, that you would compute from the date of service, as distinguished from the date of commencement of the action, if it relates back under Oklahoma practice. 
    And somewhere in these briefs I have the impression, isn't there a State Court holding that it does relate back?

    Mr. Jay M. Galt 
    I don't believe so, Mr. Justice Blackmun, but in doing the research and preparation for this argument, it appeared to me that the drafters of the Rule, when they looked at Rule 3, thought about putting a proviso in there that filing the complaint would toll any statute of limitations problem. 
    They thought better of it and did not include that. 
    Some of the writers have said that the word "commencement" is in the Rules to have a figure to calculate time from. 
    The only thing I can relate to in answer to the question is that the Oklahoma statute says that the action is commenced when you are served and, for my purposes, as a trial lawyer, defense lawyer, when an action is commenced, it is commenced on me when I receive service, and that is when I start my preparation for a defense.

    Conceivably, it might commence for one purpose under the statute of limitations and another purpose in terms of tolling your time, in determining your time to respond.

    On the matter of supplying this information, while it's true we have the statutes available, you are both Oklahoma lawyers, you submit whatever you wish to submit on it as promptly as possible.
