Agins v. City of Tiburon

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    We'll hear arguments first this morning in Agins against City of Tiburon. 
    Mr. Kanner, you may proceed whenever you are ready.

    Mr. Gideon Kanner 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    Particularly, in view of the controversy that erupted in the briefing, it seems appropriate to emphasize some of the facts in this case. 
    This case --
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="26.798" stopTime="33.835">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    You -- you observed more the volume of the briefing than the controversy, Mr. Kanner?
speaker="gideon_kanner" startTime="33.835" stopTime="88.006">
    Mr. Gideon Kanner 
    The amici have indeed been prolific, Your Honor. 
    We have here a combination of factors. 
    There is an impact of -- a twofold impact on the subject property. 
    We have first of all, the regulatory impact, the intrusive regulation which in fact appellants contend deprives the subject property of all use and value in the marketplace. 
    The second factor which is not in our view received the proper amount of attention from the appellee's side, is that we have here a fairly extensive long standing and overt accusatory activities by the city. 
    And there's a long standing official announcements and commitments to acquisition of this property and long standing studies by experts indicating that this property was to be a -- an indispensable part of the city's open space.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="88.006" stopTime="114.621">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Mr. Kanner, let me ask you a -- a question about the procedural posture of the case, because of my lack of familiarity with California law. 
    As I understand it, the -- your clients brought an action in the Superior Court of Marin County and a demurrer one -- a demurrer to one count was sustained and demurrers to another was overruled.
speaker="gideon_kanner" startTime="114.621" stopTime="118.906">
    Mr. Gideon Kanner 
    Not quite, Your Honor. 
    The -- the second count was also sustained, but with leave to amend.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="118.906" stopTime="120.390">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    You wouldn't live with -- with leave.
speaker="gideon_kanner" startTime="120.390" stopTime="127.025">
    Mr. Gideon Kanner 
    Yes, that was the declaratory relief count and the plaintiffs then declined to amend instead on that -- on that part of the pleading.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="127.025" stopTime="146.641">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well -- well, what I'm puzzled about is, do we have any way of knowing whether ultimately, your client would be allowed to build one house per acre on this 5-acre tract or only one house on the entire 5-acre tract?
speaker="gideon_kanner" startTime="146.641" stopTime="148.913">
    Mr. Gideon Kanner 
    There is no way of knowing that and that is --
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="148.913" stopTime="150.452">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    There -- there was a way, wasn't there?
speaker="gideon_kanner" startTime="150.452" stopTime="150.910">
    Mr. Gideon Kanner 
    I beg your pardon?
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="150.910" stopTime="154.847">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    There was a way, wasn't there, the administrative remedy?
speaker="gideon_kanner" startTime="154.847" stopTime="179.506">
    Mr. Gideon Kanner 
    Well, there was no administrative remedy on this ordinance, Your Honor. 
    There was at -- would have been, had Mr. Agins gone ahead and decided to build. 
    The point is that one owns property not necessarily to build. 
    He may wish to sell it. 
    He may wish to do something else with it. 
    The point is that the property, the allegation goes, has now been rendered unusable and worthless in the marketplace. 
    Who is going --
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="179.506" stopTime="181.140">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Unusable for any purpose?
speaker="gideon_kanner" startTime="181.140" stopTime="182.109">
    Mr. Gideon Kanner 
    For any purpose.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="182.109" stopTime="183.669">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Can't you build one house on it?
speaker="gideon_kanner" startTime="183.669" stopTime="224.208">
    Mr. Gideon Kanner 
    Well, we suggest, Your Honor, that we cannot and because again, Your Honor, it has been a disadvantage precisely, because of the procedural posture mentioned by Mr. Justice Rehnquist. 
    And that is we have before Your Honors a complaint that has never been even amended once. 
    The demurrer was sustained without to -- leave to amend even once. 
    So, we only have the bare language of the pleading and under California practice, the so called pleading of ultimate facts, which haven't forbid, must not be evidentiary facts that is forbidden. 
    So, we cannot on this record, point to any facts that would present the Court with the evidence that we could put on, had we been permitted to go trial.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="224.208" stopTime="233.631">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Does the City of Tiburon have a zoning commission, before whom you could've gone and asked leave to build one house per acre?
speaker="gideon_kanner" startTime="233.631" stopTime="291.553">
    Mr. Gideon Kanner 
    I presume they do. 
    The point -- our -- our point here is, Your Honor, however, that we're dealing with a legislative enactment. 
    We are dealing here with the zoning -- an extensive zoning ordinance of -- that covers a wide area. 
    And after this Court's ruling in the Forest City Enterprises case and parallel California cases, which are cited on the briefs, that is a purely legislative act, so that there were no administrative remedies to exhaust. 
    This ordinance, the -- the legislation itself, does not set up any administrative review proceedings -- procedure, so that one could do it only in the same sense that if the legislature of the State of California were to adopt an unconstitutional statute, one can say -- one could say, “Well, why don't you go to Sacramento and ask them to change it before you challenge it in court?” 
    Now, as I understand this Court's precedents, that is Euclid versus Ambler, which was quite explicit on the point that is not required to be done.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="291.553" stopTime="306.665">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    But we don't know what this point then, whether if you had followed some sort of zoning board or adjustment board procedure, you might or might not have been allowed to build one house per acre?
speaker="gideon_kanner" startTime="306.665" stopTime="308.914">
    Mr. Gideon Kanner 
    That is correct. 
    This Court does not know it on this record.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="308.914" stopTime="309.611">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Suppose --
speaker="gideon_kanner" startTime="309.611" stopTime="310.654">
    Mr. Gideon Kanner 
    -- may I -- yes, sir?
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="310.654" stopTime="326.039">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Could I ask you? 
    What do you do about the statement by your Supreme Court and California that says, “According to the wording of the ordinance at which we may take note, the RPD-1 zoning allows plaintiff to build between one and five residences on their property?
speaker="gideon_kanner" startTime="326.039" stopTime="326.335">
    Mr. Gideon Kanner 
    That is --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="326.335" stopTime="332.849">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    This belies plaintiff's claim that development of their land is forever prevented and that's the -- that's what the Supreme Court in California says.
speaker="gideon_kanner" startTime="332.849" stopTime="338.351">
    Mr. Gideon Kanner 
    That was directed, Your Honor, to the second count, to the declaratory relief count and under California or law of remedies --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="338.351" stopTime="346.563">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    You won't care whether it was directed to. 
    It says that -- that it was -- that-- that under the zoning ordinance, you can build one to five houses?
speaker="gideon_kanner" startTime="346.563" stopTime="377.051">
    Mr. Gideon Kanner 
    Well, this Court and Nectow verus Cambridge, said, “The quite, the contrary.” 
    In that case, that is precisely what the Massachusetts Supreme Court said and this Court disagreed and said that, “The owner was -- had to be permitted as he was there permitted, which we were not, to put on evidence and satisfy a triumph of fact that notwithstanding such language in the ordinance,” he in fact was not able to put the property to uses which would be economically valuable that would give him a reasonable to return.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="377.051" stopTime="386.986">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    So, you -- you say, we should just -- that we -- that we just shouldn't accept the statement as to what the zoning ordinance does to you?
speaker="gideon_kanner" startTime="386.986" stopTime="448.133">
    Mr. Gideon Kanner 
    On -- that's not quite our position. 
    The answer to that is twofold. 
    Number one, there are two causes of action involved there. 
    This one was directed only to the facial constitutionality of the ordinance. 
    So that the California Supreme Court said, “Since the ordinance on its face allows something, it is not amenable to challenge by declaratory relief under California law.” 
    However, that leaves unanswered, the first cause of action which is the Nectow versus Cambridge approach, in which we say, “Notwithstanding the face of the ordinance, let us look at the facts.” 
    Suppose the legislature or the local city was to make some -- let's -- let's hypothesize a bad face situation, in which they zone a swampland for -- for high rise office buildings. 
    Now, would not the owner then be permitted to come into court and put on evidence and say, “Look, it's impossible to build office buildings on that land.” 
    We make the same argument, except that our argument goes to the economics and to value the property --
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="448.133" stopTime="453.268">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    When you say the zoning traditionally, impair a value of property for --
speaker="gideon_kanner" startTime="453.268" stopTime="454.018">
    Mr. Gideon Kanner 
    Of course.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="454.018" stopTime="454.737">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    -- owners?
speaker="gideon_kanner" startTime="454.737" stopTime="473.080">
    Mr. Gideon Kanner 
    That's -- that's a point of some importance by this -- an allegation of this complaint not that the value has been diminished, which incidentally ought to be enough. 
    It's a matter of degree under this Court's opinion in Central Eureka Mining, but we're alleging that it went beyond that. 
    That the property has been deprived of all --
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="473.080" stopTime="473.514">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Well, are you telling the --

    Mr. Gideon Kanner 
    -- value and --

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger

speaker="gideon_kanner" startTime="484.472" stopTime="485.374">
    Mr. Gideon Kanner 
    Yes, Your Honor.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="485.374" stopTime="485.420">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    But --
speaker="gideon_kanner" startTime="485.420" stopTime="487.653">
    Mr. Gideon Kanner 
    The practicalities of the matter. 
    Let me --
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="487.653" stopTime="489.214">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    How -- how do you know, unless you did it?
speaker="gideon_kanner" startTime="489.214" stopTime="534.995">
    Mr. Gideon Kanner 
    Well, with -- there is a -- a fairly well settled body of state law and federal law that is and to the extent the federal courts have considered it. 
    We've cited some of it in the brief, the most recent one in California being Dahl versus City of Palo Alto, which discusses California law on that point. 
    And there's a well recognized doctrine of utility. 
    And that is that if the position of the public body as such, that is manifest, that they have no intention of allowing it. 
    One is not required to perform an idle act. 
    And the same thing happened in the Dahl case, if it's -- the facts are virtually identical. 
    There, the City of Palo Alto pretty much said, “We want those foothills left open. 
    That's going to be open space, there will be view shed for our city park and that's that.”
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="534.995" stopTime="544.149">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    You say this is almost then as if, the legislature had said, “You're 5-acre is zoned as a park and nothing -- nothing should be built on it.”
speaker="gideon_kanner" startTime="544.149" stopTime="594.638">
    Mr. Gideon Kanner 
    Just about, may I invite Your Honors' attention to page 32 of the appendix in the jurisdictional statement which contains some of these standards as the ordinance puts it. 
    Take a look at this for example, “Land to be preserved as open space shall be maintained as permanent open space by dedication to the city, a fee title or of scenic easements, by deed restriction approved by the city attorney or by other methods acceptable to the city.” 
    Now, we have here a piece of property, if it's going to be one house per 5-acres, we're talking here about a -- an estate of unimaginable grandeur in that part of the country. 
    And even by one house per acre, would be quite lavish. 
    Now, we have to sell this land to some person who is going to have to spend a fortune and then he discovers that he has to dedicated it in fee to the city, if the city so requires.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="594.638" stopTime="606.411">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    These are economic reality, we'll just -- we'll just mean that you cannot develop, develop, but even if you could build one house per acre, that you're -- that just won't work.
speaker="gideon_kanner" startTime="606.411" stopTime="617.456">
    Mr. Gideon Kanner 
    Well, I -- what we are saying, Your Honor, is that there is no way in which the -- there is going to be one house per acre. 
    Again, I'm again, that the disadvantage being bound to the --
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="617.456" stopTime="617.494">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well --

    -- complaint.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="618.122" stopTime="633.117">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    -- it me, an illegal sense in which -- which your theory or complaint boils down to is it, on the allegations in your complaint, instead of having the demurrer sustained, it should have been overruled and a trial on the facts should have been held.
speaker="gideon_kanner" startTime="633.117" stopTime="667.325">
    Mr. Gideon Kanner 
    That's precisely our position. 
    If all these arguments from -- for -- from the other side on that point are correct, then obviously, my client would've lost very quickly, possibly by summary judgment, if it's all that cut and dry. 
    Now -- and we -- we -- as I've -- as an advocate, I certainly inscribe a great deal of significance that a determined effort to keep my clients from going to trial and to put on their evidence. 
    Why? 
    If the evidence is all that bad, they're going to loss like that, aren't they? 
    But the evidence is not all that bad and I am prevented from going into it here on this record.

speaker="gideon_kanner" startTime="1172.364" stopTime="1193.286">
    Mr. Gideon Kanner 
    No, Your Honor. 
    I have been driven to respond in a way which I'm not sure as proper, but I think the Court should know that when this case was being argued before the California Supreme Court, Mr. Hearn, who was arguing the case, offered to dismiss the action right then and there, on a stipulation that one house per acre could be built. 
    And no such stipulation was proffered.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1193.286" stopTime="1196.442">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    How about one house for the entire 5 acres?
speaker="gideon_kanner" startTime="1196.442" stopTime="1310.802">
    Mr. Gideon Kanner 
    That is a matter of physical impossibility. 
    The offsite improvements necessary for the construction of one house on that parcel would make it so expensive that no one could afford it. 
    That's -- that's what it boils down to. 
    Now, again, I -- I apologize if I transgress the boundary of the record, but that's the sort of evidentiary matters that we would have to go into to -- to persuade a trier of fact as was done in Nectow versus Cambridge, that in fact, that's just can't be done. 
    No matter what that ordinance says. 
    I -- I did want to emphasize the other activities that took place here and that is something which this Court has never considered and that is the impact of the pre-condemnation activities of the Government, which is not content just to go ahead and condemn land when they want to, but on the contrary, they go ahead and they make announcement and they get -- they get studies and they get planners. 
    And it's all widely reported in the press. 
    This property is being acquired by the city. 
    This went on for a period of years here. 
    Who in -- in the market is going to be foolish enough to spend good money to buy land which the city has announced, repeatedly, definitively, “This is an indispensable part of open space city resources. 
    We are going to acquire it” 
    And in fact, they went ahead, adopt the condemnation resolution, brought the condemnation action. 
    And it was then only when confronting the value of this land, because it is a very desirable part of the country and they abandoned the condemnation and chose to stand on this ordinance, but accomplishes the very same thing, the passive use. 
    Now, if the Government wants to go in and build a road on somebody's property obviously, they -- they have to enter at some point and do it. 
    But if the use that is desired by the Government is a passive one, such as open space, they don't have to, they don't have to cross the -- the close. 
    They don't have to set that tow on the property.

    Mr. Gideon Kanner 
    Yes, Your Honor. 
    I again, call Your Honors' attention to the language of the ordinance at pages 32 and 33 of the appendix or jurisdictional statement. 
    And the -- the city has a -- a -- there are some four subparagraphs under each of them the -- any -- any construction can be turned down under the most vague and subjective criteria imaginable, to minimize visual impact for example. 
    In any event, I would urge the Court to consider the other mode of the city activity, that is quite critical and I see that it did not capture the Court's mind as much as the first issue. 
    Nevertheless, that is the kind of pragmatic issue, which the market reacts to very strongly. 
    And because nobody wants to buy land that has a lawsuit attached to it and nobody wants to buy land which is under a cloud of a condemnation, nobody wants to buy land that the city has shown a definite interest in and has committed itself, as clear as can be on this record even without going into the evidentiary facts, which incidentally go even further than this record. 
    But we have here two studies by two consultants we have the appropriation of funds, we have the issuance of bronzes, we have a condemnation resolution, we have an actual on again, off again condemnation, which in this cases is often a very common device, bring the condemnation, then abandon it, then bring it later, at a later date and so on.

   Argument of E. Clement Shute, Jr.

    Very well, Mr. Kanner.

    Mr. E. Clement Shute, Jr. 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    I also would like to review the significant allegations of the complaint. 
    It is alleged that the appellants bought the property for residential use and as the Court has observed, the California Supreme Court required that it be made available for residential use, by the construction that placed upon the zoning ordinance. 
    That is at least, one home must be allowed by the city and up to five maybe allowed by the city under the terms of the zoning ordinance. 
    It must be recalled that complaint alleges that the City of Tiburon has the highest values of land for residential purposes of any place in California and that these land of appellants has the highest values within the city. 
    So, we're talk --
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1583.419" stopTime="1642.338">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Mr. -- Mr. Shute, let -- let me refer to you to part of a page 13 of the joint appendix where the allegation is that the -- number seven that the ordinance and question is arbitrary, capricious and reasonable and therefore, constituted so taking their property without payment of just compensation violation the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment, in prohibiting such. 
    Now, as I say, I'm -- I -- I'm not familiar with California rules presently but I -- I would've thought that in -- under ordinary rules, a notice pleading in allegation such as that, the sustaining of a demurrer to what have said the -- the -- even if the ordinance does that, it's perfectly all right, which strikes me as a somewhat odd results.
speaker="e_clement_shute_jr" startTime="1642.338" stopTime="1674.205">
    Mr. E. Clement Shute, Jr. 
    Well, Your Honor, I think the answer lies in the fact that the California Supreme Court took judicial notice at the zoning ordinance and under California law and federal cases who have done the same, in effect, considered the terms of the zoning ordinance to be a part of the complaint or a part of the record before the Court. 
    Construe those ordinances as requiring the city to allow residential use, then determine under the substantive test for encroachment upon private rights that the -- the remaining available reasonable use rendered nugatory that allegation. 
    As a matter of law, the ordinances are not arbitrary or capricious.

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    What do you have to say about Mr. Kanner's suggestion that an application to build five houses, one per acre, would've been utterly futile?
speaker="e_clement_shute_jr" startTime="1685.699" stopTime="1705.065">
    Mr. E. Clement Shute, Jr. 
    I think, Your Honor, that's an incorrect contention. 
    The city -- there's no indication that the city would not consider such an application on its merits and perhaps grant up to five residential units. 
    One of the key parts of the city's position is that it should be able to preserve its process. 
    It calls for the submission of a master plan and then it would act on the master plan as --
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1705.065" stopTime="1706.295">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    The master plan for how many units?

    Mr. E. Clement Shute, Jr. 
    For the -- up to five units.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1707.640" stopTime="1708.981">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Just for the 5 acres?
speaker="e_clement_shute_jr" startTime="1708.981" stopTime="1739.339">
    Mr. E. Clement Shute, Jr. 
    Because the zoning ordinance calls for a maximum density of one home per acre, which if the land values are such as has been alleged, would certainly, yield very substantial values. 
    I think that would be a matter of common knowledge. 
    So, what we say is the city can't very well indicate in advance, how many units it would approve because the necessary environmental review hasn't occurred. 
    There's no way to know the physical circumstances and enough detail to indicate how many units might be approved, but the Supreme Court of our State has said, “Residential use must be approved from one to five units.”

    But did the city in this response, make any defense that you haven't even taken this before the zoning board or the land development board, whatever you have. 
    Rather than -- it's simply demurring which is as I understand, the same as saying a motion the -- if complaint fails to state a claim and which relief maybe -- maybe granted?

    Mr. E. Clement Shute, Jr. 
    Actually, an alternative ground of the demurrer was a lack of jurisdiction which under California law, the doctrine of exhaustion the administrative remedy is jurisdictional.And one of the grounds of the city's demurrer was the court lack jurisdiction precisely because of the failure to exhaust administrative remedies.

    Mr. E. Clement Shute, Jr. 
    I think, Your Honor, that it implicitly did in the sense that it also refused to speculate as to how many units might be appropriate by court action prior to administrative of action. 
    And by construing the ordinance on its face said, “That is what is before us, the facial validity of the ordinance.” 
    Now, it might be applied in circumstances that would call on this ordinance for the submission of a master plan.

    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well, how much -- is it your position that the city could've waited five or 10 years for them to get a master plan approved and meanwhile, these owners could have been a kind of held in suspense until the master plan was finally approved?
speaker="e_clement_shute_jr" startTime="1848.959" stopTime="1855.119">
    Mr. E. Clement Shute, Jr.

    Mr. E. Clement Shute, Jr. 
    That's correct and a further point I would make, Your Honor, is under the California Government Code and they have the numbers transverse, 65950. 
    There is a time limit established under California law. 
    An agency can take no more than one year for any kind of action such as this and as encouraged to take less time. 
    So, had the application been submitted, it could not have just been suspended indefinitely. 
    And the penalty for an agency's failure to act is that the application is deemed to prove by operation of law.

speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1898.829" stopTime="1916.927">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Mr. Shute, I wonder if you'd comment on Mr. Kanner's reference to subparagraph (e) on -- on page 32 of the jurisdictional statement, “Permanents of open space that the part about land to be preserved as open space shall be maintained as permanent open space by dedication of the city of fee title or scenic easements and the like.”
speaker="e_clement_shute_jr" startTime="1916.927" stopTime="1953.859">
    Mr. E. Clement Shute, Jr. 
    Well, Your Honor, I would -- I respond to that in two ways. 
    First of all, it seems to me that if there were any improprieties that occurred in this -- in the amount of dedication or the form of dedication which the city asked for during the process, then the Court would be aware of the issues and the illegal questions that would be presented and it could litigated following the completion of the administrative process. 
    In other words, if owner's dedication requirements that were unreasonable under any standard were imposed, the -- the owner could litigate that following the city's action. 
    So, that really ties into the exhaustion point and becomes kind of an element of procedural due process.
speaker="william_o_douglas" startTime="1953.859" stopTime="1960.510">
    Justice William O. Douglas 
    Well, if the city can call the dedication pursuant to that paragraph, would there be compensation paid for the debt which was dedicated?
speaker="e_clement_shute_jr" startTime="1960.510" stopTime="1970.194">
    Mr. E. Clement Shute, Jr. 
    Well, no. 
    Ordinarily, there would not be, because the compensation -- this will be an aspect of the approval for -- of the activity --
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1970.194" stopTime="1970.434">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Yes.
speaker="e_clement_shute_jr" startTime="1970.434" stopTime="2017.948">
    Mr. E. Clement Shute, Jr. 
    -- and part dedications, dedications for roadways and such as that have generally been held to be non-compensable. 
    But you see, in all candor, I don't see how that issue can be considered before the Court at this point, because we can't presume that the city would require an extraordinary or unfair illegal amount of dedication. 
    That would have to wait and see what occurs. 
    And also, the open space process is contemplated by California law, in this circumstance, calls for a balance between preservation of open space resources whatever they maybe, in California that would include vest amounts of agricultural land, lands which is subject to landslide or earthquake and it might very appropriate to require dedications under some circumstances to preserve the very open space features, which the law identifies. 
    And I think that --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2017.948" stopTime="2072.300">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well, Mr. Shute, you're simply answering the questions posed to you by members of the Court, but really, aren't all these things matters for the -- for a trial court, and isn't that -- doesn't that show why a demurrer was improper? 
    Here, you have a complaint that in paragraph 9 says that “the natural and proximate result of the ordinance was to prevent any sale, use, transfer or development thereof, or any part thereof.” 
    And then you filed a demurrer which I assume is what appears on page 25 of the jurisdictional statement and the demurrer was sustained and yet, the allegations of that complaint sound like the property was taken without any compensation whatsoever. 
    Now, maybe there are all sorts of factual evidence that can show that it wasn't, but why -- why does this make a demurrer proper?

    That's correct. 
    So, a large part of our position as I've indicated before is to try to protect the sanctity of the city's planning zoning process. 
    And I would point out that the facts to the case also indicate that a significant portion of the City of Tiburon was zoned in this manner, with the same RPD-1 zoning. 
    So we are not talking about a circumstance where appellant's property was the sole property put into the zoning district. 
    And in terms of the substantive validity of the ordinance in addition to the notion of reasonable use remaining to the property owner, there is a classic, we submit, instance of reciprocity here. 
    The appellant's properties would benefit by the grading controls and the density restrictions and all as they would be applied to neighboring property.

    Mr. E. Clement Shute, Jr. 
    Well, yes, Your Honor. 
    Except even at that time in California, there was the Subdivision Map Act, which requires going through an approval process, certain findings have to be made in order disallow the maximum density and there is the California Environmental Quality Act, which was in effect to that time. 
    So, it would not have been automatic even then that they would've received five, but their expectations certainly cannot have been much damaged by the change in the zoning.

speaker="e_clement_shute_jr" startTime="2738.114" stopTime="2926.396">
    Mr. E. Clement Shute, Jr. 
    I think we are through with that, but possibly, yes. 
    I just like to mention briefly this -- this remedy question which has been much briefed. 
    If the Court agrees with our position that this ordinance is valid on -- on its face or this case could be considered one were administrative remedy should be exhausted and of course, the question of what remedy to invoke following an unconstitutional action or an encroachment on private property rights would not be presented. 
    But the concept of the remedy to be applied to regulation is really based on the need to accommodate two very strong powers. 
    One is the power to regulate which this Court has observed to be one of the list limitable powers of Government. 
    In fact, local zoning authority has been observed to be about the most essential power held by local Government. 
    And where that power comes into conflict with protected property rights, then there are no absolutes involved. 
    What is necessary is to engage in the balancing. 
    And we submit that the proper balance to be struck in that circumstance is to invalidate the offending measure that preserves that police power as an essential power and it provides fairness to the property owner in the sense that a property owner normally does not commence development procedure or process with the idea of having the city and buying his property. 
    He commences that process with the idea of commencing some development.Invalidation allows him to go forward with some form of development. 
    Also under California law, declaratory relief and mandate have priority on the court calendar. 
    So it's much faster to receive a judicial resolution of these kinds of conflicts to declaratory relief and mandamus than it is to go inverse condemnation which can stick around on a trial calendar for a good long time. 
    So, we think it's an appropriate constitutional balance between these two strong interest and we submit that this Court has recognized that essentially, the payment of compensation or money damages is a legislative choice. 
    And that is an aspect to the separation of powers since legislatures under our structure of Government are the ones that appropriate and expend public funds. 
    And in this cases which don't have to do with the police power, U.S. Trust versus New Jersey, involving the impairment of bondholders' rights. 
    Perhaps somewhat a kin to interference with investment-backed expectations as discussed in Penn Central. 
    The Court was careful to note that while invalidating New Jersey's repeal, the State of New Jersey was not frustrated in trying to carryout its new public policy. 
    It could invoke its power of eminent domain and compensate effective property interest and proceed with its new policy. 
    The critical point there is that it was a matter of legislative choice, not court decree, that compensation would be paid. 
    So it was reserved to the legislature as a legislative matter. 
    And finally, I would notice, this has been noted in cases involving the Civil Rights Act, the prospectively chilling effect that monetary damages would have in circumstances where there cannot be easily anticipated. 
    Where to be inadvertent --

    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well, does -- does that mean that any claim -- any cause of action for monitory damages is suspect, because it has a, “chilling effect”?

    Mr. E. Clement Shute, Jr.

    Justice William H. Rehnquist

speaker="e_clement_shute_jr" startTime="2947.154" stopTime="2992.891">
    Mr. E. Clement Shute, Jr. 
    I think that where a State moves or local agency moves by eminent domain, it's not a regulatory act. 
    That isn't -- that is the exercise of sort of proprietary direct governmental powers, not adjusting the public good, but moving to the benefit of Government. 
    I don't think a physical invasion of property by Government is necessarily a -- a regulatory act. 
    So, ours -- our point is that in the area of pure regulation which is intending to adjust the public good whether it been in environmental law or some other area, that the approached should be that if it goes too far under certain circumstances, it would be an invalid act. 
    Precisely, because it's unaccompanied by the just compensation that would be necessary to sustain an invasion of guaranteed property rights.

    And then, the Supreme Court of California said, “Well, the ordinance will allow one to five houses.”

    They review the statements of the appellant here as claiming it deprived of the land over -- landowner of all reasonable use of his property and then the Court said this, “The ordinance before us had no such effect.” 
    According to the wording of the ordinance, the zoning allows plaintiffs to build between one and five residences on their property. 
    So, the perspective purchaser would know that he could build one for the Supreme Court of California having said so and that it has an administrative process for a modification of the zoning would possibly more?

speaker="gideon_kanner" startTime="3406.749" stopTime="3421.840">
    Mr. Gideon Kanner 
    May it please the Court. 
    Most remarkable argument, this is a case in which the demurrer was sustained. 
    They're arguing rise to traditional Anglo-American issue of pure law. 
    And yet, virtually, all we have been arguing about this facts.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="3421.840" stopTime="3439.501">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Well, that's perhaps because of the way you undertook to set this litigation in motion, instead of asking for what is provided under California -- under the city's ordinance, an opportunity to get five sites and you passed that opportunity and plunged right in to the total litigation.
speaker="gideon_kanner" startTime="3439.501" stopTime="3589.443">
    Mr. Gideon Kanner 
    Well, may I respectfully point up and call to the Court's attention the basic American seminal case, Euclid versus Ambler, whereat 272 U.S. 386. 
    That very issue was presented. 
    The Court said, “A motion was made in the court below to dismiss the bill on the grounds that because the complainant had made no effort to obtain a building permit or applied to the Zoning Board of Appeals for relief, as it might have done under the terms of the ordinance, the suit was premature.” 
    The motion was properly overruled. 
    The effect of the allegations to the bill is that the ordinance on its own force operates greatly to reduce the value of appellee's land and destroy their marketability for industrial, commercial and residential uses.” 
    I won't go on to the quotation. 
    We were and still are relying on that and it seems to us that the Court would have to overrule not only Nectow versus Cambridge, but Euclid as well, to deprive ourselves of an opportunity to rely on that, what was until now, a clear principle of law. 
    May I touch on the -- on just of a couple of facts? 
    Mr. Chief Justice, I -- I wanted to make very clear that in responding to your question, sir, I intended to indicate that even one -- one house cannot be built because of the prohibit of cost of our offsite improvements, that is a large 5-acre parcel on a ridge and in order to prepare it and provide access to it, utilities and so on, it would be prohibited. 
    Now, as to the -- the question also, Mr. Chief Justice, you commented on the California Supreme Court's opinion as to what they did decide. 
    May I respectfully call your attention to page 9 in the appendix that a jurisdictional statement where they tell us as to that first part of the opinion. 
    In HFH Ltd., we specifically noted that, “This case does not present and we therefore do not decide the question of entitlement to compensation in the event a zoning regulation forbade substantially all,” that's emphasized, “substantially all use of a land in question, we leave that question for another day.” 
    That was the HFH quotation. 
    They now go on and say, “We now reached that issue. 
    They did reach that issue as to what happens when substantially all use of his owned land is destroyed.” 
    So I respectfully disagree with my colleague and I urge the Court to consider that passage because there, the California Supreme Court tells us expressly what they did reach and which they did decide.
