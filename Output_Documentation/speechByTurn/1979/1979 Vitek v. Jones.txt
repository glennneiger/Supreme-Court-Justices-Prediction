    Justice Byron R. White 
    This case is here on appeal from a three-judge District Court with the District of Nebraska. 
    The question is whether a state prisoner is entitled to a hearing when he is declared to be suffering from a mental disease or defect and transferred to a mental hospital for a treatment that is not available in the prison. 
    The three-judge court held that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment requires a hearing and specified the procedures to be included in -- in the hearing including a holding that counsel was required. 
    Because of the question of mootness, we postponed the -- the question of jurisdiction to the merits and heard oral argument. 
    As indicated in an opinion on file with the clerk, a majority of five justices holds that the case is not moot. 
    We then agree with the district court that under the Due Process Clause, a prisoner about to be transferred to a mental hospital is entitled to notice and a hearing, to be present, offer testimony and cross-examined, and they'll have an independent maker and a written statement of the evidence and the reasons for the transfer. 
    Four of us, Justices Brennan, Marshall, Stevens, and I, also agree with the District Court that the prisoner is entitled with the help of counsel. 
    Mr. Justice Powell, however, has indicated in his separate opinion concurring in part would require a competent help for the prisoner but not necessarily a licensed attorney. 
    The judgment of the District Court is accordingly modified in this respect and is modified that it is affirmed. 
    Mr. Justice Stewart and Mr. Justice Blackmun have filed dissenting opinions on the jurisdictional aspect of the case. 
    The Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Rehnquist have joined Mr. Justice Stewart.
