    Justice Byron R. White 
    In the Schaumburg case which has comes here from the Seventh Circuit on a writ of certiorari. 
    The Village of Schaumburg in Cook County forbids door to door solicitation by charitable organizations unless the organization spends at least 75% of its receipts on charitable purposes which are defined to exclude salaries, solicitation expenses, overhead and other administrative expenses. 
    The District Court and the Court of Appeals both decided that both held that the ordinance was unconstitutional under the First and Fourteenth Amendment because it unduly interfered with the communication of information and ideas by charitable organizations. 
    We agree and affirmed the judgment of the Court of Appeals. 
    We have filed an opinion stating at some length our reasons for -- for this conclusion. 
    Mr. Justice Rehnquist has filed a dissenting opinion.
