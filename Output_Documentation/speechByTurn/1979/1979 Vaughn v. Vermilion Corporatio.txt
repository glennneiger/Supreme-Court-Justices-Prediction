    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    I have for announcement the disposition of the case of Vaughn against Vermilion Corporation, the related case to which Mr. Justice Rehnquist has alluded and for reasons stated in a per curiam opinion for the Court filed with the clerk this morning, the judgment of the Court of Appeals of Louisiana is affirmed with respect the second question presented in the case. 
    And the judgment is vacated and the case is remanded for further proceedings in the Louisiana court not in consistent with our opinion in Kaiser Aetna against United States just announced by Mr. Justice Rehnquist.
