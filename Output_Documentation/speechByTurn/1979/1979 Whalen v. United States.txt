    Justice Potter Stewart 
    This case is here by reason of the grant of a writ of certiorari to the District of Columbia Court of Appeals. 
    After a jury trial, the petitioner was convicted in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia of rape, and of killing the same victim in the perpetration of rape. 
    He was sentenced to consecutive terms of imprisonment of 20 years to life for first-degree murder, and of 15 years to life for rape. 
    The District of Columbia Court of Appeals affirmed the convictions and the sentences. 
    We brought the case here to consider the contention that the imposition of cumulative punishments for the two offenses was contrary to federal statutory and constitutional law. 
    For the reasons set out in detail in the Court's written opinion, we have concluded that cumulative sentences cannot lawfully be imposed for the two offenses in the circumstances of this case. 
    Accordingly, the judgment is reversed. 
    Mr. Justice White and Mr. Justice Blackmun have each filed opinions concurring in the judgement. 
    Mr. Justice Rehnquist has filed a dissenting opinion which the Chief Justice has joined.
