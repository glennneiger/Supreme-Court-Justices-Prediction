Thomas v. Washington Gas Light Company

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    We will hear argument next in Thomas v. Washington Gas Light Company. 
    Mr. Green, you may proceed whenever you are ready.
speaker="james_f_green" startTime="74.615" stopTime="183.093">
    Mr. James F. Green 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court. 
    Halley I. Thomas, a resident of the District of Columbia since 1949, was hired in 1970 as a heavy laborer by the Washington Gas Light Company in their employment office in Washington, D. C. Although Mr. Thomas occasionally worked in the neighboring jurisdictions of Virginia and Maryland, approximately 60 percent of his duties were performed in the District of Columbia. 
    For his endeavors, Mr. Thomas received a paycheck drawn upon a District of Columbia bank. 
    On January 22, 1971, Mr. Thomas was breaking concrete with an air hammer in Arlington, Virginia, when he sustained a disabling injury to his back. 
    Since that date, Mr. Thomas has been unable to return to his occupation. 
    Prior to his being represented by counsel, Mr. Thomas, while still hospitalized, signed a Virginia agreement for temporary total disability benefits under the Virginia Workmen's Compensation Act. 
    Mr. Thomas received the Virginia benefits until the maximum amount payable under Virginia law. 
    Mr. Thomas is currently without any disability compensation and medical coverage. 
    Mr. Thomas pursued permanent and total disability benefits in the District of Columbia and received an award which has never been honored. 
    The Court is today presented with two independent statutory schemes, each of which has as its purpose the compensation of injured workers. 
    The statutes concerned are those of Virginia and the District of Columbia. 
    The compensation statutes in both of these jurisdictions create administrative remedies. 
    The respective administrative fora do not look north or south or east or west to determine whether a given person is entitled to compensation in that forum.

    Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    In Virginia, he received compensation for total but not permanent disability, is that right?

    Mr. James F. Green 
    That is correct, Mr. Chief Justice.

    Totally but not permanent.
speaker="james_f_green" startTime="195.676" stopTime="196.300">

    That is correct.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="196.300" stopTime="199.417">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    The claim now is that he is permanently disabled.
speaker="james_f_green" startTime="199.417" stopTime="201.531">
    Mr. James F. Green 
    That is correct. 
    That claim was presented to the District of Columbia.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="201.531" stopTime="216.280">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Is his claim foreclosed in Virginia for permanent disability? 
    In other words, has he no residual rights when it developed that his temporary disability was apparently a permanent disability?
speaker="james_f_green" startTime="216.280" stopTime="222.391">
    Mr. James F. Green 
    Your Honor, the question of permanent and total disability was never resolved in the Commonwealth of Virginia. 
    That claim --
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="222.391" stopTime="222.934">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Why not?
speaker="james_f_green" startTime="222.934" stopTime="235.060">
    Mr. James F. Green 
    Because the benefits in the District of Columbia after Mr. Thomas obtained counsel were more generous to Mr. Thomas, and a claim was initiated in the District of Columbia for permanent and total disability benefits.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="235.060" stopTime="249.249">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    I perhaps misunderstood this situation, but I thought the fact was that he has now been paid all that he could be paid under the Virginia Workmen's Compensation Act for -- even for total permanent disability.
speaker="james_f_green" startTime="249.249" stopTime="258.188">
    Mr. James F. Green 
    Mr. Justice Stewart, you do not misunderstand what he has been paid. 
    He has been paid the extent of the Virginia award as it was then enacted in 1971.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Even if one concedes that he was totally and permanently disabled?

    Mr. James F. Green 
    That is correct, Mr. Justice.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="263.536" stopTime="264.267">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    That is what I thought.
speaker="james_f_green" startTime="264.267" stopTime="278.010">
    Mr. James F. Green 
    He has been paid that amount, the point being that they continue to pay the Virginia award even after the District of Columbia had granted Thomas' claim for permanent and total disability; an award was entered, they never paid the award.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="278.010" stopTime="282.874">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    I am having a little difficulty reconciling your two answers just on the factual situation.
speaker="james_f_green" startTime="282.874" stopTime="283.365">
    Mr. James F. Green 
    Let me see if I can --
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="283.365" stopTime="296.430">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    That is why I put the question, because I was confused as to the reality. 
    Could he have got an award for total and permanent in Virginia if he had ignored the District of Columbia entirely?
speaker="james_f_green" startTime="296.430" stopTime="326.223">
    Mr. James F. Green 
    And my answer to your question, Mr. Chief Justice, would have been he could have pursued such a remedy in Virginia. 
    The Virginia statutory scheme left open to Thomas a claim for additional relief beyond temporary total disability. 
    He elected not to pursue the permanent total disability claim in Virginia and pursued that claim in the District of Columbia to a judgment which has never been honored. 
    The Virginia award continued to be paid until it ran out in the summer of 1978, July of 1978.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="326.223" stopTime="331.991">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    And what would it have been open to him to pursue in virginia after his initial award?
speaker="james_f_green" startTime="331.991" stopTime="344.554">
    Mr. James F. Green 
    He would have been able in Virginia to pursue under a separate statutory policy permanent disability, that is permanent and total disability, although it is not captioned as such in Virginia, under their statute he could have --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="344.554" stopTime="346.723">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, what did he get an award for?
speaker="james_f_green" startTime="346.723" stopTime="352.699">
    Mr. James F. Green 
    He received an award, a voluntary award for temporary total disability.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="352.699" stopTime="353.638">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Temporary total.
speaker="james_f_green" startTime="353.638" stopTime="354.560">
    Mr. James F. Green 
    Yes.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="354.560" stopTime="358.403">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    So he could have pursued another award for permanent in Virginia?
speaker="james_f_green" startTime="358.403" stopTime="361.080">
    Mr. James F. Green 
    It would be our position that he could have, Mr. Justice White, yes.
speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="361.080" stopTime="365.760">
    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    But would he have obtained a single dime more than he had already obtained?
speaker="james_f_green" startTime="365.760" stopTime="371.411">
    Mr. James F. Green 
    Mr. Justice Blackmun, he would not have obtained any more money because the Virginia statue at that time --
speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="371.411" stopTime="374.282">
    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    Precisely, therefore why go to Virginia?
speaker="james_f_green" startTime="374.282" stopTime="382.911">
    Mr. James F. Green 
    That is why he came to D. C., sir, that was the election and he made it and came to the District of Columbia and brought his action and received the award which has not been honored.
speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="382.911" stopTime="393.282">
    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    It seems to me we are making a lot of fuss over nothing here. 
    You went to the District of Columbia because there was more money available. 
    He had wrung Virginia dry of all its funds under the statute.
speaker="james_f_green" startTime="393.282" stopTime="393.493">
    Mr. James F. Green 
    Not just the money --
speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="393.493" stopTime="395.730">
    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    Whether it is total or whether it is permanent.
speaker="james_f_green" startTime="395.730" stopTime="447.756">
    Mr. James F. Green 
    Correct, Mr. Justice Blackmun, not just the money but also the medical benefits. 
    In Virginia, the statutory scheme in 1971 allowed for a termination of medical care to an injured worker when the money ran out. 
    The District of Columbia has no such statutory policy. 
    Under section 907 of Title 33 of the U.S. Code, the man could obtain his benefits for medical care in the District of Columbia as long as he was still disabled from that industrial accident. 
    The petitioner would state that you do not have to reach a question of full faith and credit in order to determine this case, because the controversy involved does not bring the full faith and credit clause of the Constitution to bear on these issues. 
    What it does do is it suggests that this Court's holding in McCartin is correct, that the Virginia statute is not so exclusive as to preclude Thomas' claim in the District of Columbia.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="447.756" stopTime="453.475">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    What do you consider to be the holding as you described it in McCartin?
speaker="james_f_green" startTime="453.475" stopTime="481.235">
    Mr. James F. Green 
    Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I consider the holding to be that in a statutory scheme where a state allows for recovery by an injured worker having only limited demands prior common law right to sue his employer through that statutory scheme, he can bring an additional action in any state or any forum in which he desires to do so, allowing certain constitutional contacts that would give him the right to bring that claim.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="481.235" stopTime="484.947">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Isn't a good deal of what you have just said dicta rather than a holding?
speaker="james_f_green" startTime="484.947" stopTime="507.009">
    Mr. James F. Green 
    I don't believe that it is. 
    I believe that the Court repeated twice in McCartin, after discussing the reservation of the contractual right that they found that the Illinois statute or a statutory scheme similar to Illinois, like those, we would allow those statutory schemes to not be preclusive and to not be exclusive so that the man cannot bring additional claim for benefits.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="507.009" stopTime="517.841">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    But a court can write a ten-page opinion and say we hold that in every paragraph and that still doesn't make each paragraph a holding.
speaker="james_f_green" startTime="517.841" stopTime="592.044">
    Mr. James F. Green 
    I would agree with that, but I would urge that it is not dicta in McCartin, that it is the rule of McCartin and has been so interpreted. 
    Since this Court came with the McCartin decision, the progeny of McCartin are throughout this country and, as we have cited on brief, they are numerous. 
    They understand the Court to have said in that decision that unless a statutory scheme is exclusive, the man can bring an additional claim for relief in any forum in which he has a right to bring such a claim. 
    The aggregate of that claim is a set amount. 
    It cannot be more generous than the most generous forum. 
    That is what we would urge this Court to consider, that your announcement in McCartin controls this case, not Magnolia. 
    And because it does, the Virginia exclusive remedy provision is only exclusive as to a common law right to sue your employer and is exclusive for no other purpose. 
    And because it is not, a man has a right to bring a claim in multiple jurisdictions. 
    I would reserve the remainder of my time. 
   
   
   
   Argument of Alan I. Horowitz
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="592.044" stopTime="599.190">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Mr. Horowitz.
speaker="alan_i_horowitz" startTime="599.190" stopTime="633.147">
    Mr. Alan I. Horowitz 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court. 
    I would like to speak briefly about the point raised by Mr. Justice Blackmun about going back to Virginia for a permanent disability award. 
    As Mr. Justice Blackmun pointed out, the petitioner was not entitled to any further benefits under the Virginia statue. 
    It would just have been a question of whether they were called temporary or permanent. 
    But even under permanent disability, his benefits would have run out. 
    These are benefits that are not paid by Virginia. 
    They are paid by the employer, the respondent in this case.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="633.147" stopTime="653.764">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    So the fact is that he has gotten all that he could possibly get under the Virginia system and all that somebody who didn't have even a potential choice of going into another jurisdiction system, all that such a person could possibly get.
speaker="alan_i_horowitz" startTime="653.764" stopTime="654.313">
    Mr. Alan I. Horowitz 
    That's correct.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="654.313" stopTime="655.862">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    He has received, hasn't he?
speaker="alan_i_horowitz" startTime="655.862" stopTime="658.610">
    Mr. Alan I. Horowitz 
    Correct. 
    Virginia provides fewer benefits than the District of Columbia.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="658.610" stopTime="659.201">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Right.
speaker="alan_i_horowitz" startTime="659.201" stopTime="660.831">
    Mr. Alan I. Horowitz 
    Had he gone to the District of Columbia initially --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="660.831" stopTime="673.649">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    And if he had a Virginia employer and been injured in Virginia and had no connection with any other jurisdiction and had been totally and permanently disabled, this is all he could ever get under the Virginia system, isn't that correct?
speaker="alan_i_horowitz" startTime="673.649" stopTime="676.301">
    Mr. Alan I. Horowitz 
    That's right, under the statute as it was written at the time.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="676.301" stopTime="677.496">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    As it was then written.
speaker="alan_i_horowitz" startTime="677.496" stopTime="722.470">
    Mr. Alan I. Horowitz 
    That's correct. 
    Now, the question in this case is simply whether as a consequence of a Virginia Workmen's Compensation award the full faith and credit clause bars the District of Columbia from making an award to petitioner under its own worker's compensation statute. 
    Now, we believe that this Court has already answered the constitutional question presented here in the McCartin case, and that that decision compels reversal in this case. 
    McCartin held two things First, it held that a worker's compensation award in one state was not necessarily preclusive of a worker's compensation award in a second state that supplemented the first award, but that the preclusive effect depended upon the intent of the first state in granting its award.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="722.470" stopTime="727.256">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    That is wholly at odds with accepted full faith and credit doctrine, isn't it?
speaker="alan_i_horowitz" startTime="727.256" stopTime="728.682">
    Mr. Alan I. Horowitz 
    No, I don't believe it is.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="728.682" stopTime="737.985">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    It is not the intent, it is what effect the home state would give that judgment --
speaker="alan_i_horowitz" startTime="737.985" stopTime="738.235">
    Mr. Alan I. Horowitz 
    That's correct.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="738.235" stopTime="740.005">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    -- and the foreign state must give the same effect.
speaker="alan_i_horowitz" startTime="740.005" stopTime="743.668">
    Mr. Alan I. Horowitz 
    That's correct, but it does not have to give any greater effect. 
    Virginia did not intend to --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="743.668" stopTime="755.393">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    It has nothing to do with -- you wouldn't concede that the statement of the Court in McCartin was a little bit at odds with normally accepted full faith and credit?
speaker="alan_i_horowitz" startTime="755.393" stopTime="779.194">
    Mr. Alan I. Horowitz 
    I don't believe so. 
    If I understand what is troubling you, Mr. Justice Stewart, it is the question of whether we look at the preclusive effect of the Virginia award in Virginia or the preclusive effect of the Virginia award in the District of Columbia. 
    Is that accurate? 
    The District of Columbia only has to give the Virginia award the preclusive effect that Virginia would give it. Virginia --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="779.194" stopTime="782.955">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    It only has to give it that and under full faith and credit it must give it that.
speaker="alan_i_horowitz" startTime="782.955" stopTime="795.664">
    Mr. Alan I. Horowitz 
    That's quite correct. 
    Now, in this case there is a question of whether the Virginia award is intended by Virginia to preclude awards under the District of Columbia statute.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="795.664" stopTime="807.114">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Under ordinary full faith and credit doctrine, it is not that the law of Virginia says we want to make very clear that this must be given effect in other jurisdictions. 
    That has nothing to do with full faith and credit.
speaker="alan_i_horowitz" startTime="807.114" stopTime="814.120">
    Mr. Alan I. Horowitz 
    I agree, but the question is what does the Virginia award mean in Virginia.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="814.120" stopTime="815.299">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Precisely.
speaker="alan_i_horowitz" startTime="815.299" stopTime="824.861">
    Mr. Alan I. Horowitz 
    But in Virginia, the Virginia courts would not hear a claim under the District of Columbia statute, so there is no way to tell, there is not going to be any case law to tell --
speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="824.861" stopTime="835.782">
    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    Virginia courts would hear a petition for a permanent disability award. 
    It may not give him any more money, but they would hear the case, we were just told.
speaker="alan_i_horowitz" startTime="835.782" stopTime="844.535">
    Mr. Alan I. Horowitz 
    Well, I think for the purposes of this case we can treat it as if he had gotten his award in Virginia and it had been called a permanent disability award.
speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="844.535" stopTime="855.335">
    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    I would think you would want to treat it that way, but the fact is he was given a temporary permanent disability award and Virginia did not bar his seeking a permanent disability award.
speaker="alan_i_horowitz" startTime="855.335" stopTime="857.489">
    Mr. Alan I. Horowitz 
    Well, suppose he had gone to Virginia and gotten a permanent disability award --
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="857.489" stopTime="862.630">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well, the Fourth Circuit certainly knows more about Virginia law than we do.
speaker="alan_i_horowitz" startTime="862.630" stopTime="891.594">
    Mr. Alan I. Horowitz 
    Well, first of all, on the question of Virginia law, there is a dispute. 
    The Fourth Circuit did not hold that under McCartin the Virginia statute possessed the unmistakable language referred to in McCartin and that it thereby barred second awards. 
    What we contend is that the Fourth Circuit misinterpreted McCartin. 
    The Fourth Circuit's opinion in Pettus does not deal with McCartin in much detail but simply says that McCartin had no effect whatsoever on Magnolia.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="891.594" stopTime="894.956">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    And for what it is worth, the Fourth Circuit was divided in Pettus.
speaker="alan_i_horowitz" startTime="894.956" stopTime="916.148">
    Mr. Alan I. Horowitz 
    That's true, the Fourth Circuit was divided on Pettus. 
    Moreover, another panel of the Fourth Circuit has stated in a case that is distinguishable on its facts that the intent of the Virginia statute is not to preclude a District of Columbia award. 
    Moreover, the D.C. Circuit has also held that the Virginia statute does not have thus effect, explicitly rejecting the decision in Pettus.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="916.148" stopTime="929.368">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    If we have to choose between the Fourth Circuit's interpretation of Virginia law and the D.C. Circuit's interpretation of Virginia law, ordinarily we would defer to the Fourth Circuit rather than the D.C. Circuit, wouldn't we?
speaker="alan_i_horowitz" startTime="929.368" stopTime="964.226">
    Mr. Alan I. Horowitz 
    I don't think the Court has to defer to the Fourth Circuit because the Court specified in McCartin what the rule of construction was for interpreting these worker's compensation statutes when they don't specifically address the question of an award under another state's statute, and that rule of construction is that the state must specify by unmistakable language that it intends to bar such an award. 
    Now, the Fourth Circuit did not consider that. 
    The Fourth Circuit did not deal with McCartin's injunction on that point. 
    The Fourth Circuit simply said that McCartin has no application here.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="964.226" stopTime="976.371">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    But we have three judges sitting down in Richmond who are presumably familiar with the cases they are talking about, they talk about McCartin and they say McCartin does not control this case.
speaker="alan_i_horowitz" startTime="976.371" stopTime="977.781">
    Mr. Alan I. Horowitz 
    Right, and I think --
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="977.781" stopTime="989.485">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    They may be wrong, but if you are saying that they misinterpreted Virginia law, I think you are leading on a rather weak reed.
speaker="alan_i_horowitz" startTime="989.485" stopTime="992.887">
    Mr. Alan I. Horowitz 
    I am saying that they misinterpreted McCartin.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="992.887" stopTime="1000.286">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well, that may be another question, but they didn't understand what McCartin told them they had to find in order to do what they did.
speaker="alan_i_horowitz" startTime="1000.286" stopTime="1017.098">
    Mr. Alan I. Horowitz 
    That's right, and so they did not interpret -- they made no attempt to interpret the Virginia statute in line as prescribed by this Court in McCartin. 
    So I don't think that the decision in Pettus as far as the interpretation of Virginia law is entitled to much deference by this Court.
speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="1017.098" stopTime="1026.113">
    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    Mr. Horowitz, something slipped my mind here. 
    Why did this case go to the Fourth Circuit rather than the District of Columbia courts?
speaker="alan_i_horowitz" startTime="1026.113" stopTime="1133.188">
    Mr. Alan I. Horowitz 
    Well, there is a provision in the Longshoremen's Act that appeal should be to the circuit where the injury occurred. 
    There is some dispute over exactly what that means, whether it means the District of Columbia Circuit or to interpret it literally, where the injury occurred, but that was not disputed in this case. 
    Again, McCartin sets out a rule of construction that the Virginia statute must state in unmistakable language that it intends to preclude the District of Columbia award. 
    Now, the Virginia statute here contains no unmistakable language. 
    Indeed, it is very similar to the statute that was construed by this Court in McCartin, the Illinois statute. 
    Moreover, to the extent that the Virginia statute gives us any suggestion at all about its views on supplemental awards, we understand that Virginia permits supplemental awards in its own courts. 
    That is, if the petitioner here had gone to the District of Columbia first and gotten an award that was less than what he was entitled to in Virginia, it is clear from the Virginia statute that he could have gone to Virginia and supplemented that award up to the benefits that Virginia allows under its statute. 
    So what respondent is asking for is an extremely arrogant interpretation of the Virginia statute and that is that Virginia expects other states to honor the limitations that Virginia puts on its awards, but Virginia will not honor such limitations by other states, and that Virginia expects other states to permit Virginia to give supplemental awards, yet Virginia will not permit other states to give their supplemental awards.
speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="1133.188" stopTime="1142.921">
    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    What you are saying by that is that there is no interest of the Commonwealth of Virginia that is really implicated here.
speaker="alan_i_horowitz" startTime="1142.921" stopTime="1161.792">
    Mr. Alan I. Horowitz 
    Well, to the extent that there is an interest -- it is conceivable that Virginia might have decided that it was better not to have supplemental awards, that they prefer the limitations, but to the extent that they have expressed themselves on that, they have shown that their interest is in providing supplemental awards, that is that the stronger interest is to compensate the injured employees.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1161.792" stopTime="1172.724">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    But if Virginia is not concerned about awards elsewhere, one would think that it isn't concerned about its own allocation of awards.
speaker="alan_i_horowitz" startTime="1172.724" stopTime="1176.316">
    Mr. Alan I. Horowitz 
    That's correct, that it just would not want to restrict it. 
    That's correct.

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Does Virginia have any economic interest or any other kind of interest in being concerned about how much money someone else pays out?
speaker="alan_i_horowitz" startTime="1184.270" stopTime="1187.900">
    Mr. Alan I. Horowitz 
    It certainly has no direct economic interest. 
    To the extent that --

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Whatever some other state -- whatever is achieved in some other state relieves any tension or pressure for Virginia to expand its awards, is that not so?
speaker="alan_i_horowitz" startTime="1198.212" stopTime="1201.238">
    Mr. Alan I. Horowitz 
    That's correct, in a case where there is jurisdiction of both states.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1201.238" stopTime="1209.886">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    But that 90 percent or more of the industrial accidents in Virginia, an injured person wouldn't have a choice of two jurisdictions. 
    Isn't that your guess?
speaker="alan_i_horowitz" startTime="1209.886" stopTime="1239.881">
    Mr. Alan I. Horowitz 
    That's correct. 
    Now, to the extent that Virginia might have an interest and somehow having a limitation where there is jurisdiction in two states, which is what the respondent is suggesting, that is an interest that they cannot vindicate unless the injured employee makes a mistake in the first instance and goes to Virginia. 
    I mean there is no dispute in this case that petitioner could have gone directly to the District of Columbia and gotten all the benefits that he is entitled to under the District of Columbia act.

    That's right, in fact he went to Virginia.

    He didn't -- it is true that he went to Virginia.

    What provision of the Constitution is involved?
speaker="alan_i_horowitz" startTime="1545.621" stopTime="1560.616">
    Mr. Alan I. Horowitz 
    Well, there was a question prior to McCartin as to whether the full faith and credit clause would bar this award simply because an award was made in Virginia and Virginia has a general exclusivity provision that makes that award exclusive.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1560.616" stopTime="1564.762">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Is the District of Columbia a state within the meaning of the full faith and credit clause?
speaker="alan_i_horowitz" startTime="1564.762" stopTime="1567.847">
    Mr. Alan I. Horowitz 
    Well, I think for these purposes it would be.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1567.847" stopTime="1577.023">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Has that ever been held? 
    I was just wondering if it is a statutory question rather than a constitutional question. 
    It is a statutory question identical to --
speaker="alan_i_horowitz" startTime="1577.023" stopTime="1586.591">
    Mr. Alan I. Horowitz 
    Well, the full faith and credit clause ties both the Constitution implementing statute to the full faith and credit clause, and they are practically coextensive.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1586.591" stopTime="1595.349">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    But if it is not a constitutional question, we may not have the problem Mr. Justice White suggests of needing to address some other statutory question before this statutory question.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="1595.349" stopTime="1601.803">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    It is like a 1983 case, a purely statutory claim but reads right on the Constitution.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1601.803" stopTime="1605.327">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    That's right, but this one does not read on the Constitution and that is why you needed the statute.
speaker="alan_i_horowitz" startTime="1605.327" stopTime="1616.899">
    Mr. Alan I. Horowitz 
    Well, the main issue in this case is also simply a statutory question and that is what does the Virginia statute say. 
    It is only if the Court is going to reconsider McCartin that it has to worry about the constitutional question.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="1616.899" stopTime="1640.800">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    But you also suggest in your brief that we might reconsider both Magnolia and McCartin to the extent of being persuaded that the full faith and credit clause of the Constitution and its supplementary statute have nothing to do with workmen's compensation awards or that workmen's compensation awards are an exception.
speaker="alan_i_horowitz" startTime="1640.800" stopTime="1649.673">
    Mr. Alan I. Horowitz 
    Well, I certainly don't think the Court has to reconsider Magnolia in this case. 
    Whether it is possible in another case that --

speaker="alan_i_horowitz" startTime="1652.845" stopTime="1667.778">
    Mr. Alan I. Horowitz 
    Well, we suggested that other -- we were trying to have the Court not step back from the McCartin rationale and in support of that we have noted that some commentators have suggested that even Magnolia was wrong and that is not really an issue in this case.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="1667.778" stopTime="1676.791">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Exactly, and that the full faith and credit clause of the Constitution or its equivalent statute are simply inapplicable to workmen's compensation actions.
speaker="alan_i_horowitz" startTime="1676.791" stopTime="1679.043">
    Mr. Alan I. Horowitz

    Exactly.
speaker="alan_i_horowitz" startTime="1679.593" stopTime="1682.573">
    Mr. Alan I. Horowitz 
    -- that the state never considers the --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="1682.573" stopTime="1689.324">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    And that would require reexamination of both Magnolia and McCartin, at least as to their underlying premises.
speaker="alan_i_horowitz" startTime="1689.324" stopTime="1692.160">
    Mr. Alan I. Horowitz 
    Yes, if you were to reach that argument, but there is no need to do so.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="1692.160" stopTime="1693.488">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Then why did you put it in your brief?
speaker="alan_i_horowitz" startTime="1693.488" stopTime="1705.778">
    Mr. Alan I. Horowitz 
    Because I thought it was supportive of the notion that McCartin was correct. 
    McCartin sets up a rule of construction that permits the Magnolia result only when the state has made it quite it quite explicit.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1705.778" stopTime="1715.722">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Which is quite contrary, as I suggested at the outset in my question, from ordinarily accepted doctrine under the full faith and credit clause.
speaker="alan_i_horowitz" startTime="1715.722" stopTime="1716.107">
    Mr. Alan I. Horowitz 
    Except that --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1716.107" stopTime="1722.267">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    It is the duty of a foreign jurisdiction to give precisely the same effect as the local jurisdiction would give to that judgment.
speaker="alan_i_horowitz" startTime="1722.267" stopTime="1723.200">
    Mr. Alan I. Horowitz 
    That's right, and so the question of --

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Regardless of what the legislature might have said.
speaker="alan_i_horowitz" startTime="1726.289" stopTime="1730.240">
    Mr. Alan I. Horowitz 
    And so the question is whether the Virginia award would preclude the D.C. award.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1730.240" stopTime="1730.414">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    That's the question.
speaker="alan_i_horowitz" startTime="1730.414" stopTime="1736.484">
    Mr. Alan I. Horowitz 
    And because Virginia never considers D.C. awards, you can't tell that from what happens in Virginia.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1736.484" stopTime="1792.145">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    May I ask a question. 
    I have before me section 65.1-40 of the Virginia Code and I will read this language and then ask you a question. 
    I have it at page 4a I think of respondents' brief, in the appendix in the back of the brief "The rights and remedies herein granted to an employee... shall exclude all other rights and remedies of such employee...at common law or otherwise..." 
    Now, you rely on the McCartin case as holding that a state statute must explicitly exclude all other remedies. 
    What Language would you suggest to meet your own standard beyond what is presently in the Virginia law?
speaker="alan_i_horowitz" startTime="1792.145" stopTime="1800.119">
    Mr. Alan I. Horowitz 
    Well, the provision that is in the Virginia law is practically identical to the provision that was in the Illinois law that was considered in McCartin.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1800.119" stopTime="1810.159">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    The Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit said, if I recall, in Pettus that it was practically identical with the statute before the Court in Magnolia.
speaker="alan_i_horowitz" startTime="1810.159" stopTime="1826.852">
    Mr. Alan I. Horowitz 
    That's correct, although the Magnolia case had the extra feature which the Court specifically relied on, that the state of Texas did not permit its own courts to give supplemental awards, whereas here Virginia does permit its courts to give supplemental awards.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1826.852" stopTime="1829.066">

    Mr. Alan I. Horowitz 
    No, because that was under the worker's compensation statute. 
    What this language does is bar other remedies other than worker's compensation, and the question is does that bar other remedies other than the Virginia worker's compensation or does it not bar remedies under another state's workers compensation.
speaker="lewis_f_powell_jr" startTime="1913.006" stopTime="1917.055">

    That is pretty broad language.

    Mr. Alan I. Horowitz 
    That is what it states. 
    Now, I would point out that this language bars other remedies even before there is an award. 
    What this does is it forces the employee to go within the worker's compensation system. 
    He can't sue in tort. 
    He can't bring any other remedy. 
    It really has nothing to do with effect of the Virginia award. 
    Now, it is not intended, because it is clear that Virginia would not have the power to prevent the employee from going to D.C. initially and getting an award, yet theoretically this language would also prevent that. 
    So I do think it is clear that this language is not specifically aimed at an award under another state's statute and that is what McCartin --

   Argument of Kevin Jeffrey Baldwin
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="2053.136" stopTime="2054.777">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Mr. Baldwin.
speaker="kevin_jeffrey_baldwin" startTime="2054.777" stopTime="2209.557">
    Mr. Kevin Jeffrey Baldwin 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and if it please the Court. 
    The court below could have and should have dismissed this case on the non-constitutional grounds that the District of Columbia did not have jurisdiction in this case and independent of that the claim was untimely filed. 
    We Have learned that Mr. Thomas was employed by the gas company out of our Springfield, Virginia offices. 
    He was injured in Arlington, Virginia in January of '71. 
    In February, the parties executed a memorandum agreement, they submitted it to the Virginia Industrial Commission. 
    A month and a half later the commission comes down with an award. 
    Two years later he retains counsel and three and a half years later a claim is maid in the District of Columbia. 
    In regard to jurisdiction, in 1928, Congress incorporated the Federal Longshoremen's Act in toto as the District of Columbia Workmen's Compensation Act. 
    The act provides coverage for jurisdiction for injuries on navigable waters and if compensation cannot be validly had in a state. 
    Another provision provides that coverage is available irrespective of the place of injury. 
    This provision can be read and harmonized with the federal coverage to read that coverage is afforded irrespective of the place of injury and if compensation cannot validly be had in the state. 
    Thomas was injured in Virginia, he received and validly received compensation from Virginia. 
    Congressional hearings tell us that the D.C. act was to fill a void. 
    There was no recovery for D.C. employees working for D.C. employers who were injured on the job in the District of Columbia. 
    If they were injured outside the District of Columbia, they were covered by state compensation laws. 
    Congress filled this void with a mutually exclusive federal act. 
    It was a very restrictive act and it clearly intended to give the employees of the District of Columbia one remedy, not as suggested by our opponents, two remedies. 
    In regard to timeliness --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2209.557" stopTime="2214.043">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    That isn't the usual rule under the Longshoremen's Act though, is it?
speaker="kevin_jeffrey_baldwin" startTime="2214.043" stopTime="2257.314">
    Mr. Kevin Jeffrey Baldwin 
    Your Honor, in 1928 the Longshoremen's Act came after a rather hard line of cases, the Jensen case and then back up to 1942 where this Court, speaking through Justice Black, described these early cases as employees being caught in a twilight zone, that is pursuing a state remedy and then being unable to recover under a one-year statute. 
    Also in this time era the cases were thought to be maritime national versus maritime local.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2257.314" stopTime="2265.273">
    Justice Potter Stewart

    Mr. Kevin Jeffrey Baldwin 
    By overlap do you mean today or do you mean when this accident happened?

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well, when it happened.
speaker="kevin_jeffrey_baldwin" startTime="2272.400" stopTime="2274.430">
    Mr. Kevin Jeffrey Baldwin 
    I would say that --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2274.430" stopTime="2285.893">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Your argument is that getting a recovery under state law precluded a recovery under the Longshoremen's Act.
speaker="kevin_jeffrey_baldwin" startTime="2285.893" stopTime="2318.184">
    Mr. Kevin Jeffrey Baldwin 
    There is no overlap in this case, Your Honor. 
    There is not -- this Court, decided in 1969 the Nacirema case where an employee fell off a ship onto a pier and it refused to extend the jurisdiction to the really doesn't apply because Mr. Thomas was injured in Arlington, Virginia, and the overlap question doesn't pertain to this case.
speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="2318.184" stopTime="2322.711">
    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    Well, was this question presented to the Court of Appeals?
speaker="kevin_jeffrey_baldwin" startTime="2322.711" stopTime="2326.125">
    Mr. Kevin Jeffrey Baldwin 
    Yes, it was in brief, Your Honor. 
    The Court --
speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="2326.125" stopTime="2327.421">
    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    And they didn't decide it?
speaker="kevin_jeffrey_baldwin" startTime="2327.421" stopTime="2472.038">
    Mr. Kevin Jeffrey Baldwin 
    They did not decide it. 
    In regard to timeliness, Your Honor, the employee has a year to file, and ten years later, in 1938, Congress enacted a different provision that said time is not going to run against the employee until the employer also files, but the purpose of this enactment was to prevent employer overreaching, which is certainly not an issue in this case. 
    It also provided the employee his one remedy, that if he were to pursue compensation in a state or any other jurisdiction and not get it, he would still have it in the District of Columbia. 
    For either reason, this Court -- that is, for either one of these reasons, this case should be dismissed and should be dismissed. 
    With regard to the federal question, if there were no Constitution, if there were no Magnolia case, if there were no McCartin case, the result reached below would still be correct for reasons dating back to Roman law where it is said no one ought twice be sued for the same cause of action, plus it is in the interest of the state that there shall be at end to litigation. 
    But there is a Constitution, and Article 4 says that full faith and credit shall be given in each state to the public acts and records and judicial proceedings of every other state. 
    In the act of Congress implementing, it says that such proceedings shall have the same full faith and credit in every court within the United States as they have by law and by usage in the courts of such states from which they are taken. 
    In effect, this is a litigant's bill of rights. 
    It brings an end to litigation. 
    We have this Court in Magnolia telling us the clear purpose of the full faith and credit clause establishes throughout the federal system a salutory principle of common law. 
    A litigation once pursued to a judgment shall be conclusive for the rights of the parties and --
speaker="lewis_f_powell_jr" startTime="2472.038" stopTime="2478.393">

    Mr. Kevin Jeffrey Baldwin 
    It is involved, Your Honor, because we have in this --
speaker="lewis_f_powell_jr" startTime="2485.198" stopTime="2487.589">
    Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. 
    But the --
speaker="kevin_jeffrey_baldwin" startTime="2487.589" stopTime="2502.832">
    Mr. Kevin Jeffrey Baldwin 
    -- we have the Constitution, we have an act implementing it, and that is the act of Congress gives the effect of a judgment in one state the some effect in every other state.
speaker="lewis_f_powell_jr" startTime="2502.832" stopTime="2504.362">
    Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. 
    Like the District of Columbia?
speaker="kevin_jeffrey_baldwin" startTime="2504.362" stopTime="2554.203">
    Mr. Kevin Jeffrey Baldwin 
    That is correct, Your Honor, so the rights that are -- when the parties have their rights concluded, the cause of action is merged in the first state and it is merged in every other state. 
    We have this Court saying again in Magnolia that a workmen's compensation award that has been final is entitled to full faith and credit in a court. 
    From the above, we learn that no state has the power to legislate beyond its borders. 
    No state can bind within its borders and unbind outside and thus no state can give or intend to give an award or judgment within its borders one effect and a different effect outside. 
    The state does not have any power to do so.

speaker="kevin_jeffrey_baldwin" startTime="2568.881" stopTime="2622.475">
    Mr. Kevin Jeffrey Baldwin 
    I am familiar with both cases, your Honor. 
    One more principle is that the full faith and credit clause of the Constitution is what gives extra-territorial effect, by giving an award or judgment in a rendering state the same effect in every other state. 
    The problem in this case is what effect is to be accorded a workmen's compensation award in Virginia by the full faith and credit clause. 
    We are shown in Dillard v. Virginia Industrial Commission, a 1974 case before this Court, what effect an award in Virginia has. 
    It concludes the rights of the parties. 
    It binds the parties and it binds the courts in Virginia. 
    Virginia accords a workmen's compensation award the same status as that of a judgment.
speaker="lewis_f_powell_jr" startTime="2622.475" stopTime="2631.634">

speaker="kevin_jeffrey_baldwin" startTime="2731.881" stopTime="2834.232">
    Mr. Kevin Jeffrey Baldwin 
    Yes, Your Honor. 
    I would like to get into a discussion of McCartin, what is good about its, what is right about it, what is constitutional, but I would say that although we don't recommend, I can't tell you to go into looking at the extraterritorial effect of the state legislature of the state statute where it has no power. 
    I cannot lead you that way. 
    What I can tell you is that the Pettus review -- Pettus v. American Airlines -- reviewed Magnolia and it reviewed McCartin. 
    It reviewed the statute and the Fourth Circuit interpreted the Virginia statute to be exclusive. 
    This Court, in Butner v. United States in 1979, and Bishop v. Wood, said it gives great deference to the Fourth Circuit in interpreting state laws. 
    The state laws in those two cases were North Carolina. 
    The two judges that decided the Pettus case are not only Virginia lawyers but they were educated, they received their legal education in Virginia. 
    On that ground alone, the Fourth Circuit should be upheld. 
    But in Virginia, by law and by usage, Virginia treats a workmen's compensation award exactly the same as it does a judgment, and by law and by usage in Virginia a judgment is res judicata unless timely appealed. 
    It was never appealed. 
    If Virginia wanted to make an award something less than a judgment, it could easily do so, but it did not.

    I am not interpreting the act, Your Honor.

    You don't agree that they are similar?

    Mr. Kevin Jeffrey Baldwin 
    I would take the position of the court in the Fourth Circuit that if they think that the Virginia act is more similar to the Texas act, fine, but it is a matter of degree, Your Honor. 
    I cannot draw the line for you. 
    In McCartin, the Court said if it were apparent that an Illinois award was intended to be final and conclusive of all the rights of the employee against the employer, then Magnolia would control. 
    Beyond its decisive facts, the Magnolia court looked at three things. 
    It looked at the award, its nature and effect, statutory construction and legislative intent, and cases to interpret it. 
    What are the decisive facts in McCartin? 
    The decisive facts show that there are two simultaneous proceedings going on, one in Illinois and one in Wisconsin. 
    Wisconsin was studied while awaiting a lump-sum agreement without prejudice to be approved in Illinois. 
    What did Illinois do? 
    Illinois agreed with this arrangement through one of its commissioners, Mr. Granada, who had apparent authority to approve the express intent of the parties. 
    The nature of the award was that it was expressly without prejudice to proceed to Wisconsin. 
    The effect of the award was that it was not final, it was expressly not final, and so the court in Illinois could not bind the parties. 
    I should note that an agreement of this type comes within the exception of res judicata from the restatement of judgments. 
    At this point, had the McCartin court given the Illinois award its expressly intended effect, the result would have been the same. 
    But the Court went further. 
    It went into the extraterritorial legislative intent, it found no cases on point, which is not surprising, and it read the statute as non-exclusive to the extent that the McCartin court turned its opinion on the state legislature's intent not to bind a party extraterritorially. 
    We disagree. 
    No state policy can be greater than that of the Constitution. 
    And so it is we believe a strange concept that would permit the Constitution of this country to turn on a state legislature's extraterritorial intent. 
    Such intent is constitutionally meaningless. 
    The department and Mr. Thomas in their brief and in their reply briefs imply or wish that a state cannot bind a workmen's compensation case. 
    There would be no finality at all. 
    Or alternatively, workmen's compensation cases should be taken out of the full faith and credit clause. 
    If that is so, then the same arguments can be made for any other common law judgment. 
    All of these arguments -- and there is not one argument before the Court --

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    You say "any other common law judgment," this is not a common law judgment, is it? 
    It is a workmen's compensation award.
speaker="kevin_jeffrey_baldwin" startTime="3147.355" stopTime="3149.051">
    Mr. Kevin Jeffrey Baldwin 
    It has the same effect as a common law judgment.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3149.051" stopTime="3151.185">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    But it precludes common law remedies.
speaker="kevin_jeffrey_baldwin" startTime="3151.185" stopTime="3198.375">
    Mr. Kevin Jeffrey Baldwin 
    That's right, and what I am talking about is the arguments that have been made in tax cases, the wrongful death cases, the gambling cases, bigamy, child support, Winds v. North Carolina, a long line of hard decisions. 
    And Magnolia said that we cannot say that a workmen's compensation award would not stand on any different footing. 
    What I am saying is that every argument, every social policy argument that you have heard today has been expressly rejected by this Court. 
    Thank you, Your Honor.

    Very well. 
    I think all the time is consumed. 
    Thank you, gentlemen. 
    The case is submitted.
