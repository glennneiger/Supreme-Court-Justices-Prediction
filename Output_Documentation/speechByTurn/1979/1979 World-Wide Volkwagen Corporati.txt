    Justice Byron R. White 
    This case is here on writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Oklahoma. 
    Petitioners are a New York wholesaler and retailer of automobiles and they do business only in the State of New York. 
    One of their cars which was sold to a New York resident was later involved in accident in the State of Oklahoma. 
    The injured owner brought this product liability suit claiming that the car was structurally deficient. 
    Among the defendants were these petitioners who had no contacts with the State of Oklahoma other than the fact that one of the cars they had handled was involved in an accident in that state. 
    The issue is whether the petitioners are subject to the jurisdiction of the Oklahoma courts. Contrary to the judgment of the Oklahoma Supreme Court, we hold that they are not. 
    The contacts the petitioners had with that state are not sufficient under the Due Process Clause to sustain a jurisdiction. 
    We accordingly reverse the judgment of the Oklahoma Supreme Court. 
    Justices Brennan, Marshall and Blackmun have each filed a dissenting opinions and Mr. Justice Blackmun has also joined the opinion of Mr. Justice Marshall.
