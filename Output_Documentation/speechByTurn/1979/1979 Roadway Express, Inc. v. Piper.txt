    Mr. Miles Curtiss McKee 
    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice and may it please it Court. 
    This case is before the Court on a writ of certiorari to the Fifth Circuit Court on appeal. 
    The issue is whether attorneys who multiplied proceedings in an action under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and 42 U.S.C. 1981 and thereby unreasonably and vexatiously increased the cost, maybe personally assessed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 1927, with attorney's fees as part of the excess cost incurred by an opposing party as a result of such conduct. 
    The case originated in the Western District of Louisiana where it was dismissed without prejudice by reason of the failure of the plaintiffs to answer the defendant's interrogatories and ordered by the Court, the failure of the plaintiff to produce one of the plaintiffs for deposition, the general failure to prosecute the suit and ultimately, the plaintiffs' abandonment of their claim. 
    The Court after the dismissal and after an evidentiary hearing on the matter of the assessment of cost at which the lawyers for the plaintiffs were represented by their malpractice carrier, the Court awarded fees as cost pursuant to 1927 and under the terms and provisions of Title VII and Section 1988. 
    It allowed attorney's fees as part of the cost. 
    And in the case of Hutto versus Finney decided by this Court in 1978, that taxable cost were equated with attorney's fees under 42 U.S.C. 1988. 
    Our argument to the Court is plain and simple because we're allowed the plain meaning of the statutes. 
    And where the plain meaning of the statutes is -- is present, there is no construction necessary. 
    The Fifth Circuit Court said that you could not combine these statutes, 42 U.S.C. 1988 and Title VII and 1927 on the other hand, that you could not compel them to achieve what the Fifth Circuit called a hybrid result. 
    The Court of Appeals did this without any explanation, without any discussion of the in pari materia relationship of these statutes and without explaining away the plain language of the statute and without pointing to any absurd, futile or unreasonable result. 
    So where are cost defined for a determination under Section 1927? 
    It must rely on other statutes for its definition. 
    And upon which statutes may it rely? 
    The United States and the respondents say that it may rely on only two statutes and that's 28 U.S.C. 1920 and 1923. 
    They admit that Section 1927 must resort mechanically to other statutes for its definition, but they draw a barrier at the resort to Title VII and Section 1988. 
    The respondent in the amici government don't demonstrate any statutory or other limitation on Section 1927's access to Title VII and Section 1988 for the definition of cost. 
    There is nothing in any statute to prohibit this access to these statutes for cost. 
    And neither the respondent, nor the United States or any of the amici in this case assailed the bare language of the statute. 
    Their efforts are devoted to unsubstantiated, unsupported speculation and postulation on which they offer no cases and no authority.

    Mr. Miles Curtiss McKee 
    Yes. 
    1920 -- Section 1927 must derive its cost definition from some other statutes. 
    Everybody agrees on that. 
    Everybody agrees that you must go to 1920 and 1923 to get anything at all, that you're going to pop in a 1927 to make it make any sense. 
    But Title VII and Section 1988 are also cost-defining statutes. 
    And there are at least -- other than those two, there are least 34 others. 
    There's nothing about the language of any of those statutes that prohibits their application to Section 1927. 
    There is nothing that would prevent 1927 cost from including attorney's fees at -- dictated by these statutes. 
    We also maintain before the Court that the bad faith exception to the American rule supports this award. 
    The same shifting process is available. 
    The client is responsible under the Wabash or Link and Wabash doctrine. 
    And Section 1927 would shift such an award to the lawyer given the proper finding. 
    Our position before the Court on the policy aspects of it is -- is that the policy of all of these statutes are and meritorious suits will be expeditiously conducted by competent counsels of impeccable integrity strictly on the issues and nothing that we suggest is alien to that policy, whatever. 
    If the Court please, with our argument relying upon the plain meaning of the statute such as it is, we would reserve the balance of our time if there are no questions for rebuttal.

    Mr. Miles Curtiss McKee 
    Your Honor, he allowed them in total. 
    There were some adjustments made to them, but it's -- as a practical matter, he allowed them in total because he considered that the suit was improvidently brought from the very beginning and that it was the responsibility of these lawyers.

    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    Let me first make it clear that our argument does not intend to take the position as continued somewhat by the reply brief filed by Roadway that lawyers are immune from -- or -- or so have some form of immunity from the Court's sanctioning those lawyers. 
    I think that's -- that there are -- there's adequate legislation to allow the imposition of sanction on lawyers. 
    In fact in this case, Rule 37 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure was available. 
    In fact, that's how this whole attorney's fee business got started. 
    A motion was filed by counsel for Roadway to assess attorney's fees under Rule 37 for failure to answer interrogatories and for failure to appear in the deposition. 
    The thing moved a long way from there to an awarding by District Court of $17,000.

    Mr. Herschel E. Richard, Jr. 
    Well, in -- in the Piggie Park case, the awarding of attorney's fees was not to punish the defendant, but -- but it was the furtherance of the federal -- the -- the purpose of the statute to eliminate discrimination.

    Well, I don't think that the -- the idea of -- of the so -- the attorney's fees provisions if you get a look at the legislative history of -- of this -- of the provisions to allow attorney's fees was to punish the lawyers, but rather to encourage the -- the attorneys to take the source of cases that need to be handled.

    The -- the statute clearly provides the award of attorney's fees under 2000e-5 (k) in the -- and the -- the provision being interpreted in Piggie Park. 
    But the purpose, I mean the -- the reason that -- that the -- that the Fifth Circuit felt the -- the reference to the Fleischmann case was -- was important was that the language of 1927 is certainly not plain and -- and unmistakable because it just says cost and it sure doesn't say attorney's fees. 
    And the purpose of -- of any -- of the strict construction rule is to ensure that for one thing that the lawyer in this case and this -- under 1927, knows what's coming. 
    He -- he -- when he just reads cost, he sure doesn't -- he -- he would -- he would think that's cost.

    Mr. Herschel E. Richard, Jr. 
    The conduct of the lawyers.

    That -- that's -- that's the problem, Your Honors, with -- with the argument being made by Roadway in this case. 
    They -- they say on page 17 of their brief and I think this is basic to the -- is basically their problem with their rationale. 
    The authority of the basic award of attorney's fees in this case is not Section 1927. 
    You've got to get attorney's fees out of 2000e-5 (k) and 1988 as interpreted by Christiansburg before you can hop over to 1927. 
    And the facts in this case don't support that. 
    And -- and I don't think the -- the legislative history of the -- of the -- of 2000e-5 (k) or 1988 support nobody. 
    I don't think --

    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    But that wasn't the reasoning of the Court the Appeals, was it?

    They said you can never award the -- the attorney's fees.
speaker="herschel_e_richard_jr" startTime="1364.934" stopTime="1443.123">
    Mr. Herschel E. Richard, Jr. 
    They said you can -- that the -- the issue was not fully -- not considered at all in the Court of Appeals like it has been briefed here in -- in this Court, Your Honor. 
    And the -- the -- as I was saying, the legislative history and of it -- of the civil rights and statutes providing attorney's fees and particularly when you look at 1927 and the history of that statute as the -- the statute was discussed by this Court in the Alyeska case and -- and in that decision as -- it's clear that 19 -- well, it's -- it's just the -- those -- the legislation is clear that it was enacted at the same time that section -- or what has become Section 1920 and Section 1923 all of which deal with the definition of cost and what they call a docket fees or proctor's fees can be awarded. 
    And that is the limitation. 
    Congress has -- as this Court has said in -- in Alyeska, Congress has, with regard to the question of attorney's fees, has gotten into the act.

speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="1443.123" stopTime="1488.572">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    But what -- let me go back. 
    Suppose -- suppose there had been an award of -- of attorney's fees against the plaintiff in this case as a party on the -- on the grounds -- suppose the plaintiff had made a -- or the defendant, suppose the defendant had a motion for attorney's fees on the grounds that this had been a frivolous litigation and said -- said, “We are the prevailing party. 
    This is a proper case for an award of attorney's fees.” 
    And suppose the District Judge said, “You're quite right. 
    You are entitled to attorney's fees, but I'll tell you what I'm going to do. 
    I think it'd be unfair to make the plaintiff pay them. 
    I think -- well, I'll make his lawyer pay him because he's the one who brought this frivolous case and needlessly ran the bill up.

    Ms. Harriet S. Shapiro 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    My function here today is to emphasize the Government's disagreement with petitioner's reading of Section 1927 which singles out lawyers litigating cases under federal statutes that provide for the recovery of attorney's fees. 
    And my basic point is that these attorney fee statutes provide for recovery against the opposing party. 
    It distorts their purpose to read them as also approving of recovery against counsel for that party. 
    The attorney fee provisions in the Civil Rights Act are typical of those in many other federal statutes. 
    They serve two related purposes. 
    The first purpose is to encourage private parties to enforce important federal policies. 
    That's the Private Attorney General principle. 
    The cost of hiring counsel is likely to be a serious problem to victims of employment discrimination. 
    But that problem is less serious if successful plaintiffs can recover their counsel fees. 
    That means that the case -- the litigation will essentially pay for itself. 
    The -- that makes it attractive from the point of view of lawyers and the Congress recognized that in civil rights cases, it's a problem finding lawyers that were willing to take these cases. 
    But if counsel fee -- fees can be paid from -- by the -- by the -- can be recovered by the prevailing party, then the lawyers are more likely to be interested in taking the cases. 
    They'd become attractive cases. 
    But if litigating these cases imposes a special risk that's not part of the normal risks of litigating cases in any event, then the cases are unattractive to the lawyers. 
    That makes it harder for the victims --

speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="2138.585" stopTime="2178.934">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Ms. Shapiro, we're dealing with exceptional cases to start with, because most lawyers don't misbehave and give rise to claims of this kind. 
    And I think we have to start with the assumption, the lawyers did something the lawyers do not normally do. 
    And if you have a case in which a plaintiff perhaps named as a class representative or something is relatively unsophisticated and the lawyer persuades the plaintiff to file a totally meritorious -- meritless claim and makes a lot of trouble for the other side and runs up the kind of situation where normally a district judge would say, “The plaintiff ought to be charged with cost.” 
    Your position really is that they shouldn't recover from anybody because he is the one that stick the innocent plaintiff with him and so you're saying nobody should have to pay.
speaker="harriet_s_shapiro" startTime="2178.934" stopTime="2286.539">
    Ms. Harriet S. Shapiro 
    Well, I think the Court really faced that problem in Christiansburg, because in Christiansburg you made it fairly clear that you -- you were not saying that only the bad faith plaintiff was -- could -- could expect to have counsel's -- I mean, attorney's fees recovered against him. 
    That -- the -- the -- it -- it was also the frivolous case regardless of bad faith. 
    So that I think you've already faced in Christiansburg, the fact that you do decide -- look to the party to make sure that he doesn't bring frivolous suits. 
    Not just saying, “Well, I was misled.” 
    That it's up to the party to assure that his -- that -- that he doesn't bring a frivolous suit. 
    But if he does, then he bears the risk of having counsel fees as against him. 
    And I think that this is -- it's important that that's where the line has been drawn between the protection of defendants and the protection of plaintiffs. 
    That your -- you get the problem and the -- the difficulty with the -- petitioner's point of view is that 1927 is penal and it's looking at the attorney's responsibility. 
    The attorney's responsibility for the way he litigates that the -- the other -- the attorney fee provisions in the substantive statutes are not penal.

    Ms. Harriet S. Shapiro 
    No, the -- the argument really is that you're in -- in the substantive statutes, you're talking about costs -- shifting costs against the parties and that -- that however that line is drawn between the parties, it's drawn on the basis of the merits of the suit. 
    1927 says nothing about prevailing parties.

    Ms. Harriet S. Shapiro 
    Well, in this -- that's up -- and we agree. 
    A misbehaving lawyer is a misbehaving lawyer and he ought to be subject to the same penalties regardless of what kind of a statute he is litigating under. 
    He is subject to the penalties that are provided in 1927 which are conventional costs.

   Rebuttal of Miles Curtiss McKee
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="2553.715" stopTime="2557.193">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Mr. McKee, do you have anything further?
speaker="miles_curtiss_mckee" startTime="2557.193" stopTime="2705.222">
    Mr. Miles Curtiss McKee 
    Mr. Chief Justice, you asked earlier about the matter of improvident appeals and -- and awards under inherent powers. 
    It's a strange result, but on April the 2nd, the Fifth Circuit decided a case called, a panel decision. 
    Decided case called Self versus Self, which is cited on page 4 of our reply brief, in which they've suggested that an award for just such a reason might be made under 1927. 
    Mr. Justice Rehnquist, on the question of penal at -- our position is simply that where these statutes are as clear as they are that there is no construction needed and whether you admit even if you admit -- admitted completely that they might be penal that it doesn't change the result that we're contending for. 
    If you follow the argument of the Government, you must say that Congress was not aware of 1920 or 1923 when it passed the 42 c 1988 or Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. 
    And has the effect of ignoring one of the cases that they've cited which is Erlenbaugh decided by the Court in 1972, holding that Congress is presumed to be aware that all previous statutes on the same subject. 
    Or should we presume that Congress was aware of 1920 and 1923 and intended something entirely different by the use of the phrase, “As a part of the cost”. 
    Congress has from to time used various phrases to define cost. 
    In 17 statutes, they've separated them as cost and attorney's fees. 
    In five, they have used the language, “Together with.” 
    In 21 statutes they have used "cost including attorney's fees" and in 15 statutes, one of -- the ones that we're involved with today, they used "cost as a part of". 
    The simple meaning of all of these is that these attorney's fees are part of the taxable cost in these cases in Hutto and Finney, foreclosed any further discussion of that. 
    I would like to comment very briefly on the -- on the merit conduct distinction that has been advanced here. 
    And that is that it's a very mechanistic argument which divides the lawyer and his client and which divides the suit into two parts. 
    And that it's -- assigns if --
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="2705.222" stopTime="2711.293">

    Mr. Miles Curtiss McKee 
    Well, they are, Your Honor, but you can't divide them entirely for all of these purposes and ignore the Lincoln Wabash decision at all -- all together. 
    But what they've done is they've created a factious distinction here, where they divide the suit down the middle and they assigned the lawyer one side of the suit and they assigned the client the other side. 
    To wit, “The bringing of the suit is the client's responsibility. 
    The conduct of the suit is that of the lawyer.” 
    They applied Title VII to the front side of that argument and 1927 to the backside of it.

    What the people that are singled out were singled out by Congress when they passed these statutes that said that attorney's fees are part of the cost or the cost includes attorney's fees. 
    There is no singling except to the extent that some 36 or so statutes that deal in those terms. 
    I think that the Court has no other questions, I will give up. 
    Thank you, sir.
