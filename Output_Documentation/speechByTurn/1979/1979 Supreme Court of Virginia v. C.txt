Supreme Court of Virginia v. Consumers Union of the United States, Inc.

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    We'll hear arguments next in Supreme Court of Virginia against the Consumers' Union. 
    Mr. Attorney General, I think you may proceed whenever you're ready now.

    Mr. Marshall Coleman 
    Mr. Chief Justice, if it may please the Court. 
    This is a case that arises from the holding in the Bates decision on lawyer advertising. 
    Now because the Virginia Supreme Court promulgated a rule that banned advertising prior to Bates, it was subject to an award of attorney's fees by a three-judge panel and so at issue in this case is whether judicial immunity will stand or fall. 
    We are at a period in our history of enormous harmony between the federal judiciary and the state judiciary. 
    But, this case is really an anomaly in that because we are confronted with a punitive measure against a court that did not act to the harm or determent of any party, intended no harm, and wished no harm to any party, but because it had a rule that was generally accepted to be valid throughout the country, at the time of the Bates decision in 1977, a three-judge panel has found that attorney's fees that could amount to $120,000 should be assessed against the Virginia Supreme Court and against our Chief Justice.

    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    I'm not talking about judicial immunity. 
    I thought that immunity was a defense that one raised. 
    I think, in order to have a lawsuit under 1983, you have to show that the person you are suing is a person for purposes of 1983 as defined by Congress under Monell and related cases.
speaker="marshall_coleman" startTime="221.164" stopTime="255.947">
    Mr. Marshall Coleman 
    Well, during the course of this litigation, which was quite protracted, there was, and I think in the record there is a proposed order that could give rise to the thought that there was a concession on that point. 
    But, during the case as it went forward, the state always took the position that it could not be -- the attorney's fees could not be assessed against. 
    They would like to settle the question and it was a matter that was of great moment and ought to be resolved by the federal courts, but --
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="255.947" stopTime="272.449">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Is there any connection between Mr. Justice Rehnquist's question, the subject he's bringing up, and the fact that the party named was -- the named parties are the Supreme Court, presumably as an entity, and Lawrence I'Anson, the Chief Justice?
speaker="marshall_coleman" startTime="272.449" stopTime="275.648">
    Mr. Marshall Coleman 
    Well, they were named, as was the state bar, and --
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="275.648" stopTime="277.556">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Clearly, he is a person. 
    He --
speaker="marshall_coleman" startTime="277.556" stopTime="845.526">
    Mr. Marshall Coleman 
    That's right. 
    The fees, of course, against him were in his official capacity, but he is a person. 
    Now, it's our position here that no one was harmed after Bates came down and I think it's a clear rule of this Court that when a rule or law is declared unconstitutional, then it has no force or effect, that it is not necessary for any party to take any action and I think it's, in fact, recent doctrine that if the court should change that rule and reverse Bates, for example, that that law could come back into effect. 
    But, there is no evidence in the record or any suggestion that the court or any officer of the court at any time sought to violate Bates or sought to enforce the rule. 
    They clearly did not. 
    What we tried to present to the court, and it refused to hear it below, was that the machinery was going forward through the offices of the state bar to amend and change the rule consistent with Bates. 
    That's not a matter that's free of difficulty, I might add and, after I took office, I issued an Attorney General's opinion for the bar which was published and promulgated to all lawyers saying what the impact of Bates was on the rule. 
    But, there was never any question involved in this case of our Supreme Court not acknowledging supremacy of this Court or ever trying to enforce a rule that was in violation of Bates, but the court below seemed to believe that because our Supreme Court did not, with greater haste, changed the rule subsequent to Bates, that these Attorney's fees should properly be assessed under 1988. 
    And, it is our position that, with today's practice, that the awarding of attorney's fees against a court or against the chief justice has an inhibiting effect that is just as severe as damages. 
    Certainly, if the court has to stand, when it is acting as a court in its judicial functions, against the dread of having attorney's fees assessed against it. 
    The very essence of our system of federalism and constitutional law is at issue because, then, the judge is not really in the position to exercise the kind of independent judgment that he ought to in trying cases and in making judicial rulings. 
    It's interesting that when the doctrine of the case to which we all look for the best articulation of the Doctrine of Judicial Immunity, Bradley against Fisher, was a case that itself was involved with lawyer discipline. 
    That was a case, as the Court remembers, when the judge sought to remove a lawyer from the rolls and within his inherent authority to regulate the bar and the court found that he could not be moot for that decision because the Doctrine of Judicial Immunity was such an important one that has been there as long as we have had courts. 
    The lower district court seems to be saying that the priorities of our State Supreme Court should be its priorities, and its priorities apparently were that our Supreme Court should amend the rule immediately. 
    Many other states didn't and still have not and our state has now changed that rule, but change it or not, there was no one who was at hazard in Virginia as a result of our not changing the rule because the law in the Bates case applied. 
    Now, we're not talking about the assessment of cost or filing fees. 
    Obviously, that is not usually of great moment and, in the Fairmont Creamy case, the court was talking about the need to get it filing fees to continue in business. 
    We're talking, in this case, of shifting the fee under the 1988 statute that was put there specifically for one purpose, which was to, at the invitation in part of this Court after the ruling in Iliescu, to permit attorney's fees to be shifted not to create some new remedy, not to abolish judicial immunity or the other immunities that existed at the law or in the Constitution. 
    In fact, the report accompanying the bill said that it did not create any new substantive rights. 
    So, it is our position that, first of all, even if you look at a statutory construction without conceding a constitutional dimension to the right of judicial immunity that, certainly, in this case, our court is being fined because it had a rule that was part of our governance in Virginia that everyone thought was appropriate and valid and legal. 
    Our court should not be held to effect a punishment because that rule was there. 
    Special circumstances should indicate otherwise. 
    There's no hint of any bad faith on the part of our court. 
    Secondly, looking at the statute itself and looking at the guidance that we have from several cases - Pierson against Ray and others, this Court has found that if the Congress is going to abolish immunity, that it ought to do it specifically and it ought to manifest that it wanted to do that. 
    There is no such evidence of that in the reports that accompanied the adoption of 1988. 
    And, finally, it would be our position that the entitlement to judicial immunity is so at much at the core and at the heart of a function of government that is necessary for our Virginia Supreme Court that the Congress ought not to be able to overrule it even if it wanted to do it. 
    This, in fact, poses a threat to the Doctrine of Judicial Immunity. 
    We're not talking about prospective relief. 
    We're talking about attorney's fees that were awarded for something that happened several years ago, in 1970, when our court adopted this rule. 
    We're not talking about a recalcitrance or bad faith on the part of the court in any respect, but we are talking about the inherent authority to manage, by rulemaking, the lawyers in Virginia which is an inherent function being in jeopardy and every other ruling of the court being in jeopardy if attorney's fees could be assessed in this case. 
    It strikes me that, without an independent judiciary, we have to ask what our history be like, who would protect any of us. 
    It is something that is essential and is needful. 
    The question of who pays the assessments, whether it's the state or whether it's the court, whether it is an individual does not change the question before the court, and the question before the court simply is what chilling effect this decision, if it is upheld, would have on our jurisprudence, not only in Virginia, in the other states and, in view of Davis against Passman, what effect it would have on other judges, Certainly, in Stump against Sparkman this Court seemed to take the immunity issue to its very limit and to hold that, in that case, the judge could not be answerable for an act he did as a judicial officer. 
    Certainly, in this case, unlike the characterization in the opposing brief, we don't have a court that was not sympathetic or sensitive to individual rights. 
    We don't have a court that, in any way, attempted to trench on the constitutional guarantees of this Court and I think the three-judge panel certainly underestimated the difficulty and complexity of making a rule for the entire regulation of the bar consistent with Bates. 
    It underestimated the nature and extent of the job that was before it, but the Appellees in this case seem to argue that even if the rule had been changed, that that did not ch-- alter the liability for the court in this case to pay attorney's fees. 
    It's our position that this trenching on judicial immunity is a threat. 
    That it would result in the intimidation of a judiciary which would certainly interfere with the functioning of our republican form of government and our system of governance.

    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    Virginia Supreme Court's disciplinary rule which was at issue in this case is, without question, unconstitutional.

    Ms. Ellen Broadman 
    Well, when we refer to the Virginia Supreme Court, we intended to refer to each of the members of the Supreme Court in their official capacity, so when we refer to it as an entity, we're really referring to each of the individual justices in their official capacity and they are persons. 
    So that, as an entity, we would argue that they are persons for purposes of the 1983. 
    Here, the consumer groups' only means to protect their First Amendment freedoms was to institute this action. 
    The disciplinary rule at issue here prohibited attorneys from participating in an attorney directory that the consumer groups wanted to publish to educate the public about available legal services. 
    Here, the consumer groups could not appeal that rule in order to protect their First Amendment freedoms. 
    They could not publish that directory and challenge the disci -- challenge the unconstitutional rule through disciplinary proceedings. 
    Their only recourse was to bring this action under 1983. 
    The consumer groups here needed to join the Virginia Supreme Court as a party in order to obtain complete relief against all entities who had authority to enforce the rule against attorneys who participated in the directory.

    Both awards were granted against the state officers in their official capacity to be paid from state funds.

    Ms. Ellen Broadman 
    Okay, Pierson v. Ray was a damages case, as was Stump versus Sparkman. 
    The Civil Rights Attorney Fee Award Act authorizes attorney's fees as part of costs. 
    So, the statute and cost traditionally have been awarded from state funds, so that the statutory language does provide for attorney's fees from state funds. 
    And then, if you look at the legislative history, the legislative history generally says that Congress intends to make fee awards available against state officers in their official capacity from state funds, and the House report has a specific reference to Pierson v. Ray, a judicial immunity case, and specifically says this is one of several immunities that we do not intend to preclude fee awards in these cases.

    What doctrine are you talking about?

    Ms. Ellen Broadman 
    There are basic rights to appeal. 
    Where a judge enters a decision where there's a right to appeal, that party must take that appeal if the appeal is adequate because, other -- told otherwise, will completely disrupt our systems of appeal. 
    However, the Court need not reach that issue here because there was no right to appeal. 
    The act here was not a judicial act. 
    It shares none of the characteristics of judicial immunity.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="1616.960" stopTime="1622.649">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    That's really your answer, isn't it? 
    That's your basic submission that this is an administrative act, not a judicial act.
speaker="ellen_broadman" startTime="1622.649" stopTime="1622.744">
    Ms. Ellen Broadman 
    That's correct.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="1622.744" stopTime="1624.311">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    So, there's no question of judicial immunity.
speaker="ellen_broadman" startTime="1624.311" stopTime="1638.871">
    Ms. Ellen Broadman 
    That's correct. 
    Okay, that is one reason that we're saying judicial immunity does not apply. 
    The second reason is that judicial immunity does not preclude suits for declaratory and injunctive relief, so that the parties are entitled to prevail on the underlying action and, therefore, entitled to attorney's fees.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="1638.871" stopTime="1644.337">

speaker="ellen_broadman" startTime="1644.337" stopTime="1646.859">
    Ms. Ellen Broadman 
    Well, let me try and clarify. 
    What I'm say --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="1646.859" stopTime="1650.628">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Let's say that the Virginia Supreme Court performed a judicial act.

    Ms. Ellen Broadman 
    Correct.

    Finally.

    Yes.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="1652.628" stopTime="1657.503">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Now, are you going to go into a three-judge court and get a declaratory judgment against them?
speaker="ellen_broadman" startTime="1657.503" stopTime="1658.969">
    Ms. Ellen Broadman 
    Okay, it would depend.

    Justice Byron R. White 
    Wha -- on what?
speaker="ellen_broadman" startTime="1659.813" stopTime="1663.476">
    Ms. Ellen Broadman 
    Whether there was a right to appeal.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="1663.476" stopTime="1664.828">

    To where?
speaker="ellen_broadman" startTime="1664.828" stopTime="1685.795">
    Ms. Ellen Broadman 
    Okay. 
    Well, where there are appellant processes that a party sh -- party can follow, Doctrines of Comity would prevent that party from circumventing those by going and suing a court in a three-judge district court rather than following the appeals. 
    So, basically, what I'm saying is that judicial immunity there would not prevent the party from bringing action --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="1685.795" stopTime="1687.820">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    I hope that's not your strongest argument.
speaker="ellen_broadman" startTime="1687.820" stopTime="1718.414">
    Ms. Ellen Broadman 
    Let me go on to the administrative act or the non-judicial act argument. 
    Here, we don't believe that there is a judicial act at issue because none of the characteristics typical of judicial acts exists. 
    The Virginia Supreme Court, in issuing its rules, is not resolving cases and controversies between the parties by applying relevant laws. 
    The court is not bound by case precedent in issuing its disciplinary rules and there's no right to appeal. 
    None of the characteristics typical of judicial acts apply here.

    Ms. Ellen Broadman 
    Well, enforcing their own proceedings is somewhat different than enforcing their own -- the laws that they issue. 
    At the point where the legislature starts enforcing laws that it issues, it's no longer acting in -- within a legislative capacity.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1850.495" stopTime="1877.311">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Congress of United States, until recent times, enforced its contempt determinations by decreeing confinement of the person in contempt. 
    Because it was such a burdensome thing, they finally passed a statute giving that authority to the United States courts. 
    But, if they enforce that, if they enforce contempt orders, do you say that's not a legislative act?
speaker="ellen_broadman" startTime="1877.311" stopTime="1921.540">
    Ms. Ellen Broadman 
    That is a legislative act because it's inherently involved in permitting them to freely speak if they gather information in order to pass laws. 
    And, that whole process through which laws are passed is protected by legislative immunity. 
    But, once a law is passed, the minute the legislature assumes responsibility for enforcement, typically it's not the legislature that enforces. 
    Legislative immunity no longer applies. 
    You're no longer within the legislative realm. 
    It would be wholly contrary to the doctrine set forth in Ex Parte versus Young, 100 years ago, to apply legislative immunity here.

    Ms. Ellen Broadman 
    Well, we argue that it's administrative in nature because we believe it is administrative and it's not necessarily motivated by all those cases. 
    We hear the Act just doesn't -- what the Virginia Supreme Court is doing does not look at all like a typical judicial act or typical legislative act. 
    It's involved in enforcing disciplinary rules. 
    It's involved in issuing rules regulating the legal profession. 
    If the Virginia Supreme Court regulated doctor participation in consumer directories, would it be judicially immune?

    No.

    Ms. Ellen Broadman 
    Well, the bad -- my reading of the bad face sc-- well, the Court need not reach that question because you're deciding the case here on the basis of statutory interpretation of the Civil Rights Attorney Fee Award Act. 
    If that Act did not exist then we would argue that fee awards are ancillary to declaratory, injunctive, prospective relief and, therefore, wholly distinct from damages. 
    Damages are retroactive reimbursements. 
    Fee awards are merely awards which enable people to bring actions to obtain perspective relief to stop unconstitutional governmental acts.

    In that situation, consumer groups could sue the court only because it enforces an unconstitutional disciplinary rule, apart from deciding the cases in controversies, because that court could independently go out and initiate proceedings against attorneys in violation of constitutional rights.

speaker="ellen_broadman" startTime="2590.336" stopTime="2590.453">
    Ms. Ellen Broadman 
    No.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="2590.453" stopTime="2592.536">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    The lawyer, he can't sue?
speaker="ellen_broadman" startTime="2592.536" stopTime="2593.799">
    Ms. Ellen Broadman 
    No because that lawyer --
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="2593.799" stopTime="2596.773">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    And, number two, therefore, he can't get counsel fees.
speaker="ellen_broadman" startTime="2596.773" stopTime="2598.586">
    Ms. Ellen Broadman 
    That's correct.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="2598.586" stopTime="2601.954">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Well, how does it so happen that you can?
speaker="ellen_broadman" startTime="2601.954" stopTime="2617.681">
    Ms. Ellen Broadman 
    Because the lawyer has procedures that the lawyer is supposed to follow to review that disciplinary proceeding. 
    It -- the lawyer appeals from the disciplinary decision of the Virginia Bar into the Virginia Supreme Court and then it has a right to appeal up to the United States Supreme Court.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2617.681" stopTime="2618.660">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Yes, but --
speaker="ellen_broadman" startTime="2618.660" stopTime="2618.971">
    Ms. Ellen Broadman 
    We don't.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2618.971" stopTime="2623.889">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Justice Marshall's question is those procedures were all over and he's been disbarred.
speaker="ellen_broadman" startTime="2623.889" stopTime="2629.563">
    Ms. Ellen Broadman 
    He's already been disbarred and he appeals to the United States Supreme Court -- and he appeals to the United States Supreme Court and the cert is denied?
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2629.563" stopTime="2630.505">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    No.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="2630.505" stopTime="2631.432">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Yes.
speaker="ellen_broadman" startTime="2631.432" stopTime="2631.530">
    Ms. Ellen Broadman 
    Okay.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="2631.530" stopTime="2634.151">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    And then, he goes into the United States District Court of Virginia.
speaker="ellen_broadman" startTime="2634.151" stopTime="2636.401">
    Ms. Ellen Broadman 
    Res adjudicata, he can't do it.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="2636.401" stopTime="2638.183">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Is there any other reason he can't do it?
speaker="ellen_broadman" startTime="2638.183" stopTime="2640.767">
    Ms. Ellen Broadman 
    Well, I would argue comity, both res adjudicate --
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="2640.767" stopTime="2642.318">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Comity?
speaker="ellen_broadman" startTime="2642.318" stopTime="2646.399">
    Ms. Ellen Broadman 
    Well, because if the federal district court takes -- well, really, res adjudicata is the main reason.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="2646.399" stopTime="2648.227">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Well, could he have filed the --
speaker="ellen_broadman" startTime="2648.227" stopTime="2648.563">
    Ms. Ellen Broadman 
    Yes.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="2648.563" stopTime="2654.030">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Could he have filed an action in the district court originally before he was disbarred?
speaker="ellen_broadman" startTime="2654.030" stopTime="2663.779">
    Ms. Ellen Broadman 
    No, and the reason for that is because of comity. 
    Once he's filed through the appellate procedures, res adjudicata prevents him from turning around and suing the district court. 
    Where he hasn't filed the --
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="2663.779" stopTime="2689.876">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    My new question is he wasn't disbarred. 
    He heard he was about to be disbarred. 
    So, he went into the district court and asked for everything - damages, injunction, declaratory judgment, and that all things they used to have, enact the procedure, anything else the court, out of its good heart, would give him.
speaker="ellen_broadman" startTime="2689.876" stopTime="2695.749">
    Ms. Ellen Broadman 
    Okay, that raises a difficult question because, there, he could argue that the appellate procedures are inadequate, but somehow it could show that they were.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="2695.749" stopTime="2702.219">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    My point was would he -- win or lose, would he get counsel fees?
speaker="ellen_broadman" startTime="2702.219" stopTime="2704.800">
    Ms. Ellen Broadman 
    Well, if he brings an action and wins.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="2704.800" stopTime="2706.904">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    I said win or lose.
speaker="ellen_broadman" startTime="2706.904" stopTime="2709.093">
    Ms. Ellen Broadman 
    Okay, if he loses, he's not going to get counsel fees because counsel --
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="2709.093" stopTime="2710.998">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    But if he wins, he gets counsel fees.
speaker="ellen_broadman" startTime="2710.998" stopTime="2726.124">
    Ms. Ellen Broadman 
    That's right. 
    If he wins, he can. 
    But, I'm -- I don't think, where there are proper appellate procedures and those procedures are adequate, that a party can turn around and sue a judge. 
    The only time that they can bring these kinds of actions is where there is no appeals, no other recourse.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="2726.124" stopTime="2735.337">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    My point is that -- aren't you asking us the only door where anybody can do what a lawyer can't do?
speaker="ellen_broadman" startTime="2735.337" stopTime="2749.197">
    Ms. Ellen Broadman 
    Well, no. 
    I think that you can assure that people follow proper appellate procedures if you clarify that, where they exist, they must be followed. 
    The Doctrines of Comity prevent people from bringing these actions to circumvent existing appellate procedures.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="2749.197" stopTime="2751.922">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    But comity doesn't apply to you.
speaker="ellen_broadman" startTime="2751.922" stopTime="2757.435">
    Ms. Ellen Broadman 
    To us, because there -- that's correct, because there was no other recourse that we had.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2757.435" stopTime="2773.384">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    I'm going to get just straight out. 
    If we agree with you this is an administrative action by the court and there's no immunity, therefore -- then you can get attorneys' fees, you could also get damages.
speaker="ellen_broadman" startTime="2773.384" stopTime="2787.489">
    Ms. Ellen Broadman 
    Well, the standards applied to administrative officials are good faith immunity, so that where the court was acting in good faith, no damages could be obtained. 
    Now, for the -- in general, damages will not be available.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2787.489" stopTime="2789.703">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    But just no judicial immunity.
speaker="ellen_broadman" startTime="2789.703" stopTime="2790.430">
    Ms. Ellen Broadman 
    That's correct.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2790.430" stopTime="2794.466">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Just administrative -- the standards for administrative would apply.
speaker="ellen_broadman" startTime="2794.466" stopTime="2826.083">
    Ms. Ellen Broadman 
    If the Court finds this to be an administrative act. 
    The Court may want to characterize this as an administrative judicial act and preserve the immunities that exist for damages but not for declaratory and injunctive relief. 
    But, if the Court characterizes this as a wholly administrative act, then the same standards would apply as applied to other administrative officials. 
    Where courts are issuing disciplinary rules is going to -- there really be any cases where people could obtain damages people aren't going to be able to show that a panel of eight judges is acting in bad faith, but that --
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="2826.083" stopTime="2828.964">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    But it's really a qualified immunity that you would then grant.
speaker="ellen_broadman" startTime="2828.964" stopTime="2834.504">
    Ms. Ellen Broadman 
    That's correct from damages. 
    If there are no further questions, thank you. 
   
   
   
   Rebuttal of Marshall Coleman
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="2834.504" stopTime="2836.253">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Do you have anything further, Mr. Attorney General?
speaker="marshall_coleman" startTime="2836.253" stopTime="2959.937">
    Mr. Marshall Coleman 
    Just a couple of comments, Mr. Chief Justice. 
    It's our position that the remedy in a case like this would be an appeal, that that's been the rule of this Court that, in the Virginia Supreme Court, the parties could have appealed petition to the Supreme Court to have a ruling on the question of the rule and if they had lost, they could have then appealed it to this Court, but it is not appropriate for them to go at this collaterally which, in effect, is review of what our highest district court has done. 
    There is nothing that the Supreme Court did in its capacity as a Supreme Court to deprive of them of any right. 
    In fact, they are not even the prosecutor in these cases. 
    They simply hear cases that are brought to them by the state bar. 
    So that, in this case, the Doctrine of Judicial Immunity is certainly at hazard whether you call this immunity legislative or judicial, and it has been well, I think, briefed that judicial immunity is the proper denomination here because it is an inherent right in the court to regulate the practice of law. 
    There's also an argument that this is rulemaking that is legislative in nature, but whatever the immunity is identified as, it is one that should be absolute and that should be broached here. 
    The remedy should simply be a petition by a lawyer or by some other group to the court and, as I said in my opening remarks, there is no evidence. 
    There is no act at all done on the part of the court to the prejudice of the consumer u -- consumers' union and, despite the finding in Bates and the changing of the rule, this directory has not yet been published, but that is not because of anything that the Supreme Court of Virginia did. 
    It should be able to continue to operate on the basis that it is immune from its judicial acts and the judgment below should be reversed. 
    Thank you.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="2959.937" stopTime="2969.771">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Thank you, counsel. 
    The case is submitted.
