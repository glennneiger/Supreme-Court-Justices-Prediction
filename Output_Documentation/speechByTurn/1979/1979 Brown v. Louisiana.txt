Brown v. Louisiana
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="0.000" stopTime="52.804">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    We will hear argument next in 79-5364, Brown v. Louisiana. 
    Mr. Lawrence, I think you may proceed whenever you are ready.
speaker="john_m_lawrence" startTime="52.804" stopTime="141.042">
    Mr. John M. Lawrence 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court. 
    The issue in this case is whether to apply the Court's ruling in Burch v. Louisiana that a verdict of five out of six on a bobtail jury should be applied retroactively to this case, and if so if any other cases are involved, whether there should be full retroactivity or limited retroactivity to cases pending but not yet filed at the time that Burch was decided. 
    Darnell Brown was convicted in Orleans Parish of simple burglary by five-to-one vote. 
    He was then multiple-billed and sentenced to serve 22 years. 
    We are relying on the rule in Hankerson v. North Carolina as the rule to apply in this case. 
    Similarly, we are relying on the rule in Witherspoon and Ballew v. Georgia, as well as Burch v. Louisiana.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="141.042" stopTime="148.071">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    In which case did we define or at least tried to give some guidance on retroactivity?
speaker="john_m_lawrence" startTime="148.071" stopTime="282.540">
    Mr. John M. Lawrence 
    In Stovall v. Denno the guidelines came out, the criterion to apply. 
    In Ballew v. Georgia, the statistics came out, and in Burch the five-out-of-six decision was made. 
    But in Stovall and later with Linkletter, the Court drew on three factors the purpose to be served by the new rule, the reliance on good faith by the state authorities on the old rule, and the effect on the administration of criminal justice by implementing the new rule. 
    In Hankerson, the Court looked to the purpose of the new rule and that if that purpose was to enhance the truth of the fact-finding matter, then you need not look to reliance and effect, and that if the purpose was only to incidentally enhance the truth finding function or if it was small, then you would consider the other factors. 
    We submit here that we are in a better position than the litigant in Hankerson because we are not concerned with just an incidental enhancement of the truth finding function. 
    If you will recall in Ballew when the statistics were mentioned, they talk about prevention of type one error which is that an innocent man should not be wrongfully convicted being weighed ten times more heavily than the prevention of the type two error that a guilty person should go free.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="282.540" stopTime="284.683">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Was that this Court's --
speaker="john_m_lawrence" startTime="284.683" stopTime="296.147">
    Mr. John M. Lawrence 
    That was in Ballew. 
    That came out of Ballew from the statistics that the Court considered in making its decision.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="296.147" stopTime="301.250">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    But was it this Court's statement that it should be a ten-to-one ratio?
speaker="john_m_lawrence" startTime="301.250" stopTime="481.718">
    Mr. John M. Lawrence 
    No, it is not this Court's statement. 
    That is the statistics. 
    The fact remains that the enhancement here is not incidental or small, that the unanimity requirement, where do you draw the line, the unanimity requirement in a bobtail jury is where you draw the line, whether it is six of six or five out of six, as in the case of Brown. 
    Now, when you look at the reliance by state authorities, after Ballew and Williams v. Florida, they were put on notice that unanimity was being favored and not five out of six any more. 
    That is the reason that the motion to quash the five-out-of-six panel requirement was filed. 
    The purpose also in Burch was to assure accuracy in jury verdicts, to overcome an aspect of the criminal trial that substantially impaired the truth finding function, and raised serious doubts about prior trials, where five out of six would convict someone. 
    That is the reason for Ballew and Burch. 
    So here we are on similar ground with Hankerson, that the purpose of Burch is to enhance the fact-finding process, but if the Court would look at the other factors, such as the reliance and the effect on the administration of justice, you should consider this, that we are talking about really two states here, Louisiana and Oklahoma, who have the five out of six requirements. 
    Most of the people who were convicted five of six have already served their sentences and are out of prison. 
    Some people who have been multiple-billed are not, but most of the people who were convicted are already out. 
    We are talking about a period of time between 1974 and 1978 and we are not talking about people charged with relative felonies who pled guilty or who were convicted six to nothing. 
    We are talking only about five-one, so there is a relatively small number of people that we are talking about here.

    Mr. John M. Lawrence 
    There are not. 
    There is no Louisiana agency that has these figures, and what I am trying to show the Court here is that we are talking about a small number of people. 
    These are relative felonies, small crimes, where the legislative has not seen fit to give more significance to the number of people needed to convict.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="611.571" stopTime="645.611">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Of course, there are two elements really in the jury competition. 
    You say it is the truthfulness of the fact-finding process, but many of our resent decisions going down in numbers of jurors have emphasized the necessity of the cross-section and that you have to draw an arbitrary line to preserve a right to jury trial, without ever suggesting that a bench trial by a single judge is not an accurate truth-finding process.
speaker="john_m_lawrence" startTime="645.611" stopTime="685.251">
    Mr. John M. Lawrence 
    We are not talking here about the right to a jury trial or a judge trial. 
    We are talking here about the inner workings of a jury. 
    After you have made that decision to go before a group of people between the defendant and the prosecutor. 
    We are talking about that and not the right to a jury or a judge. 
    Once we get into the inner working of the jury, the five of six or the six of six, the unanimity requirement, it is a different matter.

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Which do you say is the better truth-finding process, a jury of five, which must be unanimous, or a jury of six in which the conviction may be had by five out of six?

    Mr. John M. Lawrence 
    I would have to draw on my own prior experience before 1974 and I will be very candid with the Court in telling the Court that at that time I favored five out of five, unanimity, but I am not going to argue with the requirement now of the six, but I never favored the five out of six.

    Unanimity, six out of six.

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    That isn't my question.

    I see no difference.

    I see no difference in the -- except that you may be dealing with one person if you have a five-out-of-six situation that you would not be dealing with if you had a five-out-of-five.

    Mr. John M. Lawrence 
    If there is an advantage to it, then I would recall that in Ballew they talk about the five factors when you are dealing with a small jury, the lack of discussion that goes on, that the minority view-point may not be adhered to, and that the position of the defense is of some detriment when you have a small jury.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="806.896" stopTime="810.458">

    Mr. John M. Lawrence 
    Let me explain it this way. 
    In 1974, there was a new policy for multiple billing that came into effect and after that there was a denial of good time that case into effect, and I believe in 1977 -- now, the people sentenced before that got the benefit of good time and probably are not in jail, people from, say, '77 on are likely to be in jail under multiple bill.

    Mr. John M. Lawrence 
    -- say '76 or back to 1974, during that period of time, their good time would not be affected by the multiple billing and whatever their sentence would be from zero -- from a third of the maximum, which would be three years, which most of them received, three to the maximum of 18 on a multiple bill at that time, they would be out of jail. 
    If they received the heavy end of the sentence on a multiple bill, they may still be there, but again this applies to Orleans Parish and not to most of the other parishes in the state.

    Can I go back to the question asked by the Chief Justice. 
    I think the question was which do you regard as possessing the greater integrity, a jury verdict unanimous with five or divided with six, and you said you couldn't detect any difference. 
    Do you still feel that way, even though there is, as the Chief suggested --
speaker="john_m_lawrence" startTime="1131.016" stopTime="1177.560">
    Mr. John M. Lawrence 
    You have the wild card but I would like to just draw my own experience when I tried cases at that time. 
    I feel that a unanimous verdict is always preferable but if you limit me to five of five or five out of six -- and I would for the sake of this argument say I would prefer to have five out of six, but since we are dealing here with the new rule in Burch that has thrown this out and require six of six, then I would of course feel that six is much better because it is unanimous and does not have a wild card.

    It is a two-edge sword, Chief Justice Burger.

    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court. 
    The respondent state of Louisiana would suggest to the Court that Burch v. Louisiana should be applied prospectively only, for three reasons. 
    First is that petitioner Darnell Brown has failed to establish that serious and substantial doubts exist as to the accuracy of non-unanimous verdicts before the time of Burch. 
    Second, the state of Louisiana conducted numerous jury trials before this Court ruled in Burch in good-faith reliance on what the law was earlier. 
    And third, the contrary ruling would have a seriously disruptive impact on the administration of justice in Louisiana.

    As I was saying, petitioner Brown was convicted by one of these non-unanimous juries in 1978, August, about nine months before this Court decided Burch. 
    As a habitual felon, he received a sentence of 22 years which I submit to the Court is not a minor sentence. 
    Mr. Brown had been convicted about six or seven times previously. 
    After he was convicted he appealed the sentence and his conviction. 
    This was affirmed by the Louisiana Supreme Court in May of 1979. 
    The particular record in this case certainly fails to reflect any miscarriage of justice as to petitioner, Darnell Brown. 
    The record reflects that Brown was arrested inside of a ransacked residence, that he tried to flee --
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1818.065" stopTime="1822.071">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Is that the issue here, whether there was any miscarriage of justice?
speaker="thomas_chester" startTime="1822.071" stopTime="2047.172">
    Mr. Thomas Chester 
    Your Honor, I believe that the ultimate issue in this case is whether nine unanimous jury verdicts are inaccurate, are unjust, if there is a good chance that they are erroneous. 
    In this case there is not. 
    The gist of what petitioner argues therefore is that in a substantial number of cases there must be error to justify wholesale and a windfall reversal of prior convictions, a substantial number of prior convictions. 
    The state concedes that there is no question that the Sixth Amendment that was the subject of Burch v. Louisiana pertains to what has been called the fact-finding process by this Court, but we submit also that it is well settled that the mere fact that the Sixth Amendment or the fact-finding process is involved in a particular ruling does not mandate automatic retroactivity. 
    Since it would be improper and impossible to review all of the convictions and the records of all the convictions, we have to look at this issue in general terms from what the jurisprudence has taught us about the jury trial and in functions. 
    The purpose of the jury trial is to prevent government oppression. 
    The main feature of the jury trial is an interposition between the accused and the accuser, of what this Court has called the common sense deliberations of a group of laymen. 
    The Court has further ruled that this interposition can operate if the jury can deliberate effectively and if it fairly represents a cross-section of the community from which it has been taken. 
    Many of these features are functions of the absolute size of the jury rather than the composition of the final ballot. 
    For example, it has been established that by empaneling six jurors, the cross-section requirement is satisfied. 
    And I believe the Court has rejected the argument that the fact that a member of the minority group is ultimately out-voted does not indicate that his position was not or the position of the minority was not adequately represented during the jury deliberations. 
    The Court in Ballew expressed some concern about the collective memory of the jury, and I think it has been further established that when six persons are empaneled they are able when they go back to that deliberation room to remember all the facts and arguments that were important in the trial of the case. 
    Also the state would suggest that it can't be said that a lay body has failed to interpose itself between accused and accuser, whether the final verdict is unanimous or non-unanimous. 
    Reading Burch together with this Court's prior decisions suggests that, while unanimous jury verdicts may indicate that more perfect deliberation processes occur, that the extent to which non-unanimous jury verdicts infect the integrity of the fact-finding process ranks low on the scale of probabilities. 
    The language of the Burch decision supports this. 
    The majority opinion of Mr. Justice Rehnquist at several points noted that the case was a close one, but went on to state that it was necessary to draw lines, that demarcation lines had to be drawn at some point if the substance of the trial was to be preserved. 
    The State of Louisiana would liken the rule of Burch to the rule of Callahan v. Parker as interpreted in Gosa v. Mayden, and that is that it is a prophylactic rule that only incidentally enhances the reliability of the fact-finding process.

    You think that is not the basis for Burch?
speaker="thomas_chester" startTime="2068.554" stopTime="2081.422">
    Mr. Thomas Chester 
    I think that the major difference between the two cases is that the prior jurisprudence, up until the time of Burch, talks more in terms of the absolute size of the jury, representation of the community.

    Mr. Thomas Chester 
    Yes, Your Honor, and I believe that some of the --

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    And do you think Burch said the same thing?
speaker="thomas_chester" startTime="2101.992" stopTime="2125.050">
    Mr. Thomas Chester 
    No, sir, I don't. 
    I believe Burch was more of a line-drawing decision. 
    I think that some of the features of the jury trial are more perfectly represented in a non-unanimous six-member jury than there are in a five-member jury. 
    Those are particularly cross-section of the community, the jury's ability to remember, and certain other facts.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2125.050" stopTime="2136.276">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    But you don't feel that the illegality in Burch of a five-out-of-six verdict rested on the danger of unreliability?
speaker="thomas_chester" startTime="2136.276" stopTime="2139.664">
    Mr. Thomas Chester 
    I believe that that was a factor in the case, but I believe --

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    You think it was?
speaker="thomas_chester" startTime="2140.423" stopTime="2174.621">
    Mr. Thomas Chester 
    I believe it was a factor in the case, but I don't believe that was the reason for the whole decision. 
    I believe there was a line-drawing decision and I think that that was noted in the opinion several times. 
    The state would further submit that the Court's ruling in DeStefano v. Woods and Gosa v. Mayden are dispositive of the issue before the Court. 
    In both of these cases, the Court denied retroactive application to cases where jury trials had been denied outright, where the purpose of the Sixth Amendment as it relates to trial had been frustrated entirely.

    Right.
speaker="thomas_chester" startTime="2193.818" stopTime="2201.632">
    Mr. Thomas Chester 
    The state's position is that if these cases are not retroactive, then Burch v. Louisiana should not be retroactive because --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2201.632" stopTime="2204.850">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    How about Ballew?
speaker="thomas_chester" startTime="2204.850" stopTime="2251.891">
    Mr. Thomas Chester 
    Although I have prepared an argument as to Ballew, Your Honor, I think that if you applied the same test, the Stovall three-pronged balancing test, I think you would find also that Ballew should not be retroactive. 
    If you are talking in terms of reliance on prior jurisprudence, prior law, if you are talking about impact on the administration of justice -- I think when these factors are balanced against the purpose of both of the decisions, the ultimate ruling should be that they are prospective only. 
    However, I think that the case is stronger in Burch for prospective application than it is in Ballew. 
    I believe that Burch was not as grounded in fairness as Ballew was. 
    I believe Burch had other justifications and other reasons for the Burch decision.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2251.891" stopTime="2266.556">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    On the other hand, Mr. Chester, in the Ballew-type case the proof would be very simple, we would know -- I guess everybody who was convicted there has a claim, whereas in the Burch-type case a large percentage may not have a claim.
speaker="thomas_chester" startTime="2266.556" stopTime="2267.466">
    Mr. Thomas Chester 
    Exactly, Your Honor.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2267.466" stopTime="2269.920">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    So that may argue for making it the other way.
speaker="thomas_chester" startTime="2269.920" stopTime="2271.230">
    Mr. Thomas Chester 
    It could be both ways.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2271.230" stopTime="2273.560">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Yes.
speaker="thomas_chester" startTime="2273.560" stopTime="2429.932">
    Mr. Thomas Chester 
    Now, as I spoke earlier, once we have established that the rule with which we are dealing is not so grounded in fundamental fairness as is, say, the right to counsel or reasonable doubt, like in Hankerson v. North Carolina, then it becomes appropriate to apply countervailing factors to the analysis, factors that were first set out in Linkletter, later in Stovall and those cases progeny. 
    As to the reliance of the state of Louisiana, the role of an inquiry before the court is should the state be charged with having anticipated the Court's ruling in Burch, and the state would submit that it should not. 
    First, we are dealing with an institution which was provided for by the Louisiana Constitution. 
    This is not a juris prudential rule. 
    It is not merely a statutory rule. 
    Normally, the constitutions of the states are presumed to have some validity. 
    The jurisprudence of this Court, as I said earlier, has seemed to examine the composition of the jury question in terms of absolute number rather than in terms of the final vote. 
    The issue involved in Burch had not raised long and widespread attacks in the lower courts as did the Court's Fifth Amendment decision in Bruton which was made retroactive by Roberts v. Russell. 
    Further, I don't believe that any of the Court's decision in Burch can be said to have been foreshadowed or preordained as had been the confrontation clause rule of Barber v. Page by this Court's previous decision in Pointer v. Texas. 
    Finally, again Burch by its own terms at several points noted that the issue was a close one. 
    As to the impact on the administration of justice, the third factor which was identified in Stovall, is noted in the state's brief that a number of serious felonies have been traditionally tried by juries, tried by non-unanimity six-man juries. 
    This institution, incidentally, was in effect for a little over four years, from January 1, 1974 until the date of Burch. 
    Crime such as aggravated battery, possession of narcotics, burglary, forgery, theft, possession of stolen property are among the most common prosecutions that are held in criminal courts in the state of Louisiana or probably anywhere.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2429.932" stopTime="2435.684">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Before this system you had, what, six-member juries unanimous or five-member juries?
speaker="thomas_chester" startTime="2435.684" stopTime="2445.357">
    Mr. Thomas Chester 
    Before 1975, it was five out of five to convict for felonies which were not necessarily punishable by hard labor.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2445.357" stopTime="2449.189">

    Exactly, Your Honor.

speaker="thomas_chester" startTime="2450.445" stopTime="2477.833">
    Mr. Thomas Chester 
    The difference being that in Georgia I believe that the maximum sentence for a five out of five conviction in Georgia was one year whereas in Louisiana it would have been nine, possibly being enhanced by the multiple offender statute. 
    Prior to 1975 and after 1975, potentially a man that had prior felony convictions, as had petitioner Darnell Brown, could possibly be sentenced up to life imprisonment.

    Mr. Thomas Chester 
    I don't know how many of those people would still be in jail, Your Honor. 
    I know between '74 and '75 the Department of Corrections estimates that there are about 2,000 people currently in jail who were either convicted, pled guilty or convicted by a judge or a jury or who pled guilty. 
    So you are talking about 2,000 people who were convicted --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2529.438" stopTime="2542.098">
    Justice Potter Stewart

    Mr. Thomas Chester 
    I would say we have guilty pleas in more than half of the cases.

    Those are the men who usually do go to trial because they are facing too much time to plead guilty.

    Mr. Thomas Chester 
    We proceed with a bill of information after a man has been convicted or pled guilty to a felony, we proceed by filing a bill of information alleging that he has been previously convicted of one or more felonies within a statutory time period.

    Discretion of the district attorney. 
    I believe Mr. Lawrence spoke about since 1974 there have been more multiple bills filed, that is because a new district attorney came into office in '74. 
    So Louisiana has had the multiple sentence statute since the early 1900's.

    Yes, sir.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2668.496" stopTime="2673.154">

    Then that can be denied and that is tried before the sentencing judge?
speaker="thomas_chester" startTime="2673.154" stopTime="2792.777">
    Mr. Thomas Chester 
    Yes, sir. 
    There are certain technical requisites of proof that require the state to prove up the prior convictions. 
    Now, as the Court has recognized, a retroactive application of this case could have -- could yield windfall benefits to a certain number of people who are in jail. 
    Ironically, the retrial of a case now may well result in a verdict which is less reliable than was the original trial held before the Court's decision in Burch. 
    That is when a case can be brought back to trial. 
    Inevitably, the passage of time will destroy the state's chances for bringing a lot of these cases back to trial. 
    How many, you can't tell, but again what is important is that those persons who would be most likely to be unretriable would be those persons whose cases were the stalest, that is, people with the most serious criminal records who were sentenced to the longest terms a good number of years back. 
    Mr. Lawrence initially also brought up in his argument a distinction between retroactivity on direct review and on collateral review, and I would like to answer that briefly. 
    I think that first that the jurisprudence of the court has established that that distinction is without merit back to Tehan and ex rel. Shott soon after the first non-retroactivity decision in Linkletter. 
    That distinction was rejected then. 
    I believe that the countervailing factors which spoke about earlier in connection with the Stovall decision don't admit any distinction between cases on direct review and cases on collateral review.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2792.777" stopTime="2797.431">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    What was the chronology here, Mr. Chester?

speaker="thomas_chester" startTime="2797.431" stopTime="2799.093">
    Mr. Thomas Chester

    Mr. Thomas Chester 
    Yes, sir. 
    There was a trial; nine months later Burch was decided. 
    He appealed and a month after the Burch decision the Louisiana Supreme Court affirmed Darnell Brown's case, holding that Burch v. Louisiana was not retroactive.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2820.880" stopTime="2822.707">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Which had not been decided in the meantime.

    Right.
speaker="thomas_chester" startTime="2827.618" stopTime="2869.689">
    Mr. Thomas Chester 
    Additionally, I would submit that I think that the impetus behind the argument for this distinction is basically one of inequity. 
    It is dissatisfaction with what the Court has previously termed chance beneficiary. 
    In other words, why should one man benefit from the Court's decision which [ILLEGIBLE WORDS] similarly situated does not. 
    view merely exchanges our inequity for the other, with the side effect of having just that many more convictions reversed for reasons than unfairness in the original trial.

    The practical problems, sir, are overwhelming in that type of situation. 
    In summary, I point out to the Court that there has been no showing that a substantial number of these verdicts were wrongly decided or were unfair. 
    The state of Louisiana relied on the law as it stood before the Court's decision in Burch, as it was set out in the '74 Constitution, and finally if retroactivity were found in the case before the bar it would have a seriously disruptive impact on Louisiana's criminal laws.

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Well, we thank you for your candor on that. 
    Let me ask you one more question, counsel. 
    What about the point we were just discussing with your friend, that a good many lawyers apparently did not take the precautions you did and poll every jury on a guilty verdict. 
    Isn't it just a matter of lottery and chance as to which ones would get the benefit of a retroactive holding should that be the Court's decision? 
    That is a pretty chancy business, isn't it?
speaker="john_m_lawrence" startTime="3123.568" stopTime="3131.270">
    Mr. John M. Lawrence 
    There are some attorneys who did poll and in some cases there are records to show the number, but not all.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="3131.270" stopTime="3132.344">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    It would be a matter of chance, wouldn't it?
speaker="john_m_lawrence" startTime="3132.344" stopTime="3134.966">
    Mr. John M. Lawrence 
    It would be a matter of chance, that's correct.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="3134.966" stopTime="3140.749">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    To the contrary, wouldn't it be a burden on the person alleging to show it?
speaker="john_m_lawrence" startTime="3140.749" stopTime="3141.711">
    Mr. John M. Lawrence 
    That's correct, too.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="3141.711" stopTime="3144.815">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    And if they couldn't show it, they wouldn't get a hearing, would they?
speaker="john_m_lawrence" startTime="3144.815" stopTime="3145.607">
    Mr. John M. Lawrence 
    That's right.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="3145.607" stopTime="3159.717">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Then on what standards in Louisiana, if there are any on this point, would a defense counsel be open to a charge of ineffective assistance of counsel if the record did not show that he polled the jury?
speaker="john_m_lawrence" startTime="3159.717" stopTime="3162.428">
    Mr. John M. Lawrence 
    In that case --
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="3162.428" stopTime="3169.711">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    That is not a fanciful possible claim, is it, on the part of the defendant who is in prison now?
speaker="john_m_lawrence" startTime="3169.711" stopTime="3177.233">
    Mr. John M. Lawrence 
    It could be a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel without polling the jury if this --

    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    There is nothing on federal habeas, do you suppose you could poll the jury if they were still alive?

    Mr. John M. Lawrence 
    I don't know how to answer that.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="3191.046" stopTime="3194.683">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Well, do you know of any Louisiana law that would prevent you?

    Mr. John M. Lawrence 
    From polling the jury if they were able to be found?

    Yes.

    They would --

    You've got the summary records, haven't you?

    Mr. John M. Lawrence 
    Yes, if they are still there.

    Justice Byron R. White 
    Of course, a lot of them may be dead by now or moved away or something, I agree with you. 
    But if they were around, if you even found one of them you could probably find out if it was unanimous.
speaker="john_m_lawrence" startTime="3217.549" stopTime="3222.657">
    Mr. John M. Lawrence 
    I'm sure they would remember the count.

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Your friend suggested that there is a statute prohibiting collateral attack on the jury verdict by such an inquiry. 
    Wouldn't that preclude any inquiry of any juror? 
    Because certainly the result would be to impeach the verdict. 
    That would be the purpose of the inquiry, wouldn't it?
speaker="john_m_lawrence" startTime="3244.391" stopTime="3251.934">
    Mr. John M. Lawrence 
    There is a statute that says that the jury is not competent to impeach its own verdict and I have only seen --

    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Well, it is not impeaching it, it, is just a question of fact.

    Mr. John M. Lawrence 
    That's correct, too. 
    I have had two of those cases though in the last ten years.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="3261.388" stopTime="3266.569">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    The fact is that it was not unanimous when the verdict has been impeached.

    Mr. John M. Lawrence 
    That's correct.
