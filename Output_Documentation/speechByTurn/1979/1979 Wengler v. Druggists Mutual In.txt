    Justice Byron R. White 
    This case comes to us on appeal from the Supreme Court of the State of Missouri. 
    The workers' compensation laws of that State provide that when an employed wife dies, the surviving husband is not entitled to benefits unless he is disabled or was dependent on the wife's earnings. 
    The surviving widow, however, is entitled to benefits without proving either disability or dependence. 
    This gender-based discrimination was challenged in the Missouri courts but the Supreme Court of that case upheld the provision as merely a justifiable recognition of what it thought to be a difference in the economic status of women and that of men. 
    We noted probable jurisdiction and for the reasons stated in an opinion on file with the clerk, we reversed. 
    We hold that the discrimination in this case which as we see it is -- is against both of the -- the deceased female wage earner and the surviving widower has not been adequately justified by the State and is violative of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. 
    The judgment of the Missouri Supreme Court is therefore reversed and the case is remanded to that court for further proceedings. 
    Mr. Justice Stevens has filed an opinion concurring in the result and Mr. Justice Rehnquist has filed a dissenting statement.
