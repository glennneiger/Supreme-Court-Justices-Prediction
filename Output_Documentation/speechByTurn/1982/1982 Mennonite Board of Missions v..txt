Mennonite Board of Missions v. Adams

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    We'll hear argument next in Mennonite Board of Missions versus Adams. 
    Mr. Cohen, I think you may proceed whenever you are ready.

    Mr. William J. Cohen 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    This is an appeal from the Indiana Court of Appeals. 
    This case presents the question of whether the Indiana tax sale statutes which were in effect at the time this case arose violate due process in equal protection. 
    It is the position of the Mennonite Board of Missions that the Indiana tax sale statutes violate due process because they only provide for constructive notice to a mortgagee of record. 
    The statutes only provided for notice by posting at the courthouse and publication in a newspaper. 
    This case arose as a quiet title action filed by the Appellee, Richard C. Adams. 
    Mr. Adams had purchased the property at 1829 Stevens Avenue in Elkhart at a tax sale on August 8, 1977. 
    Prior to the tax sale, Jean Moore owned the property in fee simple. 
    The Mennonite Board of Missions had a mortgage on that property. 
    The most significant fact in this case is that the Mennonite Board of Missions mortgage was recorded. 
    It was a matter of public record. 
    It was found in the Elkhart County recorder's office in Volume 388, page 693 of the Elkhart County records. 
    The name and address of the Mennonite Board of Missions was thus a matter of public record. 
    Under the terms of that mortgage Moore was required to pay the property taxes. 
    She failed to pay those taxes.

    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    Does the record show why?
speaker="william_j_cohen" startTime="175.570" stopTime="266.298">
    Mr. William J. Cohen 
    No, it does not, Justice Blackmun, as to why she did not pay the taxes. 
    But she was, despite not paying the taxes, she was paying that mortgage each month to the Mennonite Board of Missions, which I think is also a very significant point. 
    Under Indiana law if the taxes aren't paid on property for more than 15 months, the county auditor will compile a list of delinquent property tax... properties. 
    And, in this case, they would then send notice under Indiana law to the legal title owner. 
    Indiana law does not provide any mailed notice to an owner of the property. 
    It is the position of the Mennonite Board of Missions that due process requires, at a minimum, mailed notice to a mortgagee of record. 
    Had there been notice mailed to the Mennonite Board of Missions, in this case, I submit to this Court that the Mennonite Board of Missions would have paid the taxes. 
    That's demonstrated by the fact that soon after they learned that the property had actually been sold for delinquent taxes, they immediately tendered to the trial court the statutory amount due to redeem their property.

    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Mr. Cohen, is there any provision of Indiana law that assures that by inspecting the record of the mortgage, the place at which it has been recorded, whichever, a person would be able to apprise themselves of the present address of the mortgagee as well as the name of the mortgagee?
speaker="william_j_cohen" startTime="283.557" stopTime="304.846">
    Mr. William J. Cohen 
    The mortgage was filed in the county records in Goshen. 
    The county auditor's office is in the same city. 
    Their name and address was on the mortgage. 
    More importantly, the Mennonite Board of Missions offices have been located in Elkhart County for over 50 years. 
    The--

    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    You're advocating a principle of request, sending mailed notice to any mortgagee of records, I take it. 
    Now what I'm trying to find out is if there might not be situations in which there hasn't been a recorded mortgage... where the present address of the mortgagee was not available from the recording data.
speaker="william_j_cohen" startTime="322.182" stopTime="337.645">
    Mr. William J. Cohen 
    --Justice Rehnquist, if the mortgage was not recorded, I do not believe that the county auditor would be forced to search titles and give notice to anybody. 
    If the mortgage wasn't recorded, they couldn't have sent notice.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="337.645" stopTime="346.300">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    No, but-- 
    --The question-- 
    --What if the mortgage had been recorded, but the mortgage either didn't show the mortgagee's address or the mortgagee had moved.
speaker="william_j_cohen" startTime="346.300" stopTime="378.192">
    Mr. William J. Cohen 
    That is a question that is not applicable to this case, but that would be something that would be a fact question that would possibly relieve the county auditor from sending notice... actual notice. 
    But I do believe that if the mortgage was recorded in your given hypothetical, then it would be incumbent upon the county auditor to send notice to the last known address. 
    In this case--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="378.192" stopTime="387.095">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Would he be entitled to treat the mortgage... the address shown on the mortgage as the last known address even if it turned out, in fact, to be the third last known address?
speaker="william_j_cohen" startTime="387.095" stopTime="412.147">
    Mr. William J. Cohen 
    --Yes, I believe he would unless the county auditor knew that the mortgagor... or rather the mortgagee had actually moved. 
    If the facts could be shown that the county auditor knew that the mortgagee's address had changed and the county auditor knew that, I think it would be incumbent upon the county auditor to send notice under those circumstances.

    Does the record show the contents of the notice that was published in this case?

    Mr. William J. Cohen 
    No, it does not, Justice O'Connor. 
    But we are not questioning the form of published notice given in this case itself. 
    We're saying, however, that published--

    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    What is in... what is contained in that published form of notice?
speaker="william_j_cohen" startTime="434.873" stopTime="454.348">
    Mr. William J. Cohen 
    --Under Indiana law, the statutes provide that the name of the owner of the property will be listed, an address, if possible, but it does not require a specific street address. 
    The legal title should be in the notice, and that's--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="454.348" stopTime="457.566">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    And the mortgagee's name or not?
speaker="william_j_cohen" startTime="457.566" stopTime="469.389">
    Mr. William J. Cohen 
    --There is no present... there is no requirement under the Indiana law in effect at the time this case arose to send mailed notice at all to a mortgagee. 
    That is--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="469.389" stopTime="473.295">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Yes, but I'm just asking about the published notice, what it contained.
speaker="william_j_cohen" startTime="473.295" stopTime="607.723">
    Mr. William J. Cohen 
    --Okay. 
    It would contain the name of the legal title owner. 
    It would not contain the name of the mortgagee. 
    In this particular case, the published records of Elkhart County demonstrate that although the county auditor sent notice to Moore, she never picked up the certified mailing, that the property was then sold to Adams, but significantly, Moore continued to pay the property... to pay the money due and owing under the mortgage to the Mennonite Board of Missions. 
    Indiana law provides for a two-year period of time to redeem the property following the sale at... by a county official. 
    The Indiana statutes provide for giving notice to the legal title owner prior to the expiration of the redemption period. 
    But there was absolutely no provision in Indiana law at the time this case arose to notify a mortgagee of record that the redemption period is about to expire. 
    Under Indiana law, once the redemption period expires the tax deed purchaser, in this case Adams, obtains a fee simple absolute, free and clear of any prior lien or encumbrance. 
    In this case we submit to this Court that the fact that the notice was only constructive and, by posting and publication initially to the Mennonite Board of Missions, in conjunction with the fact that there was absolutely no notice given at all to the Mennonite Board of Missions prior to the expiration of the redemption period, results in the Mennonite Board of Missions having their prior reported mortgage taken from them by state action with inadequate notice and without any compensation at all.
speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="607.723" stopTime="622.796">
    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    Just a question of procedure. 
    You stated the title in fee simple blossomed in the purchaser at the tax sale after the expiration period. 
    Does he nevertheless have to go into court on a quiet title action?
speaker="william_j_cohen" startTime="622.796" stopTime="660.094">
    Mr. William J. Cohen 
    He does, Justice Blackmun. 
    But the statute provides that if notice were given to the legal title owner and that is then prima facie evidence that the tax sale was conducted in an improper manner. 
    We do not represent Jean Moore. 
    Our interests are not the same as hers. 
    We could not represent her for that reason. 
    We do not dispute the fact that there was notice sent to Moore under the statute, although she never picked up the notice, but--
speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="660.094" stopTime="665.154">
    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    Anyway, he'd have to go in and get his title cleared up?

    Mr. William J. Cohen 
    --Well, Justice Blackmun, I'm not really sure what an ordinary bank would do in Indiana. 
    I'm sure that many banks would vary their type of arrangements of looking after their particular loan. 
    However, the Mennonite Board of Missions is not a professional money-lending institution. 
    It's a charitable religious organization, a branch of the Mennonite Church. 
    They were not in the business of making money. 
    They loaned money--
speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="708.793" stopTime="710.541">
    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    But they went into the business in this case?

    Mr. William J. Cohen 
    --Much to their chagrin, at this time. 
    However--
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="715.400" stopTime="739.811">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Part of the response to Justice Blackmun's question, indeed, that in many cases banks and insurance companies that have numerous mortgages that they are holding arrange... make arrangements to see that all of the legal publications are sent to them and checked by someone. 
    That's inherent in the notice by publication system, is it not?
speaker="william_j_cohen" startTime="739.811" stopTime="753.493">
    Mr. William J. Cohen 
    --I think notice by posting and publication to a bank or to the Mennonite Board of Missions, each, under Indiana law would be unconstitutional. 
    This Court--
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="753.493" stopTime="755.352">

    Even if the bank sees the notice?

    Mr. William J. Cohen 
    --Not if the bank actually saw the notice, Your Honor, no. 
    If the bank actually had actual notice, had seen the publication, we have a different case.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="765.160" stopTime="783.856">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Well, this is not inherence, and part of the system of lending on secured loans with mortgages or trusts, that there's an obligation on the part of the holder of the mortgage to keep in touch with the situation.
speaker="william_j_cohen" startTime="783.856" stopTime="811.657">
    Mr. William J. Cohen 
    I think the Mennonite Board of Missions did exactly that in this case. 
    They did the one most important thing they could do to protect their interests. 
    They recorded it, and it was a matter of public record. 
    It was notice to the Elkhart county auditor of what their interest was. 
    It was notice to the whole world of what their interest was. 
    There was no requirement under Indiana law that they do anything else. 
    A professional--
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="811.657" stopTime="825.480">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    There are no requirements for a bank or an insurance company to keep a close check on possible foreclosures or additional liens against their security, but they do it as a matter of prudence.
speaker="william_j_cohen" startTime="825.480" stopTime="902.480">
    Mr. William J. Cohen 
    --They have, perhaps, the resources and the sophistication to do that, but the Mennonite Board of Missions as a charitable organization was not accustomed to doing something like that nor did the law require that they do that. 
    They did everything, I submit, Mr. Chief Justice, that the law required them to do under the circumstances. 
    Mr. Cohen, was your client's interest in the property totally destroyed by the fact of the tax sale purchase alone, or is... to follow up on Justice Blackman's question, was there yet to be another proceeding whereby the tax sale purchaser confirmed his title? 
    His... our interest was finally adjudicated in the quiet title action itself but the adjudication was a foregone conclusion, is what I meant to say to Mr. Justice Blackmun. 
    That is, under Indiana law, once the tax deed purchaser obtained his tax deed from the county auditor after the expiration of the redemption period, under Indiana law he had the property free and clear.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="902.480" stopTime="911.492">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    So, it isn't simply a question of having to pay a penalty plus the amount the tax sale purchaser paid by the time your client had notice?
speaker="william_j_cohen" startTime="911.492" stopTime="923.392">
    Mr. William J. Cohen 
    That's correct. 
    By the time our client obtained actual notice of the tax sale itself it... the redemption period expired and they were never given an opportunity.

    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    How long was the redemption period?
speaker="william_j_cohen" startTime="925.845" stopTime="932.061">
    Mr. William J. Cohen 
    The redemption period is two years when the property is purchased by a private individual as in this case.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="932.061" stopTime="942.292">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    You mean, that for two years this property had been sold for taxes and your client had a mortgage on it, but had no knowledge of the fact that it had been sold for taxes?
speaker="william_j_cohen" startTime="942.292" stopTime="950.664">
    Mr. William J. Cohen 
    That's correct, Justice Rehnquist.

    Mr. William J. Cohen 
    As far as what type of sophisticated mortgage transaction there may be in the case you mentioned as far as escrowing the money, that is not what happened in this case. 
    The Mennonites are trusting people. 
    When they had the mortgage with Moore, and Moore was required to pay the taxes, they believed she would do it.

    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well do you think that's really the basis for a constitutional argument? 
    To say that you trusted someone to do it and, therefore, you're not bound by any constructive service or third party notice statutes at all?
speaker="william_j_cohen" startTime="1024.352" stopTime="1040.065">
    Mr. William J. Cohen 
    --Under the facts of this case I do believe that's correct, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, because I think the focus of this Court really should be on what the state did, or really what the state failed to do. 
    That is, the state failed to send adequate notice in this case.

    Mr. William J. Cohen 
    Had there been mailed notice to the Mennonite Board of Missions, yes. 
    In fact, as this case was pending... as it worked its way up the appellate level in the State of Indiana, the Indiana legislature actually amended the tax sale statutes, and they now provide for the very type of notice that we are requesting here.

    I submit that that's in all likelihood true, Justice Blackmun.

    But, confining ourselves to the specific facts of this case, this Court has said that adequate notice under due process is notice reasonably calculated to inform interested persons of a pending action to provide them an opportunity to appear and assert their rights. 
    In this particular case, under the Indiana statute in effect at the time this case arose, notice by posting and publication is simply inadequate, that it would be a very relative, easy matter for the Elkhart County auditor to have sent notice by mail. 
    This Court has set forth the balancing test of what should be looked at as far as what due process is accorded in a given situation. 
    In this case, the private interest at stake is the permanent loss of the Mennonite Board of Missions' mortgage without any adequate notice of the initial tax sale.

    Mr. William J. Cohen 
    --That is correct, Mr. Chief Justice. 
    But the comparison with the facts of this case as to what happened in Mullane, there... I submit to this Court, this case falls squarely within Mullane, that this case cannot really be distinguished from Mullane. 
    And on that basis, I submit that this Court would have to reverse the Indiana Court of Appeals. 
    And this case, I submit, Mr. Chief Justice, also falls squarely within the case decided by this Court, the City... Walker versus City of Hutchinson cases. 
    In that case this Court said that notice by publication only of a condemnation action where the owner of the property's name and address were a matter of public record is unconstitutional. 
    And similarly this Court in City... Schroeder versus City of New York did the same thing. 
    In that case it was another condemnation action and the owner's name and address was a matter of public record and this Court held the New York statute in that case unconstitutional for the same reason. 
    That is, there was not adequate notice given where the name and address is known, that due process requires at a minimum notice by mail. 
    This Court recently, just last term, in Green v. Lindsey reaffirmed those well-entrenched principles established in Mullane. 
    The Green v. Lindsey case involved the Kentucky forceful entry and detainer act. 
    In that case the procedure utilized by Kentucky is more likely intended to reach a tenant. 
    The case involved an eviction of a tenant and in the Kentucky statutes it first provided for personal service by the sheriff. 
    There was absolutely no requirement of personal service in this case. 
    If the tenant was not home that case provided for posting on the door of the tenant's apartment. 
    I submit to this Court that posting on the property or an intrusion on the property by the state is far more likely or reasonably calculated to inform a person of an eviction action than is the form of notice chosen by Indiana in this case. 
    There have been other states that have considered virtually the same question as raised in this case. 
    In the State of Arizona, the Arizona Supreme Court, back in 1954, determined that the sale of property by posting... rather publication... only violated due process as established by this Court in the Mullane case and in the Schroeder case. 
    The State of Florida has ruled the same way.

   Argument of Robert W. Miller

    Mr. Robert W. Miller 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    I believe the beginning point is to determine whether or not this is a property right. 
    And we concede that the Mennonite Board of Missions' interest in this real estate is a "property right". 
    But I think the first place to begin is that the Court should understand and determine under Indiana law that a mortgagee is not an owner of any property. 
    The Furnish case which is a case in Indiana where the supreme court reiterated the decision that it made in Mennonite Board versus Adams, I quote, 
    "that a mortgagee is not an owner as well established by Indiana law, and further, a mortgagee has not title to the land mortgaged. " 
    Now that is mentioned because, in a due process question as such as is before the Court, Court... case law indicates that there is a balancing test.

    Mr. Robert W. Miller 
    The question wouldn't be any different? 
    I don't know. 
    I only know in Indiana there is no interest in real estate. 
    Arizona, the last case, as I call it, is the only case, I submit, at least that I can find, that has answered the question as to whether a mortgagee requires notice by mail in the 50 jurisdictions, excluding Puerto Rico and others.

    Mr. Robert W. Miller 
    --Let me answer it this way. 
    I'll get to that and some of the questions that were asked earlier. 
    The question is, is a mortgage a significant property interest? 
    One thing the Court should note for the balancing test that comes next is that in Indiana it's no... it's not one of the bundle of sticks that I learned about. 
    It's a lien.

    In Indiana a mortgagee has no interest in real property. 
    It does not have legal interest, equitable interest, none of the bundle of sticks. 
    What it has is a "property right" to have a lien on a piece of property that at a future date it may be able to sell to satisfy an obligation. 
    If this Court would determine that it's not a significant interest in property, it would be a finding of... to affirm the Court of Appeals. 
    In the... if the Court determines that it is a property right, the next question is, we have to balance the interests.

    Each has a lien.
speaker="robert_w_miller" startTime="1928.098" stopTime="2150.399">
    Mr. Robert W. Miller 
    --Each has a lien. 
    Now, in some states, it may be that an interest in a mortgage is an equitable interest in the real estate. 
    I want the Court to know that in Indiana it is not. 
    The second question, and I think my opponent didn't make it clear... my research indicates that this Court has never determined that notice by publication is not constitutionally sufficient for an owner of real estate sold at a tax sale or a tax deed. 
    There are extremely good reasons as to why notice by publication is or would be sufficient. 
    There is only one state, and that is Arizona, that I can find that indicates that notice by mail is required to a mortgage holder or a lien holder, and that is, Laz. 
    The law review article that was mentioned as 84 Yale Law Journal indicated at the time of the writing there were 21 states whose statutes say that notice by publication to the owner of the real estate is constitutionally sufficient. 
    In my research, it indicates that 33 states indicate that notice to a mortgage holder is only done by publication. 
    Of the other states, 33, just publication, to a mortgage holder. 
    And I must say to the Court, I've given the benefit of the doubts, and some of them are very confusing. 
    New York, for example, I understand reading it, has an alternate method. 
    They can either go publication or they can go actual notice to the owner. 
    Texas, I don't understand at all. 
    I've put that in one of the other states. 
    Now the question has never been briefed or argued before this Court, whether notice by publication to divest a land owner of his interests in real estate if he doesn't pay his taxes, has never been decided. 
    The... and there are courts who have decided that it is permissible to give notice mere... by mere publication to divest a land owner of his interests in real estate by not paying his taxes, that's Coleman v. Sheeve. 
    And that's the district court of... it's in the District of Columbia in the Court of Appeals in 1976. 
    In the Township of Montville... that's an Arizona... excuse me, a New Jersey case, four to three determined that notice by publication is insufficient constitutionally under the the Mullane test. 
    The dissent in that case cited a number of reasons why, as to owners, that notice by publication would be sufficient. 
    He mentions that real estate taxes are a life blood of municipal government. 
    And it... the case is an extremely good case, and the judge at the end of that indicates that realizing the due process notice requirement he would follow Mullane in all cases where there is a significant interest of property and he would carve out an exception for taxes. 
    People, owners know they're due. 
    It's a just system. 
    There's notice. 
    Everyone knows. 
    But I'm not here to argue that today. 
    We've skipped... I called that the missing link... we've skipped that. 
    This Court has never heard, as far as I know, the argument... at least made a decision, I understand they may have heard the argument, but they've never made that... rendered that opinion.

    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    May I ask you, Mr. Miller, does the dissent in the New Jersey case, which I have not read, or maybe you have if an argument ready, what is the state interest in not giving notice? 
    I suppose the state... you say it's a life blood... taxation is the life blood of the state, and they need the money. 
    Wouldn't it be to their interest to give notice to as many people who might possibly--

    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    --pay up?
speaker="robert_w_miller" startTime="2170.236" stopTime="2302.338">
    Mr. Robert W. Miller 
    --The answer to that is yes and no. 
    The practical answer is, I think, a state is interested in getting the money. 
    The state is also interested in doing it as cheaply and as efficiently as possible. 
    I can, unfortunately... you see, I believe that the state should give notice to owners by mail. 
    It makes a lot of sense. 
    I've read cases that frankly the other side has some arguments. 
    The only good one I could find is in the dissent in the Montville... Montville, New Jersey case, where the judge just says it's a just concept that you own it, you know you're supposed to pay the taxes. 
    The length of time in New Jersey was four years. 
    And after four years, you don't pay your taxes, you're putting a burden on the other taxpayers. 
    The state's not getting your money like it should. 
    If you don't pay it, you ought to know it, with exceptions, unless you're incompetent or something else. 
    And it is just fair. 
    And why should... notice to owners? 
    Well, that's the next question. 
    Is it notice to all those that have an interest in the property? 
    The Laz case in Arizona... their decision was based upon a statute that says you give notice to persons with an interest in the lot. 
    And the supreme court in Arizona decided, well, an interest means not only the owner but the mortgage lien holders, judgement lien holders, lists pendents notice. 
    In the Arizona dissent, they found in Arizona that that could cause a lot of problems. 
    Does the Elkhart County recorder or any recorder drive to the county seat, drive to the courthouse and check the judgment dockets for judgment liens? 
    A person who doesn't pay his mortgage, one would think, doesn't pay his bills. 
    One would think he'd get sued. 
    One would think would have judgments against him. 
    One would think those are liens on the real estate, so the possible work for mortgage companies and I don't want to... I'm trying to get to the issue of the mortgage, the lien holder. 
    To the owner it makes a lot of sense. 
    It's easy. 
    There are... and I'm not really here to argue... owners. 
    There are some reasonable reasons why it shouldn't be necessary.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="2302.338" stopTime="2323.986">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Even in the case of mortgages, it occurs to me that, although of course 70 or 80 percent of the mortgages are held by big institutions, when interest rates get real high as they have been in the last few years, there are a lot of purchase money mortgages held by individuals on second mortgage interests and the like and I suppose that's the area in which there's the possibility of this sort of thing happening.
speaker="robert_w_miller" startTime="2323.986" stopTime="2593.409">
    Mr. Robert W. Miller 
    Yes, there is. 
    And I think it's happening, and I think there is that possibility. 
    And I guess all I can say is that you better protect yourself and you better draw up the instrument or you have the attorney or yourself draw it up to protect yourself. 
    But to have trust in the person that is going to do it, to ignore the payment of taxes for five years, I don't know if that's constitutionally protected or should be. 
    I think the issue is... is that was this notice reasonably calculated, Mullane test, if we get that far. 
    But... and I think we have to... was it reasonably the notice, reasonably calculated under all the circumstances to apprise a lien holder of what action was going to be taken in giving that lien holder an opportunity to object, and in this case opportunity to pay the taxes if it chose. 
    Now, I submit that the Court of Appeals in this case said it quite well. 
    And that is, the Court of Appeals in this case, the Adams case, had its reasons in terms of was it reasonably calculated. 
    It says it is understandable while actual... why actual notice has not been extended to mortgagees. 
    Most mortgagees are in the business of lending money and as professional money lenders, prudence requires them to be aware of the conditions involving their collateral. 
    They can be expected to protect their interests by keeping records of the mortgagor's discharge of his obligations. 
    In a footnote it goes on to say the Mennonite Board of Missions may not be a professional money lender but it freely chose to enter an area of sophisticated financial investment and thereby necessarily chose to incur the risk inherent therein. 
    And I agree with that. 
    I also point out in Texaco Inc. v. Short, an Indiana case that was decided last year, the dissent in that case, by Justice Brenner at page 801, in a lawyers' edition. 
    Court... "The Court", that is the majority, 
    "would appear to treat property owners as businessmen of whom we do indeed expect the greatest attentiveness to regulatory obligations in the conduct of their business affairs. " 
    The Board... and I take umbrage at some of the things that, a, do not appear in the record, but Elkhart County's population of 150 thousand people... I honestly didn't know where to get a hold of the Mennonite Board of Missions. 
    I think that's all irrelevant. 
    It is not in the record. 
    They chose to do it. 
    They held the mortgage. 
    It wasn't a free mortgage. 
    It was seven percent. 
    As I recall it was in '73. 
    I think that was a reasonably marketable mortgage in '73. 
    It may have been under the market slightly. 
    It was an arm-length... arms-length transaction. 
    She was a woman, I think. 
    I've never met the individual. 
    And she was paying her mortgage. 
    Why she stopped, I don't know. 
    But we publish... or the state published notice to a... to the people that held the mortgages. 
    And as it was stated in Mathews v. Eldridge, the Social Security disability case, decided in this Court in 1971, talking about due process and notice, and it says all that is necessary is that the procedures be tailored in light of the decision to be made to the capacities and circumstances of those who are to be heard. 
    Now the question is would a letter have done it better. 
    In this case, no, which I'll bring out in a moment. 
    But notice by publication, I think the Chief Justice indicated that most institutions have employees, people. 
    I think that's the Nelson v. the City of New York, decided in 1956, in this case. 
    And that's where the notice of a tax sale to the owner went to the bookkeeper.

    Wouldn't you think that most of the professional moneylenders, big institutions whom you say can take care... whom you say can take care of themselves, would take care of themselves in a way that there would never be an occasion to have a tax sale or send out any notice. 
    They would follow... they would know when there... at least if they use some mechanisms, they would know... they would make sure that the taxes are paid. 
    So the classic cases in which, the universe of cases in which you're going to have to have a foreclosure or send out a notice are going to be reduced to a lot of people mostly who don't take care of themselves, and don't know enough to take care of themselves.

    Isn't that the primary reason in terms of getting... trying to liquidate the indebtedness, whether it's a tax sale or a mortgage sale. 
    Whoever has the money due is trying to get it back so there's a real purpose... the publication is not a matter of form. 
    It's a matter of substance, and there are people who are scanning the published notices every day in the week and every city in this county and deciding whether they want to go in and bid.

    Okay. 
    Do you concede that notice by mail would be more effective for the mortgagees?

    Mr. Robert W. Miller 
    In a... where the post office name and address of the mortgagee is in the system yes, it would be. 
    Now it depends, Justice, on each system. 
    The Elkhart County auditor... there's the Elkhart County recorder. 
    Those are not necessarily the same office, but... which I think is irrelevant. 
    But one of the problems, also, is how does the Court define mortgagee? 
    Is that lien holder, which can cover a number of problem areas with counties and states notifying all lien holders. 
    But the question that the Court, I believe one of them, has to decide is wasn't notice by publication reasonably calculated under the circumstances... the circumstances, I allege, as a mortgage company who chose to enter into a field of giving a mortgage and making a profit if not on the books but still a seven percent interest on the money as a... balancing it with the interests of the state. 
    The fact that they decided to enter into this field and even... in this case, even if the Court would determine that it's not reasonably calculated without hearing the arguments as to maybe why notice to publication to owners is all that is necessary. 
    I would point out... this is the, I believe, the most important argument I can make here under Mullane. 
    The brief of my Appellant, at page 27, has a footnote that indicates as follows: Indiana code 32-821 
    "requires the name and addresses of the mortgagee be on their recorded mortgage. " 
    That is not quite right. 
    That statute validates mortgages if they do not have the 
    "full name and post office address of the mortgagee as required by other older Indiana law. " 
    "And I quote, full name and post office address. " 
    The Joint Appendix in this case at page 45 has the address of the Mennonite Board of Missions as follows, Mennonite Board of Missions, a Corporation of Wayne County in the State of Ohio. 
    That is not a post office address. 
    That is not a mailing address.

    Mullane says, 
    "where the names and post office addresses of those affected by the proceedings are at hand the reason disappears. " 
    In the Mullane case, the trustee had on its books the names and addresses of the income beneficiaries. 
    I agree that if these are all the same people, and if we wanted to go outside the normal course of the auditor and/or the recorder, that we could have gotten a letter to them.

    Mr. Robert W. Miller 
    I have no idea. 
    I hold no mortgages. 
    I've never had the opportunity to use it. 
    That statute is used in my research in some of the... some of the other states. 
    The Appellant in this case has indicated in his brief and, again in that same footnote, that the law of the State of Indiana is that a deed and mortgage is taken to the auditor. 
    The law in the State in Indiana is, is that a deed, before it be recorded, is taken to the auditor and placed on there are the words to be entered for taxation, or words to that effect. 
    The auditor writes down who owns the property and their address and... so that the county knows, that are going to be taxed. 
    As to mortgages, the statute says and only says, that before the auditor makes that endorsement on the deed, he may require a tax identification number, and I emphasize may, on other instruments including mortgages that divest a person of a mortgage. 
    That sounds a little complicated, but Indiana has a law that if you have a mortgage on a piece of property, you pay less property taxes because you have that mortgage. 
    There is no requirement to take the mortgage to the auditor's office. 
    In other words, there's no way for an auditor under the Indiana scheme of things to have a name and post office address. 
    But in this case there was no post office address. 
    There was notice that was reasonably calculated in the general scheme of things and I reasonably submit under Mullane, even if the Court felt that all these mortgage holders should get notice that Mullane and all of the cases afterwards... in the case of Laz versus Arizona, they made a point that Laz versus Arizona requires a letter to a mortgage holder that the taxes, or the property's going to be sold, or it's going to be deeded. 
    But even in Laz, it says that's only to the mortgage or the lien holders whose names and post office addresses are in the public record without inquiry. 
    They're open and available, as was said in Mullane.

    Do you know whether that was continued after she defaulted on taxes?
speaker="william_j_cohen" startTime="3564.066" stopTime="3682.081">
    Mr. William J. Cohen 
    It was my understanding that she continued to pay everything and unbeknownst to the Mennonite Board of Missions, she did not pay the taxes right after the period of time to redeem the property expired. 
    She was asked to leave the property and she went to the Mennonite Board of Missions and informed them that she was in trouble. 
    The first time that they learned there was problem was from her at that time. 
    With respect to a question that was asked by Mr. Stevens, Justice Stevens. 
    In this case, the only interest of the state is for the collection and payment of taxes and that if mailed notice was sent to mortgagees that would actually further the states interest of collecting taxes. 
    In the brief, I cite an Indiana case where the mortgagor and there were... the mortgagor and the mortgagee, one or the other... their property was listed for sale for delinquent taxes and the county auditor mailed notice to... after the tax sale, mailed notice to the mortgagee, informed them that the property had been sold for delinquent taxes. 
    The mortgagee promptly paid the tax and, in investigating what happened as far as why the taxes hadn't been paid, learned that the property taxes... the payment had not gone onto a computer list and had it gone onto the computer list, it would have never made the tax sales in the first place. 
    So the mailing of notice would actually assist the state in notifying mortgagees who are likely to pay the taxes and in all likelihood would pay the taxes. 
    And it would further the state's interest of collecting the taxes as soon as possible and in a fast and expeditious manner.
