    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    The other case is 81-1938, United States v. Baggot. 
    It's here on certiorari to the Seventh Circuit. 
    It involves the same rules that were involved in the Sells case, disclosure of grand jury materials for civil uses is permitted by Federal Rule, and I quote from the Rule, "When so directed by a court preliminarily to or in connection with a judicial proceeding." 
    And the question in this case is whether an Internal Revenue Service investigation to determine a taxpayer's civil tax liability is within the meaning of the rule preliminarily to or in connection with a judicial proceeding. 
    And we agree with the Court of Appeals that it is not and affirmed the judgment of that Court. 
    Our reasons are detailed in an opinion filed today with the clerk. 
    The Chief Justice dissents and has filed a dissenting opinion.
