    We will hear arguments first this morning in Watt against Western Nuclear, Incorporated. 
    Mr. Garvey, you may proceed whenever you are ready.

    Mr. John H. Garvey 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court: 
    The issue in this case is whether gravel deposits which are susceptible to commercial exploitation are reserved to the United States under the Mineral Reservation and the Stock-Raising Homestead Act. 
    Respondent, Western Nuclear, owns a uranium mine about 12 miles south of Jeffrey City, Wyoming, a company town where its workers live. 
    It also mills the uranium a mile or two northeast of the town. 
    From the time in the early 1950s when Western Nuclear first located in this area, it acquired gravel for its various needs in Lander, Wyoming, about 65 miles away, and in Casper, Wyoming, about 85 miles away. 
    In 1975, finding that method of acquisition a little expensive, it acquired part of some land about a mile north of Jeffrey City where there was a deposit of gravel. 
    Respondent thereafter mined about 43,000 cubic yards of gravel from that deposit, or about 60,000 tons, which it used for making cement to line the sides of its mineshafts, for concrete aggregate for lining the streets and the sidewalks in Jeffrey City and for building roads on which to haul its ore. 
    The land on which the gravel deposit was located had been patented in 1926, under the Stock-Raising Homestead Act.

    Mr. John H. Garvey 
    It was in 1929 that the--

    Mr. John H. Garvey 
    --Department of the Interior decided Layman against Ellis. 
    The Homestead claim which was at stake in Layman against Ellis had been first located in 1925. 
    When the Bureau of Land Management learned of the appropriation of the gravel deposit, it informed respondent that its appropriation of the gravel was a trespass against the mineral interests of the United States reserved under the Stock-Raising Homestead Act and, after undertaking an appraisal of the property, concluded that respondent was liable in the amount of $13,000 for royalties for the gravel taken.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="177.282" stopTime="193.041">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Mr. Garvey, was this the first time that the government had brought such an action against claimant or user of gravel under the Farmers and Stockmen's Act... Stockmen's Homestead Act?
speaker="john_h_garvey" startTime="193.041" stopTime="221.043">
    Mr. John H. Garvey 
    To my knowledge, it was the first such action, although I should say that the history of the government's enforcement of this... of these rights is a little like what Mark Twain said about Wagner's music, it's actually better than it sounds. 
    Until 1955 these kinds of gravel deposits were not sold but were locatable under the Mining Act of 1872 and they--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="221.043" stopTime="221.728">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Until when?
speaker="john_h_garvey" startTime="221.728" stopTime="307.381">
    Mr. John H. Garvey 
    --1955. 
    And so anybody who wanted to acquire these deposits could just go on the land and take them with... after making accommodations with the homesteader. 
    After 1955, in fact, in 1957, promptly after the Common Varieties Act, which permitted sale of these deposits was passed, the Solicitor of Interior in a Solicitor's opinion addressed to the Director in Denver said that passage of this act shouldn't be understood to have relinquished the government's interest in gravel deposits on Stock-Raising Homestead Act lands. 
    All that the Common Varieties Act did was to change the method of disposal from location to sale. 
    And although it's difficult to say to what extent the people seeking gravel deposits on Stock-Raising Homestead Act lands actually get permission of the Department because of the way the records are kept in the resource area... there isn't any... there isn't any separate line on the form that they fill out to say what kind of lands gravel deposits are taken from... I notice that in the Trujillo case, on which respondent in the Court of Appeals relied, that the State of New Mexico in 1971 had acquired a permit from the Bureau of Land Management to acquire gravel deposits on Stock-Raising Homestead Act lands.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="307.381" stopTime="320.807">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well, I suppose a lot of holders of land patented under the Stock Raisers Act simply go ahead and use the gravel, or have in the past, on the assumption that it's not a mineral.
speaker="john_h_garvey" startTime="320.807" stopTime="332.496">
    Mr. John H. Garvey 
    That's entirely possible. 
    And it's also the case that the enforcement resources of the Bureau of Land Management are not such that they are able to police the use that's made of these deposits.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="332.496" stopTime="348.339">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    So, so far as you know, from the time of 1916, when the Stock Raisers Act was passed, until the bringing of this action was the first time the government had ever brought an action in court asserting that it retained title to gravel because it was a reserved mineral under the Stock Raisers Act?
speaker="john_h_garvey" startTime="348.339" stopTime="349.306">
    Mr. John H. Garvey 
    So far as I know, that's correct.

    Justice Byron R. White 
    But is the government's position narrow, that that... that on these, where the government reserves minerals on this kind of land, that it's a trespass for the rancher or owner to use any gravel? 
    I thought you were now limiting--

    In the District--

    Justice Byron R. White

    Mr. John H. Garvey

    If the deposit--

    As a matter of fact, it doesn't even belong to the government.
speaker="john_h_garvey" startTime="435.345" stopTime="435.813">
    Mr. John H. Garvey 
    --That's right.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="435.813" stopTime="451.989">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well, has the federal mining law ever treated something that was arguably a mineral as a mineral when it's found commercially but not a mineral when it's not found or used commercially? 
    Well, you can't even get a... you can't patent your mining claim unless it's a commercial deposit.
speaker="john_h_garvey" startTime="451.989" stopTime="455.491">
    Mr. John H. Garvey 
    Unless it's... unless it is a valuable mineral. 
    Under the mining law--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="455.491" stopTime="463.331">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Yes, but that... that depends on whether you can properly locate. 
    That doesn't... the definition of mineral has never turned on whether something-- 
    --No, no. 
    --was commercially used.
speaker="john_h_garvey" startTime="463.331" stopTime="501.589">
    Mr. John H. Garvey 
    --That is correct, although you have to bear in mind that under the mining law... what the Mining Act of 1872, for example, is talking about deposits on... on lands which the government owns in fee, so that it's possible to speak of minerals without taking any account of how much of the mineral is on the land. 
    On the other hand, where the government has severed the surface estate from the mineral estate, it's difficult to speak of... to say that the government has retained an interest in all minerals in the land simply because it would be virtually impossible for anybody on the surface to make any use of the surface without somehow interfering with some of the minerals that--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="501.589" stopTime="520.217">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well, but under the 1906 Act, or 16 Act, there certainly have been numerous instances, have there not, of entries by private individuals on land that was open... but where the subsurface was open to entry who proposed to become mineral claimants?
speaker="john_h_garvey" startTime="520.217" stopTime="521.050">
    Mr. John H. Garvey 
    --Certainly.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="521.050" stopTime="533.108">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    And there as in other branches of the mineral, I have never known of a court case that said the definition of a mineral turns on the degree to which it's commercially used.
speaker="john_h_garvey" startTime="533.108" stopTime="551.605">
    Mr. John H. Garvey 
    We don't maintain that the definition of a mineral turns on whether it's commercially usable. 
    We rather say that the minerals in which the government is interested under the Stock-Raising Homestead Acts are minerals which it is able to dispose of separately and which have some use apart from the land on which they're found.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="551.605" stopTime="558.259">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well, it is your contention that the reservation of minerals under the 1916 Act included all gravel?

    Mr. John H. Garvey 
    I don't know whether the Court has to reach--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="564.512" stopTime="569.150">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well, I am interested in reaching it right now by a yes-or-no answer from you, if I could.
speaker="john_h_garvey" startTime="569.150" stopTime="570.000">
    Mr. John H. Garvey 
    --Okay.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="570.000" stopTime="572.435">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    You have already answered it once, and you--
speaker="john_h_garvey" startTime="572.435" stopTime="632.140">
    Mr. John H. Garvey 
    It's... it's a little bit more complex. 
    As the passage of the Materials Act in 1947 made clear, there were some kinds of gravel that were locatable under the Mining Act and some kinds of gravel that were not. 
    Essentially, the distinction between the two types was that the kinds of gravel which were useful for making concrete for paving, for making cinder block, were reserved. 
    The kinds of gravel which were useful for purposes of fill or riprap... that is to say, large chunks six or eight inches in diameter... were not disposable under the Mining Act. 
    Those kinds were not considered minerals. 
    The reason I said the Court needn't reach that question in this case is that the kinds of gravel which respondent was using are the kinds of gravel that were disposable under the Mining Act. 
    Those other kinds which are useful for purposes of fill or for riprap are a question which the Court needn't reach in this case.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="632.140" stopTime="637.675">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    --Well, why do you say one is "disposable" under the Mineral Act and the other not?
speaker="john_h_garvey" startTime="637.675" stopTime="653.220">
    Mr. John H. Garvey 
    One was locatable as a mineral under the Mining Act of 1872. 
    The presence of that kind of gravel on the land in deposits sufficiently valuable to justify a location would permit somebody to go on the land with respect to location.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="653.220" stopTime="656.672">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Mr. Garvey, with respect to that kind of gravel, what is your answer to Justice Rehnquist's question?
speaker="john_h_garvey" startTime="656.672" stopTime="664.528">
    Mr. John H. Garvey 
    I would say that the Stock-Raising Homestead Act leaves open the possibility that that sort of gravel can be considered--

    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Can you answer it yes or no?

    Yes?

    Mr. John H. Garvey 
    The acts--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="667.913" stopTime="668.863">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    You think they do reserve it all?
speaker="john_h_garvey" startTime="668.863" stopTime="694.797">
    Mr. John H. Garvey 
    --The act says in the second sentence that the disposal of the mineral deposits on the land shall be subject to disposal in accordance with the provisions of the mineral land laws in force at the time of such disposal, which means that even though it may not have been disposable in 1916 it could well have become disposable and hence included within the mineral reservation with the passage of the Materials Act.
speaker="lewis_f_powell_jr" startTime="694.797" stopTime="706.153">
    Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. 
    Well, how will a rancher know whether a particular gravel is commercially... of commercial quality or not? 
    Does he have to go to the Department of the Interior and get a ruling before he makes any use of it himself?
speaker="john_h_garvey" startTime="706.153" stopTime="710.390">
    Mr. John H. Garvey 
    If he were in doubt, he could certainly ask the Bureau of Land Management.
speaker="lewis_f_powell_jr" startTime="710.390" stopTime="718.996">
    Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. 
    And perhaps commercial use that is unknown today may exist a few years from now?
speaker="john_h_garvey" startTime="718.996" stopTime="779.717">
    Mr. John H. Garvey 
    It's entirely possible, although I should point out that in that respect gravel is not different from other kinds of minerals under the Mining Act or under the... under the mining laws in general. 
    In 1915, a year before this act was passed, the Department of the Interior held that bauxite was not a locatable mineral even though it was known that bauxite contained uranium, simply because at that time there wasn't the technological process for extracting uranium from bauxite. 
    I doubt whether that would be followed today. 
    Or, to take another example, in 1949 Congress said that people were going on Stock-Raising Homestead Act lands in order to mine bentonite, which is used for drilling mud or for a process for collecting iron ore called taconite pelletizing. 
    And although bentonite wasn't used for those purposes in 1916, Congress recognized in 1949 that those had become minerals which would justify entry on stock Raising Homestead Acts from... Act lands for mining purposes. 
    Or uranium, for that matter.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="779.717" stopTime="798.948">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    In other words, before 1916 or whenever this first decision was made, or before the '29, whatever is the ore from which nuclear material is extracted would not have been regarded as a valuable mineral in that time, would it?
speaker="john_h_garvey" startTime="798.948" stopTime="812.838">
    Mr. John H. Garvey 
    I am... I was unable to find cases holding to that effect, undoubtedly because nobody had any use for the material. 
    It may well have been considered a mineral. 
    I doubt that it would have been considered a valuable mineral at that time.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="812.838" stopTime="820.694">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Didn't we have a case within recent years where it turned to some extent on the adjective "valuable" mineral, which--
speaker="john_h_garvey" startTime="820.694" stopTime="821.194">
    Mr. John H. Garvey 
    Correct.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="821.194" stopTime="822.144">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    --considers that--
speaker="john_h_garvey" startTime="822.144" stopTime="851.630">
    Mr. John H. Garvey 
    In Andrus against Shell Oil this Court decided that the interpretation of the mineral leasing Act of 1920 since the time of its passage by the Secretary of the Interior and by Congress suggested that oil shale was a valuable mineral before 1920 and so locatable under the Mining Act. 
    What we are maintaining in this case is much the same, that the consistent interpretation both by the Secretary and by Congress since passage of the Stock-Raising Homestead Act in that case.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="851.630" stopTime="862.271">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    --Well, how can you refer to a consistent interpretation when you have the gravel opinion sometime in the early teens, I think it was, and then the turnabout in 1929?
speaker="john_h_garvey" startTime="862.271" stopTime="896.694">
    Mr. John H. Garvey 
    I... I qualified my statement by saying that the consistent interpretation since the passage of the act. 
    There is no doubt that in Zimmerman against Brunson the Secretary held that gravel deposits, much like the gravel deposits in this case, would not disqualify land from being homesteaded because they should not be considered to make the land valuable for minerals. 
    I would suggest that when Congress passed the act in 1916, it may well have thought differently had it addressed the question about whether gravel was--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="896.694" stopTime="899.979">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    But that, Zimmerman was on the books when that was passed.
speaker="john_h_garvey" startTime="899.979" stopTime="977.579">
    Mr. John H. Garvey 
    --That's correct. 
    Zimmerman was on the books for 6 years at the time the act was passed. 
    But I might say that the decisions of this Court in cases like Northern Pacific against Soderburg had held that granite was a mineral reserved from the lands given to the Northern Pacific Railway, that the U.S. Geological Survey in 1913, 3 years after Zimmerman, had said that the presence of gravel deposits on land could make them lands valuable for minerals and so disposable under the mining laws. 
    Even the other decisions of the Secretary of the Interior at the time Zimmerman was decided suggested that materials like pumice and granite, which like gravel are now held as disposable under the Common Varieties Act, would make the land valuable for minerals. 
    But quite apart from all of that, the question in Zimmerman against Brunson was whether the land should be used for homesteading purposes or for mining purposes. 
    At that time if you got a homestead or a mining location, you got everything, the surface and the minerals. 
    And so by contrast, under the Stock-Raising Homestead Act the presence of gravel will not disqualify the land from being homesteaded. 
    Under those circumstances--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="977.579" stopTime="984.550">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    You think Congress intended a different definition of mineral in the Stock Raisers Act than it did in the Mining Act of 1872?

speaker="john_h_garvey" startTime="990.287" stopTime="1008.867">
    Mr. John H. Garvey 
    I think that Congress certainly meant to include in the Stock-Raising Homestead Act those minerals that were locatable under the mining law. 
    I also think in the second sentence of the act that Congress intended to leave open the possibility that the mineral reservation would be elastic in the sense that it could expand or contract.

    Mr. John H. Garvey 
    I assume that it is now locatable, that it is now subject to disposal under the Common Varieties Act, which speaks of common varieties of stone. 
    Granite deposits in uncommon varieties would now be still locatable under the Mining Act.

speaker="john_h_garvey" startTime="1035.435" stopTime="1086.201">
    Mr. John H. Garvey 
    The passage of the Common Varieties Act in 1955 did not act as a quit claim to the government's interest in these kinds of minerals. 
    What it did, rather, was simply to change the method of disposal of these minerals from location under the mining law to sale, because Congress expressed a concern that people who were locating common varieties of minerals weren't developing them in the way in which the Mining Act intended, much as, if I may draw an analogy, in passing the Mineral Leasing Act in 1920, what Congress did was to change the method of disposal of oil deposits, for example, from location under the mining law to leasing under the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920. 
    It didn't give up the government's interest in those minerals, it simply provided a different method for disposing of them.

    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    May I ask one other question while you pause. 
    As I understand it, the government's view is that although it will only assert a trespass claim when the gravel has commercial value, in fact it retains an interest in gravel that does not have commercial value? 
    That's correct, is it?

    Mr. John H. Garvey 
    I don't think the government has an interest in coal when it has no commercial value. 
    Let me give you another example. 
    When you grow hydrangeas, the blue color in hydrangeas is caused by a compound of aluminum. 
    To say that the stock-raising homesteader couldn't grow hydrangeas because he's using aluminum in the land would make it impossible to implement the--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1316.618" stopTime="1329.676">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Well, we aren't asking you whether the owner could use it. 
    I am asking you whether as a matter of legal theory you think the government has an ownership interest. 
    Assume there is aluminum in the soil. 
    Would you say that the government does not have an ownership interest in the aluminum?
speaker="john_h_garvey" startTime="1329.676" stopTime="1465.297">
    Mr. John H. Garvey 
    --I would say that the government does not have an ownership interest in the aluminum unless there is some... unless it is there in sufficient quantities to make it possible for the government to dispose of it. 
    The reason the government is taking this position is that in passing the Stock-Raising Homestead Act, what the government intended to do was to make multiple use of these semiarid lands in the West. 
    One use that it wanted to make of the lands was to encourage stock-raising homesteads. 
    What the... section 2 of the act says that the Secretary in classifying lands for entry under this act shall set apart lands that are chiefly valuable for grazing and forage farming. 
    Section 3 of the act says that in order to get a patent, what the entry man has to do is to improve the value of the land for stock-raising purposes. 
    It says in the reports. 
    It suggests that he ought to do things like building fences or building silos or digging wells. 
    That's one use that the government wanted to make of the lands. 
    And the reports say that the farmer-stockman is not seeking and does not desire the minerals, his experience and efforts being in the line of stock raising and farming. 
    That's one use the government wanted to make. 
    And the other use that the government wanted to make was to develop the mineral estate. 
    There was a lot of concern expressed at the time of the passage that the... that the lands being given away, 640 acres or one square mile, might, again in the words of the report, might withdraw immense areas from prospecting and mineral development. 
    And so whenever they talk about the size of the estate being given away, they're careful to say that all minerals are reserved. 
    Now, what the government tried to do in making multiple use of the lands like that was to define the estates that it was giving to the... to the surface owner and to the mineral entry man in terms of the intended use to be made of the property. 
    It doesn't make sense for the government to claim that it retains and can prevent any use by the stock-raising homesteader of minerals that appear on the land in traces insufficient to justify disposal by any means.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1465.297" stopTime="1478.974">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Well, let me question that. 
    The literal language reserves to the United States all the coal, but you say that doesn't really mean all the coal, it only means all the commercially valuable coal. 
    Is that correct?
speaker="john_h_garvey" startTime="1478.974" stopTime="1480.157">
    Mr. John H. Garvey 
    That's correct.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1480.157" stopTime="1497.018">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    So with each time a stockyard patentee comes across any trace of coal on his land, he's got to wonder whether it belongs to the government or belongs to him, and he's got to make a judgment whether it's, quote, commercially valuable?
speaker="john_h_garvey" startTime="1497.018" stopTime="1531.776">
    Mr. John H. Garvey 
    That's correct, although I should say that with respect to coal, as with respect to gravel in this case, even under the Coal Lands Acts, like the Act of 1909, 1910, 1912, the government recognized explicitly in the case of the 1909 and 1910 Acts and by decision of the Secretary in the case of the 1912 Act, that people on the land could make use of the coal for domestic purposes. 
    They were simply not allowed to sell it, make commercial use of it. 
    So in a lot of cases, that concern wouldn't arise.

    Patentees are entitled to make whatever use they want of the land once they get the patent.

   Argument of Harley W. Shaver, III
speaker="harley_w_shaver_iii" startTime="1648.401" stopTime="1751.865">
    Mr. Harley W. Shaver, III 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    What we are attempting to ascertain in this case is whether or not the 1916 Congress specifically reserved gravel in its mineral reservation of all coal and other minerals. 
    I think the case law and the legislative history is particularly important to look at, the condition of the country at the time and what Congress was intending to do when it passed the 1916 Stock-Raising Homestead Act. 
    You will recall that between 1900 and 1910 President Roosevelt withdrew approximately 150 million acres of public lands from entry, both agricultural and mineral. 
    Subsequent to that time, in 1907, President Roosevelt urged Congress to pass legislation which would provide for a distinct title to the surface and reserve to the government underlying fuel and minerals. 
    Congress commenced passage of legislation in 1909. 
    The 1916 Stock-Raising Homestead Act was the last of the large land grants to settle the West, provided, as has been stated, for 640 acres rather than the normal 160 or 320, because that type of land, that barren semiarid West, required an acreage of that nature to support the plucky homesteader who could go out there and try to make a living. 
    Did Congress in 1916 intend to reserve gravel under that mineral reservation? 
    Congress--
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1751.865" stopTime="1768.125">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Well, isn't the question a little broader than that? 
    Did they intend to reserve everything except what was essential for the purposes of the grant; that is, grazing and farming, raising crops?
speaker="harley_w_shaver_iii" startTime="1768.125" stopTime="1831.532">
    Mr. Harley W. Shaver, III 
    --I think when one looks to the legislative history of the act, one sees it replete with the phrases: What we are attempting here is to settle up to one-fourth of the remaining public domain. 
    What the West needs is settlers, people, homes, communities, churches, railroads. 
    The Stock-Raising Homestead Act was a means to that end. 
    It was a means to settle the West. 
    I don't believe the Stock-Raising Homestead Act was just a means to graze stock. 
    The cattle barons had been grazing stock on the Western lands, the public domain, long before 1916. 
    And in fact, the lands were overgrazed at that time. 
    This was a means to get people out there, to tie them to communities, to build towns, to add to the tax rolls. 
    This was shortly after these Western Rocky Mountain states joined the Union, became states. 
    They needed people to add to the tax rolls. 
    The only way to get that was to get them out there to build cities, to make improvements. 
    I think that was the underlying purpose, the driving force behind the passage of the Stock-Raising Homestead Act.

    So that administrative tribunal I think was persuaded by some excellent advocacy on perhaps... on behalf of the mineral claimant when the mineral claimant kept stressing that it had now become valuable, it had now become valuable, and therefore decided it was a mineral sua sponte and forgot to worry about deciding whether it was a mineral ab initio but just decided it was because it was valuable.

    Mr. Harley W. Shaver, III 
    I think that in 1916 as well as in 1872, if you will allow me, Mr. Chief Justice, to give a little bit longer answer to a short question, that one cannot say the mineral reservation contemplated only those things known to be mineral at the time of the reservation. 
    Therefore, if uranium oxide or U308, from bauxite or whatever source... and it's found also in granite outcroppings... was not known to be valuable in concentrated forms at the time, I think it could subsequently be a reserved mineral. 
    But the difference is, as one court has pointed out, and several tribunals, that gravel and its uses have been known since time immemorial. 
    It was known in 1872, it was known at the time of the Zimmerman decision, it was known at the time of Hughes v. Florida, it was known at the time in 1916, and it is known today.

    Mr. Harley W. Shaver, III 
    I am certain that the uses do undergo some changes, but the consistent use for gravel throughout this period has been for road, road building and concrete aggregate.

    Oil shale, for example, wasn't worth anyone's attention at one point in history. 
    Is that not so?
speaker="harley_w_shaver_iii" startTime="2226.420" stopTime="2274.997">
    Mr. Harley W. Shaver, III 
    Oil shale at one time attracted attention prior to 1920 because claims were entered on the oil shale lands. 
    And there was a department decision that upheld those. 
    And later this Court upheld them. 
    But they were thought to be of value in the future, and the department recognized that and did not apply in the oil shale cases the present marketability test. 
    But that was not the same as deciding whether or not it was a mineral in the first instance. 
    Oil was a mineral, gas was a mineral. 
    These were the essence of hydrocarbons, and so they were regarded as minerals. 
    It was getting the same product although and albeit from a different means. 
    It is not the same at all as talking about gravel.

    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Mr. Shaver, do you agree with the Solicitor General, however, that under the 1872 Mineral Location Act that valuable, commercially valuable, gravel deposits could have been located under that act even at the time of Zimmerman?
speaker="harley_w_shaver_iii" startTime="2293.895" stopTime="2354.885">
    Mr. Harley W. Shaver, III 
    Absolutely not, Justice O'Connor. 
    What the mining law provided and what was in the departmental decisions is the common varieties of special distinct characteristics could be located under the mining laws. 
    We can see an example today. 
    Clay has never been locatable under the mining laws. 
    However, bentonite may be. 
    Sand and gravel has never been locatable under the mining laws until Layman, and sand has probably not been locatable unless it possesses special and distinct characteristics such as for the making of lead crystal. 
    That has always throughout the mining law been the differentiation. 
    Ordinary gravel was never locatable until the Layman decision. 
    So, no, I do not agree that just because it's commercially exploitable equates to special and distinct characteristics. 
    In fact, the Secretary has gone to great lengths to point to the contrary.

    So the agricultural entry man could have appealed it as well as the mineral claimant?
speaker="harley_w_shaver_iii" startTime="2376.799" stopTime="2420.125">
    Mr. Harley W. Shaver, III 
    --I imagine that they could have. 
    They had a contract between themselves, in reading the case. 
    The mineral claimant and the agricultural claimant, before the thing was taken for an administrative decision, had a contract. 
    I am not privy to all of the terms of the contract, but it did provide that one would stay away from the other's domain pending the case. 
    I don't know the rest of it. 
    The case does make reference to the fact that the Secretary in following Zimmerman in the initial administrative decision... or rather the Commissioner of Public Lands in following Zimmerman in the Layman case was concerned that this land was being acquired, that the mineral claimant was just trying to jump the claim of the agricultural entry man.

    Justice O'Connor, I am not aware of the first patent issued, but I would assume that it would have been shortly after the Layman v. Ellis case if that were a commercially viable gravel deposit because that was the first case where gravel had been held to be locatable in a contest. 
    Up until then it was not.

    Isn't that why they passed the '55 Act?
speaker="harley_w_shaver_iii" startTime="2631.562" stopTime="2807.577">
    Mr. Harley W. Shaver, III 
    --I think that that is one of the reasons, but if we will take and look at the legislative history of common varieties, gravel was not specifically considered nor were other common surface constituents specifically considered until... by Congress until 1943. 
    In 1943 Senator Hatch brought a bill before Congress under the Emergency Wartime Declaration Act, providing for the disposal from public lands of sand, gravel, mesquite, clay, et cetera. 
    Those particular substances were referred to by Senator Hatch in the proposed bill as substances or materials. 
    Senator Harold Ickes at the same time wrote a letter to Congress setting forth that he was in accord with this legislastion and also referred to these substances as materials. 
    Congress passed that act in 1944, and it provided for the disposal of surface materials. 
    One of those materials was gravel. 
    One was sand. 
    One was also clay. 
    And I might point out that clay has never become locatable. 
    In 1947, because the '44 Act had expired by its terms because World War II was over, it was thought necessary for Congress to pass some additional legislation to reimplement these provisions. 
    The 1947 Act, as initially passed, was what was referred to as the Materials Act of 1947. 
    That is one of the things that was cited in the trespass notice to respondent. 
    The 1947 Act, as initially passed, referred to surface materials, clay... excuse me... sand, gravel, stone, manzenite, et cetera. 
    It was not until 1955, when the Surface Resources, or Common Varieties, Act was passed, which you made reference to, Justice O'Connor, that the 1947 Act was amended, the Materials Act, so that it would complement the '55 Act. 
    At that time, Congress adopted an approved classification system, on the one hand for mineral materials, on the other hand for vegetative materials. 
    You line up the vegetative materials over here and the mineral materials over here. 
    It's the first time that the word "mineral" materials qualified the term "materials" as opposed to vegetative. 
    So now the government in 1975 has come full circle. 
    They started out with substances and materials. 
    In '47 they were materials. 
    In '55 they were mineral materials. 
    And now in '75 all of a sudden we have gravel as a mineral. 
    And that's the legislative history. 
    And the only way it became a mineral is by administrative imagination. 
    It was always before that a material.

    Mr. Harley W. Shaver, III 
    The issue here I don't believe is one of discussing the location or location requirements pre or since Coleman, but deciding what the intent of the 1916 Congress was. 
    And it seems impossible to consider that in preserving the mineral estate to the government, that the 1916 Congress or anyone could have ever thought that miners would go out West to mine a valuable gravel deposit. 
    And mind you that gravel is normally referred to as gravel pits, not gravel mines. 
    The whole history of it would denote that it's not considered a mineral.

    Open-pit mines, because the ore is extracted by open-pit method. 
    But gravel pits in fact--

    --Mr. Chief Justice, I was just trying to make reference to the common ordinary association of the term in every-day use. 
    One digs gravel, one has gravel pits. 
    One has open-pit mines but one doesn't normally refer to open-pit gravel mines, just refer to gravel pits. 
    I would also point out that the case in this instance where this gravel was dug, as the government pointed out, from a ranch which Western Nuclear acquired, this wasn't just a piece of ground acquired to obtain the gravel, it was a ranch that Western Nuclear acquired. 
    And the government has made the assertion in its brief that the ranch was acquired specifically to obtain the gravel. 
    This is less than the $13,000 case. 
    The respondent did not acquire a several-thousand-acre ranch for the devious purpose of just acquiring a gravel deposit. 
    It just doesn't stand to reason.

    Mr. Garvey, do you have anything further? 
   
   
   
   Rebuttal of John H. Garvey
speaker="john_h_garvey" startTime="3346.774" stopTime="3492.585">
    Mr. John H. Garvey 
    I would just like to make three brief points. 
    The first is in the Court of Appeals, respondent's brief at page 2 said, in March of 1975 in order to obtain a ready and convenient source of gravel and for other purposes, Western Nuclear acquired in fee a substantial piece of ranch property which included the subject land. 
    The second point that I would like to make is there has been some uncertainty about the purpose and effect of the Materials Act of 1947 and its predecessor, the Act of 1944, for disposing of gravel which could not otherwise be disposed of. 
    Justice Rehnquist asked at the beginning of my argument whether the government claimed all gravel under its reservation in the Stock-Raising Homestead Act. 
    And I hesitated because until 1944 gravel in deposits, gravel useful for purposes of fill or riprap or uses like that rather than gravel useful for making concrete and hot-mix aggregate was not locatable under the mining laws and there was no way of disposing of that kind of gravel at the time. 
    The reason I hesitated in saying that the government does... needn't claim all gravel in this case is that the kind of gravel which is at stake in this case is the kind of gravel that was locatable under the mining laws and could be disposed of before 1944. 
    Justice O'Connor, you asked whether the government was saying that this kind of gravel was not common variety gravel. 
    The government does... the government admits that it was common variety gravel in the sense in which the 1955 Act uses the word "common variety". 
    That is not to say that it was not locatable under the Mining Act of 1872. 
    The third point I would like to make relates to Justice Brennan's concern about this question not having been raised before. 
    In the District Court the government stated... this is in the appendix to the respondent's brief in opposition... what the United States is concerned about are commercial gravel operations. 
    The United States does not see how a commercial gravel operation in any way, shape, or form lends itself to--

    Mr. John H. Garvey 
    --This is in page 5A.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="3496.120" stopTime="3500.440">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Thank you. 
    Mr. Garvey, was the government's statement there made in the connection with an oral argument?
speaker="john_h_garvey" startTime="3500.440" stopTime="3537.613">
    Mr. John H. Garvey 
    It was made in connection with a post-judgment motion by the Wyoming Stock Growers Association for motion for a new trial or a motion to alter or amend the judgment. 
    The Wyoming Stock Growers Association was concerned that the District Judge's opinion did not address their claim to use of the gravel. 
    The government said, we are not deciding that question in this case. 
    We don't contend that they're not allowed to use it. 
    And the government and the Stock Growers thereafter stipulated that the decision by the District Court would have no res judicata effect on claims by ranchers to use--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="3537.613" stopTime="3544.803">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Was there a stipulation as to the fact of whether or not there was commercial gravel involved, commercially usable gravel?
speaker="john_h_garvey" startTime="3544.803" stopTime="3618.017">
    Mr. John H. Garvey 
    --No, there was not a stipulation, although there was never an issue about that. 
    The Bureau of Land Management took the position that it was only salable gravel deposits that they were concerned with. 
    They appraised the land and decided that the fair market value in that market for the gravel was 30 cents a cubic yard. 
    The Interior Board of Land Appeals, page 65A... 65A of the government's appendix... Interior Board of Land Appeals said that it is thus clear that gravel in a valuable deposit is a mineral reserve to the United States in patents issued under the Stock-Raising Homestead Act, and went on to say that the respondent had introduced no evidence which led it to question the appraisal which had been made by the Bureau of Land Management, and for that reason, because there was no factual evidence to contradict the appraisal, would not... would not give them a hearing. 
    Just one last point. 
    In the Court of Appeals, the government's brief, as the first issue presented, said the issue is whether the District Court correctly concluded that the Stock-Raising Homestead Act in its legislative history show that Congress intended to reserve all gravel deposits susceptible to commercial exploitation on lands patented under the act.
