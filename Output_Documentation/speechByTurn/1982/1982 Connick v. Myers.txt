    Justice Byron R. White 
    The second case is a Connick against Myers which is here from the Fifth Circuit Court of -- Court of Appeals. 
    The petitioner, Myers is an Assistant -- was an Assistant District Attorney in New Orleans. 
    And one day -- one day she circulated a -- a questionnaire in the office among her -- to her colleagues asking what they thought about the office's transfer policy, asking how office morale was and their opinion, and asking whether -- what degree of confidence they had in their superiors. 
    And also, whether they felt that they were under some pressure to perform political duties. 
    When petitioner, Connick, the District Attorney heard about this, he thought it was an act of insubordination and discharged Myers. 
    She then filed suit, claiming that her discharge violated her First Amendment rights. 
    The District Court and the Court of Appeals agreed with her and ordered to -- her reinstatement with backpay. 
    We granted certiorari and we reverse that judgment. 
    In our view, Myers' First Amendment rights were not violated and our reasons for thinking so were stated in an opinion which we have filed with the clerk. 
    Justice Brennan joined by Justices Marshall, Blackmun and Stevens has filed a dissenting opinion.
