    Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. 
    This case is hereon certiorari to the Court Of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. 
    Under South Dakota's Habitual Offender Law, respondent Helm was sentenced to life imprisonment without possibility of parole. 
    This sentence was occasioned by his issuing a $100 check without an account. 
    This is a felony in South Dakota and was Helm's seventh offense. Over a period of 15 years, all classified as felonies under state law. 
    The other six offenses also were nonviolent. 
    They included third-degree burglaries obtaining money under false pretenses, a larceny as defined by the State and drunk driving. 
    Respondent was 36-year-old at the time of his sentencing. 
    He was not a professional criminal. 
    He is addicted to alcohol with consequent difficulty in obtaining employment and retaining it. 
    After exhausting state remedies, Helm sought habeas corpus relief in federal court contending that his sentence constituted cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment. 
    The Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit agreed and granted the writ. 
    Now, prior cases established that the Eighth Amendment prohibits disproportionate sentences, as well as punishment that is inherently barbaric. 
    In determining disproportionality, we examine a number of objective factors. 
    These factors are set forth in the opinion we file today. 
    On the basis of these factors, we find that respondent's sentence to life imprisonment without possibility of parole is grossly disproportionate to his crimes. 
    Accordingly, we affirm the Court of Appeals. 
    Our opinion makes clear however that invalidating an imprisonment sentence imposed under state law is action reserved only for the most exceptional cases. 
    The Chief Justice has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justices White, Rehnquist and O'Connor joined.
