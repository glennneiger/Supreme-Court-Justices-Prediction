United States v. Villamonte-Marquez

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    We will hear arguments next in the United States against Villamonte-Marquez. 
    Mr. Alito, you may proceed whenever you are ready.
speaker="samuel_alito_jr" startTime="6.015" stopTime="256.898">
    Mr. Samuel A. Alito Jr. 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, since before the adoption of the Fourth Amendment, Customs officers have been authorized by federal statute to conduct suspicionless boardings of vessels for the purpose of checking their documents. 
    The issue in this case is whether such boardings in inland waters constitute unreasonable searches or seizures. 
    The facts of this case may be briefly summarized. 
    At about 11:30 in the morning, in March, 1980, a patrolling Customs officer spotted a 40-foot sailboat equipped with a diesel engine, anchored about 18 miles inland, in the Calcasieu River Ship Channel, which is a waterway connecting the Gulf of Mexico to the Customs port of entry at Lake Charles, Louisiana. 
    The officer and those on board his boat had never before seen a sailboat in that waterway, which is traveled by large commercial vessels. 
    On the stern of the sailboat was the name of the vessel, the Henry Morgan II, and its hailing port, "Basilea", which it turns out is the Latin translation for Basel, Switzerland. 
    Although the officer did not recognize the name "Basilea", he correctly believed that it denoted a foreign port. 
    At this time, a large freighter was heading up the ship channel, and it created a huge wake that caused the sailboat to rock so violently back and forth that it appeared it was about to capsize. 
    In fact, at one point the sailboat's mast actually touched the water, and its keel emerged from the water. 
    The Customs officer called out to Respondent Hamparian, who was the only person visible on deck, and asked if he was all right, but Hamparian merely shrugged his shoulders, which suggested to the officer that he was unable to speak English. 
    The officer then decided to board the vessel for the purpose of checking the documents. 
    He did so, and while examining the documents, he detected the odor of burning marijuana. 
    He also saw through an open hatch burlap-wrapped bales of what he believed was marijuana. 
    The Respondents were then arrested. 
    The boat was searched. 
    Fifty-eight hundred pounds of marijuana, with a street value of about $7 million, was seized. 
    Respondents were convicted of drug offenses, but their convictions were reversed by the Court of Appeals on the ground that there was no reasonable suspicion of criminal activity, and therefore the officer was prohibited from boarding the vessel in inland waters for the purpose of checking the documents. 
    With these facts in mind, it bears emphasis that the only authority at issue in this case is the authority to board the vessel and check the documents, and not the authority to search any other portion of the craft. 
    It also bears emphasis that the Henry Morgan II was not a small American boat on an inland lake. 
    It was a seagoing foreign vessel on a ship channel connecting the open sea with the Customs port of entry, and it was located just a relatively short distance from the open sea. 
    Our position, of course, is that suspicionless boardings and inspections, whether on inland or Customs waters, are reasonable, and therefore do not violate the Fourth Amendment. 
    It is strong evidence of their reasonableness that they were authorized by the First Congress, which of course proposed the Bill of Rights to the States, and they have been continuously authorized by statute ever since. 
    Why is this so? 
    First, because there is simply no other adequate alternative way of enforcing the documentation laws, and the documentation laws serve many vital functions. 
    They are the primary method of identifying vessels. 
    They serve to regulate the entry and departure of persons and goods traveling by water. 
    They are used in collecting import and tonnage duties, in conserving natural resources, and promoting safe shipping and boating.

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Mr. Alito, you have been addressing the merits from the beginning. 
    What about mootness?

    Mr. Samuel A. Alito Jr. 
    Your Honor, this case is certainly not moot. 
    Both sides retain legally cognizable interests in the outcome of this case. 
    If the decision below is reversed, and Respondent's convictions are reinstated, the government will be able to seek their extradition. 
    They may be arrested and imprisoned if they are ever found in the United States, and at a minimum, reversal of the decision below will provide grounds for their exclusion--

    Mr. Samuel A. Alito Jr.

    I have thought about this quite a bit, and I can't think of an analogy. 
    I am not sure it is moot. 
    I think maybe you are right about mootness. 
    But I don't understand how you can have a conviction in a case where there is no underlying pleading. 
    I mean, you couldn't enter a judgment in a case if nobody ever filed a complaint. 
    How can you have a conviction without an indictment?

    Mr. Samuel A. Alito Jr. 
    I believe it reversed and remanded with instructions to take proceedings consistent with the decision, and since the principal evidence at trial was the evidence that had been suppressed, I believe that--

    Is it your position that if you were complying with the mandate of the Court of Appeals, you can't be charged with any waiver?

    Mr. Samuel A. Alito Jr. 
    --I think that's correct. 
    Otherwise, we would have to seek a stay in every case, and if the stay was denied, every stay case in which it was denied would have to go up to this Court, and if the stay was not granted, the case would become moot.

    It wouldn't necessarily follow that there would be a new trial, if the only evidence the government had was the evidence that was suppressed.

    Mr. Samuel A. Alito Jr. 
    Well, what I am saying is that when critical evidence is suppressed and a case is remanded to the District Court, the indictment is dismissed because a new trial is impractical, and that was what happened here, and I am sure that is what the Court of Appeals understood was going to happen when they decided this case.

    And that was consistent with the... if not ordered, it was certainly consistent with the mandate of the Court of Appeals? 
    Well, supposing you had a civil case where plaintiff got a judgment in a negligence case, and the appellate court set it aside and sent it back for a new trial, and the plaintiff went in and moved to dismiss his complaint.

    Counsel, let's get on with the merits of the case now.

    Mr. Samuel A. Alito Jr. 
    --Thank you. 
    As I was saying, there are two reasons why suspicionless boardings and document inspections are necessary. 
    First--
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="800.996" stopTime="816.178">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Excuse me, Mr. Alito. 
    May I ask you, in that respect, did the government argue in the Fifth Circuit that no reasonable suspicion was required or only that the officers in fact had reasonable suspicion? 
    Which was it?
speaker="samuel_alito_jr" startTime="816.178" stopTime="819.661">
    Mr. Samuel A. Alito Jr. 
    --We certainly raised the question of whether reasonable suspicion was required.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="819.661" stopTime="822.098">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Well, what did you argue? 
    Did you argue one or both?
speaker="samuel_alito_jr" startTime="822.098" stopTime="826.283">
    Mr. Samuel A. Alito Jr. 
    We argued... in our petition for rehearing, we argued both points.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="826.283" stopTime="828.361">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    By that, the original argument?
speaker="samuel_alito_jr" startTime="828.360" stopTime="891.365">
    Mr. Samuel A. Alito Jr. 
    Initially before the trial we merely argued that reasonable suspicion was present, but we did that for two good reasons. 
    First, the District Court had found that there was reasonable suspicion. 
    We believed he was correct. 
    We still believe he was correct. 
    Second, and more important, there were prior binding Fifth Circuit cases holding that reasonable suspicion was needed for boarding in inland waters, and therefore we saw no need to urge affirmance of the District Court decision on the ground that prior decisions binding on the panel ought to be reversed, but after the panel rendered its decision, then we raised the issue of whether reasonable suspicion was needed in our petition for rehearing. 
    There are no other adequate means of enforcing the documentation laws besides suspicionless boardings. 
    In addition, because of the long history of pervasive federal regulation of most aspects of maritime activity, persons aboard vessels within the jurisdiction of the United States have a greatly reduced expectation of privacy, especially with respect to the vessel's documents. 
    Let me first--

    Does this case fit within the border exception?

    Mr. Samuel A. Alito Jr. 
    --It does not fit within the classic border exception, but we believe it is necessary to effectively police the sea border. 
    The sea border is nothing but an imaginary line three miles from the coast. 
    Now, if a suspicionless boarding and document check is allowed only when there is reasonable suspicion to believe that a vessel has crossed the border, that is an impossible standard. 
    Unless the Customs officer actually observes the vessel crossing the border, he will usually have no way of detecting whether a border crossing has taken place.

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Let me pursue this, not on a little sailing vessel down there, but a British or a Swedish or a Norwegian or a Dutch vessel comes into the New York harbor. 
    Before they can open a hatch or discharge a passenger or do anything, our people board it and look at the papers, do they not, and they are permitted by statute to do it, and they can inspect the ship from stem to stern and top to bottom. 
    Is that not so?
speaker="samuel_alito_jr" startTime="1269.931" stopTime="1273.648">
    Mr. Samuel A. Alito Jr. 
    That is absolutely correct.

    Mr. Samuel A. Alito Jr. 
    No, I would suppose that someone attempting to set the record for the smallest vessel to make a trans-Atlantic crossing would be subject to those entry requirements.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1288.330" stopTime="1294.061">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    And this includes the health officers, and the Customs officers, and a whole range of people, does it not?
speaker="samuel_alito_jr" startTime="1294.061" stopTime="1381.823">
    Mr. Samuel A. Alito Jr. 
    That is correct, and that is why a vessel like the Henry Morgan II cannot have any legitimate expectation of privacy in U.S. waters. 
    On a vessel like that, Customs is expressly authorized by statute to put someone on board and leave him there as long as the vessel is in U.S. waters. 
    Now, as I was saying, inspection of the vessel's documents is vitally important in performing all of these important national functions, and this is so because there is simply no other way of effectively enforcing the documentation laws. 
    The markings on vessels, as we have attempted to show in the brief, are simply not satisfactory. 
    They can be easily falsified. 
    They are not very revealing, especially in the case of a foreign vessel, and even in the case of an American vessel, they do not disclose very much. 
    Respondents have suggested a number of alternatives, but I want to stress that none of these would be satisfactory. 
    Certainly hailing a vessel, as they suggest, is no substitute for looking at the documents, because it requires the Customs officers to take the word of the persons on board. 
    Checking the documents only in the case where there is reasonable suspicion of a border crossing, as I have tried to show, is also not acceptable, nor is it satisfactory to check with the documentation office by radio, for a number of reasons, including the fact that the information available from that office is severely limited.

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    And would it make any difference, for example, if it is on waters that don't empty into the seas, a lake or something like that? 
    They can still do all this?
speaker="samuel_alito_jr" startTime="1452.170" stopTime="1519.267">
    Mr. Samuel A. Alito Jr. 
    --It would... I believe the authority would extend to any navigable waters of the United States, because Customs has the... has enforcement authority that goes beyond policing the entry of goods coming from abroad, although that is perhaps their most highly visible responsibility. 
    They also have the duty to enforce all the shipping and navigation laws, and this would justify boarding many miles further inland than the one in this case. 
    But I want to stress that, of course, it is only the situation here that is at issue. 
    Let me now explain very briefly why suspicionless boardings and inspections of vessels entail a much lesser intrusion upon protected privacy interests than land inspections to which they are sometimes compared. 
    First of all, when a documentation check is made, a vessel is detained only briefly, if at all. 
    The inspecting... the boarding officer does not search the whole vessel. 
    He only searches the documents and makes a visit to the hold to look at the main beam number if that is appropriate based on the type of vessel. 
    He doesn't search the cargo or the cabins or the passenger compartments.

    We think that the necessity for suspicionless boardings and document checks is most important in that area, but the statute authorizes boardings and inspections in other areas, and I am not prepared to say that to the extent it goes further than what was necessary here, the statute is unconstitutional.

    In any event, we haven't got a lake case here today, have we?
speaker="samuel_alito_jr" startTime="1620.992" stopTime="1731.557">
    Mr. Samuel A. Alito Jr. 
    That's right. 
    We have a 40-foot foreign vessel, I want to stress, located not very far from the coast, and although it is masquerading as a pleasure vessel, in fact, it is engaged in a very lucrative, although illegal, trade. 
    It is carrying a $7 million cargo. 
    This is not a pleasure vessel, and a rule that tried to draw a distinction between pleasure vessels and commercial vessels would be subject to just this sort of abuse. 
    People engaged in violations of the documentation laws would use the sort of vessels that are commonly employed for recreational purposes, and would document them for recreational use. 
    The invasion of privacy involved in stopping a vessel and conducting a document check is significantly different from what is involved in conducting a discretionary vehicle stop on land. 
    First, and probably most important, vessels simply do not play the same central role in the lives of the average person as a passenger car does. 
    I suspect that most of the people in Court today used a passenger car this morning, and they will use one tonight. 
    I doubt that many people here used a vessel or will use one later in the day. 
    Land vessels have not historically been subject to the same close regulation as... excuse me. 
    Land vehicles have not been subject to the same close supervision as vessels. 
    In fact, the early statutes from which Customs authority derives specifically required probable cause or reasonable suspicion for searches on land. 
    In sum, the important interests served by the documentation laws in our judgment far outweigh their minimal intrusion upon privacy interests, and for that reason Customs' long-standing authority to conduct suspicionless boardings and inspections should be sustained. 
    Thank you.

   Argument of Richard I. Ieyoub
speaker="richard_i_ieyoub" startTime="1736.931" stopTime="1898.553">
    Mr. Richard I. Ieyoub 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, Your Honors, the boarding of the Henry Morgan II was pursuant to 19 USC 1581. 
    This statute grants government agents broader powers of search and seizure than any statute which has previously come before the Court for constitutional consideration. 
    It is even broader than the statute that was before the Court in Brignoni-Ponce, because in that particular situation there was at least a geographic limitation on the powers of border controls to conduct roving and random patrols and stops of vehicles near the border with Mexico. 
    There are absolutely no limitations within the statute on the powers of Customs agents to seize or search vessels and vehicles. 
    The agents may stop, board, and search any vessel, any time, any place in the United States. 
    Therefore, the time, place, manner, and scope of the boarding and search of the vessel is left to the unbridled discretion of the agent in the field, which this Court has always considered as an evil in this type of case. 
    The holding of the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeal was that the reasonableness standard of the Fourth Amendment required that Customs agents possess a reasonable suspicion of a law violation before boarding a vessel in inland waters pursuant to 19 USC 1581. 
    There was a limitation on these broad powers that were placed... that Customs agents enjoyed placed on it by the Fifth Circuit. 
    I think very definitely that the true nature of this particular patrol is important in this case. 
    First of all, insofar as the facts are concerned, this patrol was instigated and executed because of information which a Customs agent had received on the prior day, on March 5th, 1980, that there were two vessels in the Hackberry, Louisiana, area laden with marijuana. 
    Pursuant to that information, this patrol was formed, which included not only U.S. Customs agents, but included Louisiana State Police narcotics agents. 
    In fact, this was not a mere administrative search for documents. 
    This was clearly an investigatory, a criminal investigatory search that was made in order to obtain evidence to substantiate a criminal prosecution.

    There is no other explanation for his presence there except that fact.

    Mr. Richard I. Ieyoub 
    They certainly, Your Honor, do not have the right to board under 19 USC 1581. 
    There is a federal statute which was cited by the government, I think 19 USC 507. 
    However, this particular statute, the very nature of it indicates that Congress intended that any assistance given by a person to Customs agents in that particular respect was for the furtherance of a criminal search, or a search in criminal cases. 
    So, at least under the federal regulations or federal statutes, state narcotics agents do not have the right to board a vessel.

    Mr. Richard I. Ieyoub 
    --I think they could have done that, Your Honor. 
    The question, I think, in this case was whether or not the boarding was legal, and not whether or not... although I did contest that the search that took place after the boarding was illegal. 
    The Fifth Circuit did not decide that particular question. 
    The Fifth Circuit only held that the boarding itself was unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2172.160" stopTime="2174.799">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Because of the lack of some kind of reasonable suspicion.
speaker="richard_i_ieyoub" startTime="2174.799" stopTime="2261.874">
    Mr. Richard I. Ieyoub 
    That's correct. 
    That's correct, Your Honor. 
    The situation... even if we assume that the government, as the government contends, that the boarding in this case was purely an administrative documentation check, only in very unique and limited circumstances may even an administrative inspection or search of private premises be accomplished with an administrative warrant... without an administrative warrant or without a valid substitute therefore. 
    I think the government tried to argue that this particular inspection fell under the Colonnade-Biswell exception. 
    But this particular exception was a very narrow exception to the general rule, which requires a warrant for administrative inspections of residential and commercial premises. 
    The exception allowed warrantless regulatory searches of a pervasively regulated business to further an urgent federal interest, by statute. 
    However, the statute is very limiting in these particular types of cases. 
    The statute limits the time, scope, and place of these types of searches, and unless you have a valid statute which carefully and narrowly limits these particular inspections, then you need either an administrative warrant or some substitution for an administrative warrant, which we suggest in this case would be a reasonable suspicion of a law violation.

    So how do you deal with that?
speaker="richard_i_ieyoub" startTime="2303.060" stopTime="2402.676">
    Mr. Richard I. Ieyoub 
    --Well, in United States versus Demanett, which was a lower court case, they were faced with that particular proposition. 
    In fact, the same proposition has been cited by the government here. 
    And that particular court held, there has to be some way other than complete unbridled discretion in the hands of the agent in the field. 
    They did not rule out some type of border or some type of check point search. 
    They did not rule that out. 
    And certainly in the Calcasieu Ship Channel, which is not a very wide body of water at all, there certainly could have been that type of thing in the Calcasieu Ship Channel, where this particular vessel was sited. 
    There could have been a check point type situation. 
    Besides that, insofar as the documentation checks go, and insofar as the documentation laws and other regulatory objectives of this particular statute go, the minimal or the minimum... it certainly would not benefit that much, random, suspicionless, warrantless boardings of vessels would not necessarily benefit the documentation laws to such an extent that it would outweigh the tremendous possibility of abuse and threat to the privacy of the individual that this statute allows. 
    I think in Biswell, the Court stated that if the statute offers a great possibility of abuse, and there is a tremendous threat to the privacy of the individual, then you cannot fall within the Colonnade-Biswell exception.

    Mr. Richard I. Ieyoub

speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="2415.905" stopTime="2430.946">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    How would there be less intrusion of the privacy if the Customs boat had pulled alongside and said, 200 yards north there is a check point, pull your craft in for inspection?
speaker="richard_i_ieyoub" startTime="2430.946" stopTime="2472.680">
    Mr. Richard I. Ieyoub 
    --Well, first of all, the check point can be seen by all the vessels. 
    There is less of a subjective intrusion. 
    There is less fear that might be engendered when you see a check point where other vessels are being stopped. 
    There is a regular pattern that is followed in stopping all of the vessels that may be coming into a particular point. 
    And in that respect, it follows the Martinez-Fuerte rationale, that permanent check points are not as much an intrusion into the privacy of the individual as a roving patrol that makes random suspicionless searches. 
    And that is the difference between the check point and any of... the random searches.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="2472.680" stopTime="2477.693">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    But for the check point, they could have the stop and the search without suspicion?

    Mr. Richard I. Ieyoub

    Mr. Richard I. Ieyoub 
    Yes, I think so, Your Honor, because the Fifth Circuit has held that way. 
    In fact, I think it was in United States versus Whittaker in the Fifth Circuit, the Customs agent sited the vessel off the coast, and kept it under surveillance, and during the course of the surveillance there were certain articulable facts which were generated because of the nature of the boat, the type of the spray that it was throwing, the sluggish nature of its movement. 
    They followed her inland and then boarded her, and the Fifth Circuit said, that's fine. 
    You can do that, because you saw the border crossing.

    Mr. Richard I. Ieyoub 
    Well, that was their purpose. 
    The record doesn't reflect whether or not they actually did. 
    But they did site this particular vessel. 
    But the broadness of this particular statute is very important, because the Court has always held that whenever there is unbridled discretion in the hands of the officer in the field, then you have a problem here, and this particular statute does not make any provision whatsoever concerning the procedures that are to be used when these boardings take place. 
    Now, the government has said, well, this boarding only deals with the weather decks or the places that you can see. 
    The statute doesn't say that. 
    The statute simply says that you can board and examine the documents and the manifest. 
    You can board and inspect and search the vessel.

    What I think that the government is trying to do in this particular case is convert 19 USC 1581 into a writ of assistance that gives Customs agents total power to do anything they want insofar as vessel checks are concerned without any Fourth Amendment or constitutional constraints, and that's what they're trying to do in this particular case. 
    And the possibility that this will lead to abuse is very real. 
    They don't have the right to conduct random, suspicionless, warrantless stops, whether it be for a documentation check, or for a safety check, or what have you. 
    The Fourth Amendment does apply here. 
    The standard of reasonableness applies. 
    And I think this Court has recognized in numerous cases, in Brignoni-Ponce, in Almeida-Sanchez, and other cases, that the random... this discretion, the unbridled, unconstrained discretion in the hands of the officer in the field is what is very important insofar as the application of the reasonableness standard to the Fourth--

    There is also a difference in that it was made pursuant to a federal statute which grants broad powers of search and seizure which are unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment. 
    This was a random search by a roving patrol, and I think this Court in prior decisions has held that this is unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment.

    Mr. Samuel A. Alito Jr. 
    Two very brief points, Mr. Chief Justice. 
    First, if the Court wishes, we will submit a supplemental brief on the issue of whether dismissal of the indictment mooted this case. 
    Second, I want to emphasize--
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="3560.749" stopTime="3570.199">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Well, on that, will you please put in a copy of your order which the U.S. Attorney filed, the motion to dismiss the indictment?

    Mr. Samuel A. Alito Jr. 
    --Yes, Your Honor, we will look into that.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="3571.948" stopTime="3572.776">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    It is right here in the record.
speaker="samuel_alito_jr" startTime="3572.776" stopTime="3580.693">
    Mr. Samuel A. Alito Jr. 
    Well, Your Honor, as I said, that was done not because they had no further interest in pursuing this case.

    Well, it doesn't say... it just says he's the one.

    It was done because he wanted to comply with the mandate of the Court of Appeals.

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Do you have anything... Your time is not up.
speaker="samuel_alito_jr" startTime="3595.142" stopTime="3655.757">
    Mr. Samuel A. Alito Jr. 
    I am sorry. 
    The only other point I would like to add, Mr. Chief Justice, was that the crux of this case is that until a documentation inspection is conducted, it is not possible to know what sort of vessel Customs is dealing with, and that is why it's necessary, and that is illustrated graphically by this particular case. 
    Here, if the Henry Morgan II had been a documented boat from Basilea, Louisiana, or Mississippi, or Alaska, it would have had exactly the same markings, and here, a Customs patrol in a Louisiana ship channel came across a boat that bore the outward markings of a landlocked country 5,000 miles away. 
    The hailing port was written in Latin, and although the vessel bore Swiss markings, it was actually of French registry. 
    Because situations like this come up all the time, it is necessary to conduct a documentation check to determine whether any further procedures, including a full-scale border search, is appropriate.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3655.757" stopTime="3672.595">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, in your submission, it sounds like, your most recent one, anyway, is that on the facts of this case, this boarding was all right, but that you aren't pushing for any kind of a rule that you can search any... you can board any vessel that you find anchored 18 miles off the coast.
speaker="samuel_alito_jr" startTime="3672.595" stopTime="3678.624">
    Mr. Samuel A. Alito Jr. 
    No, I believe it is necessary to do that, because until you inspect the documents, you cannot--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3678.624" stopTime="3687.697">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    So you are saying any vessel you find anchored or under way 18 miles off the coast or any distance off the coast, for that matter, you can stop and make a document check?
speaker="samuel_alito_jr" startTime="3687.697" stopTime="3692.383">
    Mr. Samuel A. Alito Jr. 
    --We believe the statute is constitutional, and that is what it provides.

    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, you are not arguing about the search, I don't suppose.

    --Pardon me?

    Mr. Samuel A. Alito Jr. 
    That is not the issue here. 
    All that was conducted here was a document check.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="3705.862" stopTime="3711.547">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    But I take your argument to be, as applied here, it meets constitutional standards.

    Mr. Samuel A. Alito Jr. 
    That's correct.
