Illinois v. Lafayette
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="0.000" stopTime="81.265">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    We will hear arguments next in Illinois against Lafayette. 
    Mr. Ficaro, you may proceed whenever you are ready.

    Mr. Michael A. Ficaro 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court. 
    The Fourth Amendment, through the requirement of warrants based upon probable cause, seeks to protect citizens and their effects from governmental intrusions by unreasonable searches and seizures. 
    But not all searches and seizures without warrant offend the limits imposed by the Fourth Amendment. 
    We submit that Illinois v. Lafayette is one such case that does not offend the limits of the Fourth Amendment. 
    We urge this Court to find that the delayed search at the station house of the purse of the Respondent, Ralph Lafayette, after a valid custodial arrest was reasonable under the Fourth Amendment. 
    We submit to this Court that this post-arrest warrantless search was permissible both as incidental to arrest and as a valid inventory search.

    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Now, Mr. Ficaro, you did not make that search incident to an arrest argument below, did you?
speaker="michael_a_ficaro" startTime="149.377" stopTime="194.328">
    Mr. Michael A. Ficaro 
    Yes, Your Honor, that argument was made in the trial court. 
    Although in one line of the Appellate Court opinion, the Appellate Court found that it was waived, the Court went on to discuss the issue citing Ross, Belton, Sanders, Chadwick, Edwards, and then in its conclusion in the holding of the case the Court said that we find that this search is not incidental to arrest and thus violates the Fourth Amendment. 
    So under Jenkins v. Georgia, the Appellate Court of Illinois reached and decided the constitutional issue. 
    The fact--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="194.328" stopTime="207.604">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Before it got to the end of its opinion on page 3A of the cert petition it said we find the state has waived this argument for the purposes of appeal by falling to raise it at the suppression hearing. 
    Don't we have to take that at face value?
speaker="michael_a_ficaro" startTime="207.604" stopTime="218.521">
    Mr. Michael A. Ficaro 
    --There are three ways that this case is before this Court. 
    One is on the theory of valid... the inventory search which was not--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="218.521" stopTime="227.002">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    I understand. 
    This only goes, as Justice O'Connor's question, only to the question of search incident to arrest. 
    On that they say in so many words you waived that.
speaker="michael_a_ficaro" startTime="227.002" stopTime="265.829">
    Mr. Michael A. Ficaro 
    --Although they said that under Jenkins v. Georgia, they reached the issue. 
    The question of waiver, whether or not this is an independent and adequate ground... this is not an independent ground, the issue of waiver. 
    The Illinois courts follow procedural and substantive laws to find under the Fourth Amendment. 
    In People v. Clark, in appellate courts, People v. Renke, the courts of Illinois have said that their interpretation of the Fourth Amendment is coextensive with the scope of the federal interpretation by this Court of the Constitution.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="265.829" stopTime="273.687">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    But that has nothing to do with whether an argument might be waived, does it, the fact that the two constitutions might be coterminous?
speaker="michael_a_ficaro" startTime="273.687" stopTime="312.281">
    Mr. Michael A. Ficaro 
    The Illinois courts follow the procedural rules, so this Court under the holdings of Steagald which establishes the standard for waiver in Illinois... the Illinois courts in People v. Keller which explicitly says we follow the federal guideline of Steagald for the waiver principles, thereby allows this Court to reach the question of whether or not it was waived. 
    By a clear examination of the record in this case, the issue was not waived although the Appellate Court in one simple sentence said it was waived.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="312.281" stopTime="322.903">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    But assuming we ought to take the word of the Illinois Appellate Court in this particular case on these particular facts as to whether something was waived under Illinois law, shouldn't we?
speaker="michael_a_ficaro" startTime="322.903" stopTime="338.210">
    Mr. Michael A. Ficaro 
    I believe, Your Honor, it is not an independent ground because they use the federal standard of waiver in Steagald, and, therefore, in applying the federal standard in Steagald this issue was not waived because it was raised in a timely fashion.
speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="338.210" stopTime="346.658">
    Justice Harry A. Blackmun

    Yes, that is correct.

speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="359.373" stopTime="360.810">
    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    But you have not mentioned it in so many words.
speaker="michael_a_ficaro" startTime="360.810" stopTime="712.886">
    Mr. Michael A. Ficaro 
    --I apologize to the Court. 
    I thought that was my first reference. 
    But what they have said is, in applying the principles of the Supreme Court cases, we find that this was not a search incidental to arrest. 
    The facts of this case are that on September 1 a sergeant of the Kankakee City Police was called to a disturbance at a movie theater in Kankakee. 
    Upon his arrival he saw the Respondent at the theater having words with the theater manager. 
    As he approached the theater manager, the manager requested that the sergeant file a complaint against the Respondent, Ralph Lafayette, for disorderly conduct. 
    Sergeant Mitzner tried to straighten out the matter there, in his own words, but the Respondent continued yelling and screaming and Sergeant Mitzner then placed him under arrest, did not search him at that time, handcuffed him, took him to his car, and brought him to the police station. 
    At the police station the Respondent was unhandcuffed and taken into the booking room where the standard police booking procedure began. 
    The Respondent was told to remove his clothing, to put on jail garb, to take the things out of his pockets, and he began filling out forms. 
    Then, according to Sergeant Mitzner, the Petitioner or the Respondent placed his purse on the counter before him, took out a pack of cigarettes. 
    The sergeant touched that purse, felt something inside and reached in. 
    According to the Petitioner, the purse was taken from his shoulder and searched. 
    But it was uncontested that inside that purse at the time... after a valid custodial arrest, were ten amphetamine pills. 
    A motion to suppress was heard, was taken under advisement by the trial court. 
    Twenty days after being taken under advisement, the state filed a brief in opposition to the motion to suppress. 
    The Appellate Court then affirmed the holding of the trial court suppressing the evidence. 
    Leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Illinois was denied, and this matter is before the Court on a writ of certiorari. 
    The reasonableness of a post-arrest warrantless search of the Respondent's purse is predicated upon the right of the state to search the Respondent after his valid custodial arrest for disorderly conduct. 
    The validity of Sergeant Mitzner's authority to search this individual after the arrest has remained virtually unchallenged in this Court. 
    As this Court noted in Robinson, the right to search is not to be doubted. 
    The arrest is a reasonable intrusion as this Court has said in the initial stage of prosecution which may lead to the ultimate relinquishment of liberty of this individual. 
    When Sergeant Mitzner observed the Respondent's disorderly conduct and arrested him for that, Ralph Lafayette's expectation of privacy in the contents of his purse became subordinated to the legitimate and overriding interests of the state to search that purse. 
    Those interests, as stated in this Court, that are monitored by police officers each day are the interests to disarm the person arrested, to protect the police officers and those around them, to remove the means of escape from the arrested person, and to prevent destruction of evidence that can be used against the person arrested. 
    Now these interests that were monitored by Sergeant Mitzner were not tailored specifically for Ralph Lafayette. 
    These are the interests served in every arrest and search incidental thereto. 
    The interests served are not the justification for the search of Ralph Lafayette. 
    The valid custodial arrest as this Court has indicated is the justification for that search, and the search needs no further justification. 
    The breadth of authority to search is not limited, as this Court has held, by the crime arrested for. 
    Despite the trivial nature of a crime that a police officer arrests an individual for, an officer never knows if he is facing the infamous, as this Court put it, trojan horse. 
    It is of no moment to a post-arrest warrantless search that there may be an absence of the fruits of the crime arrested for or no evidence of the crime that can be seized in relation to the crime, although in this case the bizarre behavior of the Respondent could have been found in the evidence of amphetamines found in his purse. 
    The Justification to search is not based upon the probability of finding weapons and evidence and means of escape in each and every case, but is based upon the valid custodial arrest. 
    The state's interests to be protected after a valid custodial arrest are constant whether or not in a hindsight glance we can say that the interests were unlikely to have been served in that particular search incidental to arrest.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="712.886" stopTime="716.213">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    What was this man custodial arrested for?
speaker="michael_a_ficaro" startTime="716.213" stopTime="723.538">
    Mr. Michael A. Ficaro 
    He was arrested for, Your Honor, disorderly conduct which was a city ordinance which was subject to incarceration.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="723.538" stopTime="731.848">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    And what evidence could you find of disorderly conduct by searching him?
speaker="michael_a_ficaro" startTime="731.848" stopTime="736.018">
    Mr. Michael A. Ficaro 
    I do not believe that is an issue, Your Honor. 
    However in this case--
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="736.018" stopTime="736.924">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    But it is a question--
speaker="michael_a_ficaro" startTime="736.924" stopTime="737.377">
    Mr. Michael A. Ficaro 
    --Yes, it is.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="737.377" stopTime="738.158">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    --which I am asking.
speaker="michael_a_ficaro" startTime="738.158" stopTime="826.904">
    Mr. Michael A. Ficaro 
    And the answer to that question is that the evidence of his bizarre behavior may have resulted from the use of narcotics, in this case amphetamines. 
    So in this particular case there could be established evidence of his bizarre behavior, that his yelling and screaming in a public place and acting as what is described as disorderly in this specific case. 
    It was conceded by the Respondent if Sergeant Mitzner arrested him at the movie station, he could have conducted a search contemporaneous with that arrest, but because the search was at the station, the Respondent says it violated the Fourth Amendment. 
    The Court has ruled in United States v. Abel that a valid custodial arrest can justify a search in a place other than the place of arrest, and the Court has allowed a delay of ten hours in a search after a valid custodial arrest, in Edwards. 
    The delayed station house search in this case does not change the fact that the arrest justifies the search. 
    It does not impose on Ralph Lafayette in any manner greater than it would have imposed upon him at the time of his arrest at the movie house. 
    It does not enlarge the scope of permissible search of Ralph Lafayette.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="826.904" stopTime="840.929">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    May I ask you one question about the scope of the permissible search? 
    Supposing that the purse that this man was carrying contained a lot of letters in envelopes, some of which were sealed and some were not. 
    Could the police open and read the mail?
speaker="michael_a_ficaro" startTime="840.929" stopTime="865.935">
    Mr. Michael A. Ficaro 
    I believe the answer to that question is if it is pursuant to a valid custodial arrest, the police have a right to examine the contents, not to read the contents of the letters, as this Court has indicated in other decisions, that there is a certain amount of scrutiny available to the police. 
    What is reasonable and what may shock the conscience by a broaching--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="865.935" stopTime="869.340">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Suppose the envelopes were sealed, could they rip open the seals and look inside?
speaker="michael_a_ficaro" startTime="869.340" stopTime="884.678">
    Mr. Michael A. Ficaro 
    --I believe they could, Your Honor, and it is the arrest that justifies this intrusion because the expectation of privacy of an arrested individual is diminished and the contents of his personal belongings are also diminished.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="884.678" stopTime="888.035">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Do we have to go that far in this case?
speaker="michael_a_ficaro" startTime="888.035" stopTime="890.799">
    Mr. Michael A. Ficaro 
    No, Your Honor, we do not have to go that far in this case.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="890.799" stopTime="903.795">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    What if in feeling the envelopes they felt some kind of a granulated powder inside. 
    It might be sugar, and it might be salt, and it might be narcotics. 
    Would they be able to open that one?
speaker="michael_a_ficaro" startTime="903.795" stopTime="938.655">
    Mr. Michael A. Ficaro 
    I believe they would, Your Honor, in this case under these facts because the valid custodial arrest, just like searching into the pocket of Robinson to find a cigarette pack and then opening a cigarette pack to find narcotics inside would be the same as the Court's example or hypothetical to me. 
    Allowing searches incidental to arrest at a place other than and a time other than the arrest has been recognized by this Court based upon the practical considerations that a police officer has to face every day.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="938.655" stopTime="942.060">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Is incident to arrest your principle submission?
speaker="michael_a_ficaro" startTime="942.060" stopTime="1090.437">
    Mr. Michael A. Ficaro 
    No, Your Honor, that is the first submission. 
    The reasonableness of what a police officer does in light of the facts and circumstances of each case is the basis of this practical consideration the Court has in allowing a search at a place other than and at a time other than arrest. 
    The Court has found warrantless searches reasonable that took place seconds after the arrest as in Lavinson and Gustafson, minutes later as in Belton, or hours later in Edwards. 
    What these searches incidental to arrest share in common with the search of Ralph Lafayette is the reasonableness under all the circumstances of the time and place of the search. 
    Looking through this... looking at this search rather through the eyes of Sergeant Mitzner, it would have been unreasonable and impractical for him to conduct a search in a movie theater lobby where he had been called to quell the disturbance, where a disturbance was taking place, where the defendant may have other friends or associates among the patrons of the theater. 
    It was unreasonable, and the Court has recognized this unreasonableness in demanding that the search incidental to arrest be at the time and place of the search incident. 
    Now the Respondent also concedes that the arrest in this case was valid. 
    Now the Court has reasoned in Robinson that a search into a pocket to get a pack of cigarettes and then searching the cigarette pack to get a container crushed around narcotics is reasonable. 
    Then in this case the search into a purse after a valid custodial arrest to take out a cellophane with narcotics in it is also reasonable. 
    Both the pocket and the purse are repositories of personal effects. 
    There can be no distinction, as this Court has indicated in Ross, between worthy and unworthy containers in relation to the unreasonableness of a search and seizure in the protections of the Fourth Amendment. 
    When Sergeant Mitzner placed the Respondent under arrest in that lobby, the Respondent had a diminished expectation of privacy in the contents of his purse because--
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1090.437" stopTime="1092.686">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Is it limited to the purse or--
speaker="michael_a_ficaro" startTime="1092.686" stopTime="1093.905">
    Mr. Michael A. Ficaro 
    --No, Your Honor.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1093.905" stopTime="1098.309">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    --diminished expectation of privacy of everything on his person?
speaker="michael_a_ficaro" startTime="1098.309" stopTime="1103.838">
    Mr. Michael A. Ficaro 
    Everything on his person and within the scope of allowable search, under Chimel.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="1103.838" stopTime="1107.196">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    How about a separate locked trunk as in Chadwick:
speaker="michael_a_ficaro" startTime="1107.196" stopTime="1117.052">
    Mr. Michael A. Ficaro 
    It depends upon the association of that locked trunk with the person at the time of his arrest. 
    But we do not have to reach that issue in this case--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="1117.052" stopTime="1119.223">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    --You mean if it were nearby it could be opened and searched?
speaker="michael_a_ficaro" startTime="1119.223" stopTime="1128.250">
    Mr. Michael A. Ficaro 
    --If it were in the permissible scope of Chimel if Chimel is... if the language of Chimel means a foot locker.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="1128.250" stopTime="1130.280">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Even if it is locked?
speaker="michael_a_ficaro" startTime="1130.280" stopTime="1151.178">
    Mr. Michael A. Ficaro 
    If that is what the interpretation of Chimel means, even if it is locked. 
    Under the valid custodial arrest theory, there is really no distinction between going into someone's pocket and a foot locker that they are carrying down the street. 
    But in Chadwick that issue was not addressed because it was not a search incidental to arrest.

    Mr. Michael A. Ficaro 
    The encounter began in an observation in another city, I believe, but the arrest took place... there was probable cause to search--

    Mr. Michael A. Ficaro 
    --Based upon observations by agents in, I believe, San Diego following it through to Boston where the foot locker was observed.

    --That issue was not addressed.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="1207.249" stopTime="1219.416">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Do you think they could have... suppose the dog had sniffed the foot locker when they were sitting on the foot locker and they arrested them right then. 
    Could you have searched the foot locker?
speaker="michael_a_ficaro" startTime="1219.416" stopTime="1249.013">
    Mr. Michael A. Ficaro 
    I believe within the holding of Chimel that foot locker could have been searched as valid, incident to a custodial arrest. 
    The question is whether or not this Court in their language of Chadwick meant closely associated with the person to be a foot locker, but certainly under this situation a purse is an item both closely associated with the person as well as within the scope of Chimel.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1249.013" stopTime="1261.540">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    In Chadwick the police did not know of any... of the connection between Chadwick and the foot locker until he exercised dominion over it--
speaker="michael_a_ficaro" startTime="1261.540" stopTime="1263.336">
    Mr. Michael A. Ficaro 
    That is correct.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1263.336" stopTime="1277.174">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    --by taking possession, and the police deferred their arrest until he claimed the container that the dog had indicated had drugs in it.
speaker="michael_a_ficaro" startTime="1277.174" stopTime="1283.875">
    Mr. Michael A. Ficaro 
    But I believe this Court has distinguished Chadwick in that it was not a search incidental to arrest.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1283.875" stopTime="1286.030">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    And it was not an automobile search.
speaker="michael_a_ficaro" startTime="1286.029" stopTime="1298.822">
    Mr. Michael A. Ficaro 
    That is correct. 
    So then based upon the necessity for probable cause under the facts and circumstances of Chadwick, the Court's holding in relation to the search of that item was correct.

    Did the Ross case possibly have some impact on Chadwick?
speaker="michael_a_ficaro" startTime="1303.727" stopTime="1329.872">
    Mr. Michael A. Ficaro 
    I believe Ross merely indicated the worthiness and unworthiness of containers for the purposes of describing, as I have, a purse or a double locked foot locker. 
    It is the nature of the container... it is not the nature of the container that retains the expectation of privacy in the container. 
    It is what is done with that container, it is our position, that reduces the expectation of privacy.

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Are you going to come to your theory on the inventory search--

    Mr. Michael A. Ficaro 
    Yes, Your Honor.

speaker="michael_a_ficaro" startTime="1339.024" stopTime="1396.485">
    Mr. Michael A. Ficaro 
    No, Your Honor, I will. 
    The search of the Respondent's purse at the station house after his valid arrest was a post-arrest warrantless search of property under his control and immediately associated with his person. 
    The authority to seize was not questioned by the Respondent. 
    The Justification to search is based upon the valid custodial arrest. 
    The search of the purse was also justified as a valid inventory search because the Respondent was carrying it when the police took him into custody. 
    When Sergeant Mitzner reached into that purse, his stated intent was to conduct an inventory search according to standard police booking procedures. 
    This Court has said in Opperman--

    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor

    Mr. Michael A. Ficaro

    Mr. Michael A. Ficaro 
    In the amicus brief filed before the Court, there is a copy of the inventory form used by the Kankakee Police Department which line by line designates questions to be answered and items to be inventoried and property to be received and that the Respondent in each and every case or the person arrested must sign that inventory to verify the contents.

    What is in the course of the inventory process?
speaker="michael_a_ficaro" startTime="1460.007" stopTime="1557.872">
    Mr. Michael A. Ficaro 
    The inventory process, Your Honor, Mr. Justice, is a caretaking administrative practice. 
    It is not based upon the probable cause, but it is based upon serving the legitimate interests of the state as well as an arrestee. 
    The interests served are those listed in Opperman, to protect the valuables of the arrestee from theft, loss or damage, to protect also the police officer from any harm due to the contents of that property seized. 
    We are not talking about the subjective fear of a particular police officer. 
    What we are talking about is the objective harm that may occur if that item and the contents are not inventoried. 
    The interests served by inventory include protecting against false claims that the property of the arrestee was either stolen, damaged, or lost by the police, and this cannot be underestimated, the problem this causes both in morale and in the drain of resources in responding to frivolous claims by persons arrested. 
    We cannot also deny the fact that an interest served by the inventory search of an arrestee is to secure the security of the jail cell or the jail house.

    I believe you would have to look into the pouch or you cannot list each and every item taken from the arrestee at the time of his arrest. 
    In weighing the state's interests in the Respondent's expectation of privacy in the contents of his purse, there is no doubt that the Respondent who is a pre-trial detainee has a lesser expectation of privacy that justifies the overriding state interests to search and inventory the contents of that purse.

   Argument of Peter A. Carusona

    Mr. Peter A. Carusona 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court. 
    The Petitioner, the State of Illinois, asks this honorable Court to reverse the decision on two grounds. 
    It alleges two grounds, that it is a valid inventory in this case, or there is a valid delayed search incident to the arrest. 
    It is our position as developed in part two of our brief that the question of whether the search can be justified as one incident to the arrest is not properly before this Court since the Appellate Court held that that issue was waived. 
    The fact that after the Court held that it was waived, as the state concedes in both its petition for certiorari and its brief, and then went on to note and discuss the issue, that is purely a hypothetical discussion prefaced with the phrase, assuming arguendo, that the state had not waived the issue.

    Hypothetical discussions do occur perhaps even in this Court's decisions, but in Herb v.

speaker="peter_a_carusona" startTime="1822.438" stopTime="1899.531">
    Mr. Peter A. Carusona 
    In that case the Court in that case went on to reach and decide the question. 
    There is nothing in there to the... there is no waiver holding in that case. 
    There is no question that that case was decided on the merits of the Fourth Amendment or the Constitution. 
    Since the focus of this case really should be inventory, I would like to limit my comments to that. 
    I would rely on part three of our brief where we discuss the search incident to arrest question, and there is another reason in this case why the focus of the case should be on inventory. 
    That is what the facts show it is. 
    The officer testified he searched the contents of this shoulder bag because, pursuant to Kankakee Police Department policy, everything had to be inventoried. 
    As Your Honors will recall, there was an arrest in this case, and I must dispute the facts as supported by the Petitioner this morning. 
    The arrest in this case was for disturbing the peace. 
    It was not subject to incarceration. 
    That was a petty offense punishable by a fine only. 
    It was a violation of the Kankakee Municipal Code, and petty offenses in Illinois are punishable by fine only.

    Mr. Peter A. Carusona 
    Certainly not, Your Honor, and this is the... you can have a custodial arrest for a misdemeanor, and this is not even a misdemeanor. 
    It is even lower. 
    It is simply a petty offense carrying no subject of incarceration. 
    In fact, there is a bail schedule for this offense, and the defendant could have obtained his release by posting $35 bond money.

    Mr. Peter A. Carusona 
    If he had it. 
    That is correct, Your Honor. 
    In that regard, there has been some discussion this morning of his property index card in the brief of the amicus. 
    That is not in the record. 
    That card apparently was obtained by the amicus writing to the Kankakee Police Department. 
    That is not evidence in the record, and I wanted to point that out. 
    But, however, that card indicates that he did have $79 and enough to make bond. 
    Following the arrest in this case--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1967.552" stopTime="1973.550">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    May I ask you if the record tells us what he had in the purse other than the cigarettes, which I guess are mentioned, and the--
speaker="peter_a_carusona" startTime="1973.550" stopTime="1974.704">
    Mr. Peter A. Carusona 
    --The record does not show.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1974.704" stopTime="1980.671">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    --Because neither the cigarettes nor the drugs are listed on the card. 
    Was there anything else in the purse?
speaker="peter_a_carusona" startTime="1980.671" stopTime="2048.770">
    Mr. Peter A. Carusona 
    There is no indication in the record. 
    Following the arrest in this case, the Defendant was taken down to the police station. 
    At that point, he was allowed to fill out some forms. 
    After he filled out some forms it eventually was determined that he was going to spend the night in jail or going to spend some time in jail. 
    They took all of his belongings, and at that point they decided that they were going to search them because they were safeguarding them. 
    I would like to point out what this search is not, in this case. 
    This is not a search based on probable cause. 
    This is not a search based on any exigency. 
    This is not a search of any property that was going to accompany the Defendant into the jail cell. 
    What this is is simply a search pursuant to the Kankakee Police Department policy to inventory everything that they are going to be safeguarding, and I would also point out that this is not a search which could ever be justified by a warrant. 
    With respect to this inventory question, the state--

    Mr. Peter A. Carusona 
    We are not disputing a contemporaneous search.

    --All right. 
    Thank you.
speaker="peter_a_carusona" startTime="2069.697" stopTime="2119.459">
    Mr. Peter A. Carusona 
    I might add, however, that such a search might be illegal under Illinois law because it is controlled by state statute. 
    With respect to this inventory question, the state asked the Court to fashion a rule which requires the police, just as the Kankakee Police Department policy, to open up every container, every repository of personal effects, and this would have to include an envelope because you would have to open up an envelope to check to see whether or not there was currency in it or some type of bearer bond. 
    Our position, on the other hand, is that this Court should approve or affirm the decision in this case and approve the majority rule and that is that the contents of these containers should not be searched as part of an inventory.

speaker="peter_a_carusona" startTime="2168.720" stopTime="2180.387">
    Mr. Peter A. Carusona 
    What we are saying, Your Honor, is that such a search would not be an inventory search. 
    That would be a criminal search, and it would have to go by the Court's normal standard and perhaps the warrant would apply as in Chadwick.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="2180.387" stopTime="2189.493">

    Now suppose after he posted his bond and had been fined he then claimed that he had had $10,000 in currency in it but that the $10,000 in currency was missing.

    Mr. Peter A. Carusona 
    What we are suggesting, Your Honor, is the right... the police do have a right to protect themselves from a claim, and they could have done it exactly as the officer testified in this case by placing the shoulder bag in an inventory bag, which were available, and securing it in a locker.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="2229.413" stopTime="2240.067">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Would that prevent this gentleman from claiming afterward that he had $10,000 when he put it in, that the $10,000 was missing when he was released?

speaker="peter_a_carusona" startTime="2255.169" stopTime="2262.447">
    Mr. Peter A. Carusona 
    That would not protect a false claim.

    Mr. Peter A. Carusona 
    Well, Your Honor, in this case the shoulder bag could have been placed in an inventory bag and that could have been sealed and the Defendant could have initialed that and then--

    Mr. Peter A. Carusona 
    --I agree with Your Honor. 
    In a majority of the jurisdictions today they do not search these contents. 
    They do not search the contents of these containers. 
    They are the ones that are faced with these false claims, and they do not find them significant.

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Well, in Opperman we said that an inventory search is a constitutional means for several purposes, one of which is the protection of the police from false claims, but that is only one of the purposes.

    Mr. Peter A. Carusona 
    That is correct, Your Honor, and we feel that that interest is served exactly as the majority of courts have been holding. 
    It is better served by simply putting it in a bag and initialing it. 
    They find that... Actually the courts are saying that claims are more likely when the contents are handled, and, in fact, in regard to whether that is a significant risk there is no evidence that it is a significant risk in this case. 
    The state has cited some federal cases in their reply brief, but none of those involve a claim from a container and most of them involve property taken from someone's cell, not property which was being stored. 
    The evidence that it is not significant comes from two Supreme Courts and that is Minnesota and Delaware, excuse me, and Wisconsin where the courts have indicated that they have never seen such a claim. 
    They were sure they existed, but they had never heard of one.

    What we are asking in this case is to apply the balancing test of Opperman and that is what is the need to search and balance that against the high privacy interest involved, and there is no need to search to prevent these false claims. 
    Even if there is a slight need or even if it is better by having some type of rummaging through letters and everything, and as I said you would have to open up a letter to check it and read papers to make sure they were not a stock certificate or some type of bearer bond--

    Mr. Peter A. Carusona 
    Because Robinson is a case which allows... There is no need. 
    There is no... There has to be no justification other than the fact of arrest. 
    In other words--

    Justice Byron R. White 
    I thought Chadwick carefully put aside those items that were intimately connected with the person and did not say that those could not be searched at the station house.

    Mr. Peter A. Carusona 
    --There is some language in Chadwick to that effect, but it is our position that that just applies to clothing. 
    There is no need for this Court to make any kind of container rule on clothing, and, in fact, I think as the Chief Justice wrote in Sanders is what we are talking about here and that is that items carried on, accompanied or being carried by the person when they are arrested that a search of those items cannot be justified by any reduced expectation of privacy.

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Let me take you back to the wallet that Justice White postulated to you. 
    A man puts the wallet down on the table, and you say they must wrap that up in some kind of a seal and not look inside of it. 
    All right, they do that. 
    Two days later he is released and they hand him his billfold and ask him to sign a receipt. 
    He looks at it and said, well, I had $10,000 in here when I left it, and now there is only $3. 
    You mean to tell me that they cannot inventory the contents of that wallet in order to protect the police from that kind of a claim?
speaker="peter_a_carusona" startTime="2729.980" stopTime="2735.071">
    Mr. Peter A. Carusona 
    That is correct, Your Honor, because we feel that they are protected by sealing--

    Mr. Peter A. Carusona

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    The entire of everything in the automobile including things that were in the--

    Mr. Peter A. Carusona 
    --Glove compartment.

    --glove compartment.
speaker="peter_a_carusona" startTime="2750.893" stopTime="2764.372">
    Mr. Peter A. Carusona 
    That is correct, Your Honor, but there was essential need in that case. 
    In fact, the state courts... This is the reverse of Opperman. 
    The state courts have said... In Opperman, the majority said the search was essential. 
    Why? 
    Because of the need to protect from vandalism.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="2764.372" stopTime="2767.232">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Also to protect the police.
speaker="peter_a_carusona" startTime="2767.232" stopTime="2865.114">
    Mr. Peter A. Carusona 
    That is correct, Your Honor, but the idea was that a car is stored outside. 
    That involves significant burdens. 
    There are two key factors why the courts have not found Opperman to extend to this situation, and again one is the significantly higher expectation of privacy in the contents of these repositories, and the second one is that it involves no burden to secure them. 
    In this case they simply put it in a locker. 
    An automobile, on the other hand, is subject to vandalism, and when there is vandalism that is when false claims are even more likely because you have an insurance fraud type claim. 
    But the idea of the security of the station house and this higher expectation of privacy is what has made the scales tip the other way. 
    Again, we are talking about... The test here is the need to search versus the privacy interest involved, and we must consider as one of those factors the scope of the search, and as I pointed out the state's search is virtually unlimited in scope. 
    The scope of their rule is unlimited. 
    Another interest which has been advanced is normally the idea that you have to protect the police from injury and so on. 
    In other words, that interest, too, is served by securing the property in a locker. 
    Once you have secured the property in the locker, you have maintained jail security. 
    You have protected the owner's property from theft and vandalism. 
    You have also protected the police from the idea that someone is going to obtain a weapon from the container and use it against the police.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2865.114" stopTime="2867.707">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    And to you it would not make any difference if they had a probable cause to search the purse?
speaker="peter_a_carusona" startTime="2867.707" stopTime="2873.330">
    Mr. Peter A. Carusona 
    Probable cause would be a different case, Your Honor. 
    It would not be an inventory case.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2873.330" stopTime="2879.357">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    But you would just say they would have to go get a warrant. 
    You would not say they could make a warrantless search?
speaker="peter_a_carusona" startTime="2879.357" stopTime="2922.918">
    Mr. Peter A. Carusona 
    If there were probable... That is correct, Your Honor. 
    If there were probable cause to search for contraband, this case would be controlled by Chadwick and Sanders at the station house now. 
    Again, this is something that is securely in their control. 
    But once... We are not suggesting that there cannot be a search for these other reasons once you get out of inventory context. 
    One example is the idea that there is a bomb in every type of container. 
    That is true. 
    Every container is a potential bomb. 
    However, it is very remote that the Defendant would have planned his arrest with a bomb in there and secondly, we have to understand that it is foolhardy to routinely open up containers looking for a bomb because it may be booby-trapped, and you would have one injured officer.

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    In Washington just recently a young man was arrested and he had a package and it was discovered that there were two venomous, poisonous snakes which had inflicted very serious injury on him endangering his life. 
    Now would you suggest that police should not have done a little checking on that, the contents of that bag?
speaker="peter_a_carusona" startTime="2951.954" stopTime="2956.030">

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    The whole point is that he might not have any reason to think there was a bomb or a poisonous snake any more than you would have any reason to think there was $10,000 in the man's wallet, but is it not the business of the police to find out?
speaker="peter_a_carusona" startTime="2984.722" stopTime="2992.797">

    He should not open it up. 
    He should have an expert come and take it. 
    Your Honors, I would like to talk a little about the waiver question in this case and that is review of the search as incident to the arrest should be precluded because the Appellate Court rejected that theory on an adequate and independent state ground which served legitimate state interest, and as I noted the Court's discussion was purely hypothetical. 
    And I think it is important to note here that are extreme legitimate state interests in this case. 
    We have the normal state interest that there is an inadequate record. 
    We do not know exactly what this container is.

    Well, they did. 
    It was not the... The burden was on your client to show that the evidence should be suppressed, I take it, and that would be the rule in Illinois as elsewhere, and if you were to make a claim that could be sustained on appeal, it is up to you to make the record that would justify sustaining the claim. 
    If the Illinois Appellate Court upholds that claim on the basis of a record that will not support it, then it seems to me it is you who suffer and not the other side.

    I am not sure it is right to call that a hypothetical, that alternative ground, because they were subject to review by the Illinois Supreme Court which might have disagreed with them on waiver so they had a perfectly good reason for putting another reason in the record if they wanted to avoid review by their superior court.
speaker="peter_a_carusona" startTime="3313.653" stopTime="3403.195">
    Mr. Peter A. Carusona 
    I think Your Honor brings up a good point, and that is that in the petition for leave to appeal the state did not raise the waiver question. 
    In fact, they never disputed the waiver contention until the brief that they filed in this Court, and that is something that this Court noted in Tyler was significant. 
    With respect to this search incident to arrest question, it is our position that we must look at what Justice Frankfuter stated in United States v. Rubinowitz and that is that the exception has its basic root on need, and there was no need to conduct a search in this case. 
    That need exists at the time of arrest as in Robinson, but once the item, the container, is secured at the station, is in custody of the police that there is no need then to conduct a search for that reason. 
    And if we just facially look at this case compared with Chadwick and Sanders, this is a stronger case. 
    There is no probable cause to search in this case. 
    There is no exigency. 
    The idea that the Defendant in Sanders could have got to his suitcase was much greater than in this case. 
    Accordingly, Your Honors, we would ask that this Court affirm the decision of the Appellate Court finding that the inventory question was rightly decided, and also we think review of the search incident to arrest question is precluded.

    Mr. Michael A. Ficaro 
    Brief response, Mr. Chief Justice. 
    Whether we wish to call this a search incidental to arrest or a valid inventory search, the search is based upon the validity of that arrest, and the Justification then is existent in an inventory search the same as it is in the search incidental to arrest. 
    When Justice White addressed the question of what do we do with the wallet, if we follow the counsel's least restrictive rules test, we must ignore that there are 10 million arrests annually that involve custodial taking of a person into custody or taking him into custody.

    --according to the FBI uniform crime statistics, although at times it seems that there are that many in Chicago.

    If we take counsel's less intrusive means test, we do not balance the state's interests because we are dealing with a pre-trial detainee whose expectation of privacy in the contents of his purse or wallet have been severely restricted. 
    So we must balance the state's interest to search as provided for in the interest named in Opperman versus the rights of a pre-trial detainee. 
    And finally as this Court has questioned the waiver issue by the state, the importance in my statement of facts and the relation to a brief being filed after the court took this matter under advisement in the trial court was that the state raised this issue of search incident to arrest eight days before the court decided this matter, and, therefore, it was timely raised in the trial court below.
