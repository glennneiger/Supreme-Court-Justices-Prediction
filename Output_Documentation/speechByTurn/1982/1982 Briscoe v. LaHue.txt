    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    This case raises the question whether a person who has been convicted of a crime in a state court may recover damages under the Federal Civil Rights Acts from a police officer who is alleged to have given false testimony at the criminal trial. 
    The United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit concluded that a police officer was entitled to the same immunity from liability as a lay witness. 
    And that such a damage action against an officer may not be maintained. 
    Although this conclusion is consistent with the decisions in most courts that have addressed the issue, a contrary opinion has also been expressed. 
    In view of the importance of the question, we granted certiorari to decide it. 
    As we explain in an opinion filed with the clerk today, we agree with the majority view and therefore affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. 
    Justice Brennan, Justice Marshall, and Justice Blackmun have filed dissenting opinions.
