    We will hear arguments next in Barefoot against Estelle. 
    Mr. Greenberg, you may proceed whenever you are ready.

    Mr. Jack Greenberg 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, I shall argue first as a friend of the Court on the issue of standards for granting stays of execution on denials of petitions for writ of habeas corpus in capital case, and Mr. Gray shall argue for the Petitioner on the merits of the case with regard to the admissibility of the psychiatric testimony. 
    I would first like to commence with a brief review of the chronology of the case, because it bears upon an important issue with regard to the stay, and that is whether counsel acted diligently or dilatorily. 
    The Petitioner in this case, Thomas Barefoot, was convicted in November, 1978, of homicide, and he litigated his case in the state courts on direct review, and then to this Court, and then on state post-conviction relief for approximately three years, and on October 6th, 1981, he completed his proceedings in the state system, and less... approximately a week later, on October 14th, he filed his case in the United States District Court. 
    That case was resolved a year later in the District Court on November, 1982, and on December 3rd, the District Court granted a certificate of probable cause and permission to proceed in forma pauperis, and on December 4th it vacated a stay which it had theretofore granted. 
    Shortly thereafter, on December--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="211.674" stopTime="216.110">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Mr. Greenberg, do those two actions strike you as being at all inconsistent?
speaker="jack_greenberg" startTime="216.110" stopTime="347.003">
    Mr. Jack Greenberg 
    --Yes. 
    On December 20th, the District Court set the date of execution for January 25th, 1983. 
    Texas has a doctrine which does not permit litigation in its state courts as long as proceedings are pending in the federal courts, and some newly discovered evidence appeared, as well as an additional state court matter, which had not been exhausted, and so Mr. Gray went back into the state courts on December 20th on state habeas corpus which was denied on December 21st. 
    However, he was not notified of this denial until January 7th. 
    A week thereafter, he filed his petition in the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, on January 14th. 
    He received a telephone call on January 17th telling him to appear for a hearing on the application for stay on January 19th. 
    He appeared in court on January 19th. 
    The panel which had Judge Brown on it informed him that Judge Brown was ill and Judge Randall was substituting for Judge Brown, and it was stated in open court that Judge Randall had showed up at the last moment, didn't know anything at all about the case. 
    The record on the... of the state court proceedings had not yet been filed in federal court. 
    The record of the federal habeas court proceedings was just then filed. 
    There was a letter from counsel which was turned over to the court saying that the American Psychiatric Association desired to file a friend of the court brief on the important issue of the admissibility and the significance of the psychiatric testimony in this case, which was based upon a response to a hypothetical question. 
    The hearing on the stay was concluded. 
    Twenty-four hours later, a 16-page opinion was issued denying the stay and setting forth as a standard for granting a denial of stay whether or not Petitioner had established a substantial likelihood of success on the merits. 
    In essence, this--
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="347.003" stopTime="356.221">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    I have a little difficulty, Mr. Greenberg, tracking the matter of the substitution of the judge. 
    How is that relevant to any issue here?
speaker="jack_greenberg" startTime="356.221" stopTime="365.405">
    Mr. Jack Greenberg 
    --Such preparation as the judge might have been able to make even on that short notice was not possible for Judge Randall, who just showed up at the last moment, certainly through not fault of her own.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="365.405" stopTime="383.147">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Well, you must be aware that, for example, one Justice of this Court for many years came on the bench without knowing anything but the name of the case, and did so deliberately. 
    You suggest that disqualifies a judge from participating?
speaker="jack_greenberg" startTime="383.147" stopTime="393.579">
    Mr. Jack Greenberg 
    No, I certainly was not suggesting it was a disqualification, but certainly it was an indication of not adequate opportunity for study and reflection on a matter that was complex and difficult.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="393.579" stopTime="398.375">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    But a matter that had been through the state court systems up to that time.
speaker="jack_greenberg" startTime="398.375" stopTime="446.012">
    Mr. Jack Greenberg 
    The matter had been through the state court system, but Petitioner had a Congressionally mandated statutory right to federal habeas corpus review of his constitutional claims in the federal courts and had not yet had that. 
    Now, our brief and others argue that a stay should be granted on appeal from appeal from denial of a first application, I must stress, a first application for writ of habeas corpus whenever petitioner presents issue that are not frivolous or has a certificate of probable cause. 
    But there are additional reasons which we would like to submit on this argument based on policy why Petitioner's first application should receive the ordinary consideration afforded non-death sentence prisoners who assert they have been denied constitutional rights without having their cases mooted by execution. 
    Those--

    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Mr. Greenberg, I know you stress first application, but there just isn't anything in the rules or the statute that refer to the first application, and I--

    If the Petitioner is abusing the writ--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="468.500" stopTime="477.980">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    But nothing as far as the rules concerning the stay are concerned that would limit it to a first application.
speaker="jack_greenberg" startTime="477.980" stopTime="488.743">
    Mr. Jack Greenberg 
    --Well, but he is not going to have... he is not going to have his hearing unless he gets a stay, because he will be executed before his case has been heard on the merits, so the two are intimately involved one with another.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="488.743" stopTime="500.099">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Well, but I think we have to be conscious of the fact that there are successive petitions typically filed, and we will have to address this for successive petitions.
speaker="jack_greenberg" startTime="500.099" stopTime="512.077">
    Mr. Jack Greenberg 
    I do not for a moment suggest that a successive petition requires the same consideration that an initial petition requires, although some successive petitions have succeeded in the Courts of Appeals, and indeed in this Court, so they are not all to be viewed as automatically--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="512.077" stopTime="518.933">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well, then, how would you distinguish them, as opposed to just saying you don't see why one would have to be treated the same as the other for stay purposes?
speaker="jack_greenberg" startTime="518.933" stopTime="739.214">
    Mr. Jack Greenberg 
    --I think a successive petition deserves much more cursory treatment. 
    An initial petition merits serious consideration. 
    These initial petitions have succeeded at the rate of almost 70 to 80 percent in the courts of appeals. 
    These are not frivolous petitions. 
    I would like to just identify three policy considerations that support the statutory argument made in the various briefs. 
    The first is the interest of the defendant to have his constitutional claims fairly considered in the same manner as the claims of an ordinary embezzler or petty thief. 
    The second is the interest of the states in maintaining an effective system of criminal justice, and the third is the interest of this Court in not only doing justice to capital defendants but the total run of business of the federal courts. 
    As to the defendants in the capital cases, they are mostly represented by volunteer counsel, public defenders, a few civil rights organizations, such as the one for which I work, which has three or four lawyers working on such cases. 
    The cases are complex. 
    The capacity of lawyers to present them fairly and completely is now... we have now gone totally beyond that, and if the courts obtain the assistance they need, at a minimum, there should be the time for the ordinary briefing and presentation of ordinary cases. 
    As far as the interests of the states are concerned, there is one thing to be said for states. 
    They are interested in the administration of... fair administration of the criminal justice systems, capital punishment as a deterrent, as an appropriate attributive device. 
    I happen not to agree with that. 
    We are required to accept. 
    The pipeline is filled. 
    Executions are occurring. 
    Anyone who picks up the papers will know that people who commit homicides are being executed. 
    If there is a deterrent effect arising from executions, that deterrent effect will take place. 
    So far as the interest of the federal judiciary is concerned, this Court and other courts have heavy dockets of many different kinds of cases. 
    The counsel in those cases and the parties in those cases cannot have their cases fairly heard if they must operate on a crash schedule, as Mr. Gray had to operate in this case, compiling a complex record in three days, the record of the trial and the record of the habeas corpus proceeding not being presented until one before the hearing and the other after the hearing, a difficult issue requiring medical judgments, which was covered in a brief by the American Psychiatric Association, which finally was filed in this Court. 
    To compress on a crash, rush basis the consideration of the stay into the consideration of the merits, which is what, of course, happens, because otherwise the case is mooted out by the execution of the defendant before he has a hearing on the merits, does not help the federal courts, does not help criminal justice, and certainly is to the detriment of the defendant. 
    We urge upon this Court a standard which is that in cases of a first application for a petition of writ of habeas corpus, that application be considered in the ordinary course of events, which may take four to six months, instead of the crash basis, which takes four to six weeks, and that the interests of... all the various interests involved will be well served and no interest involved will be deserved by such a procedure.

    Very well.

   Argument of William E. Gray, Jr.
speaker="william_e_gray_jr" startTime="747.352" stopTime="840.004">
    Mr. William E. Gray, Jr. 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the state in this case put on at the guilt stage of the trial... Texas has a bifurcated procedure in capital cases... put on all of the evidence that was later incorporated in the hypothetical questions to two psychiatrists. 
    They put on evidence of prior convictions. 
    At the punishment hearing, they put on evidence... well, they put that on at the punishment hearing, prior convictions for two firearm cases and three drug-related cases. 
    They put on testimony at the guilt stage of the trial about... at least they introduced the testimony of some charges in New Mexico involving rape and kidnapping of a child under 13. 
    At the punishment stage, they put on evidence of the defendant's bad reputation. 
    This testimony came in from police officers who had handled the Petitioner on these drug-related cases, on the firearm cases, and on no cases relating to violent crimes. 
    The prosecutor then incorporated all of the evidence that had already been heard by the jury in the hypothetical questions to two psychiatrists, Dr. Grigson, who has represented the state in probably 75 to 100 cases, and Dr. Holbrook, who is now deceased. 
    Both of these psychiatrists--
speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="840.004" stopTime="841.548">
    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    Is now deceased, did you say?
speaker="william_e_gray_jr" startTime="841.548" stopTime="899.792">
    Mr. William E. Gray, Jr. 
    --Yes, Your Honor. 
    He committed suicide. 
    The critical nature of this type of testimony goes to the very heart of the Texas procedure, because the issue of whether a defendant lives or dies is based upon one fact issue, and that is whether in the opinion of the jury he will constitute a future danger to society. 
    Dr. Grigson testified in answer to this hypothetical question that it was 100 percent and absolute, in his... he didn't even say in his opinion. 
    He just said 100 percent and absolute that this defendant would constitute a continuing danger to society. 
    Dr. Holbrook was almost as emphatic. 
    That removes any discretion that the jury that heard this case may have had in determining whether Mr. Barefoot lived or died.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="899.792" stopTime="903.336">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Well, the jury could disbelieve the testimony, could they not?
speaker="william_e_gray_jr" startTime="903.336" stopTime="929.357">
    Mr. William E. Gray, Jr. 
    They... well, not under the... there is nothing a defendant can present under the Texas procedure in mitigation of punishment unless it bears directly on future dangerousness, and even then, when he introduces such evidence, there are no provisions whatsoever in the Texas law that the jury be instructed to consider that mitigating evidence or to balance the mitigating evidence against the aggravating facts of the case.

    Mr. William E. Gray, Jr. 
    If the lawyers are prepared to do so. 
    But most of the lawyers are court-appointed in these capital cases in Texas, and they have no funds, and it is difficult to get a psychiatrist to testify.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="1029.489" stopTime="1036.016">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Well, the state of Texas not pay for expert witnesses for a defendant in a capital case?
speaker="william_e_gray_jr" startTime="1036.016" stopTime="1105.693">
    Mr. William E. Gray, Jr. 
    They will pay up to $500, and you can't get a psychiatrist to come in off the street for $500. 
    There is really no adequate way that you can remove the prejudice from this testimony by cross examination or by putting on the testimony of another psychiatrist. 
    It is just like if the state put on polygraph testimony. 
    You can't remove the prejudice from that testimony, that inadmissible testimony, by putting on another operator, or by cross examining that person. 
    This falls in that same category. 
    Based on the brief filed by the American Psychiatric Association, and based upon the studies they have done, psychiatrists are wrong more than they are right in their predictions of future dangerousness. 
    This zeros all of the life or death issues in a capital case down to that one issue, and down to testimony from practitioners like Grigson and Holbrook who are absolutely certain that a defendant... every defendant they see will be a future danger to society if he is charged with the offense of capital murder.

    Mr. William E. Gray, Jr. 
    Well, I don't think we have to go that far in this case. 
    We are objecting... We say... certainly that is the thrust of our argument, that it should not be admissible. 
    This Court has held in Jurek that a lay jury is qualified to make that determination. 
    In this case, the lay jury had the exact testimony and evidence that the psychiatrists had in their hypothetical question. 
    The psychiatric opinion merely reinforced that evidence, and gave a gloss of expertise to it, where no expertise was required. 
    It was a decision that the jury was competent to make based on the evidence already before them. 
    It will not... The state does not have to rely on psychiatric testimony to prove the issue of future dangerousness. 
    Five other states have a similar statute. 
    None of those utilize psychiatric testimony.

    He can't be, because the studies have shown that they are not qualified, they are no more qualified than the lay person to make predictions of future dangerousness.

    It is something that can't be removed, because these doctors are so absolute, and a reliable practitioner is not. 
    They can't compete with those people, because they try to stay within the guidelines of their profession. 
    The prejudice cannot be removed, and the whole question comes down to the jury relying on what these doctors tell them, how they should answer the question, a question that this Court has held can be answered by a lay jury. 
    And it is all based on lay testimony. 
    It is all based on the same evidence that the jury heard in these hypothetical situations.

    Mr. William E. Gray, Jr. 
    Well, I don't know. 
    I think 27,000 out of the 35,000 belong to the American Psychiatric Association, and that association is appearing in this case, trying to point out to this Court, as we are, that it is futile to rely upon cross examination of the adversary procedure to counter this type of testimony in a capital case. 
    There is too much at stake. 
    And the jurors invariably believe something that is presented to them as medical testimony by... even though it is not medical testimony, as it was not in this. 
    These were not hypothetical questions. 
    These were fact questions, and even if the Court doesn't go far enough to exclude this type of testimony in every case, I think under the facts of this case it should hold that the procedure used in this particular case was unconstitutional because it was not hypothetical.

   Argument of Douglas M. Becker
speaker="douglas_m_becker" startTime="2024.401" stopTime="2112.785">
    Mr. Douglas M. Becker 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, by way of background upon the stay issue, I wish to state at the outset, as the Court has said in another context, death is indeed different. 
    The Court has said that the imposition or the carrying out of the death penalty is different. 
    The imposition of it is different also, in the rather obvious following manner which I think bears emphasis. 
    No one is sentenced to be on death row, and I think we can all agree that the more than 1,100 persons now on death row represents a national tragedy, but it is a national tragedy that is exacerbated by the fact that they sit there apparently interminably while their cases are litigated year after year in the appellate courts. 
    I think that we can all agree that the effects of this delay are terrible. 
    They erode the public faith in the judiciary, promote the view that the law cannot be carried out, destroy whatever deterrent effect the death penalty would otherwise have, makes proof of claims harder if retrials are necessary, often make retrials impossible, and I think that we also agree that the delays are very unfair to those who are unconstitutionally confined upon death row, who after interminable years on death row finally reach an adjudication that their conviction was unconstitutional in the first place, and now rehabilitation must begin of those individuals after the debilitating effects of being on death row for years.

    Mr. Douglas M. Becker 
    Well, Your Honor, it is because he believed that at least one of the claims was not frivolous. 
    I think we know which one it was, and I think we can tell from the language why he thought that was, and at the same time I can respond to Mr. Justice Rehnquist's earlier question about the inconsistency. 
    The certificate of probable cause was undoubtedly granted as to the hypothetical psychiatric testimony issue, and I think the language that the District Court used showed what he meant. 
    He said, upon careful reflection, or upon reflection, this ground--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2196.172" stopTime="2200.983">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist

    Mr. Douglas M. Becker 
    --The language? 
    It is in the joint appendix, Your Honor, the joint appendix, which contains the District Court's opinion, and he said that upon careful reflection, the ground is without merit, or completely without merit, and what he meant was the ground to him was not frivolous--

    Mr. Douglas M. Becker 
    All right. 
    He said that you couldn't look at the issue and upon its face conclude that it was frivolous, but upon examination and careful thought, that it was entirely without merit, and I think that there is only an inconsistency between the fact that... among the two facts that he granted a certificate of probable cause, and actually, he did not deny a stay of execution. 
    He granted the state's motion to remove the stay of execution that he had previously entered, the same procedural effect. 
    And he thought that even though it was not frivolous upon its face, that upon reflection, it was not a substantial issue. 
    Therefore, he did not stay the execution, and the Court of Appeals looked at the matter the same way.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2275.293" stopTime="2284.289">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    So he thought... the District Judge thought the standard for granting or vacating a stay was different from the standard for issuing a certificate of probable cause?
speaker="douglas_m_becker" startTime="2284.289" stopTime="2292.425">
    Mr. Douglas M. Becker 
    Patently he did, just as the District Court in the Brooks case thought the same thing, and just as the Fifth Circuit judges have thought the same thing and indeed said the same thing.
speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="2292.425" stopTime="2296.110">
    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    Does that mean that he should not have issued a certificate of probable cause?
speaker="douglas_m_becker" startTime="2296.110" stopTime="2333.689">
    Mr. Douglas M. Becker 
    No, sir. 
    We have contended that the hypothetical question issue is not frivolous, but as we argued in the Fifth Circuit, it borders upon the frivolous. 
    That is, we have been unwilling to say it is a frivolous issue completely. 
    It is one that bears some thought, some minimal reflection. 
    But upon making that reflection, every judge that has considered it, which at this point includes 32 by my count, has concluded that the issue is without merit, and is totally without merit. 
    Therefore, even though it may not be frivolous, it is without substance, and there are a large number of issues in these cases that will fall within that category.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="2333.689" stopTime="2350.963">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Well, it just seems so illogical to have a different standard for when you issue a certificate of probable cause than you do for the issuance of a stay so that issue can be resolved. 
    I just don't see how you would argue for a different standard.
speaker="douglas_m_becker" startTime="2350.963" stopTime="2366.818">
    Mr. Douglas M. Becker 
    Well, because we are under different statutes, Your Honor. 
    The certificate of probable cause, as you know, is governed by Rule 22, and Section 2253, and the granting of the stay is governed by Rule 8 of the appellate rules or Section 2251, Part 28, depending on whose argument you buy in the briefs.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="2366.818" stopTime="2369.330">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Well, neither one of them articulate the standard.
speaker="douglas_m_becker" startTime="2369.330" stopTime="2420.904">
    Mr. Douglas M. Becker 
    Well, that's correct, but I think there are different... there are different things involved. 
    The certificate of probable cause is related to what he needs in order to appeal, but the granting of the stay is in effect the granting of an injunction against a state process, a state procedure that has been supported by lengthy judicial proceedings, and I think that the granting of an injunction under those circumstances, whether it is under Rule 8 or Section 2251, involves important comity interests. 
    It involves calling a halt to the state court proceedings, and I think that in order to do that, the Petitioner has a higher burden properly to fulfill than the mere burden that he has to gain a certificate of probable cause to appeal within the federal system something that involves no state interest at all. 
    So, although it may be inconsistent, I think that there are good reasons for it. 
    I also think that--
speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="2420.904" stopTime="2425.934">
    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    Well, there certainly is a great Pyhrric victory, isn't it, to get a certificate of probable cause only to be executed?
speaker="douglas_m_becker" startTime="2425.934" stopTime="2479.662">
    Mr. Douglas M. Becker 
    --Well, Your Honor, I think you have to look and see what happened after he got his certificate of probable cause. 
    We know from this Court's authorities, Garrison and the other cases, that what he has to have is a fair opportunity to present his claims, and he has to have notice of what those procedures are, and in this case he had the opportunity to present a brief, any brief that he wanted, any number of briefs that he wanted up through the day of oral argument. 
    He had unlimited oral argument itself, and he had a written opinion. 
    Now, much has been made of the time periods the Petitioner had to prepare his briefs in his oral argument. 
    In fact, these are... the important issue, the hypothetical testimony issue is one that he had briefed five separate times in prior judicial proceedings, both state and federal, which had been going on since his original appeal. 
    He raised it in his original appeal, and his certiorari--
speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="2479.662" stopTime="2502.135">
    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    General Becker, don't misunderstand me. 
    I am sympathetic, and have said so in published opinions, to this intolerable delay, but I think one hurdle you have is the fact that some federal judge has issued a certificate of probable cause, and I think what you are saying really is that he shouldn't have issued it, and if he had not issued it, you would have an entirely different case.

    Mr. Douglas M. Becker

    Quite a difference.
speaker="douglas_m_becker" startTime="2625.585" stopTime="2700.241">
    Mr. Douglas M. Becker 
    Yes, sir, it is. 
    His execution was scheduled on December the 20th, 1982, 36 days hence, and so at that point he knew he was going to be in the process of getting a stay of execution from the state or the federal courts. 
    He ultimately presented three issues in the fifth circuit to support the granting of a stay. 
    The hypothetical question issue, which had been briefed many times previously, a jurisdictional issue of the Court of Criminal Appeals that the Fifth Circuit did hold frivolous, purely a matter of state law, and thirdly, the issue of the allegedly perjurious witness, Mary Richards. 
    Now, she surfaced on, apparently, December the 27th, 1982, when she contacted the Petitioner's attorneys and they took her deposition in Austin, Texas, when the state was not present, having had no notice, and so even after December the 27th, they had 18 to 20 days in which to prepare a brief raising that issue, which they did. 
    Indeed, the surfacing of Mary Richards is one of the reasons that we have argued that the speeding up of this process achieves justice. 
    The record in this case shows she wouldn't have come forward if an execution date had not been set. 
    I think that the procedure--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2700.241" stopTime="2715.344">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Do you think the Court of Appeals would have been justified in terms of the procedures that it followed in concluding... in concluding... well, it concluded... I will start that way... it concluded the motion for stay should be denied. 
    That was its last few words, wasn't it?

    Mr. Douglas M. Becker 
    --Well, I suppose besides the possibility that some other court might stay the execution and things might be left, the inquiry they were making was not whether he was right or wrong in any of the assertions he was making on the merits. 
    The inquiry they were making under Rule 8 as they followed it was whether or not they entertained a reasonable--

    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, if he couldn't show he had an issue that had any semblance of merit, why didn't... why would you suggest it would be wrong for the Court of Appeals just to affirm?

    Mr. Douglas M. Becker 
    No, sir, it wasn't. 
    What their routine policy was to do was to decide whether he raised an issue that, as I put it in the brief, raised a reasonable judicial doubt as to its outcome. 
    That is all that he had to do, to raise a question in the minds of two out of those three judges that if he had an appeal, it was possible that he might win, reasonable to think that he might win, and if he couldn't do that, then the Fifth Circuit, by denying the state of execution, would in effect be saying, what is the use of going ahead with the full appeal and more briefing and our usual burdens upon whether judgment is going to be affirmed or reversed when the result is preordained by the finding that we have already made that he can't even present an issue that has substantial merit or semblance.

    Well, Garrison suggests... said you could use summary procedures, and you could collapse... you could collapse the question of stay and the merits, but it never suggested that you could avoid ruling on the merits with finality, and there was no ruling on the merits with finality here.

    Mr. Douglas M. Becker 
    --Correct, which is exactly what happened in the appeal of Charlie Brooks. 
    That's right. 
    And if the Fifth Circuit had adopted those procedures, I have agreed that I think that they could have done so under Garrison if there had been notice to the parties and so on, but what they did here was, they did something that was even easier for the Petitioner. 
    They said, you don't have to convince us you are going to win. 
    All you have to convince us of is that there is a reasonable doubt or, as the Fifth Circuit has also said, that we don't have adequate time at this point to determine whether or not you raise a substantial issue. 
    And the Fifth Circuit said in O'Bryan that if they didn't have adequate time again they would grant the stay. 
    I have said in my brief that I don't quarrel with that approach either. 
    I think perhaps I have conceded too much. 
    The problem of the--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="2967.741" stopTime="2996.448">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    May I ask you a question at this point about the timing of the thing? 
    Because we are all interested in expeditious procedures in these cases. 
    The case was in the state court system for about three years. 
    It was in the Federal District Court for several months, maybe close to a year. 
    And then you get to the Court of Appeals, and suddenly there is a great emergency. 
    Why, if there is this much time allowed for the Texas appellate courts to review it carefully, why should there suddenly be this change in emphasis on accelerated procedures here?
speaker="douglas_m_becker" startTime="2996.448" stopTime="3005.022">
    Mr. Douglas M. Becker 
    --Well, Your Honor, I think it is appropriate for the focus in these proceedings to be upon the trial, the direct appeal, and the first certiorari petition. 
    Those are the--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="3005.022" stopTime="3007.443">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    But couldn't they be done more rapidly than three years?

    Mr. Douglas M. Becker 
    --Well, I wish that they had been, and in this case, the trial itself, the conviction occurred three and a half months after the crime.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="3013.441" stopTime="3014.097">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Right.
speaker="douglas_m_becker" startTime="3014.097" stopTime="3018.830">
    Mr. Douglas M. Becker 
    Then it was on appeal in the Court of Criminal Appeals for 17 months before a result was obtained--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="3018.830" stopTime="3021.985">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    That compares with what period of time in the federal appellate system?
speaker="douglas_m_becker" startTime="3021.985" stopTime="3086.896">
    Mr. Douglas M. Becker 
    --Yes, sir. 
    Well, then there was a certiorari petition which sat in this Court for 14 months before being ruled upon, and then he was in... he filed the state habeas corpus writ that was very speedily resolved, denied by the Court of Criminal Appeals about four months after this Court had denied certiorari. 
    Then he was in Federal District Court, where it took 13 months following an evidentiary hearing. 
    It wouldn't have taken so long. 
    There were three evidentiary hearings set at our request, upon our motion to expedite proceedings in the District Court, but the judge heard extensive evidence in that federal evidentiary hearing. 
    He had to write extensive findings of fact, conclusions of law, which took him from August to November, basically, to write, and which I don't think was an unreasonable delay, and I think it's appropriate at this point... at that point in the proceedings to say that if the Petitioner, after all of this review, which at that point had involved nine separate proceedings, 51 judges, state and federal, not one of whom had ever found any constitutional problem with what happened at his trial.

    No... well... No, sir, there was... between his first appeal and his second and third state habeas corpus appeals, there was a large turnover on the Court of Criminal Appeals.

    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    But is it your submission, just so I get it, that once the case reached the Federal Court of Appeals for the first time, then everything should accelerated at a radically different rate than ordinary litigation?
speaker="douglas_m_becker" startTime="3149.761" stopTime="3176.108">
    Mr. Douglas M. Becker 
    Well, ordinary litigation is subject to motions to stay pending appeal. 
    It is routine. 
    We have to get them ourselves when we lose habeas corpus cases in the state of Texas, and there's an order to release a petitioner. 
    We have to go to the Fifth Circuit and ask for a motion to stay that in order to keep him incarcerated during the appeal. 
    It is not extraordinary. 
    Now, it may appear extraordinary when it is applied to a capital case, but again, the burden that is placed on the petitioner is the same as any litigant.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="3176.108" stopTime="3191.945">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Well, I understand. 
    I am really trying to get your position as a general matter, not just this case. 
    Is it your view that when a capital case first reaches the Federal Court of Appeals on the first review of a denial of an application for habeas corpus, there should be an expedited procedure in that court in every capital case?
speaker="douglas_m_becker" startTime="3191.945" stopTime="3193.212">
    Mr. Douglas M. Becker 
    Well, yes.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="3193.212" stopTime="3198.037">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    And if so, how much... what should it be, ten-day briefing, or what is the regular procedure they ought to follow?
speaker="douglas_m_becker" startTime="3198.037" stopTime="3234.509">
    Mr. Douglas M. Becker 
    Well, Your Honor, the Fifth Circuit has to allow the briefing that the time constraints will allow in terms of the execution and then if there hasn't been adequate time for them to get briefs that they thought were satisfactory, or to decide the issues presented by the briefs, then I said they should stop the execution, they should stay it. 
    They should refuse to stay the execution only where they are satisfied with the presentation by the parties and where they are satisfied in good conscience that they have had adequate time to determine that there is not substantial issue. 
    Otherwise, they are free to stay the execution. 
    We are asking for a limited rule. 
    We are not saying Petitioner has the burden of proof to do this, and if he doesn't have time to do it, then he loses.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="3234.509" stopTime="3246.675">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    No, but you are asking... I just want to be sure I understand you. 
    You are asking that as soon as the first federal habeas corpus application is denied, you then will run into... proceed, I shouldn't say run, you will go promptly into the state court and get an execution date set--

    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    --which will then accelerate the proceedings in the Court of Appeals.
speaker="douglas_m_becker" startTime="3250.142" stopTime="3292.093">
    Mr. Douglas M. Becker 
    And then we will be fighting for a stay of execution or opposing a stay of execution. 
    That's right. 
    We have attempted to expedite the proceedings also in the District Courts, and have been very successful, and did so in this very case, expedite them at every point, to reach a result in these cases, whether the state wins or whether the state loses. 
    We want to reach a result. 
    We want the people off death row, whether they weren't supposed to be there in the first place or whether there is no constitutional problem with their conviction, and that they should be executed, and when we are in the context of a motion for stay in the Fifth Circuit, we don't think it is inappropriate to ask the Court of Appeals to refuse to grant the stay of execution unless the Petitioner can show a substantial issue. 
    That is all that we have asked for in this case.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="3292.093" stopTime="3306.664">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    And it would be your view that if he did show a substantial issue and they weren't quite prepared to decide it, they should then have a second argument. 
    You are in effect asking for two arguments on the merits, I mean, in a case that is close enough that it requires some thought.

    Well, if they didn't have time to decide the question, which is what they said in the O'Bryan case, then they grant the stay of execution, and what would happen is, then they went ahead with the normal briefing schedule. 
    Now, once they had stayed the execution, there wasn't anything else that could be done, because the state of Texas couldn't set a new execution ordinarily.

    It seems to me it is a... maybe this shouldn't be a consideration, but the procedure you advocate will be more burdensome for the Federal Courts of Appeals, because they will have to take the first look at it on an expedited basis, and if they think there is a serious question, then they set it down for a second briefing and argument.

    --Rule 8 is probably burdensome to the... more burdensome to the Court of Appeals than life would be without it, because in those cases, too, they have to do the same thing. 
    They have to decide, do we stop everything on appeal, and if we don't, sometimes that makes things easier for them. 
    An appeal can be mooted out by refusing to stay the judgment of the District Court, and subject it to dismissal later on, as certainly happened, and has happened to me.

   Rebuttal of Douglas M. Becker
speaker="douglas_m_becker" startTime="3389.599" stopTime="3699.262">
    Mr. Douglas M. Becker 
    Your Honors, I have attempted to reduce my argument upon the stay question to a syllogism. 
    First, that it is perfectly understandable why the standards for granting a certificate of probable cause and a stay pending appeal are different. 
    A certificate of probable cause to the appeal involves an internal matter of federal jurisdiction with no particular concern for the state. 
    The granting of a stay pending an appeal involves in effect an injunction against the state court proceedings and, we argue, justifies the higher standard that has been required in these cases. 
    The standard for a certificate of probable cause is an absence of frivolity of at least one issue, and of the stay, that there be a substantial question. 
    The opinion of the District Court in this case illustrates the District Court's painstaking attempt to distinguish between those issues that were frivolous, some of which were labeled as frivolous in his opinion, and others, like the psychiatric issue, at Page 12 of the joint appendix, where the District Court stated that upon careful reflection, this ground is without merit, and I think the District Court felt that if he had to give the kind of careful reflection to an issue that he had to give in this opinion, that it was not frivolous, but at the same time that he could in good faith conclude that it was not substantial, and therefore grant the state's motion to reinstitute the execution. 
    Secondly, the Fifth Circuit could have simply expedited the appeal and done essentially the same things that it did do and affirm the judgment of the District Court. 
    Instead, it did something that was more favorable to the Petitioner. 
    Clearly, the Fifth Circuit addressed the merits of all the issues that Petitioner raised in this case. 
    They did so in applying the stay standard to determine whether any of those were substantial, a more favorable standard for Petitioner to prevail upon than he would have had in an expedited appeal. 
    So, although I think they could have expedited the appeal and actually affirmed the judgment, I also think if they could have done that, plainly they could have done something that was more favorable to Petitioner, which is to consider his issues within the context of a stay. 
    The procedures are not precisely a way to expedite all capital cases, as was suggested. 
    It is a manner, and there have been indeed many cases where we did not oppose stays of execution that were granted by District Courts, even though we were plainly entitled to do that in the Court of Appeals under Rule 8. 
    Instead, what it is is a means of deciding where an injunction is necessary in a capital case as in any other kind of case, to preserve the appellant's right to appeal, to make a preliminary evaluation of the issues that are presented, to determine whether any of them are substantial, and to determine whether further delays are appropriate even though there are no substantial issues. 
    And what the Court of Appeals did in this case is to decide that where there was no substantial issue after a careful examination of the merits, no further delay was appropriate. 
    I don't think that that is an unreasonable burden on the Courts of Appeals. 
    It is one that they exercise all the time. 
    I don't think the Fifth Circuits thinks it is an unreasonable burden. 
    The Fifth Circuit, it must be remembered, the Court of Appeals had the absolute right simply to grant the stay of execution pending appeal. 
    They would have had to write nothing upon that point, and the state would have been out of court. 
    Instead, what they did was to take on that burden and to decide the question of whether any of the issues were substantial. 
    With respect to the issue of the hypothetical psychiatric testimony, I think that what the plaintiff does ask the Court in effect to do is to overrule Jurek, something that is obviously not before the Court, and that is the import of his argument, because in Jurek if the Court approved the future dangerousness issue as an appropriate one to decide the question of life or death, the Court also in the same breath said that all relevant evidence should be presented. 
    I think that Petitioner's argument that there is no room for mitigating circumstances within this context is plainly without merit. 
    The very criteria that Drs. Holbrook and Grigson enumerated as important to their diagnosis emphasized the kinds of things that Petitioner says he had no opportunity to present, things like family ties, and employment record, attendance at church, a stable circle of friends, and all the other things in his brief that he says could not have affected the opinion of the psychiatrists are the very things that are directly related to the loyalty to institutions that the doctors talked aboutduring their testimony. 
    He could have impeached their testimony upon that basis and asked them if it would have been changed if any of those things existed. 
    He could have clearly put on evidence, mitigating evidence of those facts at the punishment phase in order to argue that to the jury, and he did not. 
    It can only be assumed that those things did not exist. 
    I also will emphasize that under Texas law, the defendant can, and he does, call psychiatric witnesses in his own behalf, and although the assertion has been made--

    Mr. Douglas M. Becker 
    --Well, Your Honor, I am not sure I understand the question.

    Are you using just Dr. Grigson in all these cases?

    Mr. Douglas M. Becker 
    --Well, now, it is up to the individual district attorneys as to who they want to use. 
    Both Dr. Grigson and Dr. Holbrook testified at trial that they had testified for defendants before. 
    That is in the record. 
    Dr. Grigson has testified against me in a habeas corpus proceeding. 
    And so I don't think the situation is as black and white as Petitioner and some of the amici would lead you to believe.
speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="3761.877" stopTime="3764.533">
    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    Well, he has been here in every case we have had from Texas.
speaker="douglas_m_becker" startTime="3764.533" stopTime="3824.070">
    Mr. Douglas M. Becker 
    Yes, sir. 
    He has... There is no denying that he has testified in a wide range of cases. 
    There is also no denying that that would be a substantial basis for his impeachment by the defendant, and in fact that was used as a basis for his impeachment. 
    During jury argument, I think it is worth noting... I think reading the jury argument in this case at the punishment phase is well worth the Court's time, because it places this issue within the proper context. 
    You will see defense counsel arguing to the jury without objection that psychiatrists cannot predict human behavior with certainty, citing literature, the studies, the APA task force report. 
    They can't predict future dangerousness. 
    They had never examined defendants. 
    That their elements of the diagnosis didn't prove it. 
    That all sociopaths do not necessarily commit acts of future violence. 
    That the facts in the hypothetical question were not true and therefore should not be believed by the jury, and a number of other matters. 
    They also emphasized that there was nothing in the hypothetical question about--
speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="3824.070" stopTime="3830.165">
    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    Of course, he had no other alternative. 
    The evidence was admitted. 
    That was the only thing that he had to say.
speaker="douglas_m_becker" startTime="3830.165" stopTime="3831.819">
    Mr. Douglas M. Becker 
    --Well, Your Honor, but he could--

    You can't criticize him for having done this.
speaker="douglas_m_becker" startTime="3833.539" stopTime="3902.977">
    Mr. Douglas M. Becker 
    --Well, he could have presented evidence of his own to further substantiate his claim. 
    In fact, I don't know of anything that is any of the briefs of the Petitioner or of the amici that could not have been presented at trial, either in the way of evidence or in the way of jury argument. 
    The jury was charged by the court that expert witnesses are the same as any other witnesses in the sense that their testimony is to be weighed by the jury, and the jury is to give whatever credibility that they wish to those witnesses. 
    And the district attorney in this case, in his own summation, told the jury to weigh the testimony of the expert witnesses, and that they may want to put a certain amount of credence here, or a certain amount there, and furthermore, he told the jury that if any way the facts and the hypothetical question were inaccurate, that they should not... that they should discount the answer to the hypothetical question also. 
    I think that there was ample ground for the defense to present mitigation within the context of the hypothetical question, and that as long as that opportunity existed, they should not be heard to complain now.
