    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    The second case that I have to announce is Associated General Contractors of California against California State Council of Carpenters and others. 
    The case arises out of a dispute between parties to a multiemployer collective bargaining agreement. 
    The plaintiff unions alleged that in violation of the antitrust laws, the mutliemployer association and its members coerced certain third parties as well as some of the association's members to enter into a business relationship with nonunion firms. 
    This coercion according to the complaint adversely affected the trade of certain unionized firms and thereby in turn, restrained the business activities of the unions. 
    The unions filed suit in United States District Court for the Northern District of California, alleging that they have been injured by conduct in violation of the federal antitrust laws. 
    The District Court dismissed the complaint and the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed. 
    We granted certiorari to decide whether the Union's compliant sufficiently alleged that they were parties who have been injured in their business or property by reason of anything forbidden in the antirust laws and may therefore recovered treble damages under Section 4 of the Clayton Act. 
    For reasons stated at length in an opinion filed with the clerk today, we conclude that the Union's action may not be maintained under this statute. 
    We, therefore, reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals. 
    Justice Marshall has filed a dissenting opinion.
