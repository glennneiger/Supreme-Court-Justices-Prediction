    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    This case comes to us on appeal from the Supreme Court of Minnesota. 
    Minnesota imposes a sales tax on most retail sales but not on the sales of goods to be used as components in the production of other goods. 
    The state also imposes a complimentary use tax on goods purchased out-of-state for use in the state. 
    Publications are exempt from the sales tax. 
    In 1971, however, the state legislature amended the use tax provision to impose a tax on all ink and paper purchased by publications. 
    Publications became the only producers required to pay a tax on the purchase of components. 
    The state later amended that provision again to exempt from tax the first $100,000 worth of ink and paper consumed by a publication in a calendar year. 
    As a result, only a handful of newspapers incurred any liability at all for the ink and paper tax. 
    And the appellant, Minneapolis Star &amp; Tribune paid roughly two thirds of the taxes collected. 
    It brought this action to seek a refund of the taxes paid alleging a violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments. 
    The Minneapolis Supreme Court upheld the tax. 
    We now reverse. 
    Minnesota's ink and paper tax is a special tax that singles out the press for treatment different from that of other taxpayers. 
    Special taxation of this type was among the concerns of the framers of the First Amendment. 
    And it necessarily places a burden upon the rights protected by the First Amendment. 
    Unless the state presents a governmental interest that could not be achieved without the burden on First Amendment rights, and that is sufficient to counterbalance the burden, its tax cannot survive review. 
    Minnesota has asserted no such interest here. 
    Further, Minnesota's tax is objectionable because the structure of the exemptions is tailored to target a few publications to bear the burden of the tax while excusing all others. 
    Again, the state has not offered an adequate justification for this burden on First Amendment rights. 
    Justice Blackmun joins the opinion except footnote 12. 
    Justice White has filed an opinion concurring in part and dissenting part. 
    Justice Rehnquist has filed a dissenting opinion.
