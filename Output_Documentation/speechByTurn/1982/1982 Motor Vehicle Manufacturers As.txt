    Justice Byron R. White 
    These cases are here from the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. 
    In 1966, Congress passed the National Traffic and Highway Safety Act which among other things required that the Secretary of Agriculture formulate an issue, Highway Safety Standards. 
    The Secretary delegated his authority to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. 
    That agency, among other things, issued Safety Standard 208 which at that time simply required that new cars have seat belts. 
    Over a period of time however, and after much pulling and hauling, the agency issued a Modified Standard 208. 
    That standard among other things required that after certain date, new cars would be equipped either with airbags or with automatic seatbelts. 
    These were the so-called passive restraints and that they -- and they are used, didn't require – didn’t depend on the volition of the driver or the other occupant of the car. 
    That standard to say the least was controversial. 
    There were many developments and eventually the agency revoked or rescinded Modified Standard 208 insofar as it required any passive restraint. 
    After that, the aim of the decision was to eliminate the requirement for either airbags or automatic seatbelts. 
    The decision was challenged in the Court of Appeals successfully, the Court of Appeals holding and that their rescission was arbitrary capricious. 
    The Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association and others brought the cases here and we granted certiorari. 
    Although our approach to the case is somewhat different from Court of Appeals, we also hold the rescission to have been arbitrary and -- and capricious. 
    Agencies are required to give reasons for their action and to explain the basis for their decisions. 
    That standard was not satisfied here. 
    The entire focus of the rescission action was on automatic seatbelts. 
    No attention was given to -- or no explanation was given as to why the airbag requirement was rescinded along with the automatic seatbelt requirement and that the agency must explain. 
    We also have concluded for reasons, we've given an opinion that the explanation for rescinding the automatic seatbelt requirement was also inadequate in certain respects. 
    Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated. 
    The cases are returned to that Court so that they may be returned to the agency for proceedings consistent with our opinion. 
    The opinion is unanimous except for Parts 5 (b) and Part 6. 
    Justice Rehnquist has filed an opinion concurring in part in dissenting and part in which he explains why he, the Chief Justice, and Justices Powell and O'Connor do not join those two parts of the opinion.
