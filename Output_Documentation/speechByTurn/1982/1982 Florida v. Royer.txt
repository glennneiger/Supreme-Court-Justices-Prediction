    Justice Byron R. White 
    In this case, the respondent, Royer, was stopped by police officers as he was about to board a plane, the Florida airport. 
    The officers told him he was suspected of carrying drugs. 
    He accompanied them to a room off the concourse and there he consented to the search of his luggage, which the officers had retrieved from the airline. 
    Drugs were found in each of two suitcases. 
    The trial judge denied Royer's motion to suppress the evidence, but -- and he was convicted. 
    The Florida Court of Appeals set aside the conviction holding that when Royer gave his consent, he was being illegally detained and hence, his consent was tainted and the evidence was inadmissible. 
    We granted certiorari and we affirm that judgment. 
    However, there is not an opinion for the Court. 
    I have filed an opinion stating why Justice Marshall, Justice Powell and Justice Stevens and myself would affirm the judgment. 
    Justice Brennan would also affirm and has filed an opinion. 
    Justice Powell has filed a concurring opinion. 
    Justice -- Justice Blackmun and Justice Rehnquist have each filed a dissenting opinion. 
    The Chief Justice and Justice O'Connor joined Justice Rehnquist.
