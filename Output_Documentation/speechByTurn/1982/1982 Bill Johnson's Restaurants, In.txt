Bill Johnson's Restaurants, Inc. v. NLRB
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="0.000" stopTime="47.246">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    We will hear arguments next in Bill Johnson's Restaurants against National Labor Relations Board. 
    Mr. Katz, you may proceed whenever you are ready.
speaker="lawrence_allen_katz" startTime="47.246" stopTime="235.168">
    Mr. Lawrence Allen Katz 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the issue before the Court in this case is the extent to which restraints should be placed upon the power of the National Labor Relations Board to interfere with civil proceedings instituted in state court and growing out of a labor dispute. 
    The civil litigation in this case was a suit filed in the Arizona Superior Court by petitioner, Bill Johnson's Restaurants, against several persons who were demonstrating in front of the restaurant in September, 1978. 
    The suit alleged that the protesters had defamed the restaurant by publishing leaflets which accused the restaurant in engaging in a refusal to pay lawful overtime, in sexually harassing waitresses, in discharging a waitress for union activity, and maintaining filthy restrooms. 
    The suit also asked for injunctive relief and for damages for misconduct occurring during the demonstrations. 
    This Court has held in the past that some controversies arising out of labor disputes are so deeply rooted in matters of local concern and responsibility that the state courts have primary jurisdiction to hear and determine these controversies even though they may touch on matters of federal concern as well, and I refer here to suits growing out of labor controversies involving defamation, involving violence, involving trespass and other torts out of such labor disputes where the public peace and order are threatened. 
    In these cases, the state has been held to have an overriding interest in the resolution of the controversy. 
    Despite this history, the National Labor Relations Board has in the present case ordered the restaurant to withdraw its civil suit and to compensate the defendants for all expenses incurred by them in the defense of the suit, including expenses incurred by them in the prosecution of their counterclaims. 
    The Board does not justify its order in this case by any finding that the complaint filed by the restaurant on its face asked for relief barred by the National Labor Relations Act. 
    The Board does not justify its order in this case by any finding that the complaint filed by the restaurant was pre-empted by the National Labor Relations Act, or that it raised issues that were already pending before the Board. 
    Instead, the Board attempts to justify its intrusion into the parties' civil litigation by a finding that the restaurant's suit constituted an effort to retaliate against those demonstrators who were outside its premises. 
    To reach that result, the Board performed adjudicatory responsibilities that should have been performed by the state court. 
    After the restaurant filed its suit, the Board compelled the restaurant to demonstrate that the suit had some reasonable factual basis, that it had merit. 
    Considerable evidence was presented before the Board's Administrative Law Judge on the same questions that were then pending in front of the state trial court. 
    For example, were the offensive statements of the demonstrators true or false? 
    Did the demonstrators publish those statements knowing them to be true or false? 
    Did the demonstrators improperly obstruct or interfere with the restaurant's operations?

    Mr. Lawrence Allen Katz 
    Questions of defamation arising out of a labor dispute are questions of state law.

    Mr. Lawrence Allen Katz 
    The question of whether there was a publication was not at issue, but other questions decided by the Administrative Law Judge, Justice Rehnquist, were in fact then pending before the state court.

    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    A federal question could be pending before the state court. 
    I was more interested in whether the Administrative Law Judge also examined question that were concededly only of state law. 
    Did the Administrative Law Judge say there wasn't anything to the suit under state law?

    Mr. Lawrence Allen Katz

    Your Honor, the--

speaker="lawrence_allen_katz" startTime="290.881" stopTime="317.479">
    Mr. Lawrence Allen Katz 
    --It is purely a state law question. 
    The Administrative Law Judge determined... The Administrative Law Judge determined that in fact the statements on the relief work were truthful, and in fact the demonstrators had not engaged in obstructions or interference with restaurant property, and that in fact the restaurant's lawsuit lacked a reasonable basis, and his interpretation had to be one of state law, because the issue was one of state law. 
    The Board--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="317.479" stopTime="346.203">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Mr. Katz, would you concede that perhaps the National Labor Relations Board, through its Administrative Law Judge, could still consider issues relating to whether it's an unfair labor practice here to have filed the state suit at least for purposes of giving other remedial relief other than the cease and desist order, for example, requiring payment of costs of suit?
speaker="lawrence_allen_katz" startTime="346.203" stopTime="379.922">
    Mr. Lawrence Allen Katz 
    --Justice O'Connor, I would say that the responsibility of the National Labor Relations Board in that circumstance would be to wait until the state court had issued its determination on the merits of the lawsuit. 
    At that point, if the state court had failed to issue sufficient relief to protect the federal rights that were then at issue, or to protect the rights of employees under the National Labor Relations Act, the Board certainly had the opportunity to take another look at the unfair labor practice charge that was in front of it and to determine whether the interests of the National Labor Relations Act required supplemental relief to be ordered.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="379.922" stopTime="388.762">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    What do you see in the Act that would affect the timing of the Board's jurisdiction in that regard?
speaker="lawrence_allen_katz" startTime="388.762" stopTime="432.636">
    Mr. Lawrence Allen Katz 
    If I understand your question, Justice O'Connor, Section 10(j) of the Act would allow the National Labor Relations Board to file a petition with the United States District Court in order to protect the interests of the Act and the interests of employees against any direct infringement that might occur during the prosecution of that suit. 
    For example, if the plaintiff in such a state suit engaged in discovery which the Board determined might have an adverse impact on a proceeding then pending before the Board, it is arguable that the Board could apply under Section 10(j) to the United States District Court and obtain an appropriately limited injunction. 
    In this case, the Board might well have been able to do that, but instead--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="432.636" stopTime="435.041">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    That's an exception to the Anti-Injunction Act--
speaker="lawrence_allen_katz" startTime="435.041" stopTime="488.036">
    Mr. Lawrence Allen Katz 
    --Yes, Your Honor. 
    That would be an exception to the Anti-Injunction Act, and this Court has recognized two or three exceptions to the Anti-Injunction Act in the past, and I think one of them would be applicable in this case, and that is, when the Board has to act in aid of its own jurisdiction. 
    If there is an issue pending before the Board which has also been raised before the state court, or if the proceedings in the state court threaten to impact directly on the proceedings before the National Labor Relations Board, that, I believe, is what Congress intended Section 10(j) of the National Labor Relations Act to be used for, and the Board could go into the District Court and petition for appropriate limited injunctive relief. 
    In this case, the Board did not seek an appropriate limited injunction from the District Court. 
    The Board petitioned the District Court under Section 10(j) for an injunction restraining the entire lawsuit that had been filed in the state court.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="488.036" stopTime="495.937">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    --What if the Board had limited its relief to an order that court costs or legal fees be paid?

    Mr. Lawrence Allen Katz 
    While the state court suit was still pending?
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="498.607" stopTime="499.843">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Right.
speaker="lawrence_allen_katz" startTime="499.843" stopTime="519.490">
    Mr. Lawrence Allen Katz 
    I think that would be an unwarranted infringement on the state suit. 
    I think any remedy that would come out of the state proceeding was within the original primary jurisdiction of the state court, and the Board could only interfere with that proceeding to the extent that there was a direct impact on a matter pending then before the Board. 
    In this case, there was no such finding.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="519.490" stopTime="539.653">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    You are saying, I take it, that the statute, the federal statute, 2283, I think, has not expressly authorized this kind of restraint to be put on the Board.
speaker="lawrence_allen_katz" startTime="539.653" stopTime="540.605">
    Mr. Lawrence Allen Katz 
    It has not.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="540.605" stopTime="554.414">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    What is the scope of the Administrative Law Judge's inquiry to determine whether there is harassment that would interfere with the Board's jurisdiction?
speaker="lawrence_allen_katz" startTime="554.414" stopTime="623.934">
    Mr. Lawrence Allen Katz 
    I think that if the civil suit on its face were to allege a cause of action barred by the National Labor Relations Act, then the Administrative Law Judge arguably would have authority to take action and perhaps that might include even the restraint of that suit. 
    I think, for example, of the 1970 Machinists case and the 1972 Textile Workers case, in which unions had allegedly violated the Act by seeking to impose fines on employees who had engaged in conduct that was against the union constitution, but the conduct had been engaged in after the employees had resigned from the union. 
    Such a complaint may well state a cause of action barred by the National Labor Relations Act, and in those cases the Board held an unfair labor practice had occurred, and the Board enjoined the state court action to enforce the fines. 
    That, of course, is not our case, because the state court complaint filed in this case did not allege a cause of action barred by the National Labor Relations Act or pre-empted by the National Labor Relations Act.

    I might point out, if Your Honor will refer to Exhibit B attached to our brief, which is a selection from the transcript of proceedings before the District Court, District Judge Crane did suggest to the Board that he would be willing to consider an order enjoining the respondent from interfering with proceedings before the Board, but the Board did not pick up on that suggestion, and did not ask for any more limited injunction.

    Justice Byron R. White 
    Could I ask you, how do you read the National Labor Relations Board views in this case? 
    In order to make out the unfair labor practice which they found, according to them, is it necessary to prove not only an anti-union bias or a harassment, but also that the action have no basis?

    Mr. Lawrence Allen Katz 
    It is difficult to read the National Labor Relations Board, because--

    Justice Byron R. White 
    I know what the Administrative Law Judge said, but I don't read the Board as relying on that other factor at all, just a finding that the suit was motivated by an anti-union bias or by retaliation.

    Mr. Lawrence Allen Katz

    Mr. Lawrence Allen Katz 
    Well, although the Board is willing to look at the merits of the state court suit in order to determine whether it has a foundation in fact--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="786.255" stopTime="795.064">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, I know, but even... assume that it does have a foundation in fact. 
    The Board would still find an unfair labor practice.
speaker="lawrence_allen_katz" startTime="795.064" stopTime="797.311">
    Mr. Lawrence Allen Katz 
    --I think that's a fair conclusion from the position the Board has taken.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="797.311" stopTime="800.824">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    I don't think that's true of what the Court of Appeals said in reviewing the Board though.
speaker="lawrence_allen_katz" startTime="800.824" stopTime="811.462">
    Mr. Lawrence Allen Katz 
    The Court of Appeals indicated that even in the absence of an unlawful motivation, a suit which had a coercive impact on employees might well be a violation of Section 81.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="811.462" stopTime="814.602">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    I know, but they would require that the suit have no basis.
speaker="lawrence_allen_katz" startTime="814.602" stopTime="896.928">
    Mr. Lawrence Allen Katz 
    That's not... well, yes, I think I'd have to concede that. 
    The Court of Appeals would require the suit have no basis. 
    It is not clear the Board would do that. 
    The Ninth Circuit held that the restaurants also had a lawful objective on its face, and then the Ninth Circuit went on to say that the proper test of the legitimacy of a state cause of action is whether the plaintiff has evidence to support his allegations. 
    Now, we agree with that holding, but we disagree with the Ninth Circuit as to the appropriate forum in which such evidence should be tested. 
    Simply put, our position is that the NLRB is not entitled to adjudicate or to restrain a pending state court lawsuit which has a lawful objective on its face and its properly subject to state court jurisdiction. 
    I pointed out a moment ago that there might be some situations in which the state court suit asks for relief barred by the National Labor Relations Act. 
    In such a case, the Board might arguably have the right to restraint that suit, but in so considering, the Board might take into account the motive for filing the suit. 
    For example, there have been a number of suits where employers have sought injunctions against activity that was clearly protected, such as picketing. 
    In such cases, it has been the Board's habit to evaluate the motive for such suit, and if the Board determines that the motive is one of good faith, the Board has typically not restrained the state court suit.

    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Well, Mr. Katz, in this instance, unless I am mistaken, your client was found by the Board to have committed an unfair labor practice by prosecuting the suit.

    Mr. Lawrence Allen Katz 
    Yes, Your Honor.

    Mr. Lawrence Allen Katz 
    Well, we are certainly challenging that an unfair labor practice has occurred in the filing of the suit, and more importantly, we are challenging the process by which the Board reached its conclusion that an unfair labor practice had existed. 
    The Board--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="928.072" stopTime="930.822">

    We did not challenge the--

    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    I read your petition as challenging the power of the Board to order you to cease and desist from the state court action.
speaker="lawrence_allen_katz" startTime="956.949" stopTime="1061.298">
    Mr. Lawrence Allen Katz 
    --And the ability of the Board to find that a suit filed in state court which has a lawful purpose on its face and is subject to state court jurisdiction is an unfair labor practice. 
    The Board now asserts the right, and it is a very broad right, to conduct a threshold scrutiny of litigation involving labor disputes in order to determine whether the plaintiff's motivation is to use an apparently lawful suit in order to retaliate against the defendant for conduct protected by the National Labor Relations Act. 
    We believe the Board has no such power. 
    When a civil suit has a lawful objective on its face, and is subject to state court jurisdiction, the state court interest is superior. 
    We recognize that there is a balancing of interests, when we are involved with a labor dispute, when there are some federal rights at issue, and when there are some state rights to be protected, but when the suit has a lawful objective, it is properly subject to state court jurisdiction, that balancing test requires that the state court interest be superior, and that the state court bears responsibility for trial on the merits and for all appropriate relief. 
    Concern that the litigation may be motivated by improper considerations should not allow the Board to subject the plaintiff in the suit to an administrative trial of the civil complaint in order to assess his motive by evaluating the factual and the legal support for his civil claims. 
    If the Board does intend to determine that the weakness in a plaintiff's suit justifies an inference that the suit was brought for retaliatory purposes and is therefore an unfair labor practice, then the Board must await the decision of the state court, and to the extent that the state court fails to provide sufficient relief to accommodate the interests of the National Labor Relations Act, the Board still has the ability to step in and to award the proper relief.

    He must do so without discovery. 
    He must do so without a civil judge, and without a civil jury.

    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Mr. Katz, what do you mean by the Board going forward? 
    Do you mean going forward with any of the possible proceedings against the employer, or do you mean just going forward in making a determination as to the merits of the employer's state court suit?
speaker="lawrence_allen_katz" startTime="1293.312" stopTime="1343.837">
    Mr. Lawrence Allen Katz 
    I mean the latter. 
    If the employer were alleged to have committed a series of unfair labor practices, one of which was the filing of a civil suit which is alleged to be retaliatory, I would certainly concede that the Board can go forward to adjudicate the other unfair labor practices, and perhaps to look at the entire pattern and say, this employer is engaged in a course of conduct which constitutes an unfair labor practice and must be stopped, but even in such circumstances, the Board could not restrain the pending state court suit. 
    Once the state court suit had run its course, and informed by the decision and the findings in the state court, the Board might then decide to supplement the relief it had provided by a further order enjoining the commencement perhaps of subsequent state court proceedings which might be a part of that same pattern and practice of coercive conduct.

    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    What if the action of the Board was initiated before the state court suit, on allegations of unfair labor practice, and then it develops that the suit is filed and they expand the case? 
    You say they have to stop?
speaker="lawrence_allen_katz" startTime="1360.660" stopTime="1390.444">
    Mr. Lawrence Allen Katz 
    No, Your Honor. 
    The Board's authority to find an unfair labor practice based on a threat to file a lawsuit is not challenged here, nor is the Board's authority to enjoin an employer's intention to commence something if there is sufficient substantial evidence to indicate that the employee is going to engage in some conduct, including perhaps a suit which would be a violation of the National Labor Relations Act, but of course that is not this case. 
    Our case is one in which a state court--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="1390.444" stopTime="1402.939">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Your position would be that if what had happened here was that Bill Johnson's had threatened a lawsuit, that the National Labor Relations Board could go ahead and process a complaint.
speaker="lawrence_allen_katz" startTime="1402.939" stopTime="1404.203">
    Mr. Lawrence Allen Katz 
    --That is correct, Justice O'Connor.

    But if the suit is filed by Bill Johnson's, then it must stop what it is doing.
speaker="lawrence_allen_katz" startTime="1408.531" stopTime="1435.878">
    Mr. Lawrence Allen Katz 
    That is not only my contention, Justice O'Connor. 
    It is what the Board has held for many, many years. 
    One year before our civil suit was filed, the Board decided the case of Essie Nichols Marcey, in 1977, cited in our papers. 
    In that case, the employer had threatened to file a lawsuit and the employer had filed a lawsuit. 
    The Board found the threat to file the lawsuit to be an unfair labor practice. 
    The Board found that the filing of the lawsuit itself was not an unfair labor practice. 
    We agree with that decision.

    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Mr. Katz, do you know what the first case decided by the Board was in which the conducting of a state lawsuit was found to be an unfair labor practice?
speaker="lawrence_allen_katz" startTime="1452.466" stopTime="1511.661">
    Mr. Lawrence Allen Katz 
    The first case that comes to mind, Your Honor, is the 1960 case, I believe it is, of Clyde Taylor, although I remember the Clyde Taylor overruled a case called W.T. Carter, which may have been on the same issue. 
    The W.T. Carter case and the Clyde Taylor case are, of course, opposites. 
    In Clyde Taylor there was a finding that the employer had as part of a bad faith effort to stop a union campaign filed a civil suit. 
    Nevertheless, the Board in that 1960 case, adopting the dissent in W.T. Carter, decided many years before, held that even... without specifically saying so, the Court held that even the bad faith motive which it had found would not deprive the employer of the right to file a civil action in court, because the right of an individual to go to court, to seek judicial protection of his claims, was too important to be declared an unfair labor practice. 
    What the Board has done in the 23 years since Clyde Taylor is really reverse itself almost completely. 
    We--

speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1526.545" stopTime="1538.415">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Number two, and they have not shown that it was necessary to protect the jurisdiction of the Labor Board, which is the second leg of the statute. 
    Is that your position?
speaker="lawrence_allen_katz" startTime="1538.415" stopTime="1551.876">
    Mr. Lawrence Allen Katz 
    Let me correct, Mr. Chief Justice, if i may, Congress has provided some circumstances, by statute, in which the board may seek to protect federal interests even when there is a pending state court proceeding.

speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1592.798" stopTime="1617.147">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    And you say it does not interfere with it here, and on the other leg of the statute, it is not an interference which has been expressly authorized by Congress. 
    The statute is expressly authorized by an Act of Congress. 
    This is not such a suit, you say, this interference. 
    This federal injunction has never been expressly authorized by Congress.

    Mr. Lawrence Allen Katz 
    Not where the Board has to try and adjudicate the state court action in order to determine what the underlying motive is for the proceeding. 
    There is no allegation in this case that the state court action on its face interferes with the National Labor Relations Act or interferes with the National Labor Relations Board. 
    We recognize that the Board has some expertise in evaluating an employer's motivation for suit, and some interest in the prevention of retaliatory suits, but we submit that an employer's request for judicial relief stands on a different footing from any other kind of conduct that might be coercive or directly interfering with employee rights.

    Mr. Lawrence Allen Katz 
    In order for the suit to be coercive in such a manner that the National Labor Relations Board can intervene, the suit has to ask for relief which is a violation of the National Labor Relations Act, or the suit has to include some procedure, for example, a specific abuse of process which interferes with the conduct of the National Labor Relations Board or with the National Labor Relations Act.

   Argument of Carolyn F. Corwin
speaker="carolyn_f_corwin" startTime="1755.466" stopTime="1777.771">
    Ms. Carolyn F. Corwin 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, Justice White, the response to that is that the issue before the Board in an unfair labor practice proceeding is whether there has been a violation of the National Labor Relations Act, whether there has, for example, been a coercive interference with protection of rights, employee rights under Section 7.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="1777.771" stopTime="1778.301">

    Yes.

    Ms. Carolyn F. Corwin 
    The issue that the Board considers in a situation like this one, in which the allegation is that the bringing, the filing and prosecution of the civil suit itself is coercive conduct, and is thus an unfair labor practice, is essentially the motivation of the employer--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="1796.418" stopTime="1796.793">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Right.
speaker="carolyn_f_corwin" startTime="1796.793" stopTime="1800.732">
    Ms. Carolyn F. Corwin 
    --to the... there are a number of different sorts of evidence that can be used.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="1800.732" stopTime="1808.710">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    So that if he wouldn't have... so that if he has the unlawful motivation, that's... the unfair labor practice is complete at that point.
speaker="carolyn_f_corwin" startTime="1808.710" stopTime="1830.671">
    Ms. Carolyn F. Corwin 
    The unlawful motivation is the central focus of the inquiry. 
    The Board has recognized that the filing of a civil suit for the purpose of retaliation has an inherently coercive effect, and to that extent effect is part of the calculus, but the Board's essential inquiry in a charge like this is, what is the employer's motivation.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="1830.671" stopTime="1851.008">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Right, and if they find that his motivation is anti-union or whatever it takes to make an unfair labor practice, it could be that the unfair labor practice would be found even if, even if on any objective basis the lawsuit had... wasn't frivolous, or that it had a foundation in fact.
speaker="carolyn_f_corwin" startTime="1851.008" stopTime="1857.317">

    Justice Byron R. White 
    I know, and I would suppose it would consider whether or not the suit had a foundation in fact, but even if they found that it had a foundation in fact, it could be an unfair labor practice.

    Ms. Carolyn F. Corwin 
    --Indeed not, and that is not what the Administrative Law Judge attempts to do in a case like that. 
    The issue before the Board is not the merits of the state court claim. 
    The issue before the Board is the motive of the employer in bringing a suit like this.

    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well, but then we are right back to the hypothetical that Justice White put to you, and it doesn't seem to me... I realize you prefer not to answer the question, and certainly there may be good reasons for it, but if you are now going to again stress motive rather than the merit of the suit, it seems to me you do have to face up to the hypothetical. 
    What if... there is no question that all 100 Administrative Law Judges would have found anti-union animus, and yet any objective lawyer viewing the merits of the state court suit would have said it is grounded in fact and will probably succeed.
speaker="carolyn_f_corwin" startTime="2137.560" stopTime="2153.072">
    Ms. Carolyn F. Corwin 
    Well, I don't want to try to evade the question. 
    The concern is that this is an area in which the Board has attempted to accommodate interests, and I hesitate to commit the Board before it faces a case of the sort that you are describing.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2153.072" stopTime="2160.895">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well, your earlier answer to me was that the 100 Administrative Law Judges don't have to be grounded in state law because all they look at is animus.
speaker="carolyn_f_corwin" startTime="2160.895" stopTime="2212.185">
    Ms. Carolyn F. Corwin 
    No. 
    No, I must go further to explain. 
    They look at a number of different types of evidence, all for the purpose of determining whether or not the suit is motivated for a protected activity or anti-union animus. 
    There are many different sorts of evidence, and one that employers frequently urge and in fact which this employer urged is that the Administrative Law Judge take a look to see whether there is a reasonable basis in fact for the suit. 
    Here, the employer... the petitioner urged at the Administrative Law Judge stage that it had a reasonable basis for the suit, and the general counsel responded with evidence on that point. 
    The finding of the Administrative Law Judge was not addressed to the merits of that claim. 
    It was not the same sort of inquiry as the state court.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2212.185" stopTime="2213.810">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well, but was it addressed to a reasonable basis of the suit?

    Ms. Carolyn F. Corwin 
    It was addressed to the reasonable basis of the suit as one indication of the motive of the employer.

    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well, then, to the judge, to that... to the extent he made that sort of a finding, would have to know something about the law of the state.

    Ms. Carolyn F. Corwin 
    I think that the judge may need to know something about whether a particular statement is true or false. 
    I think perhaps the broad outlines most Administrative Law Judges would be familiar with.

    The broad outlines of what?

    Ms. Carolyn F. Corwin 
    I'm not suggesting that, but I'm suggesting that the inquiry of the Administrative Law Judge is very limited, and to the extent there is an examination of this reasonable basis concept, it is confined to the sorts of questions like, is the statement true or false, is there any indication that there was malice. 
    It is really a very--

    Ms. Carolyn F. Corwin 
    --Well, I think that if one gets into the sort of questions that require further legal analysis or further inquiry into state law, I simply don't think that's the sort of thing the Administrative Law Judge is going to do. 
    It is a very basic inquiry.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="2300.321" stopTime="2313.006">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    But, Ms. Corwin, in his own findings he did conclude that the respondent did not have a reasonable basis for filing his lawsuit. 
    In two or three places, he says something similar to that. 
    So he had to make that inquiry before he made that finding.
speaker="carolyn_f_corwin" startTime="2313.006" stopTime="2326.451">
    Ms. Carolyn F. Corwin 
    Well, I think the inquiry of whether there is a reasonable basis for the lawsuit is not the same inquiry as who is going to prevail under the particular state law, and how the merits--

    Ms. Carolyn F. Corwin 
    --Well, I think in this case, for example, you had the employer state that it had a reasonable basis for the lawsuit because on the face of it simply... it simply stated state law claims, and that was the end of that, and you had the employer saying, I filed the lawsuit because I felt that I was personally attacked for filthy restrooms and unwarranted sexual advances.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="2356.989" stopTime="2360.331">

    Ms. Carolyn F. Corwin 
    No, I don't argue that he didn't look at the merits. 
    I suggest he did not have the task of deciding the merits, and in fact what he did in this case was to see whether the employer had presented any evidence that might support some sort of a reasonable basis for bringing the suit.

    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Well, is it your position that what the Board has to do is to simply find whether the employer had reasonable grounds for believing that the alleged facts he is relying on occurred? 
    Or what?

    Ms. Carolyn F. Corwin 
    Well, I think that is one possibility. 
    I think it depends on what the employer suggests. 
    The employer could come forward and say, I thought such and such was true because people informed me of X or Y.

    Ms. Carolyn F. Corwin 
    Well, again, I would have to reiterate that the Board is concerned with what the employer's motive is. 
    The Board inquiry in an unfair labor practice proceeding is what sort of intent did an employer have, what sort of effect does the conduct have. 
    Is this--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="2450.386" stopTime="2462.786">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Well, is the determination of whether the lawsuit has a reasonable basis in fact just a means of assessing whether it was filed for a retaliatory purpose?

    Ms. Carolyn F. Corwin

    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, it now sounds like you have answered the question you were very reluctant to answer a while ago, if you answered yes to Justice O'Connor's question, that it is only relevant to determination of motive, and it is not an independent factor required to... for the finding of an unfair labor practice.
speaker="carolyn_f_corwin" startTime="2495.445" stopTime="2497.289">

    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, so you have answered the question. 
    Yes, and you really answered it yes, it seems to me. 
    If the basic inquiry is motive, bad motive, and lack of merit of the suit is simply an element that goes to make up bad motive, now, am I faithfully following you?
speaker="carolyn_f_corwin" startTime="2522.156" stopTime="2522.968">

    Ms. Carolyn F. Corwin 
    --It is certainly relevant to determining motive, but my concern is that I don't know how the Board would weigh the evidence in a suit such as the one that you suggest. 
    I think it is certainly correct to say that the reasonable basis inquiry goes to motive. 
    It is simply that I don't know whether there would ever be a case in which that was the only evidence of intent. 
    I think it is far more likely that you are going to have what you have in this situation, in which you have evidence of the employer making statements ahead of time, a week ahead of time, that petitioner would get even with these employees, and particularly with Mrs. Helton, one of the waitresses who had filed a charge with the Board.

    Ms. Carolyn F. Corwin 
    We have not questioned that.

speaker="lewis_f_powell_jr" startTime="2606.808" stopTime="2619.192">
    Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. 
    And the end result of the Board's decision that was enforced by the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit is to enjoin the prosecution of that suit, is it not?
speaker="carolyn_f_corwin" startTime="2619.192" stopTime="2624.410">
    Ms. Carolyn F. Corwin 
    That is correct. 
    At least to enforce the Court's cease and desist order requiring dismissal of that suit.
speaker="lewis_f_powell_jr" startTime="2624.410" stopTime="2640.842">
    Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. 
    Yes. 
    So the effect of all of it is that the libel suit cannot go forward in the state court, so that the Labor Board where a federal court enforces its order may enjoin a libel suit bona fide on its face?
speaker="carolyn_f_corwin" startTime="2640.842" stopTime="2672.985">
    Ms. Carolyn F. Corwin 
    That is the result only after the Board has found that the filing and prosecution of the suit is an unfair labor practice because it was for the purpose of harassing the employees for the exercise of their protected rights. 
    Only after finding a violation of the federal statute, the federal labor laws, does the Board then identify an unfair labor practice and provide a remedy for that. 
    In this case, the remedy is dismissal of the civil suit and reimbursement of legal expenses.

    Ms. Carolyn F. Corwin 
    Yes, that's correct. 
    The state suit was prosecuted through several stages. 
    On the day that the complaint was filed, the temporary restraining order was issued.
speaker="lewis_f_powell_jr" startTime="2716.388" stopTime="2718.310">
    Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. 
    Yes, and some depositions were taken.

speaker="carolyn_f_corwin" startTime="2723.543" stopTime="2745.404">
    Ms. Carolyn F. Corwin 
    It did not go to trial. 
    There was a preliminary injunction stage at which the court denied a preliminary injunction to the employer and vacated the temporary restraining order. 
    There were cross-motions for summary judgment, and that occurred after the Administrative Law Judge hearing but before the final decision came out from the Administrative Law Judge.
speaker="lewis_f_powell_jr" startTime="2745.404" stopTime="2760.241">
    Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. 
    Suppose it had gone to trial and a verdict and judgment entered on it for the plaintiff before the Labor Board acted. 
    Would it have been obligated to respect that, or what would have happened then?
speaker="carolyn_f_corwin" startTime="2760.241" stopTime="2829.403">
    Ms. Carolyn F. Corwin 
    Well, I think the Board's reaction to that development, had it occurred, which it did not in this case, but had it occurred, I think would depend on the circumstances in which that judgment were entered. 
    If it were, for example, a default judgment because the waitresses here couldn't afford to hire a lawyer and to pursue the suit to that extent, I don't think the Board would feel constrained by any default judgment, for example. 
    If it were a judgment on the merits, I think again it would depend on what the Board could identify in the decision as relevant to its inquiry into motive. 
    I think obviously the Board would think twice about what a state court had found on the merits, but again, it's conceivable that a trial court would err in the state and that the employee wouldn't have the money to pursue an appeal. 
    The waitresses in this case may not be able to pursue this sort of litigation through to the state Supreme Court, and again the Board might consider a situation like that.

    Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. 
    Just on the libel issue.

    Ms. Carolyn F. Corwin 
    --Well, in this case, there were two causes of action. 
    One was a business interference claim which was dismissed by the state court. 
    The libel action is still alive. 
    But again, I suggest it would really depend on the circumstances. 
    I think the Board might well take something like that into account if it were convinced that the waitresses had been able to be represented by good legal counsel that pursued their claims and that in fact the determination was an appropriate one in light of the procedural circumstances here.

    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Ms. Corwin, would you agree that your theory as you have given it to us in response to Justice White's questions is quite different from the theory of the Court of Appeals, which did rely squarely on the absence of any reasonable basis in fact, and on that finding?

    Ms. Carolyn F. Corwin

    Why shouldn't the... in this case, the employer be permitted to come back and say, I had a reasonable basis for the lawsuit and I would have filed it anyway--

    --even if I had an anti-union bias.
speaker="carolyn_f_corwin" startTime="3112.163" stopTime="3115.630">
    Ms. Carolyn F. Corwin 
    --In fact, I think that's what the employer tried to do in this case.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3115.630" stopTime="3126.514">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    I know. 
    He may have. 
    But on your position, he wouldn't... it would be irrelevant. 
    The Board would say to him, don't waste our time. 
    Once the motivation is proved, the case is over.
speaker="carolyn_f_corwin" startTime="3126.514" stopTime="3176.213">
    Ms. Carolyn F. Corwin 
    Indeed not. 
    I think the Board considers carefully the employer's reasonable basis argument that the Board considers that this can be something that might tend to countervail other evidence of motive. 
    I think that the analogy perhaps to the issue you are raising in the transportation management, the Wright-Line test, is that this might be analogized to a pretext case in which only one motive was found. 
    It is not a dual motive case here. 
    The Administrative Law Judge found that the reason for filing the suit was to retaliate against Mrs. Helton for filing her charge, her initial charge, and to harass the employees for having engaged in their protected activity, and it concluded that there was no other motive.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3176.213" stopTime="3197.348">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, if it were found that the lawsuit was well grounded in fact, and in state law, it would be difficult to say, wouldn't it, that part of the motive of filing the lawsuit was to vindicate the employer's reputation?
speaker="carolyn_f_corwin" startTime="3197.348" stopTime="3202.203">
    Ms. Carolyn F. Corwin 
    Well, that is part of my reluctance in responding to your hypothetical, because I think the--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3202.203" stopTime="3204.157">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, you have responded well enough.
speaker="carolyn_f_corwin" startTime="3204.157" stopTime="3237.299">
    Ms. Carolyn F. Corwin 
    --In a case like that, I think the general counsel might hesitate, and think that the evidence was close, and that the motivation was not as clear as it was in a case such as this one. 
    In this sort of case, I think petitioner's view takes you to the conclusion that a particular sort of coercive conduct that may be analogous to other sorts of coercive conduct that employers use, that that... the particular form of conduct that this employer chose somehow ought to be immunized from the coverage of the federal labor laws.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="3237.299" stopTime="3254.231">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Ms. Corwin, is there anything in the legislative history of the National Labor Relations Act that would indicate Congress thought about the possibility that an employer or union prosecution of a state court suit could constitute an unfair labor practice?
speaker="carolyn_f_corwin" startTime="3254.231" stopTime="3299.305">
    Ms. Carolyn F. Corwin 
    I am not aware of anything in the legislative history. 
    I think one can look to the plain terms of the statute and in a case such as the retaliatory suit we have here, one can say, it fits fairly clearly within the language of the statute, in that it's intended to interfere with the exercise of protected rights, it's intended to discriminate against the employee for the invocation of the processes of the Board, so I think our starting point is, it comes within the language of the statute. 
    Now, this Court has on several occasions indicated that the Board has considerable discretion to identify unfair labor practices. 
    They are not enumerated in the Act.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="3299.305" stopTime="3304.039">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Well, my question was whether there was anything in the legislative history, and I thought perhaps you--
speaker="carolyn_f_corwin" startTime="3304.039" stopTime="3314.065">
    Ms. Carolyn F. Corwin 
    Yes, and the answer to that is no. 
    I think here we can look to the plain language of the statute, and this kind of conduct falls pretty clearly within it.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="3314.065" stopTime="3324.733">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    --When was the first time after 1935 that the Board entered an order such as this requiring the cessation of a state court lawsuit?
speaker="carolyn_f_corwin" startTime="3324.733" stopTime="3339.353">
    Ms. Carolyn F. Corwin 
    Well, I think Mr. Katz referred to the Carter suit, which was quite early on. 
    I don't have the date. 
    It must be around 1950 or so. 
    There have been a series of suits involving various factual situations, and--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="3339.353" stopTime="3347.238">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    I am more interested in the chronology of it. 
    So, for the first 15 years after the enactment of the Wagner Act, there were no such orders entered by the Board?
speaker="carolyn_f_corwin" startTime="3347.238" stopTime="3413.089">
    Ms. Carolyn F. Corwin 
    --I am simply unaware of any. 
    I suspect that there were not, but I really don't know. 
    The rule that the Board follows and has followed since 1960 is the one referred to as the Clyde Taylor rule, and that is that the general practice of the Board is to not find an unfair labor practice in the case of good faith litigation. 
    That is the general rule, and that continues to be applied today. 
    However, the Board has recognized that in a case like this, when you have employees who are just faced with the devastating effect of a retaliatory suit, a suit for half a million dollars in punitive damages, that that can provide such a coercive effect that at least in the case where you have clear proof of retaliation, that the suit was brought for the purpose of harassment, that here you have an unfair labor practice, here you have to step apart from the general rule of Clyde Taylor and conclude that this sort of retaliatory suit is an unfair labor practice. 
    I think--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="3413.089" stopTime="3422.304">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Is there any way to accommodate the parallel interests here short of ordering a cease and desist of the state suit?
speaker="carolyn_f_corwin" startTime="3422.304" stopTime="3424.004">
    Ms. Carolyn F. Corwin 
    --Well--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="3424.004" stopTime="3428.769">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Is there any middle ground or other means of accommodating these interests?
speaker="carolyn_f_corwin" startTime="3428.769" stopTime="3472.920">
    Ms. Carolyn F. Corwin 
    --Well, to some extent, they have been accommodated already in the general rule that good faith litigation will not be the basis for an unfair labor practice. 
    In the narrow class of cases we are talking about here, where the Board has found that the suit is brought for the purpose of harassment, it doesn't seem to me that you can vindicate the federal right, that you can protect the employee rights that the Act guarantees and that you can deter the sort of coercive employer conduct you have here without issuing a cease and desist order as you would against any unfair labor practice, telling the employer to stop. 
    And I think that there simply isn't another remedy that is going to be very effective.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="3472.920" stopTime="3483.277">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    You don't think payment of fees and expenses and letting the state court determine the merits of the action would be an accommodation?
speaker="carolyn_f_corwin" startTime="3483.277" stopTime="3529.852">
    Ms. Carolyn F. Corwin 
    Well, I think reimbursement of legal expenses may get you part of the way there, but it doesn't do anything to solve the question of the employees, these waitresses, who are forced to engage legal counsel, to pay out a lot of expenses on things like depositions and trials and so on. 
    That is the sort of coercive conduct the Act was designed to deter and to prevent, and to provide a remedy for. 
    It doesn't seem to me that one can provide that sort of remedy by simply saying, all right, we will let this unfair labor practice proceed. 
    That is simply not the sort of remedy that Congress intended in the case of coercive conduct of a particularly devastating type like the suit you have here.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="3529.852" stopTime="3536.972">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Of course, I wonder if the suit can really be characterized as that devastating if it is frivolous on its face.
speaker="carolyn_f_corwin" startTime="3536.972" stopTime="3565.369">
    Ms. Carolyn F. Corwin 
    Well, I think that the... what occurred in this case is an example of what can happen. 
    Even with a suit like that, the employees were notified on Monday morning that a temporary restraining order hearing would be held at noon. 
    They attended that. 
    They had an order entered against them. 
    They were served with a complaint for half a million dollars. 
    And the employer sought to take their depositions beginning the following Wednesday, two days later. 
    I think you have to do a lot of sorting out--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="3565.369" stopTime="3576.377">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    But the bottom line is that once they've got their side presented to the state court judge, he found no significant merit to the complaint, and the risks, it seems to me, were minimal after that point.
speaker="carolyn_f_corwin" startTime="3576.377" stopTime="3577.660">
    Ms. Carolyn F. Corwin 
    --Well, I... that's--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="3577.660" stopTime="3584.234">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    True, they had damned them, and the complaint is for a lot of money, but you know, there are a lot of complaints like that that don't have any merit to them.
speaker="carolyn_f_corwin" startTime="3584.234" stopTime="3589.889">
    Ms. Carolyn F. Corwin 
    --Well, I think that is true for part of the litigation here. 
    The libel claim is still pending. 
    The state court--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="3589.889" stopTime="3595.465">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    But there is no basis in fact for it. 
    We have such a finding that everybody agrees is true.

    --Well, I--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="3597.373" stopTime="3602.197">

    Ms. Carolyn F. Corwin
