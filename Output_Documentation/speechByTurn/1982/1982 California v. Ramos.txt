California v. Ramos
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="0.000" stopTime="9.371">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Mr. Mayfield, I think you may proceed whenever you are ready. 
    And, we are hearing California against Ramos.
speaker="harley_d_mayfield" startTime="9.371" stopTime="367.101">
    Mr. Harley D. Mayfield 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    The Respondent was sentenced to death for first-degree murder during the commission of a robbery. 
    He robbed the on-duty employees at a fast food restaurant where he worked, after which he shot both of them in the head, and one of them lived. 
    He was convicted of two counts of robbery, attempted murder, and murder of the first degree, along with a special allegation that the murder was committed during the commission of a robbery. 
    Under the California Penal Code, murder of the first degree is punishable by 25 years to life, unless certain special circumstances are alleged and found true beyond a reasonable doubt. 
    In which case, the alternative penalties are death or life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. 
    The penalty is determined at a separate hearing in which the trier of fact is a jury unless waived by both parties. 
    At that separate hearing both parties may present additional evidence, and the statute provides for certain specified aggravating and mitigating factors which the jury must consider in addition to an additional catch-all factor permitting the jury to consider any factor in litigation. 
    If the aggravating circumstances outweigh mitigating circumstances, the jury is required to return a verdict of death. 
    If mitigating circumstances outweigh aggravating circumstances, the jury is required to return a verdict of life imprisonment without possibility of parole. 
    The trial judge may modify a verdict of death to one of life without the possibility of parole; although if the jury returns the lesser punishment, it cannot be increased. 
    The statute also requires that the trier of fact be instructed that the punishment of life imprisonment without possibility of parole may in the future be modified by the governor to include a lesser sentence which permits the possibility of parole. 
    In this case, defense counsel objected to that instruction being given on the ground that it violated his right to due process of law, and the trial judge overruled the objection on the ground it was required by statute. 
    On automatic appeal to the California Supreme Court, the Court expressly and exclusively reversed the death penalty on the ground that the portion of the statute which required the giving of that instruction violated the defendant's right to due process under the 5th, 8th, and 14th Amendments for two reasons. 
    One, that it introduced an extraneous factor into the jury's deliberations. 
    And, second, that it was misleading because it did not require an instruction, because the instruction did not inform the jury that the governor could also commute a sentence of death to a lesser sentence. 
    The issue presented on Certiorari to this Court is whether enforcement of that statutory provision requiring instruction violates the 5th, 8th, and 14th Amendments. 
    This Court's cases indicate that due process is violated whenever a defendant is deprived of some guaranteed right, or if a procedure is fundamentally unfair. 
    In the capital cases which sort of blend the 5th, the 14th, and 8th Amendment principles, cases have held that a procedure which increases the likelihood of an arbitrary, a capricious, or unreliable sentencing determination may violate due process. 
    There is a basic distinction this Court has drawn between capital cases and others on the ground that the death sentence is unique in its finality. 
    A subsidiary question under the question presented on Certiorari, since this is a state statutory procedure, is the question whether the statute clearly and unmistakably violates the defendant's due process rights. 
    In California's alternative sentences, the sentence of death, the meaning is quite clear. 
    If that sentence is carried out, the defendant will be put to death. 
    On the other hand, the sentence... the alternative sentence of life without possibility of parole is not literally accurate because it does not mean that if that sentence is imposed the defendant must inevitably be perpetually imprisoned... imprisoned until death.

    It is, Your Honor, in the sense that it does not literally mean what it says. 
    In California law, a sentence of life imprisonment permits a consideration for parole after seven years.

    --The governor can set his own criteria. 
    Although, for individuals sentenced to life without parole, there are provisions within the Department of Corrections... regulations for them to consider and make recommendations. 
    There is also a vast difference in that there is relatively a small window for the governor to commute death sentence, during this period after all the appeals have expired and a period when the sentence is to be carried. 
    On the other hand, every individual who is in prison under a sentence of life imprisonment without parole, always retains the possibility that he may be commuted and not spend the rest of his life in prison.

    That is simply a statement of fact, isn't it, that the governor could commute a death sentence.

    Mr. Harley D. Mayfield 
    Yes, Your Honor, I believe so.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="724.271" stopTime="734.610">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    So, you get the same result if the instruction said, the governor may commute any sentence, including a sentence of death?
speaker="harley_d_mayfield" startTime="734.610" stopTime="738.358">
    Mr. Harley D. Mayfield 
    I believe so, yes.

    Justice Byron R. White 
    That is essentially what the instruction says, doesn't it?
speaker="harley_d_mayfield" startTime="741.201" stopTime="744.419">
    Mr. Harley D. Mayfield 
    The first part of the instruction does not differentiate.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="744.419" stopTime="748.215">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    The governor can commute anything, including a death sentence?
speaker="harley_d_mayfield" startTime="748.215" stopTime="1015.012">
    Mr. Harley D. Mayfield 
    Yes. 
    It does, in fact, say that. 
    But, it does not specifically refer to the death sentence whereas the second part of the instruction does. 
    From the standpoint of the alternatives offered, I believe it is reasonable to consider that the determination by a sentencer will in some way be affected by the sentencer's perception of the alternatives that he is choosing between. 
    For example, in Beck v. Alabama where the jury could only return a verdict of guilty of a capital offense, even though there was evidence from which a lesser offense could be returned, this Court found that that would skew the determination. 
    I believe that the determination of the jury's verdict could be skewed also if the jury believed that the difference between the alternative punishments is minimal. 
    For instance, it would be impermissible under the California statute for a juror who was convinced that aggravating circumstances outweighed mitigating circumstances to impose a sentence of life imprisonment without possible parole because he believed that was a more severe sentence. 
    Probably, not too many people may think that, but I suggest there are some. 
    Similarly, it would be impermissible under the California statute for a juror who was convinced that mitigating circumstances outweighed aggravated circumstances to impose the punishment of death, because he thought he was doing the defendant a favor. 
    In this case, the defendant himself, at least, told at least his psychiatrist that he would rather have the death penalty than life without parole. 
    There is a probability that a large percentage... a substantial percentage... of jurors will be aware of California law, and will, in any event, realize that there is a power of commutation of sentences of life without parole... that there is a possibility of parole. 
    But, I think it is reasonable for California to decide that it is preferable if every juror in every case is aware of that by manner of a simple instruction which tells them this fact. 
    When we speak of the liability of sentencing determinations, I think that consistency is of some significance. 
    As to the other part of the California Supreme Court's decision that the instruction is misleading, I believe it is significant that trial counsel below did not make that argument. 
    And, I suggest the reason possibly is set forth in the California Supreme Court's decision in People v. Morse, back in 60 Cal 2d, where they said since people probably know something about parole, you should tell the jury that there is a possibility of parole, but tell them that is not supposed to be what they base their decision on. 
    They should not take that into consideration. 
    On the other hand, you should not tell a jury about the power of a trial judge, or the California Supreme Court, or the governor to commute a sentence of death--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1015.012" stopTime="1021.400">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Was that earlier decision you were referring to, Mr. Mayfield, based on federal constitutional grounds?
speaker="harley_d_mayfield" startTime="1021.400" stopTime="1032.036">
    Mr. Harley D. Mayfield 
    --No, that was based on the view of what it was a good idea to tell--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1032.036" stopTime="1036.613">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    What the highest court of any state might do in reviewing jury instructions given in that state?
speaker="harley_d_mayfield" startTime="1036.613" stopTime="1089.185">
    Mr. Harley D. Mayfield 
    --Yes, but this was not based on federal constitutional grounds because the rationale for that was they said that if you tell a jury that someone else might change their death penalty decision, that may lessen their sense of responsibility for this awesome thing they are going to do in imposing the death penalty. 
    And, I suggest that very rarely would a trial counsel want to have that instruction given. 
    The only conceivable reason if he thought that aggravating circumstances were so overwhelming that he wanted to convince the jury it made no difference.

    I suggest that if California had chosen to eliminate the sentence of life imprisonment without possibility of parole, and tell the jury to select between 25 years to life and death, that the jury would know that the defendant at some time could be released from prison. 
    And, it would not in that case be necessary to inform the jury that the death penalty could be commuted, and I believe that California's decision that it may make for a more reliable and consistent decisions to inform the jury of the... accurately of the meaning of this sentence does not violate any guaranteed right of the defendant or does not make the decision fundamentally unfair to him or otherwise arbitrary and capricious.

    --Yes, Your Honor, I do because I do not frankly read it the same way you do. 
    The way I read it, it says you are instructed that under the state constitution a governor is empowered to grant a reprieve, pardon, or commutation of a sentence following conviction of a crime. 
    It does not say any sentence. 
    It does not say all sentences.

    Mr. Ezra Hendon 
    I think if you examine the reasoning behind the state court decisions, they go off on grounds which are ultimately federal constitutional grounds, though they may have preceded Furman so that they are not couched in constitutional terms, but the logic and the reasoning is that the issue of commutation, even when the issue of commutation is put before the jury... even when a jury is told that governor can commute both life without parole sentence and the death sentence, which this instruction does not do... but when the issue is put before the jury even-handedly, that injects a level of speculation into the jury's sentencing phase which renders any decision it may return unreliable and which diverts it from its primary task, which is after all what? 
    It is to decide whether this individual, in light of this crime, should die.

    Mr. Ezra Hendon 
    --I can think of three off-hand. 
    The most recent Illinois case. 
    I believe Poole v. Maryland is federal constitutional. 
    I think the Louisiana case, Lindsey, is. 
    There are two reasons why this provision, I think... this particular provision... cannot pass constitutional muster. 
    First, it affirmatively misleads a jury in the penalty phase of a capital case as to the nature of its function and the consequences of its decision. 
    And, secondly, as I have alluded to, it injects a level of speculation and uncertainty into the penalty decision, which cannot be tolerated in the capital case and which deflects the jury from its true task. 
    What does this statute do? 
    It tells a jury, in effect, you have two choices here. 
    You can sentence to life without parole, or you can sentence to death. 
    But you should bear in mind that life without parole does not mean life without parole, that the governor can commute life without parole. 
    And, I may say in passing in response to the question that Justice Rehnquist asked that the term life without parole is no more a term of art in the state of California than is the term death.

    Mr. Ezra Hendon 
    Yes, I think that the purpose of this initiative was to overrule the case of People v. Morse, which told the jury... What the case of People v. Morse did was to tell the jury, look, you may speculate about issues such as parole or commutation, and I, the judge, will tell you about parole and commutation so that you will know what the truth is, and so that you will not speculate. 
    But, Morse goes on and says, it would be a violation of your oaths as jurors if you were to consider this factor in rendering your decision. 
    Your decision is to be based upon the facts of the case and the circumstances of the crime and on nothing else.

    Mr. Ezra Hendon 
    Because in that event, which is a question that the Court need not reach in this case, but in that event the issue of commutation would still be before the jury. 
    The jury could still take into account the fact that a governor could commute a death sentence, for example. 
    And to the extent that it took that into account it would be taking into account the utterly unknowable. 
    What a California governor, perhaps a governor who has not even been elected yet, may do some day in the future is obviously something that no sitting juror can know about.

speaker="ezra_hendon" startTime="2078.148" stopTime="2289.578">
    Mr. Ezra Hendon 
    No, I would have a much more difficult argument. 
    I would have the argument, you know, the skunk in the jury box argument. 
    You put a skunk in the jury box and then tell the jury not to smell it. 
    Can you really... is this the kind of information that a jury really could be asked to disregard. 
    It is an issue that is not presented in this case. 
    It is not one that the Court needs to reach, and I would suggest that the Court not reach it. 
    I think we need to talk a little bit about what a jury is being asked to consider when it is being asked to consider commutation. 
    It is being asked to consider what is perhaps the most wide-ranging, open-ended untrammeled power that an executive can have. 
    This Court's opinions over and over and over again, and California opinions over and over and over again, have made clear that the power of the governor to commute is virtually unlimited. 
    He can do so for any reason he sees fit at almost any time that he sees fit. 
    And, in point of fact, as the chart which Justice Stevens alluded to makes clear, California governors have exercised that power as they saw fit, in terms of their political view, their political perspective of what is an appropriate case to commute taking into consideration all of the political, essentially nonjudicial factors that go into a decision to pardon or to commute. 
    And, to ask a jury to somehow factor that in to the penalty phase of the capital case is to ask it to do the impossible... is to ask it to consider information which is the essence of speculation, the essence of uncertainty. 
    I suggest it is not possible. 
    It is essentially unreliable. 
    It also, I suggest, deflects the jury from the task that it is set forth to do. 
    Whether a governor is going to commute a sentence has absolutely nothing to do with Marcelino Ramos as far as the jury is concerned. 
    A) they will never know whether the governor is going to commute him; and B) if he does, he can do so, as I said, for any reason he sees fit. 
    There have been governors in this country who have commuted all death sentences. 
    I believe Winthrop Rockefeller before he left office in Arkansas, commuted all death sentences... cleaned out death row. 
    This was a political decision that he made. 
    It had nothing to do with who was on there. 
    It was within his power to do so. 
    President Andrew Johnson has commuted all sentences of all secessionists. 
    This was a political decision, which he was free to make for what reasons he makes. 
    And, I suggest, respectfully to the Court that when we come to the point when juries in the most serious case, which the criminal law at least knows, are making their decisions not on the basis of what they may think is appropriate in terms of this individual and this crime, his background, what he did and why he did it. 
    Not on that basis, but on the basis of what some future governor may do in the exercise of a power which he exercises pursuant to considerations which are wholly alien to judicial considerations.

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Do you really think you can generalize that way about what motivates governors to exercise the commutation power?

    But, given these various imponderables such as jurors knowing it from civics class or perhaps having voted for or against this particular initiative, wouldn't it be fair to say that the state ought to be entitled to the very wide latitude in making decisions as to what kind of facts go before the jury and what do not... that it is not simply only one particular set of instructions which pass constitutional muster?

    Mr. Ezra Hendon 
    No, I agree with that, and I do not contend otherwise. 
    if this were a case in which the instructions said to the jurors, here is the governor's power to commute life without parole sentences. 
    Here is the governor's power to commute death sentences. 
    You are instructed not to consider these factors. 
    They are not relevant for you in coming to the task which the constitution and the law imposes upon you.

    Because there is no way that a jury can factor that in to its decision in a way which satisfies the repeated injunction of this Court's cases since Furman, that the state must take extraordinary measures... I believe was Justice O'Connor's language in Eddings... must go to extraordinary measures in order to ensure that death sentences are not returned on the basis of arbitrariness, caprice, or mistake.

    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    It seems to me you are putting the state courts at power to instruct in these cases in a very narrow bind under the federal constitution, given the fact that courts are constantly wondering, will the jurors probably already know this, should I instruct on it, should I not? 
    Not just in this area but lots of others. 
    And, until now I do not think it has been thought the federal constitution had a preference one way or the other, so long as the state court was reasonably fair about the thing.
speaker="ezra_hendon" startTime="2835.484" stopTime="2967.744">
    Mr. Ezra Hendon 
    No, I think the federal constitution makes very clear the nature and quality of the information that can go before a sentencer in a capital case. 
    I think in Gardner v. Florida this Court ruled that potentially unreliable information by a judge, in that case... potentially unreliable information put before a judge under a statute which this Court had otherwise previously upheld as constitutional in Proffitt v. Florida required a remand for a new sentencing hearing. 
    This Court has gone to great lengths to ensure that a part of the capital sentencing decision is not arbitrary, unknowable, speculative information. 
    Many, many things happen after the jury returns a verdict of death. 
    There is review by the state's highest court. 
    Should a jury be told about that? 
    They may speculate about that? 
    There is escape. 
    People die in prison. 
    People are killed in prison. 
    Many, many things can happen. 
    It strikes me that the system only works... and the Constitution requires for the system to work... that jurors do their duty. 
    Their duty is to do what they think is right based on the facts of the case, and to assume that other duly constituted authority will do its job. 
    The governor will do his job. 
    The jury does its job. 
    The Supreme Court does its job. 
    It works that way. 
    It does not work if you have got juries basing decisions on what the governor is going to do. 
    Before leaving, I do not want us to lose sight of the fact that there is a specific... that there are two specific issues in this case. 
    One involves this particular instruction. 
    I have been arguing all this time on the assumption that the entire issue of commutation should not be before the jury whether we are talking about death commutation or life without parole commutation. 
    We are faced with this particular statute, and I ask the Court to bear that in mind. 
    This is a statute which involves partial disclosure, neither more nor less. 
    The jury is told that life without parole does not mean life without parole period. 
    They are not told that death does not mean death, even though death clearly does not mean death.

    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Well, ordinarily you cannot complain about the failure to give an instruction which you did not request. 
    If you say this would have been a fine instruction if they just added to it this little part that I have now dreamed up. 
    But if you did not ask the trial court for that you cannot complain about it.
speaker="ezra_hendon" startTime="3001.433" stopTime="3159.026">
    Mr. Ezra Hendon 
    --Well, I think, if I take the thrust of your question correctly, what you are really talking about is a procedural default, in essence object at trial. 
    The California Supreme Court has reached the issue on the merits in this case. 
    There is no issue. 
    Whatever shortcoming of state law and state procedure there may have been in failing to tender this instruction to the jury has been forgiven by the California Supreme Court. 
    That is no obstacle to this Court's going on and reaching it. 
    I ask the Court to bear in mind that the California Supreme Court has stated flat out that if this were... if we were dealing with a provision here which were an installment... a provision of an installment sales contract for the purchase of an automobile, and it were before a municipal court somewhere in the state of California, that that court would be required to strike it down. 
    This is the equivalent of telling somebody I have two automobiles to sell. 
    I want you to know that one of them has a cracked engine block, not disclosing that the other one also has a cracked engine block. 
    There is nothing more nor less than this. 
    And, I suggest, that if it is not good enough for a municipal court in the state of California then it ought not be good enough in a death case before the highest court in the land. 
    The other thing that I guess needs to be mentioned... although I do not think more can be done about it than mention it... is that there is a procedural problem in this case. 
    I think there is a serious question about the security of the court's jurisdiction in this case. 
    There is a ruling on the merits of a state law issue in this case contained at footnote 22 of the Court's Opinion. 
    It is the last issue briefed in our brief on the merits in which the California Supreme Court has ruled flatly that there was an error of state law in this case under California Evidence Code, Section 352, in the admission of certain highly prejudicial error, basically statements of the defendant that he might seek revenge on the jurors. 
    But the California Supreme Court has ruled under California evidence law... there is no federal constitutional question there... that this was erroneously admitted. 
    It should not be repeated at retrial. 
    They did not go on and reach the question of whether that error standing by itself and without regard to the federal constitutional question would require a reversal. 
    I suggest it is a very serious error--

    Mr. Ezra Hendon 
    --It went to the penalty phase... strictly to penalty, yes. 
    The California Supreme Court purported to predicate its decision on the federal constitution, and, therefore, it did not address the question of whether this error standing by itself should mandate reversal of the penalty phase. 
    In a situation like that I suggested in the brief that this Court cannot feel secure that the Petitioner has met his burden of demonstrating not only that the court predicated its decision... that the California Supreme Court predicated its decision on a federal constitutional ground, but that that ground was necessary to--

speaker="ezra_hendon" startTime="3209.053" stopTime="3235.325">
    Mr. Ezra Hendon 
    --Well, the two options that this Court's cases have followed in that situation is either to dismiss the Writ as having been improvidently granted, or to vacate the opinion of the California Supreme Court and remand for a determination of whether the violation of California evidence law, standing by itself would... and apart from any consideration, federal constitutional considerations... would require reversal of the penalty.

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Do you have anything further, Mr. Mayfield?
speaker="harley_d_mayfield" startTime="3238.884" stopTime="3426.606">
    Mr. Harley D. Mayfield 
    Yes, Your Honor. 
    In regard to the jurisdictional question of the issue that the California Supreme Court found prejudicial evidence, it was bound up in the constitutional issue they were addressing. 
    Prejudicial evidence they found admitted included the defendant's psychiatrist's testimony that the defendant himself knew about the possibility of parole and was considering whether he might want to take revenge if he were paroled. 
    In regard to amplifying instructions, the California Supreme Court did not find and the statute does not provide that a defendant, if he chose to do so, could not request additional amplifying instructions whether they related to a disclaimer telling the jury not to consider the other instruction or an additional instruction about commutation of the death penalty. 
    The citation to Gardner v. Florida, that case is sort of the obverse of this case. 
    That involved the instance where the sentencer, the judge, had some information that the defendant and his counsel did not have, and may have based his decision on that. 
    Well, that was unfair. 
    In this case, the information that the jury was given is information which the defendant knows, his counsel knows, and we are asked to find that is unfair for the jury to know. 
    In regard to a necessity for some prophylactic measure to offset this instruction to the jury informing them that there is, in fact, a possibility of parole, I suggest that we have it in the declarements of the statute itself, which sets forth specific factors for the jury to consider and permits them to return a death penalty only if they find aggravating factors outweigh mitigating factors. 
    And, I suggest that this instruction is not about commutation anyway. 
    What it is a bout is about the indisputable fact that this sentence, which is described as life imprisonment without the possibility of parole, if which by its description has parole in it, that this sentence is, in fact, not a sentence that has no possibility of parole. 
    That is what the subject of the instruction is.

    May I go back to the jurisdictional point for a moment? 
    The testimony that was erroneously admitted, as I remember, was the psychiatrist's testimony that this defendant had said that if his sentence is commuted, he might seek revenge against the prosecutor, the judge, and the jury? 
    Was that what he said, something like that?

    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Well, but I am not quite clear on what your response is. 
    The jurisdictional argument that your opponent makes is that well, this is clearly an error of state law. 
    The California Supreme Court has told us that. 
    And, it is rather obviously a fairly significant error because it suggests to the jury that they ought to sentence the man to death in order to protect themselves, and, therefore, the judgment would have been reversed on state law grounds even if they are wrong about the federal constitution. 
    And, if that is true, then we do not have jurisdiction. 
    Now, what is your response to the argument?
speaker="harley_d_mayfield" startTime="3565.612" stopTime="3582.886">
    Mr. Harley D. Mayfield 
    --My response to that is that the error they found on state law grounds was error because of the conclusion that the instruction regarding the possibility of parole was erroneous on federal constitutional grounds.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="3582.886" stopTime="3589.228">
