Dirks v. SEC

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    We will hear arguments first this afternoon in Dirks against the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
    Mr. Bonderman, you may proceed whenever you are ready.
speaker="david_bonderman" startTime="11.602" stopTime="214.551">
    Mr. David Bonderman 
    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    Ten years ago today, in fact virtually at this hour, Petitioner Dirks was in the office of Stanley Goldblum, Chairman of the Board, President, and Chief Executive Officer of then high flying Equity Funding Corporation of America. 
    Justice White, it was at 10:00 in the morning, California time. 
    [Laughter] 
    Mr. Dirks was there to confront Mr. Goldblum with uncorroborated allegations of a former officer... a fired former officer of a subsidiary to the effect in relevant part that the major foundations of the company, its life insurance subsidiary, were a fraud and that the company was carrying on its books substantial amounts of "phony policies" which were being sold to reinsurers as though they were real in a Ponzi scheme. 
    Mr. Goldblum, of course, denied all, arranged for a meeting which lasted much of the day with all of the other major officers of the company in an endeavor to persuade Mr. Dirks that these allegations were entirely spurious and were being circulated by a disgruntled former fired employee who, although Mr. Dirks hadn't mentioned his name, Mr. Goldblum knew who it was. 
    Secrist had come to Dirks ten days earlier with these and other allegations, some of which ultimately proved to be true, some of which proved to be false. 
    He had come to Dirks because Dirks had a reputation as an analyst who was willing to investigate beyond just looking at reports, the bottom line financial analysis, because as the Court of Appeal below found the Securities and Exchange Commission had a history of failing to act promptly in dealing with what has come to be known as the Equity Funding Scandal, the SEC having been informed by one of its own former attorneys a year and a half earlier and having taken essentially no action, a quick investigation which was closed. 
    The SEC again being informed within two days of Mr. Dirks, but again concluding that there was nothing there and not taking any action at that time. 
    Secrist had the idea that in view of the performance by the regulators and in view of the notion within the company that the company had connections through its associate general counsel to the SEC, which made it clear that the SEC would never act, and through its vice president of the Illinois Insurance Commission, which also assured that the Insurance Commission which had regulatory authority would never act, the only way to public's eyes what Secrist believed, though, as he admitted he had no proof, was a major, perhaps the major fraud in corporate America at the time was to have somebody like Dirks go out, do such investigation as he could and to publicize those allegations in the only way a securities analyst can by telling everybody he can get his hands on with the result that the trading in the stock would cause an adjustment in the price--

    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Mr. Bonderman, we are dealing here, I guess, only with the activities of Mr. Dirks in those few days before he went to the SEC.
speaker="david_bonderman" startTime="224.580" stopTime="229.701">
    Mr. David Bonderman 
    --That is correct, Justice O'Connor, from the 7th of March until the 26th of March.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="229.701" stopTime="235.713">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Why shouldn't he have gone in the first place to the SEC and then gone ahead and done all of the things that he did?
speaker="david_bonderman" startTime="235.713" stopTime="249.148">
    Mr. David Bonderman 
    Well, there are two answers to that. 
    I would like to start with the second one if I might. 
    The second one is that the SEC's position is that even if he had he would have violated the law because it is no defense that you reported it to the SEC--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="249.148" stopTime="255.520">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Well, but I suppose you could argue to us that it should be a defense that he reported it to the SEC. 
    That is another question.
speaker="david_bonderman" startTime="255.520" stopTime="270.404">
    Mr. David Bonderman 
    --That brings me to what I suppose, perhaps, should have been my first. 
    It was reported to Dirks by Mr. Secrist that the SEC was aware and had been informed in 1971. 
    That was correct. 
    The Courts below so found--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="270.404" stopTime="279.369">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    But isn't it his obligation to go as a broker/dealer to the SEC? 
    You would acknowledge that at some point it is his obligation? 
    Would you, or would you not?
speaker="david_bonderman" startTime="279.369" stopTime="286.602">
    Mr. David Bonderman 
    --Well, the answer to that is, I would say first, if he has an obligation to go to the SEC at all--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="286.602" stopTime="289.098">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Does he ever, in your view, have an obligation?
speaker="david_bonderman" startTime="289.098" stopTime="319.476">
    Mr. David Bonderman 
    --I believe not, but I believe that that is not material here because under the facts present what he had was a rumor, an unverified allegation, perhaps more than a rumor, but certainly less than fact, of the sort that goes on in the market all the time. 
    In fact, Stanley Sporkin, the head of the Securities and Exchange Commission's Division of Enforcement at the time, who was called before Congress and asked why was it that the SEC didn't take action when Dirks did go there on the 26th--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="319.476" stopTime="340.327">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Well, if you would assume for purposes of answering the question that his obligation as a licensee to be a broker/dealer does obligate him to go to the SEC with the information, then could you agree that he ought to go there first?
speaker="david_bonderman" startTime="340.327" stopTime="396.694">
    Mr. David Bonderman 
    --I think the answer to that is no because I believe that Mr. Dirks did, in fact, go to the SEC himself although Secrist told him on the 19th of March that Secrist had gone to the SEC... That turned out to be inaccurate. 
    Indirectly the information was brought to the SEC's attention on the 9th... I believe that the record here is clear that Mr. Dirks went to the SEC on the 26th at the very first time, certainly the very first working day, that he had anything beyond speculation allegation. 
    After he had checked it out, he and Mr. Blundell from The Wall Street Journal, who was, in fact, the first person that Mr. Dirks talked to, did, in fact, go to the SEC. 
    I might add that Mr. Dirks had a very personal additional reason for not going to the SEC because the last time he was involved in an investigation, he had done just what you suggest. 
    Some clients of his... This involved a prior case, the ITT Hartford--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="396.694" stopTime="397.552">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Is this in the record?
speaker="david_bonderman" startTime="397.552" stopTime="437.943">
    Mr. David Bonderman 
    --Yes it is. 
    It is in the record. 
    Mr. Dirks in that case had gone to the SEC because he heard from some of his clients that insider trading was going on, and he went to the SEC and told them requesting that they please keep his name out of it because his clients would not appreciate his sharing their confidences with the SEC. 
    The first thing the SEC did was call up the clients and said, Dirks here is alleging that you know thus and such about inside information and inside trading in the Hartford case. 
    Needless to say, Mr. Dirks himself was personally disencouraged because of that experience for going to the SEC before he believed he had facts, which he did not have, we believe.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="437.943" stopTime="452.766">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    But, I suppose, the SEC as affirmed by the Court of Appeals, though, found that the information he had during the days before he went to the SEC was material specific in detail?
speaker="david_bonderman" startTime="452.766" stopTime="506.992">
    Mr. David Bonderman 
    Well, the answer to that is in part, yes, although what the Commission really found was at least and the Administrator alleges the same thing... at least, forgetting what happened earlier on, at least by the weekend between the 23rd and 26th he had such information. 
    In fact, the information that Dirks had was brought to the attention of Mr. Sporkin on a telephone call by Mr. Blundel of The Wall Street Journal on the evening of the 23rd of March which happened to have been a Friday. 
    Dirks came in and testified starting on the following Monday, the 26th, testified for three days at the end of which time Mr. Sporkin testified before Congress that the SEC had nothing but hearsay, innuendo and rumor, and nothing on which it could act. 
    That was the SEC's position and testimony before Congress about what Dirks knew. 
    That is after Dirks spent three days telling them. 
    I would like to talk about--
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="506.992" stopTime="508.415">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Before you go on with that--
speaker="david_bonderman" startTime="508.415" stopTime="508.977">
    Mr. David Bonderman 
    --Yes, sir.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="508.977" stopTime="534.437">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    --when a citizen, a private citizen, goes to the SEC as they sometimes go to the FBI, Department of Justice or a newspaper, are there any regulations first that could guarantee them anonymity? 
    Second, beyond that, are there any protections from liability for slander or libel, if they do it in writing?
speaker="david_bonderman" startTime="534.437" stopTime="537.777">
    Mr. David Bonderman 
    The answer to both questions is, as far as I know, there are none.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="537.777" stopTime="540.652">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    They go at their own risk, then, don't they?
speaker="david_bonderman" startTime="540.652" stopTime="590.148">
    Mr. David Bonderman 
    I believe they do. 
    In fact, you raise a very good point because when Dirks started to make his checks in the industry and ask people, look, you know how reinsurers operate, is this scheme possible, because it made no sense. 
    It was Ponzi scheme. 
    Is this scheme possible. 
    He was cautioned, don't say anything to anybody. 
    You are going to get yourself in trouble. 
    There are libel laws here. 
    You be very cautious about what you say. 
    So, the truth is that you are caught between a rock and a hard place in the sense that an analyst like Dirks has no access to the press. 
    He went to The Wall Street Journal. 
    That was the first thing he did. 
    They declined to print the story. 
    The testimony was that they cannot print a story on hearsay allegations. 
    They did not act on it, though they worked with Dirks, and ultimately based on the information that Dirks uncovered printed a story after the period of time we are talking about.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="590.148" stopTime="612.590">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Now, on the other side of this equation, if it is an equation, I am not sure, if a person, an analyst, a securities analyst has clients who depend upon him, would he be at risk for a malpractice if he had information and did not give it to them?
speaker="david_bonderman" startTime="612.590" stopTime="613.292">
    Mr. David Bonderman 
    Well--
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="613.292" stopTime="617.168">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Is there any malpractice suit that has reached that area yet?
speaker="david_bonderman" startTime="617.167" stopTime="741.867">
    Mr. David Bonderman 
    --One of the defenses raised by the persons to whom Dirks gave information and who traded... and let me just regress for a second to say, Dirks told literally a hundred people about this, some of whom bought, some of whom sold, some of whom did neither. 
    Some of those... Five of those persons who sold were charged in this proceeding below, and they defended themselves, in part, on the grounds that they were caught with two fiduciary obligations, assuming for the moment that this was inside information, which I do not believe for a moment it is. 
    They had two fiduciary obligations. 
    One to their clients, pension funds for example, for whom they were trustee. 
    Information comes to them. 
    They have an obligation to act for those trustees, and they have an obligation not to violate the law with respect to this information. 
    The Courts below, or this Commission because it never got to the Court below, held that whatever your other fiduciary obligations are, it gives you no license to violate these laws. 
    I think the question is an open one. 
    It was decided by the administrative law judge, but I am not aware of any further decisions on that point. 
    What happens here if we think about the public policy implications of what was done, and, indeed, why the Solicitor General and the Assistant Attorney General in charge of the criminal division filed a brief urging reversal, is that as one commentator put it, you have here the biggest boon for the successful commission and continuation of fraud that can be imagined because what you have done to somebody in Dirks' position is to tell him that the only thing he can do without risking a securities violation is to do what counsel suggested below, nothing. 
    That is to say to be silent. 
    Why do I say that? 
    Because you will recall that Dirks himself did not trade. 
    He did not own any stock. 
    Neither he nor his company traded a single share. 
    What he did was tell everybody he could get his hands on, which included the auditors, which included The Wall Street Journal, which included a whole series of persons in the securities business, large and small, as the SEC found. 
    He basically responded to other people's calls.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="741.867" stopTime="747.723">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Could Mr. Dirks and his firm have traded in the stock on their own during that interval of time?
speaker="david_bonderman" startTime="747.723" stopTime="754.002">
    Mr. David Bonderman 
    Well, the answer to that is I think there is an argument that they could, and I think there is an argument that they could not.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="754.002" stopTime="757.921">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    What is your position? 
    [Laughter]
speaker="david_bonderman" startTime="757.921" stopTime="820.430">
    Mr. David Bonderman 
    My position is that if those members of the court in Chiarella who expressed the view that misappropriation of information is grounds under 10b-5 and 17(a) for violation, and the information came to Dirks on the theory that he was going to disseminate it. 
    If he instead used it solely for his own private trading, it might be argued that he misappropriated it. 
    I think that is wrong, but I think a substantial argument can be made based on that branch of Chiarella. 
    I think there is no argument that can be made, no reasonable argument that can be made, that where Secrist reasonably concluded that the only way to get this out in view of what Secrist understood to be the SEC's defaults in investigating, and which the Court below found to the SEC's defaults in investigating it, the only way to get this out was to do what Dirks did. 
    Dirks did not trade, but did get it out. 
    There is no grounds under Chiarella to find that any person breached any duty to any one.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="820.429" stopTime="837.202">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Would your... If the information that Mr. Dirks had received were merely adverse but not indicating criminal conduct, would Petitioner have been liable as a tippee for the failure to disclose?
speaker="david_bonderman" startTime="837.202" stopTime="839.031">
    Mr. David Bonderman 
    I think the answer to that is probably yes.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="839.031" stopTime="839.904">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Clearly yes.
speaker="david_bonderman" startTime="839.904" stopTime="962.902">
    Mr. David Bonderman 
    That is correct. 
    The reason that he is not liable here is because under no conceivable definition of the term, insider information, as that has been used, inside information, could this possibly be inside information. 
    That is what the SEC forgot here. 
    They made the incredible... and I think it is... incredible statement as the underlying basis for their rationale in this case that Dirks should have known that this information was intended by the company to remain confidential. 
    Indeed, it was. 
    Nobody who is committing a fraud desires to have it circulated. 
    But, yet that is the foundation for the whole insider trading rules and regulations stemming from Investors Management, the notion of improper dissemination. 
    There was nothing improper about what Mr. Secrist chose to do. 
    He had two choices as a fiduciary. 
    The fraud was going on. 
    He could do either of two things. 
    He could, as the Commission suggests he should have, done nothing whatsoever and allowed it to continue. 
    Instead, he chose to follow a path which lead to its disclosure sooner rather than later. 
    And, that is because, and it is a proven fact in this case, so found by the Court of Appeals that reporting this information to public officials got nowhere in the past. 
    That isn't and should not come to anybody as a shock, although this case is a little more egregious as to what it is that public officials overlooked because entire statutory enforcement schemes, indeed the whole reason we have a 10b-5, a private right of action at all, is a recognition that no matter how well motivated an intention and whatever skillful a job they are doing, regulators simply cannot probe and uncover all instances where enforcement is appropriate. 
    That is why we have private enforcement, not only in 10b-5, in the anti-trust statutes, throughout the federal regime. 
    It is why we have informers' rewards. 
    It is why we try to encourage dissemination and uncover of fraud.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="962.902" stopTime="987.344">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    But, if you are right, and if there is no accompanying obligation on Mr. Dirks to go right away to the SEC and disclose the information, then that would build an incentive to people who might uncover this information to continually, selectively disseminate it and to extend that time as long as possible to maximize their profits.
speaker="david_bonderman" startTime="987.344" stopTime="1019.395">
    Mr. David Bonderman 
    Well, let me answer that this way, if I might, Justice O'Connor. 
    First of all, I think Commissioner Smith in Investors Management gave the right response to the notion of selective dissemination. 
    That is a spit word the SEC has invented, and it means nothing. 
    Because, what the selective dissemination means, if it means you did not make it public because you did not put it on the wire, of course, they are right. 
    No one would put this on the wire. 
    The Wall Street Journal would not publish it. 
    If it means that you chose a few people to select for profit and did not try to get it out as broadly as possible, that is not what was done here. 
    The Court below found--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="1019.395" stopTime="1023.863">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Well, but if you are right, it might be done in the future for others.
speaker="david_bonderman" startTime="1023.863" stopTime="1094.585">
    Mr. David Bonderman 
    --If, in fact, someone uses it to line their pocket in a direct sense, I think we have a different case, and, indeed, maybe can have a different rule. 
    But, I would like to suggest that the entire theoretical underpinnings as... I am referring the Court, for example, to Professor Easterbrook's seminal article and this suggests that there is nothing wrong with the notion, if what you are talking about is encouraging people to investigate fraud and the choice is to have them not investigate fraud, what are the costs you are willing to pay to encourage someone. 
    If, in fact, Dirks because of his own personality did this essentially for free... He did, in fact, do it essentially for free... his company received one indirect commission. 
    But, you cannot expect people to spend their own time and incur costs to investigate fraud doing that. 
    In fact, it has never been the case in this society, that I am aware, that people... altruism was supposed to contribute solely and 100 percent to their doing of acts that the society regards as good. 
    That goes for all of us in this courtroom.

speaker="david_bonderman" startTime="1099.159" stopTime="1117.510">
    Mr. David Bonderman 
    That depends if you believe that Judge Wright's single-judge opinion creating a broker/dealer duty to the whole world which he announced was breached.

    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, what about Dirks, I said. 
    What if he had not told any of his clients? 
    He just made a sign that said so and so is a fraudulent outfit and stuck it up at the corner of something and Wall Street?
speaker="david_bonderman" startTime="1236.351" stopTime="1273.119">
    Mr. David Bonderman 
    --That is not public disclosure because the persons who do not go by Broad and Wall, for example, people trading in Seattle, Washington never find out about it. 
    In fact, one of the trading defendants, Dreyfus, did disclose. 
    They disclosed substantially everything that Dirks had told them on the 23rd to Goldman Sachs to whom they sold some stock. 
    The SEC argued, and the administrative law judge found... these folks did not appeal... that even had they done so he said there was great merit in the notion that that is not enough. 
    You cannot simply tell who you are dealing with.

    What is to prevent the Dirkses of the future from being indicted for this if this Court says that Dirks did wrong here.

    I understand the objections to your opponent's theories, but under your view if everything hinges on the character of the information, it is illegal and, therefore, there is no protection to it, it does follow, does it not, that you would say that he would not be liable even if he had traded directly and never told?

    We also recognize, however, the misappropriation arguments that the Chief Justice made in his dissent, and what we are saying is that it is at least possible to formulate a theory of misappropriation which would not apply here, which might apply if Secrist had come to Dirks and said, look, disseminate this, as, in fact, Dirks did, but instead Dirks went home and traded on it for his own use and that is all he did. 
    It seems to me there might be a misappropriation argument along the lines made by the Chief Justice in Chiarella.

    I do not think so because everybody recognized that, and at least Secrist planned, if that is what it could be called, was that Dirks would do exactly what he did do, which was tell everybody in sight, which was not simply clients. 
    He told competitors. 
    He told people he never heard of, people who called him up on the telephone.

   Argument of Paul Gonson
speaker="paul_gonson" startTime="1623.912" stopTime="1673.752">
    Mr. Paul Gonson 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    Raymond Dirks was censured by the Commission for passing material, nonpublic information he had received from Equity Funding to five institutions. 
    On the basis of that information, they sold more than $17,000,000 worth of Equity Funding securities to investors who did not know that those securities were virtually worthless. 
    In imposing only a censure, the Commission took into account Mr. Dirks' role in bringing to light the massive fraud at Equity Funding as a result of his investigation. 
    But while his role mitigated any sanction to be imposed upon him as a result of his unlawful tipping activities, it did not excuse them.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1673.752" stopTime="1676.170">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Was anybody at SEC censured?
speaker="paul_gonson" startTime="1676.170" stopTime="1856.394">
    Mr. Paul Gonson 
    Was anybody at the Commission censured? 
    So far as I am aware, no, Your Honor. 
    Let me address the question of the information to the SEC, which is set forth in both of our briefs. 
    The events that are involved in this case took place in 1973. 
    In 1971 a former attorney who worked on the staff of the SEC called to say that two employees of the SEC, one Mercado and one Templeton, had information about irregularities at Equity Funding. 
    We asked that they be sent in. 
    They were sent in, but they were very circumspect. 
    They did not tell the kind of story that the lawyer promised that they would. 
    We followed up on it, and we were unable to get that information. 
    At a later time, the attorney for Mercado who became concerned that his client had gone to the SEC unaccompanied by counsel then came... and then there is an issue which counsel raises as to whether an offer of immunity was made whereby Mercado allegedly would discuss that. 
    From the SEC's staff's memorandum it was never perceived that such an offer was made and so that matter was not pursued. 
    On the 9th of March, which was two days after Secrist told Dirks the story he had told him, the California Insurance Commission representative contacted a staff member of the Los Angeles office of the SEC to reveal in a very vague way that some allegations were being made. 
    And, the response was made that the California authority should look into them and if they promise if they bring proof to contact us again. 
    This has to be understood, I think, in the context that at that time approximately 10,000 complaints were received... this is back in 1973... by the SEC. 
    Today it is closer to 20,000 a year. 
    So, the very detailed hard story that Dirks knew and received from Secrist, and which, by the way, he corroborated in great detail by talking at length with six former and present employees of Equity Funding, was not brought to the SEC, rather a much vaguer, softer information. 
    Now, it may assist analysis of this case to view Dirks as did the administrative law judge in this case as proceeding on two tracks. 
    On the first track, which is what has been described to you, Dirks was seeking to confirm and expose what he believed was a fraud. 
    And, as the administrative law judge found had Dirks confined his disclosure to The Wall Street Journal reporters, or had he gone to the authorities, 
    "He might indeed have been perceived as the public spirited hero he portrays himself. " 
    But, there is a second track. 
    Dirks informed his clients about this fraud. 
    Secrist testified that he wanted Dirks to disseminate information to his clients so that they would sell Equity Funding securities--

    Those that the SEC and the--

    Mr. Paul Gonson 
    --That is correct. 
    That an insider has to observe what has come to be known as the abstain or disclose rule.

    What did Dirks do that was so different here?
speaker="paul_gonson" startTime="1951.541" stopTime="2021.292">
    Mr. Paul Gonson 
    The Commission pointed out in its opinion that it views the role of analyst as very important and said that they perform valuable functions in putting forth their analytical skills in evaluating data and then putting them together in what has sometimes been referred to as a mosaic. 
    They take perhaps what might be inconsequential bits of information to others and because of other information they know and their analytical skills they can make predictions and they can make suggestions as to the company will do or will not do. 
    That is different, said the Commission, from the kind of devastatingly important information that would become obvious to anyone, that there was a massive fraud at Equity Funding. 
    The Commission said a line has to be drawn between the usual functions of analysts and their trading on inside information that would not be available to anyone. 
    The line is between what might be called fairness, as far as is possible to do so, on the one hand, as against the role that analysts play on the other hand.

    Secrist wanted Dirks to disseminate information to his clients so that Dirks would sell these securities in large quantities.

    In other words, are you trying to induce me to do something to depress the price. 
    Secrist said, no. 
    Secrist said that a friend of his had approached him and said, I will put up the money. 
    We will sell the stock short, and then we will divide the profits.

    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    May I ask one other question, please. 
    Supposing during the period between, I think it was March 7th and the time he went out to the west coast, he had nothing but the Secrist source of information, which were the bad facts but no verification, was he then under a duty to refrain or disclose?
speaker="paul_gonson" startTime="2519.107" stopTime="2565.897">
    Mr. Paul Gonson 
    That raises the question, Your Honor, as to whether that information was material. 
    That, of course, is a closer question then much later when he had confirmed that with six former Equity Funding insiders. 
    The Commission found that it was material, that it was very specific. 
    It came from a source which Secrist... excuse me... which Dirks himself said was a credible source. 
    It was a three-and-one-half-hour, very detailed conversation. 
    The Commission found that yes, it was. 
    But, I am not sure that this Court need reach that because trades, of course, were made throughout that period and most of them at the very end of the period when, by that time, the information had been confirmed in great detail by others who had seen or witnessed others participate in the fraud--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="2565.897" stopTime="2576.067">

    Mr. Gonson, we are not giving you much of a chance to argue you case, but there are so many interesting questions.

    How long would Secrist be the possessor of inside information? 
    Suppose he had withheld it for four or five years. 
    No one else had ever discovered it. 
    He obviously did not owe any duty not to disclose confidential information to Equity, did he?

    Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. 
    If he had finally concluded five years later that he had a guilty conscience.

    Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr.

    Mr. Paul Gonson 
    Well, that raises a number of questions, Your Honor. 
    Was the information material? 
    Was it then public? 
    I think the fact that he knew about it a long time is not as relevant as the fact that the person who is receiving it learned it only then. 
    The question then would be was it material. 
    Of course, we would have to look for a duty, which I would like to get to, and if it was received in a breach of duty and the person knew that it was coming from an insider, then he would be disabled from trading on it.

speaker="paul_gonson" startTime="3028.757" stopTime="3189.990">
    Mr. Paul Gonson 
    It generally does, Your Honor, if you are talking about a large number of complaints that are made or complaints over a period of time, but what we are talking about here is a complaint, if you will call it that, in 1971 then another one in 1973, neither one conveying very much in the way of detailed information. 
    If I may return to the question of duty... The Commission in this case dealt with Secrist and Dirks. 
    Secrist was an insider and as an insider owed a duty to shareholders of Equity Funding and to those who were to become shareholders by the very act of buying the stock. 
    And, that duty was a duty of disclosure to them, a duty not to defraud them. 
    And, that duty rests upon the fiduciary relationship recognized in the common law between the corporate insider and the shareholder and not on the separate and distinct duty of the insider to the corporation to preserve the confidentiality of the corporation's secrets. 
    Dirks and the Solicitor General who has filed a brief in this case confused these two duties. 
    They disregard the duty to the shareholders. 
    They argue instead that because Secrist had no duty to keep confidential the information about the fraud he breached no duty to Equity Funding. 
    Now, this Court recognized in the Chiarella case in discussing the traditional prohibitions against insider trading by insiders and their tippees that the duty to disclose inside information arises not from any obligation to the corporate source of the information, but from the 
    "relationship between the corporate insider and the stockholders of the corporation. " 
    The Court there referred among other sources to the Commission's Katie Roberts decision in which the Commission had recognized that a relationship of trust and confidence exists between the shareholders of a corporation and its insiders giving rise to a duty of disclosure in order to prevent a corporate insider from taking advantage of the uninformed shareholders. 
    The Court also refers to this Court's 1909 decision in Strong v. Repide essentially for a similar proposition. 
    Now, the duty to shareholders is separate from the duty of confidentiality that the insider also owes to the corporation. 
    This case, as I mentioned before, is not about confidentiality. 
    It is not about the corporation's interest in keeping the fraud quiet. 
    It is about the shareholder's interest in knowing about the fraud and the insider's duty to tell them about it before--

    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Mr. Gonson, may I interrupt you? 
    If we just concentrate on duty to shareholders, how would the financial interests of the shareholders have been served by a total disclosure of the fraud?
speaker="paul_gonson" startTime="3199.720" stopTime="3230.599">
    Mr. Paul Gonson 
    --Of course, at any time when the fraud would become known, the stock would become worthless or virtually worthless and whoever would be holding it at that time would have worthless stock. 
    But, I believe, and I think that this is probably an accurate statement, that people who buy stock assume the risk that some companies are not going to do well. 
    I do not think that people assume the risk, however, that infavored insiders are going to be able to bail out and dump their stock on them before that time comes.

    Mr. Paul Gonson 
    Yes, Your Honor. 
    In the Chiarella case this Court quoted Judge Learned Hand's reasoning in Gratz v. Claughton, a Second Circuit case, that 
    "the director or officer assumed a fiduciary relation to the buyer by the very sale; for it would be a sorry distinction to allow him to use the advantage of his position to induce the buyer into the position of a beneficiary although he was forbidden to do so once the buyer had become one. " 
    And, our position and the Commission said, Your Honor, that just as Secrist could not trade his tippees, Dirks could not trade and Dirks' tippees, the institutions, could not trade.

    Everyone should go down together?
speaker="paul_gonson" startTime="3289.248" stopTime="3305.396">
    Mr. Paul Gonson 
    So long, Your Honor, as they know the information comes from an insider, was communicated with the intention that purchasers be defrauded. 
    That intention was carried out. 
    Everybody who is in that chain ought to be disabled from trading on that information.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3305.396" stopTime="3319.423">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Again, I will ask what I asked a moment ago. 
    If Dirks and/or his tippees had disclosed everything they knew to their buyer, would that have discharged their duty to the stockholders of Equity?
speaker="paul_gonson" startTime="3319.423" stopTime="3331.964">
    Mr. Paul Gonson 
    Yes, it would, Your Honor. 
    If there were a way, yes, certainly. 
    That is the principle of the case. 
    If the buyer of the stock is given full disclosure, all the facts, the material facts known by the seller--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3331.964" stopTime="3336.303">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    That discharges the duty not only to the buyer but to the stockholders?
speaker="paul_gonson" startTime="3336.303" stopTime="3341.162">
    Mr. Paul Gonson 
    --It discharges the duty to those who are purchasers in response to Justice Stevens.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3341.162" stopTime="3345.147">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    I thought you said the insider owes a duty to the stockholders--
speaker="paul_gonson" startTime="3345.147" stopTime="3347.534">
    Mr. Paul Gonson 
    Owes a duty to the stockholders not to deceive them--

    Justice Byron R. White 
    --He is not deceiving them. 
    He just goes and sells his stock and he tells the buyer exactly what the facts are.
speaker="paul_gonson" startTime="3354.643" stopTime="3356.031">
    Mr. Paul Gonson 
    --As I mentioned by quoting--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3356.031" stopTime="3359.436">

    Does that satisfy the duty to the stockholders?
speaker="paul_gonson" startTime="3359.436" stopTime="3387.254">
    Mr. Paul Gonson 
    --Yes, Your Honor. 
    When I speak to duty of the stockholders, I am referring it to the possible other side of the case where the insider, as was the case in Strong v. Repide in this Court, buys the stock, then, of course, he would breach the duty to that stockholder in purchasing without disclosure of material information because of the fiduciary relationship that he bears. 
    When he sells stock then he breaches the duty to the purchaser who by that very act of fraud, if you will, then becomes the shareholder.

    Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. 
    Mr. Gonson, I just want to be clear about this, but as I understand your position, it is perfectly immaterial that Dirks' firm profited by the information he had disseminated? 
    That is immaterial to your position, isn't it?
speaker="paul_gonson" startTime="3403.278" stopTime="3407.509">
    Mr. Paul Gonson

    It is immaterial to your basic theory.

    It is immaterial, yes, to the basic theory, although it provides, of course, some reason for him--

    Mr. Paul Gonson 
    --That is correct, Your Honor, because potentially under the theory of this case, Dirks was free to have enjoyed that $17,000,000 profit--

    Would it strike you as curious from the standpoint of society in general if that were true?

    Mr. Paul Gonson 
    Your Honor, it does not strike me as curious, if I may answer the question. 
    If one discovers a crime and is on his way to the police station to tell them about it and decides on the way to take a little piece of it himself, then, I think, that tarnishes his image as a hero. 
    If another person publishes an article and does not profit himself, I think there is a distinction. 
    That does not strike me as curious. 
    Thank you.

   Rebuttal of David Bonderman
speaker="david_bonderman" startTime="3494.630" stopTime="3518.839">
    Mr. David Bonderman 
    If I might make a few brief points in my remaining time, I would like to answer Justice White's questions. 
    The SEC's position is not that everybody should go down together. 
    It is that the fraud should be allowed to continue because all incentive for anybody, whether it is Secrist or Dirks, to disseminate any such information if they do not have access to a wire, should be withdrawn from them because they should risk SEC proceedings, $17,000,000 liabilities--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3518.839" stopTime="3524.853">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Dirks could get off the hook by making the whole thing public, in which event, everybody would go down together.
speaker="david_bonderman" startTime="3524.853" stopTime="3531.100">
    Mr. David Bonderman 
    --Except Dirks could not make it public. 
    He tried as best he could. 
    He did not have a wire service. 
    No one would print these--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3531.100" stopTime="3532.535">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, suppose it was printed.
speaker="david_bonderman" startTime="3532.535" stopTime="3543.126">
    Mr. David Bonderman 
    --If The Wall Street Journal had, in fact, published it, which it refused to do, I would believe that the SEC would have said, okay, thereafter it is public. 
    But--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3543.126" stopTime="3545.938">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Then everybody could take his chances?
speaker="david_bonderman" startTime="3545.938" stopTime="3554.964">
    Mr. David Bonderman 
    --That is right, but the truth is that Dirks, remember, did not trade. 
    He told everybody. 
    This is not a trading without disclosure. 
    Dirks told everybody he could.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="3554.964" stopTime="3562.335">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Let me ask you one other question about your theory. 
    What about... Assuming that Secrist had traded, would there be liability for Secrist?
speaker="david_bonderman" startTime="3562.335" stopTime="3563.368">
    Mr. David Bonderman 
    I think so.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="3563.368" stopTime="3564.289">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Why?
speaker="david_bonderman" startTime="3564.289" stopTime="3593.698">
    Mr. David Bonderman 
    Because I believe it is not us, but the SEC is confused as to whom Mr. Secrist has a duty. 
    He has a duty first to the shareholders not to profit himself. 
    I believe that. 
    Secondly, he has a duty to the public to disclose fraud. 
    That is what he was trying to do. 
    If instead what he had done is simply take the information, put it in his pocket and lined his pocket, we would not have the implication that we do here of a man who is trying to disseminate the fraud--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="3593.698" stopTime="3607.304">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    What if he tried to tell The Wall Street Journal just as Dirks did, and The Wall Street Journal would not publish and then he said, well, the only way I can get this into the public is by selling and causing the market to fall and cause an investigation, would he still be liable?
speaker="david_bonderman" startTime="3607.304" stopTime="3624.654">
    Mr. David Bonderman 
    --I think that is a tough case. 
    I think he probably would because Dirks is not in the same position under Chiarella and under the common law fiduciary cases as Secrist is. 
    Dirks had no contact with this company. 
    He is not a fiduciary of the company. 
    He had no contact with the stockholders. 
    He was not in a position of faith and trust.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="3624.654" stopTime="3628.342">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    No, but if he had traditional inside information, he would be in the same position.
speaker="david_bonderman" startTime="3628.342" stopTime="3643.600">
    Mr. David Bonderman 
    But, that is because there would have been a breach of duty supposedly in making that information available. 
    Where, I ask you, is there any breach of duty? 
    You have to go back. 
    What is wrong with the SEC's position here and why their arguments make no sense and why they cannot answer your questions--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="3643.600" stopTime="3653.002">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Well, their argument is that the duty to refrain or disclose was something that imposed on Secrist, he violated that and the person to whom he disclosed had the same duty. 
    That is their theory.
speaker="david_bonderman" startTime="3653.002" stopTime="3700.374" flagged="true">
    Mr. David Bonderman 
    --The problem with their theory is that it is obviously wrong. 
    Did Secrist have a duty not to disclose information relating to the criminal conduct? 
    Let's go back and see where this whole tippee theory came from. 
    The notion is that inside information is in a sense a corporate asset. 
    That it is information good or bad to be controlled by the corporation for its private purposes, whether it is Texas Gulf's strike, good, or McDonnell-Douglass' collapse and dividend loss, which is bad, but to be released and will be released in due course by the company when the company has taken such legitimate advantage of it as it is entitled to. 
    That is where the whole notion came from. 
    Now, how can you possibly apply that theory to information with respect to an illegal ongoing fraud which the management has been concealing for 11 years and will conceal for the rest of all of our lives if it can. 
    You cannot, I submit. 
    That is why there is no breach of duty. 
    Thank you.
