    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    This case comes to us by way of an appeal from the Supreme Court of Kansas. 
    It doesn't lend itself very well to a description from the bench. 
    I think it will suffice to say that the case concerns intrastate gas contracts between the respective predecessors of the appellant producer and the appellee public utility. 
    That these contracts contained an escalator clause and a price redetermination clause, and that the Federal Natural Gas Policy Act was in -- enacted in 1978 and replaced earlier federal price controls for interstate gas as well as extending federal price regulation to the intrastate gas market. 
    And that a Kansas Act was enacted in May 1979 and imposed price controls on the intrastate market with respect to contracts executed before April 20, 1977. 
    And that the parties are in dispute as to whether the new federal Act triggered the escalator clauses and enabled the producers when the utility refused to go along with a higher rate to terminate the contracts. 
    In this litigation, a Kansas trial court entered summary judgment for the utility holding that the federal Act's imposition of price ceilings on intrastate gas did not trigger the governmental price escalator clauses. 
    And that the Kansas Act did not violate the Contract Clause of the Federal Constitution. 
    That reading was affirmed by the Supreme Court of Kansas. 
    In an opinion filed today with the clerk, we in turn affirm the judgment of the Supreme Court of Kansas. 
    Justice Powell has filed a separate opinion which joins the Court's opinion and except as to Part II-C and he is joined in that opinion by the Chief Justice and by Justice Rehnquist.
