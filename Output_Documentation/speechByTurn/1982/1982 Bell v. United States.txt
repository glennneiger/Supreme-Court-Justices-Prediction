    Mr. Roy W. Allman 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court. 
    It is my position here in the interpretation of the federal bank robbery statute, section 2113(b) does not cover the crime of false pretenses. 
    Here, as the facts indicated in the brief, a client managed to take some money from Dade Federal Savings and Loan by and with their consent with an artificial trick. 
    That is, he altered a check which was sort of obvious had they looked at it and took $10,000 from this account which he created in his own name. 
    The check was drawn to him. 
    It was done totally by mistake on behalf of the bank. 
    Basically what we have--

    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Mr. Allman, Daytona wasn't the drawee of the check either, was it?
speaker="roy_w_allman" startTime="89.868" stopTime="105.048">
    Mr. Roy W. Allman 
    --No, Dade Federal Savings and Loan. 
    It was a check which he somehow came into possession of, altered the deposit number on the back, i.e., put his account number after scratching out somebody else's and put it in an account that he created at Dade Federal Savings and Loan.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="105.048" stopTime="107.781">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    The check wasn't drawn on Dade Federal Savings and Loan?
speaker="roy_w_allman" startTime="107.781" stopTime="458.499">
    Mr. Roy W. Allman 
    No, it was not. 
    It was drawn through somebody else for deposit to some account of the person whose check it was. 
    Basically, he got the bank involved through the bank's mistake. 
    It is my position in reading the statute and it has created an ambiguity. 
    It has got the Courts of Appeal... I think it is five to four now... construing this statute both narrowly and broadly. 
    The bank robbery statute which in 1934 was specifically limited to bank robbery amended in 1937 to include the terms 1937 interpreted and argued by the government that, in fact, this covered only common law larceny. 
    So the position now... The former Fifth Circuit now the Eleventh first went along with my arguments in my brief then en banc reversed itself and took the broad position that 2113(b) covered the crime of false pretense. 
    The reason all this has come about is the way this Congress drew the statute. 
    The statute was drawn as follows: It indicated that you take and carry away, steal, or purloin, words that are not necessarily defined specifically at common law but are in fact defined now generically. 
    But in 1934, 1937 were contemplated in the common law sense. 
    What has happened is this. 
    In 1934 a broad bank robbery statute in dual form was submitted to the House Judiciary Committee. 
    The Committee considered this bill and specifically, specifically rejected the aspects of the bill that covered crimes of false pretense, embezzlement and other crimes by trick or consensual takings and restricted it to the forceful robbery concept. 
    Thus, the title of the Act, the text of the bill and the thrust of the situation in 1934 with the gangster-style bank robberies going on. 
    Subsequently, apparently in briefly reading the Act the prosecutors have brought prosecutions of people who take money from banks in various types of ways, false checks, forgeries, false pretenses, trick, deceipt, fraud, et cetera. 
    Four districts have gone along with this. 
    Four districts have not. 
    However, the Supreme Court itself in Jerome in 1943 took the position and the government took the position that the Bank Robbery Act, 2213(b) was a common law situation defining the crimes it intended to proscribe as robbery, burglary, and larceny even though the Act eventually uses the terms 
    "steal, purloin, take and carry away. " 
    which are not specific to those crimes. 
    In Turley, the Supreme Court gave us some indications how we should interpret these nonspecific common law terms. 
    What they have said is this. 
    You look to the legislative history of the Act. 
    In this case specifically in Le Master the Ninth Circuit looked at the legislative history in great detail and quoted directly from it saying they could not do better than the analysis which they put forth of the legislative history which showed specifically the Act was originally intended to be broad. 
    It was tightened and limited to robbery in 1934 and then extended to burglary and common law larceny only in 1937. 
    For this reason the factual situation that Mr. Bell put himself in unwittingly exempted him from prosecution under 2113(b). 
    In the dissent in the Eleventh Circuit the judge said it is not a question that Mr. Bell has committed some kind of a crime. 
    However, the crime he committed is not contemplated in 2113(b) because the legislative history combined with the title to the Act combined with the fact that the Act contemplated a, shall we say, active or violent taking away from, robbery, burglary, some kind of active, moving type of crime as opposed to the act of crime of false pretenses. 
    That is something stealthily done. 
    It is our position if you follow Turley and the appellate courts that look at Turley carefully and analyze the guidelines in Turley and apply them to the act in this case including the context of the Act, that is robbery, violent acts, taking away, carrying away, that type of thing with the fact that they were specifically in the bill in the House investigation of what they should do about the robbery situations occurring in the '30s took and eliminated the crime of false pretenses from the purview of this Act. 
    It is my conclusion and I think the only conclusion that is reasonable if you take the Act and interpret the ambiguities in it in accordance with what has happened, legislative--

    Mr. Roy W. Allman 
    --Steal and purloin, yes, sir.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="480.067" stopTime="495.514">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    --Because there was a carrying away of money with some kind of an intent to... At least the person knew he was not entitled to the money.
speaker="roy_w_allman" startTime="495.514" stopTime="504.979">
    Mr. Roy W. Allman 
    There is no question about that, Judge. 
    He committed a crime probably a state crime involving the generic term. 
    He stole. 
    He took somebody else's property.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="504.979" stopTime="510.787">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    But Jerome at least used words that had some common law meaning like larceny--

    Mr. Roy W. Allman 
    Larceny--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="511.287" stopTime="515.475">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    --and things like that, but steal or purloin does not have that kind of meaning.
speaker="roy_w_allman" startTime="515.475" stopTime="614.480">
    Mr. Roy W. Allman 
    --It is a generic term. 
    That is correct, and that creates the ambiguity in this sense. 
    If you look at the history of the law, if they intended to cover that type of crime they would not have eliminated specifically the crime of false pretenses as they did in the legislative debates that created the robbery statute. 
    They wanted to leave the states with that type of crime specifically focusing the federal law on the crime involving robbery, active carrying away, the violent gangster-type crime that initiated this situation. 
    That is my analysis of that ambiguity situation, Judge. 
    In Turley where they were interpreting the dire act of the interstate transportation of stolen motor vehicles that type of thing, stolen was construed consistently with the legislative history to be a broad thing where the federal government had an interest in controlling interstate transportation of stolen vehicles. 
    In this case it is the exact opposite. 
    The Congress specifically eliminated the crime of false pretenses in its debate before creating the statute. 
    That is analyzed very well, I think, in Le Master, the Ninth Circuit decision which is inconsistent with the other four decisions in applying Turley to the word "stolen" in the context of the statute along with the legislative history. 
    The only conclusion I think you can come to reasonably if you look at Le Master and go along with Turley is that 2113(b) was a restrictive statute and the government used to argue in 1937 that in fact it was a restrictive statute.

    Are there any other statutes that would make it a crime to get money from a bank other than by this violent kind of crime?
speaker="roy_w_allman" startTime="631.567" stopTime="636.411">
    Mr. Roy W. Allman 
    Yes, there are, Judge. 
    I think every state in the Union has a generic term which they--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="636.411" stopTime="640.470">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    I mean any other federal law, any federal law.
speaker="roy_w_allman" startTime="640.470" stopTime="682.706">
    Mr. Roy W. Allman 
    --Yes, as a matter of fact, a recent case, Williams. 
    The Williams case construing, I think it was 1025, indicates that, and this Court held recently, I think it was 1982 that unless the Congress specifically says in so many words that this is the proscribed act, we will not expand the congressional intent to cover a generic-type situation. 
    In analyzing the legislative history in Williams, this is exactly what they did. 
    The government was seeking to place a broad concept on the word's use in the statute where Congress in its legislative history did not intend to say--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="682.706" stopTime="701.303">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    I will put it another way. 
    Does this Act go as far as any Act towards covering false pretenses kinds of crime, or are there some other statutes that might reach false pretenses?
speaker="roy_w_allman" startTime="701.303" stopTime="703.693">
    Mr. Roy W. Allman 
    --There are other statutes both state and federal. 
    I believe--

speaker="roy_w_allman" startTime="709.878" stopTime="748.786">
    Mr. Roy W. Allman 
    I believe this comes about as close as any. 
    There are other statutes that cover, for instance, the card sharking statute which specifically contemplated false pretenses by specific language which I cite in my brief. 
    I can't recall the case name at this time. 
    However, in that case the Congress specifically said card sharking and false pretenses is a federal crime on the high seas... It was gambling off the shore of New Jersey or something like that... specifically enumerated by Congress. 
    This is the reverse. 
    In this case Congress specifically contemplated a broad bank robbery statute in the House bill and rejected it.

    The false statement I guess... He induced the bank by trick or fraud to give him somebody else's money is what he did. 
    There is no question about it. 
    He committed a crime.

    Mr. Roy W. Allman 
    I would have no problem with that in resolving the ambiguity in saying stolen or purloined if the legislative history had not specifically eliminated the crime of false pretenses. 
    In Le Master, in Jerome if you look at the Le Master case, the House Judiciary Committee had a very broad bill. 
    They accepted one provision and eliminated two others. 
    Specifically section 2 said it should be a crime for anybody to trick a bank in any way shape or form, false pretenses or whatever and accomplish the taking of money from said bank. 
    This was not enacted in the statute. 
    It was contemplated and eliminated specifically in 2113(b). 
    That is why I think it is different. 
    I think it would be a good result had they left it in, but they did not. 
    That is my problem with 2113(b) in this prosecution.

    That was the bank's mistake. 
    But that is not a crime under 2113(b) and that is the whole problem here.

    Is there not an aspect of the legislative history that you have not addressed at least yet? 
    In the '34 bill they broke it into two parts, consensual takings and nonconsensual takings and it was with the consent of the bank that the artifice and trick line which appeared. 
    But in the '37 bill there is no division between consensual and nonconsensual from which one might infer, I am not sure this is right, that the statute was intended to cover both categories and once it covers both categories you do not need the artifice language because takes and carries away is enough to take care of it.

    We cannot prosecute him under our Bank Robbery Act. 
    Therefore, we should change the Act as follows: make it burglary, you do not have to put anybody into fear to take the money, and larceny, common law larceny.

    This is not common law larceny.

    Mr. Roy W. Allman 
    Burglary or larceny, but the quick, violent active type of crime that Congress was addressing in this matter, if you look at legislative history and if you look at the interpretation in Turley, Turley says how are we going to interpret the words "steal and purloin"? 
    Purloin could mean by stealth, but it is still the same concept. 
    All the tellers go to the coffee machine. 
    He comes in sees the money on the table picks it up and walks out. 
    That is a larceny. 
    Like you say, there is no consent from the bank. 
    In this case the bank helped him commit this crime by a mistake. 
    He tricked the bank as just as though he tricked the people who had the money. 
    That is why Congress in limiting itself to the violent type of crime specifically said, we do not want to cover the crime of false pretenses by eliminating section 2 in the 1934 bill and again in 1937 not specifically enacting it.

    Mr. Roy W. Allman 
    It is both a removal.

    It is a crime. 
    The difference is this--

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    He carries it away in both cases does he not?

    --I'm sorry?

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    He carries it away in both cases?
speaker="roy_w_allman" startTime="1284.284" stopTime="1426.557">
    Mr. Roy W. Allman 
    Yes. 
    He carries it away. 
    There is no question about it. 
    The difference is in this case Congress considered the option of covering consensual trickery or crimes by the bank coming in and being suckered into a deal. 
    They considered that. 
    They specifically eliminated it in 1934. 
    If they had intended and if it had been a problem as the burglary and larceny aspects, the original statute was inadequate to cover the immediate taking and nonconsensual carrying away type thing, so in '37 they amended it. 
    They changed it. 
    But they did not go back to section 2 which they eliminated in 1934 and say this shall include either by implication and interpretation the trick, false pretense. 
    False pretense was not larceny ever under definition in common law. 
    False pretense was a separate crime primarily because they got possession and title. 
    The larceny thing they got possession with the consent. 
    In this case the bank intended him to have the money. 
    They thought it was his money. 
    They had made a mistake. 
    He had involved the bank in a crime but not the crime under 2113(b) because there was no nonconsensual taking away. 
    There was a consensual tricking of the bank not covered by this statute. 
    The legislative history is specific on that. 
    They could have put it in. 
    They did not. 
    In Williams this Court absent support in legislative history for the design of a statute to apply to the specific conduct, this Court, the Supreme Court holds it is not proscribed. 
    That is not the conduct approached in this statute. 
    That was the conclusion in Williams in 18 U.S.C. 1014. 
    We have an analogous situation. 
    Just recently the Supreme Court again said consistent with the approach of lenity the construction of a criminal statute shall be specific. 
    They shall not be presumed to take over the state's role in prosecuting crimes. 
    The federal bank robbery statute approaches and addresses itself specifically according to legislative history the nonconsensual, violent or active taking away from a bank not false pretense which was contemplated and rejected. 
    This is my whole problem with 2113(b) in this case.

    I think what really happened and basically what we are talking about is the prosecutor charged him with the wrong statute. 
    He could have turned it over the the state. 
    The man would have been punished. 
    He made a mistake. 
    In the dissent they admit he committed a crime. 
    He did something wrong. 
    There is no question about that.

   Argument of Rudolph W. Giuliani

    Mr. Rudolph W. Giuliani 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court. 
    The Petitioner in this case obtained possession of a $10,000 check that did not belong to him to be deposited into a savings account at the Dade County Savings and Loan Association. 
    Petitioner opened an account at the Dade County Bank using a false address, birthdate and social security number. 
    He then deposited the stolen check into this new account at another branch of the Dade Bank using a second false address and having altered the account number on the check to state his own new account number. 
    After a 20-day holding period, Petitioner withdrew $10,000 plus interest from this account. 
    In plain every day English, Petitioner stole $10,000 plus interest that at the time belonged to the Dade County Bank, a bank insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. 
    The bank theft statute, 18, U.S.C. section 2113(b) prohibits anyone from taking and carrying away with intent to steal or purloin money belonging to a bank insured by the FDIC. 
    In plain--

    Mr. Rudolph W. Giuliani 
    --Yes, Your Honor, I believe he did. 
    In plain English that is precisely what Petitioner did. 
    He stole $10,000. 
    In order to avoid the express language of this prohibition, Petitioner urges that the words do not mean what they say but instead should be read to mean that Congress in 1937 meant to prohibit solely larceny at common law. 
    That is trespassory taking or taking without consent.

    The Court's decision.
speaker="rudolph_w_giuliani" startTime="1625.863" stopTime="1711.032">
    Mr. Rudolph W. Giuliani 
    Yes, Your Honor. 
    Crucial to the crime of larceny at common law was a trespass really a physical invasion because primitive criminal law was concerned only with protection against force or violence. 
    A trespass was necessary for any crime to be felonious. 
    As the criminal law developed, however, and expanded to protect other interests including property rather than acknowledging the changing nature of the law, the Courts in England engaged in fiction to avoid the reality of reversing prior precedents. 
    So crimes such as larceny by trick an unilateral mistake developed so that it was larceny to trick someone out of possession of that money, but it would not constitute larceny if the owner of the money had also turned over title. 
    If Petitioner's argument is accepted and these ancient distinctions are revived, it would be a violation of section 2113(b) if a person cashing a check for $100 mistakenly received $1,000 from the teller, realized that mistake and decided to keep it and walked out of the bank because that at common law would have amounted to larceny by trick in the sense that according to the fiction only possession had been turned over, not title. 
    If, however, that same--

speaker="rudolph_w_giuliani" startTime="1817.519" stopTime="1840.870">
    Mr. Rudolph W. Giuliani 
    First of all, Your Honor, this particular bank was not an uninsured bank. 
    This bank was insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. 
    The statute that we are construing here was passed in order to protect the assets of federally insured banks and that is one of the reasons why we argue for an interpretation that would include all forms of theft.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1840.870" stopTime="1852.159">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Is it not true that it was passed in response to a specific problem. 
    John Dillinger and some of his friends were running around the country crossing state lines holding up banks all over the place. 
    Was that not what caused this statute to be enacted?
speaker="rudolph_w_giuliani" startTime="1852.159" stopTime="1856.831">
    Mr. Rudolph W. Giuliani 
    No, Your Honor, that is what caused the 1934 Act to pass.

    Mr. Rudolph W. Giuliani 
    But I think there is a very big difference between the 1934 Act and the 1937 Act. 
    The 1934 Act when it originally was proposed by the Attorney General would have covered all forms of taking. 
    It would have covered robbery, burglary, and larceny both with and without consent.

    The answer is because Congress says.
speaker="rudolph_w_giuliani" startTime="1907.449" stopTime="1909.056">
    Mr. Rudolph W. Giuliani 
    That is precisely correct.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1909.056" stopTime="1914.430">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Why didn't you read the statute correctly? 
    If it did not say that you would make precisely the same argument to the contrary.
speaker="rudolph_w_giuliani" startTime="1914.430" stopTime="1957.695">
    Mr. Rudolph W. Giuliani 
    Well, our argument is simply that the plain language of the statute if you put aside distinctions that are 200 and 300 years old and have been criticized for 200 or 300 years as just introducing technicalities into the law that have no equity. 
    If you read the plain language of the statute it certainly covers the conduct of this Petitioner taking and carrying away $10,000. 
    Then when you look at the legislative history of the 1937 Act and what Petitioner has done is to confuse the legislative history of the 1934 Act with the legislative history of the 1937 Act. 
    There is no doubt that the 1934 Act was limited to bank robberies. 
    The House so limited it. 
    Their concern was the Bonnie and Clyde gangster bank robbers who moved around state to state.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1957.695" stopTime="1959.665">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Not just burglaries but robberies.
speaker="rudolph_w_giuliani" startTime="1959.665" stopTime="2028.090">
    Mr. Rudolph W. Giuliani 
    Only robberies in 1934. 
    In 1935, however, a significant fact occurred. 
    Congress expanded the coverage of the bank robbery statute to cover not only federal reserve banks and banks chartered by the federal government, but in 1935 Congress expanded it to cover all banks insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, a much larger and greater area now of potential federal liability. 
    So that in 1937 when the Attorney General went back to Congress, he asked the Congress to expand the coverage of the 1934 Act to include burglary and larceny and he used new words to define larceny, not the old words that we used in '34 but new words. 
    The words that he used were 
    "taking and carrying away with intent to steal or purloin. " 
    so that the purpose of the '37 Congress cannot be the same as the limited purpose of the '34 Congress. 
    The purpose of the '37 Congress goes beyond merely being concerned about taking by force and violence.

    Mr. Rudolph W. Giuliani 
    That would be covered by a separate statute that had a federal embezzlement statute that applies to agents and employees of the bank.

    So the taking away requirement is really almost done away with because in the facts of this case you have Bell actually taking $10,000 that did not belong to him, dollar bills, so to speak, or tens or hundreds, but in the embezzlement thing it is just basically a credit or a ledger transaction.

    Mr. Rudolph W. Giuliani

    Was that on the books in '37?
speaker="rudolph_w_giuliani" startTime="2180.934" stopTime="2472.828">
    Mr. Rudolph W. Giuliani 
    I do not know if it was or not, if it was on the books in '37 or not, Your Honor. 
    The embezzlement statute was a crime prior to 1934. 
    I do not know about section 1014. 
    To assume that Congress in 1937 had reintroduced these distinctions would mean that it would be a violation of this statute if someone mistakenly received $1,000 as I said before and decided to keep it. 
    But it would not be a violation of this statute if he stole checks, forged those checks, presented those checks to a bank and over a period of time depleted the bank of unlimited amounts of money because at common law one would constitute larceny by trick because there had only been a cheating of possession and the other would constitute taking by false pretenses. 
    Petitioner and the few Circuits supporting his view in our view confused the purpose of the 1934 Congress with the purpose of the 1937 Congress and interpret those purposes as being exactly the same. 
    The 1934 bill as presented by the Attorney General and passed by the Senate would originally have prohibited robbery, burglary, and larceny defined actually as both taking by false pretenses and larceny at common law. 
    The House Judiciary Committee struck the burglary and the larceny provision not as Petitioner would have it because of some concern over the reach of common law larceny. 
    There was no discussion of common law. 
    There was no discussion of common law distinctions. 
    The word never even came up in the legislative history. 
    That Congress, the 1934 Congress was concerned with limiting the crime to reach the situation of interstate gangster bank robbers and wanted to limit the crime just to robbery and not to embrace burglary or any form of larceny. 
    The 1937 Congress when it took up this subject again clearly had a different purpose than the 1934 Congress. 
    The 1937 bill was intended to broaden coverage beyond robbery, beyond just merely taking by force and violence to cover burglary and larceny. 
    Concededly under everyone's interpretation of this statute, it would cover crimes such as taking money mistakenly given by the bank or larceny by trick, scarcely crimes that are committed by the Bonnie and Clyde interstate bank robbers. 
    Once Congress removed the force and violence limitation and expanded the statute to reach nonviolent theft as well as fraudulent theft, it cannot be logical to ascribe to the 1937 Congress the same intent as the 1934 Congress. 
    Rather the more logical and sensible conclusion is that in expanding the statute the intent of the 1937 Congress was to give broad protection to banks whose assets were insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. 
    Now the choice of words that Congress used, I believe, is very important. 
    The Petitioner relies very heavily on the fact that Congress selected the words "take and carry away" and the title larceny as if those two formulations are code words for all of the ancient distinctions of common law larceny. 
    By 1937, however, the words "take and carry away" as well as the term "larceny" no longer were limited solely to describing common law larceny. 
    In fact, in the 1934 bill which passed the Senate it used the words "take and carry away" to go on and define takings without consent which would have been common law larceny and then taking and carrying away with consent which at ancient common law would have been a false pretenses. 
    As this Court has noted in the Turley decision, by 1919 the law of many states had developed to include not only common law larceny but larceny by trick and false pretenses in their prohibition of generic larceny and theft offenses. 
    This Court, in fact, in the Jerome case twice used the label larceny for a description of crimes including false pretenses and pointed out that Congress did so in the legislative history to the 1934 Act. 
    Thus, by 1937 to conclude mechanically and dogmatically that larceny means solely common law larceny and that takes and carries away means the same thing that it meant in the 18th century is to ignore the contemporary use of those words both common use and use as words of art.

    Mr. Giuliani, speaking of the Jerome case, in Jerome the Court held the burglary prohibition of section 2113(a) did not cover this act and the underlying act in Jerome was, I think, uttering a forged check. 
    Under your theory, could the government have brought that action under subsection (b) then?
speaker="rudolph_w_giuliani" startTime="2497.243" stopTime="2512.159">
    Mr. Rudolph W. Giuliani 
    No, Your Honor, because actually it was an incomplete crime. 
    The crime was never completed in Jerome in the sense of a taking and carrying away. 
    The Jerome case does contain dicta--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="2512.159" stopTime="2514.390">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    That is contrary to your position.
speaker="rudolph_w_giuliani" startTime="2514.390" stopTime="2570.948">
    Mr. Rudolph W. Giuliani 
    --That is contrary to the position that the government is now arguing. 
    At the same time the Prince case contains dicta that supports precisely what the government is arguing. 
    The Jerome case really involves in our view a very different issue. 
    It involved a question of whether in determining whether Congress meant to cover in the burglary section a situation where a person enters a bank with intent to commit a felony. 
    Did Congress mean by felony, felony under the laws of all the states in which case what it would have read into the federal statute all the differing interpretations and definitions of felony, high misdemeanors and misdemeanors that vary in the 48 states or not. 
    It came to the conclusion actually which is supportive of our position that you should not read felony to mean what felony meant at common law and that you should give it an interpretation consistent with the purpose of the 1937 amendment which is precisely the--
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="2570.948" stopTime="2578.583">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    If the act had been completed in the Jerome situation, could the government have prosecuted under subsection (b)?
speaker="rudolph_w_giuliani" startTime="2578.583" stopTime="2582.568">
    Mr. Rudolph W. Giuliani 
    --Yes, I believe so. 
    It would actually be a taking of the money.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="2582.568" stopTime="2595.593">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    Could the government in the case that we had last term in Williams have prosecuted for the check kiting scheme under this subsection?
speaker="rudolph_w_giuliani" startTime="2595.593" stopTime="2713.748">
    Mr. Rudolph W. Giuliani 
    If the scheme had actually been completed in the sense that check kiting you have the ambiguity as to whether or not the person intends to make good on the check in the period of time between the time that they write the check and the time that the check is actually finally negotiated. 
    If, in fact, the person goes through with the check kiting scheme and takes away the money then you really move out of the strict definition of check kiting and you have an actual theft of the money. 
    In looking at the language that was struck by the 1934 Act, the Petitioner ignores several crucial points, and I think makes more of that than the legislative history can sustain. 
    The 1934 Congress as I said before was concerned with a situation of robberies and limited the language to robberies. 
    It was not in any way, didn't evince any concern at all with the coverage of larceny as either being common law larceny or false pretenses so there was not a specific striking of the language because Congress was concerned with any of these distinctions as between common law larceny and false pretenses. 
    In 1937 the new language that was presented was significantly different. 
    It deleted the words Mr. Justice Stevens noted before it also deleted the words "without consent" which would have clearly defined solely common law larceny. 
    So the words that it used 
    "with intent to steal or purloin. " 
    in our view created or evinced a concern with a broad interpretation or at least as broad as the matter that they were concerned about, the assets of federally insured banks.

    Mr. Rudolph W. Giuliani 
    There is a formal procedure that exists if a person is prosecuted in one place and then there is the possibility of prosecuting him again because of the possible double jeopardy concerns involved in that. 
    But there is no formal process that takes place in making that decision in advance. 
    Most United States Attorneys have policies that they work out with District Attorneys as to what cases they will take and what cases would be turned over to the Department--

    Mr. Rudolph W. Giuliani

    In most urban areas the local prosecutor is anxious for the federal government to take as many of these cases as the federal government can take because of the tremendous burden on the administration of justice.

    --there is a sharing. 
    There is a kind of attempt to share the responsibility and to share the burden. 
    This would be one that would easily fall within a matter of federal interest. 
    The amount of money was $10,000. 
    It was not de minimis. 
    In some of the drug cases there are guidelines that are worked out so that it has to be either a conspiracy case or a case involving a certain amount of drugs for it to involve the federal government and in some of the embezzlement cases U.S. Attorneys have dollar figures that they use to try to delineate the difference between whether the federal government will take the case or the state government. 
    But by any standard that I know of a theft of $10,000 would certainly be enough for a United States Attorney to prosecute it anywhere.

    Well, if that were not the case, why it would apply to any bank and it would not make any difference how this case came out. 
    Whatever the reach of this statute it would reach any bank.
speaker="rudolph_w_giuliani" startTime="3035.772" stopTime="3087.516">
    Mr. Rudolph W. Giuliani 
    That is correct. 
    Your Honors, there are four principle reasons why we urge this Court to affirm the decision of the Fifth Circuit. 
    First of all the plain language of this statute clearly reaches this conduct. 
    Any ordinary person reading this statute would assume that this person's misconduct was covered by it, and there is no issue here of fair notice or in some way the Petitioner's being treated unfairly because he might have misunderstood what the statute meant. 
    Secondly, the legislative purpose evinced by the 1937 Congress clearly covers all forms of taking from a federally insured bank. 
    That is exactly what happened here and that interpretation, the government's interpretation is in line with that purpose. 
    Third--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="3087.516" stopTime="3110.928">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    May I interrupt right on that point? 
    The footnote your brief quotes, I guess it is a note which I have not read but points out that Chairman Sumners of the House Judiciary Committee in 1934 sought to limit the expansion of federal power just to those situations where there was not really a strong showing of need. 
    I am curious to know and perhaps I should not take your time, but was he still chairman of the committee in 1937?
speaker="rudolph_w_giuliani" startTime="3110.928" stopTime="3119.206">
    Mr. Rudolph W. Giuliani 
    --I believe he was. 
    I will check that but I believe he introduced the '37 legislation as well.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="3119.206" stopTime="3129.954">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    That is why it would seem to me... I wonder if he thought it was as expansive as the government's argument would make. 
    Is that consistent with the views he seemed to be espousing in '34? 
    Do you think maybe he changed his mind?
speaker="rudolph_w_giuliani" startTime="3129.954" stopTime="3156.770">
    Mr. Rudolph W. Giuliani 
    Well, I actually do not think you have to say that in '37 you need an expansive interpretation of the language of either the statute or the legislative history, just a common sense interpretation of it. 
    The plain meaning of the language clearly covers the misconduct and the '37 Congress was clearly intending to protect banks, federally insured banks, broadly against theft. 
    So I don't think--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="3156.770" stopTime="3158.143">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    And more broadly than '34?
speaker="rudolph_w_giuliani" startTime="3158.143" stopTime="3159.219">
    Mr. Rudolph W. Giuliani 
    --That is right.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="3159.219" stopTime="3165.923">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    The only example that was given, and am I correct, and it is the only example that was given was the larceny example?
speaker="rudolph_w_giuliani" startTime="3165.923" stopTime="3189.288">
    Mr. Rudolph W. Giuliani 
    It was an example that would have constituted if you use the common law distinctions of common law larceny. 
    However, Your Honor, Chairman Sumners never displayed any interest at all or any concern about whether larceny was defined as common law larceny or taking by false pretenses. 
    He was concerned about in '34 limiting it just to robbery.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="3189.288" stopTime="3189.834">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Right.
speaker="rudolph_w_giuliani" startTime="3189.834" stopTime="3277.456">
    Mr. Rudolph W. Giuliani 
    But in '34 or '37 there is absolutely no concern at all evidenced as to whether it should be common law larceny or larceny by false pretenses. 
    In summation, the views have now been... This question has been passed on by just about every Circuit. 
    I believe nine Circuits have either held or expressed their viewpoint on this, and the split for whatever it is worth is six to three for the government's view. 
    But also the most recent decision and I believe the best considered decision is the Hinton case which was decided after our brief in the Second Circuit and the Simmons case lay out the legislative history very clearly. 
    Finally, to reintroduce these distinctions would just create unnecessary, needless distinctions that have no purpose any longer. 
    It would become difficult to charge under this statute in the sense of bringing an indictment. 
    It would be difficult to charge a jury as to the distinction between possession and title. 
    It would also raise unnecessary issues on appeal that have nothing to do with the underlying equities of why theft or why protection of federally insured banks should be a federal crime. 
    For all those reasons and for the others that we mentioned in our brief, we ask this Court to affirm. 
    Thank you very much.

   Rebuttal of Roy W. Allman
speaker="roy_w_allman" startTime="3280.611" stopTime="3390.081">
    Mr. Roy W. Allman 
    May it please the Court. 
    Everything he said was true. 
    The government is arguing what the statute should say and maybe what the law should be, but I am arguing what the law is and what Congress intended the law to be specifically in the development of this law. 
    This law has been specifically expanded and amended and nowhere in all this time since 1934 has Congress taken upon itself to say it covers the crime of false pretenses. 
    It has added larceny and burglary. 
    The government used to argue in Jerome in 1943 it applied to common law larceny specifically. 
    There is no question about that but the definitions are not important. 
    What we have to decide here is the ambiguity of steal and purloin. 
    Is it expansive to the point where it covers crime by false pretenses and the answer is no. 
    Sumner specifically addressed that issue saying he wanted to confine the extension of federal power to those situations where the need to supplement state and local law enforcing agencies had become imperative. 
    It was an emergency-type statute to eliminate bank robberies. 
    It is the bank robbery statute, not the thing that is covered by state law and the statute has not run on a state law in this case with regard to the fact that a man did commit a crime by false pretenses. 
    That is my whole point in this case. 
    2113(b) is not an expansive statute. 
    It is a narrowly defined and specifically drawn federal statute that does not approach and control for that crime. 
    Thank you.
