    Mr. Roy Lucas 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this appeal from the Supreme Court of Virginia dates back three years and one day ago, when a team of Falls Church police arrived at the American Women's Clinic in that city. 
    Dr. Simopoulos, a gynecologist, was inside with his staff and numerous patients. 
    He practices there as well as in a Woodbridge office and at four hospitals in Northern Virginia where he has staff privileges as a board certified obstetrician/gynecologist. 
    The police seized the clinic, secured it. 
    They arrested Dr. Simopoulos, searched the premises, photographed the area, including the operating room, the laboratory, and the various pieces of equipment that he had there. 
    They in particular had a search warrant and seized the medical records of one young woman who has gone by initials during the course of this case, and I will continue to do so. 
    They also seized the sign-in sheet that had the names of all of the patients who were there on that particular day. 
    Dr. Simopoulos was--

    Mr. Roy Lucas 
    --These are basic background facts, Your Honor. 
    That is all. 
    I was getting to the charge now.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="79.163" stopTime="81.345">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    I fail to see what they have to do with the case.
speaker="roy_lucas" startTime="81.345" stopTime="261.382">
    Mr. Roy Lucas 
    They are just background about the fact that he was then arrested, he was then charged under the particular Virginia statute, the Virginia Code 18.2-71. 
    The statute defines as a felony any abortion "except as provided" in the other sections that are within the particular article. 
    The statute is in its language remarkably like the statutes from 1848, the first statute up through 1970, except the earlier statutes were included in one paragraph, whereas... and this was significant to the Virginia Supreme Court... the current statute is in several different statutory sections. 
    The indictment, which is set out in the jurisdictional statement, Pages 3 through 4, charged only the violation of the one statute, the 71 statute, which on its face declares all abortions illegal except as provided in the other statutory sections. 
    The indictment did negate two of the separate sections, the section pertaining to the length of pregnancy and that the indictment alleged, and it was not contested, that pregnancy was in the second trimester. 
    The indictment also negated the question of whether the abortion had been performed in a hospital or somewhere else. 
    The indictment did not negate, however, the 74-1 section on medical necessity. 
    The prosecution theory, as expressed in the indictment and in the various arguments, particularly the closing argument at 449 of the Joint Appendix, was that the Commonwealth had only to prove some act by the doctor with intent to cause an abortion, and that that constituted the sufficiency of the crime. 
    According to the prosecution theory, the crime was essentially complete when P.M. left Dr. Simopoulos's American Women's Clinic, provided that she later somewhere aborted, and provided that the prosecution was able to connect up the saline installation procedure with either the demise of the fetus or the abortion of the fetus. 
    There was a bench trial in this case rather than a jury trial, at which numerous arguments were made, of which three have remained in our presentation to the Court here. 
    In pretrial hearings that lasted about a day and a half, the defendant put on evidence to challenge the constitutionality of the statute and to challenge the arguments to challenge the defects in the indictment and the definition of the offense. 
    We called various expert witnesses to deal with the question of whether there was any health or other basis for the statute. 
    We had three gynecologists from Northern Virginia experienced with second trimester abortions, as well as one particular gynecologist who had conducted an extensive study on out-patient saline abortions.

    Your Honor, the clinic does not have a license as an out-patient hospital.

    Mr. Roy Lucas 
    As first... There are some out-patient abortion hospitals in the Commonwealth that are licensed to do first trimesters. 
    It is very unclear, and certainly--

speaker="roy_lucas" startTime="375.946" stopTime="392.937">
    Mr. Roy Lucas 
    He did not attempt to apply for that, and the state has never required him to. 
    The state has treated him as a physician's office where first trimester abortions might definitely be performed without question under Virginia law. 
    The state has never taken the position in any way that he was required to--
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="392.937" stopTime="401.204">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Well, what I am really getting to, are there... of the... I gather there are several clinics rather than hospitals, abortion clinics, are there not, in Virginia?

    Mr. Roy Lucas

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    All right. 
    And the record doesn't tell us how many, if any, of them have obtained certification?
speaker="roy_lucas" startTime="410.658" stopTime="449.584">
    Mr. Roy Lucas 
    There is no evidence that a facility performing second trimester abortions could even obtain certification. 
    There is no evidence in the record whatsoever of that. 
    The analysis of the different out-patient licensing regulations might even suggest that they are not applicable. 
    The Virginia Supreme Court at one point in its opinion interpreted the abortion law to require abortions at every stage to be inside the hospital. 
    That would seem to exclude any out-patient facility, because the out-patient facility by definition sends the patients home at the end of the surgical procedure in the afternoon.
speaker="lewis_f_powell_jr" startTime="449.584" stopTime="455.058">
    Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. 
    The out-patient surgical hospitals are described as hospitals under the Virginia regulations.
speaker="roy_lucas" startTime="455.058" stopTime="462.514">
    Mr. Roy Lucas 
    They are indeed, but they are prescribed as hospitals that are for day type surgery, where the patients do not stay overnight, and--

    Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr.

    Mr. Roy Lucas 
    --I don't believe I understood your question. 
    I think--
speaker="lewis_f_powell_jr" startTime="477.724" stopTime="494.554">
    Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. 
    Well, there is a category under the Virginia regulations of out-patient surgical hospitals, and I assumed that they were the places that under Virginia law second trimester abortions normally would be performed.
speaker="roy_lucas" startTime="494.554" stopTime="577.469">
    Mr. Roy Lucas 
    --There is absolutely nothing in the record or any of the health department reports or anything to support that. 
    I have no knowledge or basis in the record to think that a second trimester abortion has ever been performed in an out-patient surgical hospital, and that is something that was never even mentioned until this level. 
    The Virginia Supreme Court had no opportunity to interpret it, to even determine whether the out-patient surgical hospital question... I would anticipate that if we ever had an opportunity to respond to that issue raised at this point by the Virginia Attorney General, that we would be able to show that there are very few facilities licensed as out-patient surgical hospitals. 
    We would show that according to the Attorney General, they would not let Dr. Simopoulos obtain the type of license for second trimester abortions he had requested, because the Assistant Attorney General in the letter in the reply brief told him he would have to build a hospital. 
    And I would submit to the Court that as far as this record shows, the only places where second trimester abortions are done, certainly in Northern Virginia, are in the two hospitals, the Fairfax Hospital and the Alexandria Hospital. 
    That is out of well over 20 hospitals in the Northern Virginia area. 
    There are 95 in the state. 
    Which shows the sharp restrictive impact, certainly, of the statute. 
    And the--
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="577.469" stopTime="593.817">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    May I ask you, Mr. Lucas, one other question on the Virginia regulations, just to be sure I understand it correctly? 
    Part 3 deals with "hospitals" that are abortion clinics in which only first trimester abortions may be performed. 
    Am I correct in understanding that your client did not even have that kind of license?
speaker="roy_lucas" startTime="593.817" stopTime="794.120">
    Mr. Roy Lucas 
    --That is correct. 
    He was never required to apply for one. 
    I would presume that applies to non-physician owned type facilities. 
    This was a physician's office that happened to be extremely well equipped. 
    The Commonwealth never required him to apply for it, and since it would be a misdemeanor for him not to if it was required, presumably he was operating a perfectly lawful place. 
    The evidence certainly in the record about Dr. Simopoulos's clinic would show that he had all of the facilities that would have met the requirements of the first trimester abortion clinic if there had been any reason for him to apply for it. 
    Certainly the testimony of the expert witnesses, I believe three of them actually went and viewed his clinic before they testified in order to be able to compare the type of facility that he had with the type of facility that they utilized at the Fairfax Hospital, and each of them testified that he had far more extensive equipment. 
    He had the highest qualifications one could have, not only the training in GYN but the training in emergency medicine that he had, and he had the extra equipment that would be necessary that he preferred to have, equipment which was not at all present in the hospital context. 
    The requirement that abortions be done within the hospital stops at that point, and as the record in this case shows, the hospital simply used a standard treatment room with no special equipment in it whatsoever. 
    One of the documents submitted by the Commonwealth in their submissions, in the Virginia addendum at Page 80, is the American College of OB/GYN Technical Bulletin from 1976, which points out that saline installation abortions can safely be done in a standard treatment room, and I would submit that shows to us that the facility that he had was far... in far better condition. 
    It also points out the low mortality rate from the saline installation procedure, and that it could even be cut in half using the various advanced techniques which there was testimony that Dr. Simopoulos was utilizing. 
    And that goes strongly in favor of cutting against any health interests which the state has offered, and the state has only made that contention pertaining to the health interest. 
    The Commonwealth at the pretrial hearing submitted no evidence whatsoever. 
    They did not call a single expert witness in support of what burden they would have to show a health interest of the state. 
    They didn't call anyone. 
    They didn't call any witness of any kind. 
    And they simply did not make any attempt, and the Virginia Supreme Court in its opinion ruled what I believe is a clearly erroneous standard of review under the decisions from this Court that the burden entirely of showing the statute to be unconstitutional was on the defendant, on the physician. 
    The decisions of this Court have certainly indicated that, from Roe v. Wade onward, that the Commonwealth would have some burden of showing a maternal health interest, showing a compelling interest, showing that their regulations were narrowly tailored, that they were reasonably related to maternal health, and the Commonwealth in this case made no attempt whatsoever to meet that burden.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="794.120" stopTime="807.789">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Do you get any guidance from the cases in this Court about the constitutionality of requiring second trimester abortions to be performed in a hospital?
speaker="roy_lucas" startTime="807.789" stopTime="834.787">
    Mr. Roy Lucas 
    There have been mentions from time to time in the Court's opinion from Roe and onward. 
    Most of the mentions I have seen in the opinions have indicated in the second trimester regulations reasonably related to maternal health may be valid. 
    Roe used that terminology. 
    Roe indicated there were various types of reasonably related health regulations which the state might attempt to apply.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="834.787" stopTime="836.970">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    And one of them was what, a hospital requirement?
speaker="roy_lucas" startTime="836.970" stopTime="1049.148">
    Mr. Roy Lucas 
    Roe did refer to the possibility of a hospital requirement. 
    Roe did not squarely indicate that the hospital requirement would be considered valid. 
    At the time, as pointed out in the American Medical Association brief, there was very little evidence about the safety of second trimester hospital procedures. 
    Abortion had been illegal in this country. 
    There was no record, no evidence in that case. 
    And the issue was certainly never addressed by anyone, and it was considered to be, I would think, a guideline from the Court as one of the possible types of regulations, as opposed to a definitive holding, since the second trimester hospital requirement was not at issue. 
    Subsequently, in the Danforth case and the Colautti case, this Court has certainly carefully scrutinized the basis of restrictions and prohibitions in the second trimester abortion area. 
    In the Danforth case, where the Court had the question of an attempt by the state of Missouri to outlaw saline abortions, the Court carefully examined the basis for that attempted prohibition, and pointed out on the evidence in that case, as later in Colautti, that the saline installation technique was one of the primary techniques, if not the primary technique for that 15 percent or so of patients who find themselves in the second trimester, and that Danforth specifically pointed out that on that record at that time, the saline installation procedure had a lower mortality rate than that of childbirth, which was one of the important factors considered in the Danforth case. 
    Now, that was on a 1974 record. 
    There have been eight years of medical technology developments since that time, which would only enhance the position of the defendant in challenging the absence of any maternal health basis for the statute at present. 
    We argued in our first primary point with one of the criminal procedure questions, since the underlying statute need not be reached if the Point One or Point Two is persuasive to the Court. 
    The statute under which the doctor was charged criminalizes all abortions as construed by the Supreme Court of Virginia. 
    It would allow the indictment of any physician for performing any abortion. 
    The physician would then at least have to evoke and perhaps come forward with more in the way of proof that the abortion was justified under that particular subsequent statute. 
    This approach to the case, the Virginia Supreme Court did to avoid the other problems of United States v. Vuitch. 
    The United States v. Vuitch statute is so similar to the Virginia statute in many ways, except it is all incorporated into one paragraph. 
    The Virginia Supreme Court construed its statute as being different statutory sections, and therefore reaching a different result. 
    As it was construed, however, the Virginia Supreme Court then ran immediately into questions that did not deal with the question of are you violating the constitutional rights of a physician and a patient when you allow a physician to be indicted under a statute simply for performing an abortion. 
    If it is a first trimester abortion, it falls right in the language of that--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1049.148" stopTime="1055.851">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Why can your client complain about that aspect of the statute since I understand he was involved with a second trimester abortion?
speaker="roy_lucas" startTime="1055.851" stopTime="1064.657">
    Mr. Roy Lucas 
    --Well, he is primarily complaining about the second trimester. 
    I am just illustrating how the statute is construed. 
    The statute as construed would outlaw all second trimester abortions also.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1064.657" stopTime="1078.597">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Yes, but outside the field of free speech and so forth, haven't we adopted the position in that kind of a challenge that you can challenge the parts of the statute that apply to your conduct, but not parts of the statute that apply to other people's conduct?
speaker="roy_lucas" startTime="1078.597" stopTime="1090.956">
    Mr. Roy Lucas 
    We cited cases in our reply brief, such as Eisenstadt v. Baird, Broderick v. Oklahoma, which have applied the standing concept in a broader way when the right of privacy is concerned, and the Court has certainly--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1090.956" stopTime="1094.079">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    You think Broderick versus Oklahoma supports your position?
speaker="roy_lucas" startTime="1094.079" stopTime="1095.778">
    Mr. Roy Lucas 
    --On the standing question, yes.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1095.778" stopTime="1097.409">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    On the merits, do you think it supports it?
speaker="roy_lucas" startTime="1097.409" stopTime="1249.699">
    Mr. Roy Lucas 
    And on the merits, it is a First Amendment case, so I don't think it would be applicable. 
    We didn't examine it on the merits, but it does rely on Eisenstadt v. Baird, which was a criminal prosecution under the anti-contraceptive law, in which the Court gave broad standing to Mr. Baird to raise and assert the rights, and here you've got a situation of physicians treating patients at all kinds of different stages of pregnancy. 
    In this particular situation, you've got... you'll have physicians treating patients at 13 weeks, 15 weeks, 17 weeks, 19 weeks, treating patients by three or four different types of second trimester procedures, and the concepts of standing the Court has enunciated would certainly support the view that the physician should have standing to raise the interests of his entire range of second trimester practice and the entire range of patients, that he should not be confined to 22.0 weeks, and then there be another case in this Court three years later on 23.0 weeks or 19.0 weeks. 
    We have attempted to deal with that extensively in our brief. 
    Both the majority and the dissenting opinions in Singleton v. Wulff discuss standing questions involving access to abortion in a way which we have discussed in our brief and we believe is strongly supportive of allowing the doctor full standing to challenge the statute in its full scope. 
    The trial court did not make any findings whatsoever or address the question of this burden of production in the medical necessity question, and we would suggest to the Court that cases such as Sandstrom and Patterson v. New York would apply in a way which is helpful to the defendant in that when one looks at the facts of what actually happened in this case in the transcript, it is crystal clear that the prosecution made no attempt to disprove medical necessity. 
    It is crystal clear that the trial court never made any instruction to itself or to discuss with counsel or... in any way as to where that burden would lie. 
    The trial court completely disregarded the medical necessity question. 
    It is clear that under those circumstances, in a case such as Sandstrom and the other cases we have cited, that medical necessity would be not only a statutory defense, it would be a constitutional defense, and that if medical necessity--
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1249.699" stopTime="1260.956">
    Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    If it is a statutory defense, I presume that the trial court is thought to have considered it, and that the Supreme Court of Virginia would have considered it, if it thought it was a statutory defense.

    --Extensively, yes, and we cited Sandstrom also, and Patterson also, and we attempted to show that in this case, that because the burden of production on that question involves a constitutional defense, that in that limited area, which would apply in this case, in that limited area, that the burden of production and persuasion should be entirely on the Commonwealth. 
    Otherwise, the Commonwealth can come in and indict people for constitutionally protected conduct in this area, in the First Amendment area, or any other area, and that that is one of the biggest problems with the criminal procedure issues in the case, is that this is not a collateral issue like... as in Patterson, the emotional disturbance question. 
    This is something very central. 
    If the abortion was necessary for the patient's life or health, then the abortion was constitutionally protected, and the Commonwealth would have the obligation to allege that in the indictment and to come forward with proof on that particular question.

    --No, they didn't. 
    They addressed the question pretty thoroughly. 
    The Commonwealth has argued that he did not invoke it, but he invoked it very clearly and it is raised in the Joint Appendix, 194 through 197.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="1443.324" stopTime="1452.972">

speaker="roy_lucas" startTime="1452.972" stopTime="1476.396">
    Mr. Roy Lucas 
    There is no procedure under the Virginia criminal procedure for invoking a particular defense of this nature. 
    There is for insanity and alibi and things of that nature, but there is no special procedure. 
    The invocation in this case was done by counsel's argument concerning U.S. v. Vuitch and the argument that the Commonwealth had the burden of proving all of the elements of the crime, and that appears at 194 through 197 of the Joint Appendix.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="1476.396" stopTime="1484.230">

    Mr. Roy Lucas

    The arguments based on U.S. v. Vuitch, I think, clearly alerted the Commonwealth to the medical necessity question.

    Mr. Roy Lucas 
    Then there are other approaches to it. 
    If the burden is then on the... it depends on the question then of burden of production. 
    Is the burden of production entirely on the defendant? 
    In this particular case, we would contend that when you get to cases such as Sandstrom--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="1597.069" stopTime="1608.645">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Do you think the Virginia Supreme Court approached... construed the statute to indicate that the absence of medical necessity was an element of the crime?
speaker="roy_lucas" startTime="1608.645" stopTime="1619.672">
    Mr. Roy Lucas 
    --No, they did not. 
    They construed the statute so that there was only one element of a crime, namely, an abortion being done, that everything else was something that had to be invoked by the defendant.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="1619.672" stopTime="1630.439">
    Justice Byron R. White

speaker="roy_lucas" startTime="1630.439" stopTime="1642.787">
    Mr. Roy Lucas 
    Yes, accepting that construction of the Virginia statute then takes you immediately into the Roe v. Wade question of whether they can indict people for every abortion in the Commonwealth, and that is the central thrust of our first argument.

    Justice Byron R. White 
    I know, but suppose, though, it is recognized that medical necessity is a defense, it is not an element of the crime, but it is a defense, which... the Virginia Supreme Court seemed to recognize it as a defense.

   Argument of William G. Broaddus
speaker="william_g_broaddus" startTime="1742.304" stopTime="1869.304">
    Mr. William G. Broaddus 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, Virginia respectfully submits that this Court may, and indeed that this Court should affirm the judgment of the Supreme Court of Virginia based upon the law and the facts of this case. 
    Only by substantially enlarging the Roe v. Wade right and restricting the state's legitimate interest may the Court have a basis for reaching a contrary result. 
    Because the Virginia statute under attack in this case is drawn directly from the description in Roe of legitimate and permissible state regulation, we respectfully urge affirmance. 
    As Mr. Justice Rehnquist has indicated, there are some difficulties with respect to standing in this matter, and we respectfully urge the Court to focus only on those factual situations in which Dr. Simopoulos has a personal interest at stake, and not to permit him to assert hypothetical bases for invalidating or alleging the invalidity of Virginia statutes. 
    I believe that that is certainly consistent with this Court's opinions in Harris v. McPae and in the general line of cases. 
    Eisenstadt v. Baird would, we believe, not be on point in this particular situation, because that case involved a situation in which the defendant in a criminal trial was permitted to assert the rights of distributees of contraceptives. 
    Those persons who were receiving the product were not subject to criminal prosecution, and would not have a forum to assert their rights. 
    So, that took that particular situation out of the general standing proposition. 
    Turning to the major issue in this case, Virginia law imposes with respect to second trimester abortions only three conditions: first, that it be performed after the patient has given her informed written consent; second, that it be performed by a physician; and third, that it be performed in a hospital.

    Mr. William G. Broaddus 
    --Mr. Justice Brennan, that is set forth in the Commonwealth's addendum. 
    It involves filing an application which satisfies the requirements in that... that are specified by the State Board of Health. 
    Among other things, there has to be certain equipment present within the facility. 
    The doctor has to in writing define certain procedures which he will follow when he performs surgical operations. 
    There have to be certain arrangements for transporting the patient to a general acute care hospital in the event of complications which cannot be handled there in the hospital. 
    There have to be certain arrangements for anesthesiologists, certain arrangements for infection control, and things of this nature.

    Mr. William G. Broaddus 
    Yes, sir. 
    Now, with respect to the letter, as you observed, that letter was written after the facts, but I think it is also important to note that it was written in response to an inquiry about a certificate of need, which is an entirely different procedure from certification as an out-patient hospital, and also it was based upon the assumption, stated in that letter, that Dr. Simopoulos was simply operating a doctor's office, not a general surgical facility. 
    Now, six weeks after that letter was written, at trial, Dr. Simopoulos was asked the question as to whether he had applied for an out-patient hospital license, and at the time of the events, he had not, but he said at trial that he was then in the process of applying. 
    So certainly he knew at that time that it was possible.

speaker="william_g_broaddus" startTime="2101.227" stopTime="2126.945">
    Mr. William G. Broaddus 
    The Virginia abortion statute does not define hospital. 
    As you noted earlier in a question, that is defined elsewhere, and it includes out-patient surgical facilities. 
    So, the abortion requirement which requires hospitalization would be satisfied by performing the abortion in a general hospital, an acute care hospital, or in an out-patient surgical facility, which is also a hospital by definition under the code.

    We respectfully submit that for three reasons the state's interest today is just as compelling as it was in Roe v. Wade. 
    First, the mortality rates for abortion in second trimester is certainly at least equal to, if not greater than mortality rates for natural childbirth.

    Mr. William G. Broaddus 
    Based upon the Table 2 in Dr. Simopoulos's addendum and Table 20 in our addendum, I believe that an analysis of all of the abortions and natural childbirths over the same span of years would yield that result, that it is at least equal to, if not greater than.

speaker="william_g_broaddus" startTime="2246.803" stopTime="2278.783">
    Mr. William G. Broaddus 
    When one includes all abortions performed in the first trimester, then certainly the mortality rate will be lower, because that is 90 percent of all the abortions, and the mortality rate there is only one. 
    As one goes into the second trimester, there are certain procedures which may have lower mortality rates than natural childbirth, but considering all of the second trimester procedures together, the rate is at least equal to, if not greater than.

speaker="william_g_broaddus" startTime="2424.069" stopTime="2444.131">
    Mr. William G. Broaddus 
    Well, the basis would be in the code of Virginia, which provides that hospitals may be or would include out-patient hospitals under regulations authorized and promulgated by the State Board of Health, meeting certain specified requirements in the code. 
    That's the basis for it.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2444.131" stopTime="2451.988">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, did the statute require that hospitals be licensed?

    Mr. William G. Broaddus 
    Yes, sir.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2454.880" stopTime="2464.825">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Did it require that every second trimester abortion be performed in a licensed hospital?
speaker="william_g_broaddus" startTime="2464.825" stopTime="2507.294">
    Mr. William G. Broaddus 
    The criminal code of Virginia does. 
    Yes, sir. 
    Now, as one goes into procedures such as saline amniocentesis, which is the procedure that was used in this particular case, the mortality rate is substantially higher than the mortality rate for live birth, and as one considers the mortality rate for second trimester abortions in relation to the mortality rate for first trimester abortions, the mortality rate for second trimester abortions is much higher. 
    It is at least five times higher for even the safest second trimester procedure, and 17 times higher for the procedure which was utilized in this particular case.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="2507.294" stopTime="2529.276">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    When you say hospital, when you said hospital in response to that last question, that includes any clinic like the petitioner's, the appellant's clinic here if he had secured a license as an out-patient hospital.

    Justice Byron R. White 
    Perhaps I should ask my question another way. 
    Then I will leave you alone. 
    Could the board or whoever issues licenses, whoever issued these regulations, could... did they have the authority under the statute to permit second trimester abortions to be performed in a facility such as the doctor was running without a license?
speaker="william_g_broaddus" startTime="2569.584" stopTime="2571.604">
    Mr. William G. Broaddus 
    Not without a license.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2571.604" stopTime="2578.240">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    So it had no authority whatsoever to exempt him from the licensing requirement.
speaker="william_g_broaddus" startTime="2578.240" stopTime="2624.960">
    Mr. William G. Broaddus 
    That's correct, sir. 
    It did not. 
    Now, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists only this year changed its position from that which was referred to in Roe v. Wade, and they have suggested that there are certain limited procedures within a certain limited time in the early part of the second trimester of pregnancy which in their opinion may be safely performed outside of general acute care hospitals. 
    But they say that even those procedures should be performed in out-patient facilities meeting the requirements for surgical out-patient facilities as prescribed by the states, and that they should be licensed by the states. 
    Virginia law requires no more than that organization recommends.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="2624.960" stopTime="2628.002">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Are those standards in evidence in this appendix?
speaker="william_g_broaddus" startTime="2628.002" stopTime="2706.436">
    Mr. William G. Broaddus 
    They are referred to, Mr. Chief Justice, in the amicus brief filed by the American Medical Association and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists in the other two cases which the Court will hear this afternoon, and I believe the reference specifically would be on Page 23 and 24 of that brief. 
    Virginia would respectfully suggest that based on H.L. v. Matheson, it is not incumbent upon it to fine tune its statutes to facilitate abortions, but if fine tuning is necessary to accommodate any proven medical advances, which are not present in this particular case, but if that were the obligation imposed upon us, then certainly the legislature would be capable of making such changes. 
    In this particular situation, even Dr. Cates, who suggests that certain procedures could be safely performed outside of hospitals, acknowledges in an article printed on Page 101 of our addendum that other authorities, to use his term, recommend that all abortions in the second trimester be performed in hospitals.

    Mr. William G. Broaddus 
    There are requirements that the clinics and the hospitals be inspected annually to ensure that they continue to maintain the standards that they are required to keep. 
    Beyond that, unless it comes to the attention of a local prosecuting authority that there has been a violation of the law, then I don't know of an enforcement program as such designed for this particular procedure.

    What I am trying to say is that there are all kinds of surgical procedures--
speaker="william_g_broaddus" startTime="3112.319" stopTime="3113.040">
    Mr. William G. Broaddus 
    Yes, sir.
speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="3113.040" stopTime="3126.328">
    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    --minor and major, and would it be violative of Virginia law in any respect if a physician lanced a carbuncle on the back of a patient's neck in the office?
speaker="william_g_broaddus" startTime="3126.328" stopTime="3127.760">
    Mr. William G. Broaddus 
    No, sir.
speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="3127.760" stopTime="3130.441">
    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    And that is a surgical procedure.
speaker="william_g_broaddus" startTime="3130.441" stopTime="3165.574">
    Mr. William G. Broaddus 
    Yes, sir, I would agree. 
    Now, that brings up the medical necessity question. 
    The Virginia Supreme Court has authoritatively construed the Virginia statute, and it has decided, indeed, it decided in 1966 or '67 in the Russo case, which it states in its opinion, that the medical necessity issue is a matter for the defense to assert, and once the defense asserts it, then the burden is placed upon the Commonwealth to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that there was no medical necessity.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3165.574" stopTime="3167.437">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    What is involved in the assertion?
speaker="william_g_broaddus" startTime="3167.437" stopTime="3184.287">
    Mr. William G. Broaddus 
    That could be brought about either through the cross examination of witnesses for the prosecution, by the introduction of witnesses on his own behalf, or through any other means which brings it to the attention of the court and the prosecution.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3184.287" stopTime="3192.622">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    But it isn't necessarily fatal to the state's case on its side of the case if it puts on no evidence of necessity.
speaker="william_g_broaddus" startTime="3192.622" stopTime="3328.991">
    Mr. William G. Broaddus 
    That's correct, sir. 
    That's absolutely correct. 
    Now, in this particular case, counsel for Dr. Simopoulos argued that the indictment was effective because it did not affirmatively negate medical necessity, and that was the argument which I believe the Court will find if it examines the transcript. 
    I do not believe that the Court will find an argument that the Commonwealth was affirmatively under the constitutional obligation to prove in its case in chief that there was no medical necessity. 
    Dr. Simopoulos we do not believe invoked that defense at trial, and how could he? 
    He stated that the girl's condition was normal which he ascertained as a result of his examination of her. 
    He stated that she could carry the fetus to term. 
    He stated, and I quote, that 
    "The option of abortion was entirely up to her, and I had no business in influencing her one way or the other. " 
    He simply left the decision entirely up to her. 
    So, we submit that he has no standing to assert that issue at this time, but in any event, the Virginia Supreme Court has found that there was no medical necessity. 
    That finding is certainly supported by sufficient evidence in the record. 
    Also, the court's construction of the statute does not in any way implicate improperly presumptions or in key elements of a crime. 
    Such was the case in Mullaney or in Sandstrom. 
    The defense is never required to shoulder the burden of proof. 
    It simply has to invoke the defense. 
    I think that that will make this particular situation fall well within this Court's decision last term of Engle versus Isaacs, where the defense merely had to invoke the defense of self-defense. 
    The prosecution then had to affirmatively disprove it beyond a reasonable doubt, and the Court concluded that even in those circumstances, that did not mean that on its case in chief, the prosecution had to disprove that as an element of the offense.

    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Mr. Broaddus, may I ask you another question about history? 
    Because when I first read this statute, I understood it to require the procedure to be performed in a conventional hospital, and I have since learned that since 1977, at least, it is permissible to perform it in these other licensed facilities. 
    During the interval between the period when the statute was enacted in 1977 when the regulations were adopted, could the procedure have been performed in any facility other than a conventional hospital?
speaker="william_g_broaddus" startTime="3355.588" stopTime="3357.100">
    Mr. William G. Broaddus 
    Prior to '77, sir?
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="3357.100" stopTime="3362.624">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Yes. 
    In other words, I am just wondering what the legislature was thinking of when it enacted the statute.
speaker="william_g_broaddus" startTime="3362.624" stopTime="3376.212">
    Mr. William G. Broaddus 
    I think prior to '77, sir, it would have been possible to perform it legally only within a conventional general acute care hospital, because the state prior to that time did not have the licensing requirements for out-patient hospitals.

    Unknown Speaker 
    Thank you.
speaker="william_g_broaddus" startTime="3377.524" stopTime="3432.689">
    Mr. William G. Broaddus 
    On the issue of causation, which is mentioned in Dr. Simopoulos's brief, we shall touch upon that very quickly. 
    Again, the starting point is the doctor's own examination, in which he stated that her condition was normal, and that she could carry the fetus to term. 
    He then injected her with a saline solution for one purpose, to induce an abortion. 
    That was the only purpose. 
    His own witness testified that the procedure works at least 90 percent of the time, and an American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists Bulletin, which we have printed on Page 78 of our addendum, states the procedure is effective 97 percent of the time within 72 hours. 
    Between the time of the injection and the delivery, the girl had only peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, and pain pills prescribed by the doctor. 
    There was no other intervening cause which was likely to bring about an abortion. 
    Within the normal time--
speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="3432.689" stopTime="3438.432">
    Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
    Did he prescribe the peanut butter sandwiches? 
    It sounded as though that is what you said. 
    0 [Generallaughter.]
speaker="william_g_broaddus" startTime="3438.432" stopTime="3486.953">
    Mr. William G. Broaddus 
    --She told the doctor, Mr. Justice Blackmun, that she was going to go to a motel. 
    He said that was okay. 
    And when she went to the motel for the period of... prior to delivery, she carried with her that supply. 
    Within the normal time period within which the procedure is predicted to work, in fact, it did work. 
    She delivered her fetus just as Simopoulos had predicted, and just as he had intended. 
    So when the evidence is viewed in the light most favorable to the prosecution, as it must be, certainly it is sufficient to permit a rational trier of fact to find beyond a reasonable doubt that the crime was committed. 
    For the reasons which we have stated and the reasons in our brief, we respectfully ask this Court to affirm the judgment of the Supreme Court of Virginia.

    General, let me ask, suppose there is compliance by an out-patient clinic with the regulations and the law, and they get a license, and they are authorized to perform a second trimester abortion, and... do they keep the patient there until the abortion is... or would they have at that time?

    Mr. William G. Broaddus 
    The procedure, the surgical procedure has to be performed within the hospital. 
    Certain procedures can be performed, and that is the entire culmination of the process. 
    In this particular situation--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3527.261" stopTime="3529.532">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    It is because of the method that was employed--

    Mr. William G. Broaddus 
    Presumably so, sir, even in a general acute care hospital presumably that would have been the situation. 
    She would have been instructed to return at the appropriate time for the delivery of the fetus.

    Mr. William G. Broaddus 
    If I may answer the question, Mr. Justice Blackmun, that is a matter in dispute. 
    The doctor testified that he did instruct her--

    His nurse gave her a set of written instructions which do state that she should return. 
    The girl stated that he never instructed her to return, that she told him she was going to a motel. 
    He said that was okay, and she knew exactly what he meant by that, and that when she read the instructions after she left his office, she was confused because she had previously clearly understood that he knew that she was not coming to the hospital at any time.

   Rebuttal of Roy Lucas
speaker="roy_lucas" startTime="3624.765" stopTime="3727.341">
    Mr. Roy Lucas 
    If I may further reply to Justice Blackmun's question concerning whether she was told to return or not, under the Virginia Supreme Court interpretation of the statute, that might not make any difference, but on Page 187 of the Joint Appendix, she squarely admits that the doctor told her to go to the hospital if she had severe cramps. 
    She never threw away the instruction sheets, which were clear, and his two phone numbers 24-hour-a-day were circled in there. 
    This question about ambulatory surgical centers is extremely important, I think, to this particular case, and it is unfortunate there was no opportunity to respond to it in the lower courts or in the trial or to put on a full exposition of it. 
    Looking at the regulations, the Part 3 regulations on out-patient hospitals actually require more extensive extra technology than do the Part 2 on out-patient surgical hospitals. 
    In construing those regulations and reading them as to what do they contemplate, there is no indication whatsoever that the out-patient surgical hospital scheme contemplates second trimester abortions. 
    There is no evidence that a second trimester abortion has ever been done in an out-patient surgical hospital. 
    The Commonwealth named four facilities. 
    The Virginia Heart Institute certainly does no second trimester abortions. 
    The Hampton General Out-Patient Emergency Center certainly does none. 
    The Fairfax Surgery Center is in the community involved here, and was never named by any witness as permitting second trimester abortions. 
    And there is another one in Norfolk, Virginia, that I know nothing about, except it is not in the list of second trimester abortions offered by the Commonwealth in its exhibits. 
    They list no out-patient surgical facility that ever performed a second trimester abortion. 
    Thank you.
