Davis v. North Carolina

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Number 815, Elmer Davis, Jr., Petitioner, versus North Carolina.

    Mr. Charles V. Bell 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    In this case Elmer Davis, the petitioner, contends that his petition for writ of the habeas corpus should be granted. 
    This case has been in the litigation for nearly seven years and Elmer Davis, a 35, now 35, I believe he was about 29 when this case started, is in the state present at Riley on death row. 
    We say we are -- I believe the state would even admit this that this case stands or falls with this confession. 
    What I mean by that? 
    That the only evidence that could possibly could link Davis with this murder is the confession, that's the only thing in this case. 
    Now if you have notice on the record page 110, that he was arrested by the Charlotte police on September the 21, 1959. 
    They went over there and arrested him. 
    They brought him back to Charlotte and in his presence they made out that arrest sheet. 
    Don't let him use the telephone, don't let him call anybody, and hold for Hucks and Fesperman RE - Foy Bell Cooper, that's the remedy. 
    So he was arrested right there in Belmont in the police station.

    Mr. Charles V. Bell 
    Well what we contend in this case that the Charlotte Police Department went to Belmont and the record where arrest sheet solely indicates it and arrested him in Belmont, North Carolina which is another county and brought him back into Gaston for the crime or killing and murdering the white lady, Mrs. Foy Bell Cooper. 
    Then -- and we say that this -- the arrest sheet and be -- our points in this case that he was denied, one, he was denied counsel and number two that all of the facts and circumstances point unerringly that this is of course confession that it wasn't voluntarily given by Davis. 
    And if you -- the careful perusal of the fact presented by this record in this case would indicate that it was coerced that they used force and that would -- it was involuntarily obtained. 
    It's admitted Davis is an illiterate man who couldn't read and write. 
    When they brought him back to Charlotte and still no place I mean placing him in the county jail, they put him in the police lockup. 
    He was held in solitary confinement and held incommunicado for 16 days.

    Captain McCall testified that he put his entire force of 29 men to investigate this case.

    Mr. Charles V. Bell 
    Davis contends that this dispute of -- Mr. Chief Justice that he contends that he was interrogated around the clock. 
    But they -- they don't -- they dispute that. 
    They say they only talked to him maybe seven or eight times. 
    And they contend that they didn't talk to him about his crimes that they were trying to breakdown some alibis and that in itself trying to breakdown some alibis, that in itself would show to the Court that they were continuously questioning him about this crime. 
    They took him to Canton in North Carolina and it's in the record. 
    Captain McCall testified that he agreed with the other police to take him to a Canton in North Carolina breaking down the alibis and made and forced, took him out of the jail with leg cuffs and handcuffs. 
    And after they've got to Canton, he was handcuffed with that -- to another officer walked 19 miles down the railroad right away for 19 -- that's what their -- Mr. Fesperman said. 
    That is 19 miles from Canton to Asheville, but from one of the outskirts to the other Canton and Asheville would only take up about 14 miles. 
    But I think this Court could have judicial notice that that's punishment, that's cruel and barbarous punishment.

    They -- when they brought Elmer they -- goes back from Gaston County into Mecklenburg. 
    Captain McCall had already divulged the plaintiff by which he would make this man confess. 
    He knew that he couldn't get a bill of indictment that he would have to be released and so he -- this was a planned thing. 
    This was a means of punishing Davis breaking down his spirit and cause him to confess.

    Now this was the testimony that was elicited from Captain McCall and cross-examination. 
    He is the man who is in-charged of this whole investigation and here's what he says. 
    “I don't know if it's impossible that I could have ordered this boy to be held without privilege of communicating with his parents.” 
    Now, he's the man in-charge. 
    He's the man who directs his officers what to do. 
    His friends and relatives are held without privilege of using the telephone or without privilege of talking to anybody. 
    And may it please the Court I think the word “anybody” to mean lawyers, relatives, friends, or anybody who -- or everybody he might possibly contact to give him some type of assistance. 
    I don't know whether I told the jury or not that I did not do this. 
    Yes, I care. 
    No, I did not want him to talk to anybody.

   Argument of James F. Bullock
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1900.090" stopTime="1905.853">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Bullock.
speaker="james_f_bullock" startTime="1905.853" stopTime="2218.419">
    Mr. James F. Bullock 
    Mr. Chief Justice, Associate Justices. 
    Mr. Bell was been with this case all the way through and I got in on the very end of it, several members of our office having handled it previously. 
    The question before this Court is not a new question. 
    However the ascertainment of the answer by placing all the facts of this case within the applicable law was enunciated by this Court, it's difficult as always, we realized that. 
    If I may add a personal note, the case is difficult for me there are two reasons. 
    First, I do not approve of capital punishment. 
    Second, it's the first case I have ever appeared in which the death sentence had been imposed and I was on this side of defense that I -- I've always been a defense counsel previously. 
    Now, the State of North Carolina and the Attorney General's Office is not vindictive, not blood thirsty. 
    It has been our practice as Mr. Bell well knows during the years that I have been there that we concede error very frequently in criminal cases in both the State and the federal courts when there's been violation of due process or error of law. 
    Yet, I have a duty to the public of North Carolina and I have a profound respect for the law and we feel that when all of the circumstances of this case have been considered, that the decisions of the lower courts will be affirmed finding that there had not -- had not been a violation of due process. 
    Mr. Bell in response to your question, we did some of the history of this case. 
    It has been a long case. 
    It's been in litigation ever since 1959. 
    The voluntariness of the confession was considered by the trial judge in the Superior Court and resolved against the defendant. 
    The North Carolina Supreme Court resolved a question against the defendant. 
    This Court denied certiorari. 
    It was Judge Butler the first time in the District Court in that circumstance, I was not within, found the facts against the defendant. 
    It went to the Fourth Circuit and they felt that a plenary hearing should be held and a plenary was held in the United States District Court of the eastern district which was a trial de novo. 
    In fact, every witness involved so far as this confession is concerned in material was heard by the District Court plus additional three witnesses who were not heard in the Superior Court. 
    And I might say that the State allowed Mr. Bell to lead his client and his witnesses anyway they wanted to go because we had no hesitation in letting the full facts come out in that court. 
    Now, we had not planned to argue the facts of this case in detail because we think that the findings of the District Court, the findings of the Fourth Circuit sufficiently deal with the facts and then prior to law thereto and it would be somewhat of a wasted time for us to review them again here. 
    I would like to respond to what Mr. Bell said he felt had happened that this was a planned thing from the beginning when the police first took Davis into custody. 
    It must be remembered that he was taken into custody in Belmont the night or the day after the murder and I see no way that the police could have planned anything against Davis because they didn't know who had committed the murder. 
    Now, on Davis' person when he was arrested was a pocketbook, identification cards from Bishel Hayes whom he had robbed the day of the murder within a few yards of the cemetery where the murder occurred. 
    Now that is why the Charlotte police went to Belmont and brought him back. 
    The Belmont police contacted the Charlotte police as they always do when they pick up an escaped convict and let them know he has been apprehended. 
    In addition to that he had on this person various other articles which he had stolen. 
    He had broken into homes and stolen ladies pants. 
    He had stolen these items off on clotheslines on his trip down from the mountains coming in to Charlotte. 
    He would --

    I don't believe he ever said the exact day. 
    It shows that he – it indicates that it was several days prior to his apprehension and the murder in Charlotte because he had come down by train and he said by bus and other means from up in the mountains. 
    And this route from Campton to Ashville is where he told the police very freely, he admitted this in the Superior Court, admitted it in the District Court that he had broken into these homes. 
    That he had committed this robbery although he said it was on Saturday instead of Sunday the day of murder. 
    He pretty admitted all of these. 
    He said he had always freely omitted his crimes. 
    The statement is in the record which he had committed, but the Charlotte police had ample reason to investigate this suspect, this escaped convict of all these other crimes and a crime which was committed in Charlotte, a robbery of a -- from the person there.

    Mr. James F. Bullock 
    Yes, Your Honor not on my explanation, but the record does not indicate when that notation was put on there that you will note from the reading of the record that the arresting officers or the least the ones who went to Belmont and brought him back, said they said they did not put that on there. 
    They had never had any knowledge on this until the time of the trial. 
    The two officers who were assigned to the Cooper case to investigate the Cooper case said they never put it on there because they were not the arresting officers of course. 
    They had no occasion to -- they had no knowledge of this notation until the time of the trial in the Superior Court. 
    Now, Captain McCall testified that he may have had it put on there sometime, but apparently it was sometime after he was put in jail and not the day of this -- original ‘arrest sheet' was made out.

speaker="james_f_bullock" startTime="2526.840" stopTime="2588.281">
    Mr. James F. Bullock 
    Yes sir. 
    The -- the notation -- we can't deny the fact that the notation raises serious questions. 
    However, all of the evidence that the Superior Court and the District Court indicates that this notation was completely disregarded by all of the police officers, in fact, they had no knowledge of it other than Captain McCall who said he may have had to put on there -- it would be explanation concerning to being a C grade prisoner. 
    Now, the reason -- the evidence shows that it was disregarded immediately after David was put into jail, I believe the next day the record indicates, he requested the jailer, I believe, to contact his sister by telephone. 
    They looked in the directory and could not find her address. 
    It must be remembered that his sister had not seen Davis for 10 to 15 years, she testified. 
    So apparently, he did not know exactly who she was so they were having some difficulty in locating in the directory. 
    But Mr. Hucks --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2588.281" stopTime="2589.665">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Does she live in the city?
speaker="james_f_bullock" startTime="2589.665" stopTime="2646.788">
    Mr. James F. Bullock 
    She lives in Charlotte yes sir, near the cemetery where this murder occurred. 
    In fact Davis' home was near the cemetery where this murder occurred and I believe it was in evidence that one of his parents has killed the other parent while Davis was a youngster. 
    And the police knew him and his background for that reason for more investigation with that and his other crimes. 
    But Mr. Hucks, a detective, when Davis says time after time, he treated him very nice that he was assigned to the case never mistreated him in any form of fashion. 
    Mr. Hucks went out and made a search and found the sister and told him that Davis wanted to see her. 
    And she said, I think she had seven or ten kids, something like, who were sick. 
    She said she couldn't come then because of the children.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2646.788" stopTime="2649.247">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. -- when the fact that he did that?
speaker="james_f_bullock" startTime="2649.247" stopTime="2651.946">
    Mr. James F. Bullock 
    That was a day or two after Davis had been arrested.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2651.946" stopTime="2652.836">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    After the arrest.
speaker="james_f_bullock" startTime="2652.836" stopTime="2738.640">
    Mr. James F. Bullock 
    Yes sir and after he was brought back to Belmont. 
    And then a few days later Mr. Porter asked Davis whether there was any one he wanted to contact and he mentioned that his sister had not come and he wanted to see her. 
    He started to located the sister and found that Mr. Hucks had already had and did not proceed any further. 
    But Mr. Hucks and Mr. Garner who lived next door to the Davis home -- old Davis home out there went over and talked to the sister a second time and she still did not come. 
    Now, all the officers say that she'd never once came to the City Jail to see Davis. 
    She said that she did go over to the County Jail to see him at one time, but it's significant that she didn't even bother to go to his trial. 
    It is further significant that neither Mr. Bell nor Mr. Avins or her attorneys nor the sister nor Davis considered this testimony germane enough to have at the trial or at any time until four years later at the plenary hearing in the District Court. 
    And we just think that the police testimony on all of these circumstances as the District Court believed and the Circuit Court believed, was more worthy than I believe than the sister's.

    Mr. James F. Bullock 
    The only explanation we have as what Captain McCall himself testified to there that he was doing that in order to -- or get -- that was the instruction he had received from the prison department. 
    When they -- he called about having him and asked permission to keep him up there. 
    And that -- that was a preference. 
    But apparently none of the police officers had been instructed by Captain McCall to argue anything about this notation. 
    Now, we say that all the evidence clearly indicates that we -- we can't deny it was there and the fact if it had been carried out and the purpose of it was to hold him this way, the police would have been silly to kept this ‘arrest sheet' there for the attorneys to see. 
    They could easily destroyed it and fix that one. But they say there never was any denial that Davis seen anyone he wants -- he only requested to see one person and that was his sister. 
    They made two attempts, three counting the telephone trying to find -- to find her and she would not come.

    Mr. James F. Bullock 
    Yes sir I will. 
    This was I believe about two weeks perhaps after he had -- his arrest. 
    Detective Hucks who was assigned, chief detective assigned to this took Davis to his home that morning for breakfast and fed him a hot breakfast and then they went out to Canton by an automobile. 
    Now, they kept leg chains on him in the car, but they took the leg chains off of him for the walk and the officer handcuffed Davis to his wrist. 
    And they walked side by side for the 14 miles he testified from outskirts to outskirts approximately 14 miles along this way trying to identify the homes into which Davis had broken to secure these items which he had in his possession at the time of his arrest. 
    He wanted -- he was willing to go, the record indicates that. 
    Now he wanted to clear up this aspect of it and he was willing to go.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Would you please tell us why they didn't mention the murder to him for over two weeks after he was in custody while they were interrogating him all the time?
speaker="james_f_bullock" startTime="3319.102" stopTime="3330.266">
    Mr. James F. Bullock 
    The officers testified that they were investigating his backgrounds and these other crimes which he had told them about. 
    He had told them of several crimes which he had committed since his escape.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3330.266" stopTime="3333.885">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    They were more interested in that than they were to murder do you mean?
speaker="james_f_bullock" startTime="3333.885" stopTime="3380.030">
    Mr. James F. Bullock 
    Well, I -- what I understood from their testimony was the fact that if in investigating these they could place Davis away from Charlotte. 
    He would be exonerated of the crime in Charlotte. 
    If as he later testified he was some place else breaking into homes, committing another crime, and certainly it was to his interest that the Charlotte police investigate these matters and attempt to find out what had occurred and that was the explanation. 
    In fact, they were still investigating the Cooper murder and beside that they had not been able to tie in with Davis in any respect until they asked him about it and on October the 3rd, again on the 5th, and then on the 6th when a confession occurred.

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    When did he later say he later say -- he -- what was his alibi? 
    You said alibi? 
    Why did he later the claim he was at the time the murder occurred?
speaker="james_f_bullock" startTime="3388.613" stopTime="3404.730">
    Mr. James F. Bullock 
    He claimed that he was in Belmont at his auntie's home. 
    But the auntie didn't appear at the trial and testified that he was up there. 
    I'd like to say one word about Nathaniel Cross.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3404.730" stopTime="3405.573">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    About what?
speaker="james_f_bullock" startTime="3405.573" stopTime="3525.935">
    Mr. James F. Bullock 
    Mr. Dr. Nathaniel Cross, a colored pastor who testified at a District Court. 
    They called him Uncle Tom. 
    I have never seen a more dignified gentleman in my life than Dr. Cross. 
    He's a -- has a doctor's degree in religion. 
    He's editor of the newspaper, radio commentator, highly educated, very rounded person and has fought, for many years, for the rights of the underprivileged people particularly their constitutional rights as the record would show in Charlotte and surrounding areas. 
    He testified to this fact. 
    Now, why did he come to see Davis? Because Davis was standing and Davis himself was former member of his church in Belmont, he knew him and when he finally made the connection by reading the newspapers that this was the Davis that had been in his church or his family, he went down to visit him and went in and had an hours of conference with him at which time Davis admitted to him that he'd been well treated, no mistreatment by the police officers that he signed a confession voluntarily. 
    It's all in the record. 
    Now, we don't like to talk about people whose character is known but Davis here, I have a summary that I think this points it out, 29 years old, low average intelligence according to the District Court, frankly he made an outstanding appearance in the District Court on the witness stand. 
    He was very calm and he's not half as nervous as I am here today, but -- and gave very intelligent answers. 
    Now --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3525.935" stopTime="3526.920">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    This Davis?
speaker="james_f_bullock" startTime="3526.920" stopTime="3527.555">
    Mr. James F. Bullock 
    This is Davis.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3527.555" stopTime="3528.488">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    In the federal district court.
speaker="james_f_bullock" startTime="3528.488" stopTime="3530.984">
    Mr. James F. Bullock 
    In the federal district court. 
    It's the only time I had ever seen him --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3530.984" stopTime="3532.883">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Yes.
speaker="james_f_bullock" startTime="3532.883" stopTime="3640.064">
    Mr. James F. Bullock 
    Made a very favorable impression on me as a witness. 
    This is the first time I was connected with the case. 
    I went back then and got the record in the Superior Court which this Court had the written -- that same record that appeared certiorari, not once in 41 pages of testimony in the Superior Court did Davis say anything about any mistreatment, not once. 
    But when you get into the District Court four years later, that's his theme song, police beating and brutality relay after relay of questioning late in to night, all night long. 
    He is a phenomenon. 
    He has total recall of details four years later. 
    He has every component that this Court has said was a violation of the constitutional rights four years later, but they don't have at the original trial, they don't mention them. 
    He's a liar by his own omission in the District Court by identifying an officer whom he claimed, said he was going framed -- framed, something to that effect. 
    In the District Court he identified three different persons and then finally ended up by saying that he had lied about Detective Sykes in the Superior Court and you will find inconsistency after inconsistency between the two records, his testimony which to me is nothing more than his testimony in the District Court as complete publication, a good story dreamed up, fixed up, to get a reversal, to save himself from this penalty which has been imposed upon him.

    Of course we do find some discrepancies in the prosecution's case too, don't we?

    Mr. James F. Bullock 
    Yes, I --

    Which is the records here and the handwriting of the Captain of police which says do not allow this man to see anyone, do not allow him to telephone and that is -- he explained the way has been of no consequence.

    Mr. James F. Bullock 
    We do not deny the fact that it was there but we -- we do say that all of the evidence -- a great deal of evidence indicates that that was completely disregarded so far as this prisoner was concerned.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3677.251" stopTime="3680.305">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Yes, I know. 
    I say that they -- they have to contradict their --

    Mr. James F. Bullock 
    Yes, yes it would.

    -- their own handwriting in their own record in order to say that, do they not?

    Mr. James F. Bullock 
    Yes, they do.

    Would you mind telling us how they denied -- that the -- the officers admit interrogating him?
speaker="james_f_bullock" startTime="3694.311" stopTime="3703.084">
    Mr. James F. Bullock 
    I don't believe there's any omission that they ever interrogated him at night. 
    At that time the detectives only worked until 11 o'clock at night.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3703.084" stopTime="3709.593">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well, I thought there was something in the record to the effect that they never -- they never interrogated him after 11 o'clock.'
speaker="james_f_bullock" startTime="3709.593" stopTime="3733.745">
    Mr. James F. Bullock 
    I -- I check back on it. 
    I thought I had -- I believe I mentioned that in my brief that they had not interrogate him after 11 o'clock in any event but I went back to the record later and I never could find any testimony that he was interrogated at night by the police officers. 
    The latest that I could find was late in the afternoon four, or five, six, seven o'clock, something to that nature. 
    What time is it?
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3733.745" stopTime="3737.539">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    What's the word fram mean in the North Carolina fram?
speaker="james_f_bullock" startTime="3737.539" stopTime="3748.902">
    Mr. James F. Bullock 
    I assume that he was talking about the beating among friend, he beat you, I think that's what he's having reference to. 
    I couldn't what word is that whether he was framed or fram or what but --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3748.902" stopTime="3749.124">

    I wonder.
speaker="james_f_bullock" startTime="3749.124" stopTime="3760.132">

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    If -- if you had another statement to make in this brief you may make it Mr. Bullock.
speaker="james_f_bullock" startTime="3770.121" stopTime="3778.397">
    Mr. James F. Bullock 
    I don't believe that we have any other points to make at this time unless the Court has some questions.
