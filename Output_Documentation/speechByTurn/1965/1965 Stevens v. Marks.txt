    Yes and with the 290, James T. Stevens, Petitioner, versus John J. McCloskey, Sheriff of New York City. 
    Mr. Schofield, you may proceed with your argument.
speaker="john_p_schofield" startTime="36.645" stopTime="141.502">
    Mr. John P. Schofield 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    Petitioner, James T. Stevens, was a lieutenant with the New York City Police Department prior to a summary discharge on July 15th, 1964 asserting his constitutional privilege. 
    Stevens had been a member of that department for 18 years and only needed two more years for retirement. 
    On a morning of June 26, Stevens together with other police officers with summons in the police headquarters and at an office of the deputy chief inspector, they were all handed forthwith subpoenas to appear before the New York County grand jury standing there or sitting some three blocks away. 
    A superior officer was assigned to accompany these men to that grand jury. 
    When they arrived there at, they were met by an assistant district attorney who told them, he wished their testimony in the grand jury. 
    However, he told them before they would be permitted to enter that grand jury they must sign a waiver of immunity. 
    He stated this was a requirement that the state constitution and the city charter required of each of these men if they wished to stay on the police force. 
    He reminded them that on a day pervious, ten police officers were summarily dismissed for failure to sign up a waiver. 
    He also told them at that time, they had a constitutional privilege not to incriminate themselves. 
    However, Stevens saw fit to sign that waiver of immunity on the advice of the Assistant District Attorney without having any private counsel to advise him. 
    Stevens went into that grand jury --
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="141.502" stopTime="143.588">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    He -- did he ask for a (Inaudible)
speaker="john_p_schofield" startTime="143.588" stopTime="506.865">
    Mr. John P. Schofield 
    No, Stevens didn't but several other police officers had. 
    But Stevens made no mention of requiring a lawyer or ask him for one at that time outside that grand jury. 
    However, when Stevens went into the grand jury, the Assistant District Attorney who had him sign that waiver outside, now for the first time told Stevens that he was not there as a witness but perhaps as a potential defendant. 
    He then had Stevens identify himself and state that he had signed this waiver outside and he understood the conditions. 
    Stevens gave his name, rank, command, home address and then was told by the Assistant District Attorney that he had a financial questionnaire, and he gave it to him and he told him he would be called at a later date before that grand jury. 
    Stevens was dismissed from that grand jury and it's our contention, he gave no relevant testimonies such there's no question as to what statements were given there except his name, command, etcetera. 
    Stevens was -- on July 15th, called back again before the New York County grand jury. 
    However this time, it was a new grand jury that had been specially impaneled to look into the crimes of bribery and corruption within the police department and the Assistant District Attorney told him in my presence, this time he's represented by a counsel that they required Stevens to sign a new waiver of immunity. 
    Stevens went into the grand jury and then in there, informed the Assistant District Attorney that he did not wish to sign this new waiver of immunity, as a matter of fact, wished to recall the one that was signed on June 26th. 
    The Assistant District Attorney admonished Stevens by telling that it was a requirement that he must sign this waiver or he would be summarily dismissed from his employment. 
    After having told them this, he told them that he had a constitutional right to exert -- assert his privilege and he could at any time invoke this privilege. 
    Stevens of course stated these -- stood on his constitutional rights. 
    He was dismissed from that grand jury. 
    However, one week later, the petitioner Stevens was called back before the New York County grand jury, this time, before the original grand jury where he had signed the limited waiver. 
    The Assistant District Attorney brought him into the grand jury, asked him questions and each question was responded by Stevens that in fact that he stood on its constitutional rights not to incriminate himself. 
    Whereupon, after refusing to answer any questions, he was brought up before a New York County Supreme Court judge. 
    He was commanded by that Supreme Court judge to go down and answer the questions on the grounds that he had been given immunity. 
    At this point, the Assistant District Attorney stood up and told the judge sitting there that Stevens does not have immunity but it was the people's contention that he had signed a good and valid waiver and they wished him to speak under this waiver. 
    The Supreme Court judge, Charles Marks, which is Number 210 before this Court, told Stevens to go back and answer the questions when he read them and he specifically asked him the same question at the District Court Attorney asked him in that grand jury and that question is this, whether or not Stevens in the five year -- last five years had accepted any moneys from bookmakers or policy operators to allow them to operate violation of the penal law of the State of New York. 
    Stevens refused to answer on the grounds that might incriminate him, whereupon, Stevens was summarily found guilty of criminal contempt. 
    Counsel at that time asked -- say at that time so they can submit written memorandum and for oral argument. 
    Judge Marks consented, however, on the oral argument which counsel pointed out that Stevens was not represented by counsel that the waiver was not a good and valid waiver since Stevens, as far as we are concerned was coerced into signing that waiver. 
    And third, the fact that only a month before this Court in a Malloy versus Hogan decision has stated that the Fifth Amendment was now applicable upon the states as Stevens like any other citizen could take the Fifth Amendment. 
    However, Judge Marks fines Stevens some $250 and sentenced him to 30 days in jail. 
    He did get counsel time to apply for the Appellate Division which was in summer recess because this happened in July to stay the execution. 
    Counsel made application for the presiding judge of the Appellate Division for refuse to stay at this sentence until the fall term on -- the Appellate Division would come back on th ebench. 
    As a result, Stevens went to jail for the first time with criminal contempt served -- and while serving by the way, for the first 30 days, counsel made application in the Federal District Court for writ of habeas corpus. 
    That court denied the writ based on the fact that Stevens had not exhausted his state remedies. 
    Therefore, Stevens finished serving his first term of contempt. 
    Soon after coming out of civil jail and paying the $250 fine, Stevens was again subpoenaed before the New York County grand jury once again with the same grand jury where he had signed his coerced waiver. 
    Once again --

    -- dismissal provision?
speaker="john_p_schofield" startTime="513.355" stopTime="602.145">
    Mr. John P. Schofield 
    Not only a dismissal provision which was coerced. 
    That's exactly right. 
    The fact that the pressure was on this man that I don't believe was a free and voluntary act of this party that it served 18 years, leaving two years for retirement which faced with a public scandal, had seen what was happening in the newspapers up there to his family, his wife, etcetera. 
    He felt that he should sign it. 
    I'm sure that was the pressure. 
    I'm sure any public official faced with this decision whether to give up the years of service after having done, I think almost five years in military service knowing this to be his only job, he signed it. 
    I don't think it was a free and voluntary act. 
    It is our contention that it was coerced. 
    Of course -- now, he's back before that same grand jury, he is asked by that same Assistant District Attorney the same question whether or not for the last five years, he had received any money from bookmakers or policy operators. 
    Once again, standing on his constitutional rights, he refused to answer that question. 
    Once again, he was brought up again before the New York Supreme Court judge. 
    This time, it was Judge Weiser. 
    Judge Weiser commanded him to answer. 
    He refused. 
    Judge Weiser then and there found him guilty of criminal contempt and sentenced to begin 30 days in jail, order him in turn -- 30 days in jail, fine of $250 or the alternative to do another 30 days in jail. 
    While --

    Alternatively.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="604.456" stopTime="605.911">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    He didn't give him 30 days.
speaker="john_p_schofield" startTime="605.911" stopTime="611.764">
    Mr. John P. Schofield 
    He gave him 30 days in jail, a fine of $250. 
    If he failed to pay the 250, he would do another 30 days in jail.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="611.764" stopTime="613.885">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Oh, that would make 60 instead of --
speaker="john_p_schofield" startTime="613.885" stopTime="923.127">
    Mr. John P. Schofield 
    That would make 60 if he didn't pay the money, that's correct Your Honor. 
    As a result, before this mandate was now signed by Judge Weiser, counsel under Titles 28 -- U.S. Code 1443, removed the proceedings from the state court into the federal court claiming that Stevens' constitutional rights will be violated by the state court and an application of course was brought by the state to bring the case back into the state and that federal judge then and there from the bench decided that we came too late. 
    He said, the man is already sentenced, I do not have jurisdiction as a result of which, Stevens case was transferred back from the federal court to the state court. 
    Stevens started serving his second 30-day sentence. 
    While in jail for the second time, the Appellate Division came down and denied the application of count -- rather denied, made decision in which they relied on the Regan cases controlling and stated in that decision that they were not entering into the Malloy or the Escobedo case as far as the constitutionality of the questions posed by counsel. 
    Stevens finished serving his second 30-day term in civil jail, paid his $250 fine and when released, found himself again subpoenaed before the same grand jury now for the third time, met again by that same Assistant District Attorney, again asked the same question, again brought up before the New York Supreme Court judge, commanded again to answer that question. 
    Once again relying on his rights was then and there sentenced now for the third time, to a civil jail for 30 days, fined $250 or the alternative, another 30 days. 
    It was pointed out to that Supreme Court justice that as far as counsel was concerned, this has not only became double jeopardy or triple jeopardy. 
    It was also pointed out that Supreme Court justice that the state court still had an appeal pending in the Court of Appeals, the highest court in the State of New York, and when he stay the execution of his third sentence until we got a reply back or decision back from Albany. 
    That was denied. 
    As a result, Stevens went into jail for the third time. 
    While Stevens was in jail and just before his first 30-day jail sentence run out, a decision did come down from the Court of Appeals once again relying on the Regan case and this time counsel now having exhausted the state remedy made application once again in the Federal District Court, by the way the denial by the Court of Appeals makes is Number 210 now before this Court of certiorari. 
    Now having exhausted our state remedies, we made application, Federal District Court Southern District, on behalf of Stevens, Judge Weinfeld entertained the application, allow Stevens to come out of civil prison, he is paroled of federal custody without opposition from the District Court Attorney's office. 
    However, after oral argument, Judge Weinfeld denied our application but did say that it was a -- issued a step in a probable cause and permitted us to go to the Circuit Court of Appeals on an expedited appeal. 
    We argue the case before the Circuit Court of Appeals, the decision was -- once again was rendered against us and at this time, the Court also relied on the Regan case which this Court passed on 1955. 
    Of course, this Court now granted certiorari which is now Number 290 before this Court based on the one question, whether or not Article I, Section 6 in 1123, the New York City Charter which requires that public officials to sign a waiver of immunity or to be dismissed from their job from not signing it. 
    I have the wording a little mixed up but that's -- in that sense what it is. 
    What happened to Stevens in the lower court -- excuse me, this time, I would like to point out to the court that I have a co-counsel arguing with me this morning. 
    I am going to show, I hope to this Court the difference between the Regan case and the Stevens case. 
    My co-counsel will take the constitutional question. 
    Since all the courts below felt that Regan was controlling, I would like this time to point out similarities and of course the differences not only factually but legally between Stevens and Regan. 
    Like Regan, Stevens --

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Do I understand that on each of these occasions where he was committed for contempt that the Assistant District Attorney told him that he was not to receive immunity and that he would be prosecuted on his own testimony and that he had a right under the federal constitution not to testify if he chose to do so?
speaker="john_p_schofield" startTime="955.172" stopTime="1002.976">
    Mr. John P. Schofield 
    That is correct Your Honor. 
    As a matter of fact, the District Attorney -- if we look at the brief on page 290, page 16 -- excuse me, the record, I said that the -- I meant the record at 290, page 16. 
    The District Attorney made it crystal clear the position of their office. 
    He stated, “And do you understand further that regardless of what your lawyer may say or what anyone else may say, that it is the contention of the People that this is a valid waiver of immunity and that you do not have immunity? 
    Do you understand that?”

    So the District Attorney made it clear that Stevens do not have immunity. 
    The District Attorney in answer to your question Your Honor, with reference to the advice he gave him, also made it very clear.

    Mr. John P. Schofield 
    That's now -- we're in record 218 -- 210, page 13, a little more than halfway down. 
    This is when Stevens appeared on the -- before the July 15th grand jury, the chief -- Assistant District Attorney stated this to Stevens when he is in the grand jury. 
    “Well now, you'll appreciate that under the constitution of the State of New York in the city charter as a public officer, if you choose to retain your public office, you are required to waive immunity with respect to the matters that relate to your official conduct or through the performance of your official duties. 
    Do you understand that?” 
    Answer, “I realize that sir, yes.” 
    Question, “Even though you still have your constitutional privilege against self-incrimination?” 
    “Right sir.” 
    “That you can revoke it anytime?” 
    “Right.”

    But if you invoke that privilege then you are subject to the forfeiture of your position as a public officer. 
    Stevens of course said, “I realize that”, and when Stevens did then and there that day, refused to sign that waiver, he received a letter terminating his employment from the New York City Police Department and that letter in that sense said that he went before a grand jury and refused to sign a waiver, his office was terminated and his ranked as a lieutenant was vacated.

    Yes Your Honor, because it was at this second time before the grand jury on July 15th that he asserted that that was when they want him to sign a new waiver. 
    So that he had actually been fired on July 15 which the letter he received on the 16th. 
    So when he was called back a week later on July 22nd to testify under this question of his immunity that he signed on June 26th, he was no longer a member of the police department according to that letter.

    That, I may call it some limbo, in as much as the cooperation counsel over the -- attorneys for the City of New York in their answer alleged when -- that's what happened to Stevens after his signing in the waiver. 
    And we asked to how this taken out from thereafter on the grounds that this happen subsequent to Stevens' dismissal and had no pertinent part in the New York County grand jury -- or rather, New York County Supreme Court decision then and there before that justice. 
    However, Mr. Justice Hufstedler denied our motion to strike the answer which showed what happened to Stevens subsequent. 
    As a result, we appeal that up to the Appellate Division and I've -- since this Court did declare certiorari where keeping in a limbo area hoping that this Court resolve that and it will also resolve Stevens' application for restoration back to police department. 
    However, there has been decisions there for that from the Supreme Court of New York County saying that they amend that -- had been by them that this suit be restored.

    Must he answer to --
speaker="john_p_schofield" startTime="1374.943" stopTime="1436.342">
    Mr. John P. Schofield 
    The question is whether or not the validity of that statute in line with this Court's decision in Malloy has allowed to stand in as much as I say public employees have the same rights as any other citizen and this requirement that we have in our city charter in the state constitution, certainly, is a violation of their constitutional rights that certainly when they're faced there with a waiver, it's not the exercise of their free will that they are signing this waiver. 
    It's in their position put upon these public officials by the state constitution and by city charter. 
    And as a result, it is repugnant to United States Constitution. 
    And I think Stevens is a prime example of what happens to a man that wants to assert this right. 
    He's found guilty of criminal contempt after he is finally advised by counsel that had no right or it was a contention that counsel had no right to assert that they should receive this waiver. 
    So I think --

    Either one -- well, he -- actually, city charter follows the state constitution.

    As a matter of fact --

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    We wouldn't have to -- we wouldn't have to decide that independently.
speaker="john_p_schofield" startTime="1489.743" stopTime="1633.104">
    Mr. John P. Schofield 
    Well, I would say and I'm going to leave Mr. Gressman for his oral argument on the constitutional question. 
    I don't want to infringe on his. 
    I would say this that New York procedurally within a departmental procedures can setup rules and regulations as to how they wish to conduct of their public officials to be carried on. 
    But New York City and New York State cannot shave the constitution of the United States and it was stated here in the Court of Claims -- rather in the Court of Claims and cited here by this Court assert the decision that when it was applied to a federal employee who was looking for his retirement and was cutoff in a Steinberg decision, that court -- the Court of Claims said, “Congress can pass laws and Congress can repeal laws but Congress even with the expressed permission of the president of United States cannot shave the constitution.” 
    And that's -- is an essence what the city charter in Article I, Section 6 of the state constitution is known, they're shaving the constitution. 
    Now if Your Honor please, I'm going to leave more of that argument to Mr. Gressman but I would like to point out the big differences between Regan and Stevens. 
    Regan of course was a policeman and like Stevens, he signed the waiver of immunity. 
    However, unlike Regan, Stevens never got a hearing or never had a trial as to whether or not his waiver was coerced. 
    Everything that happened to Stevens was summarily found guilty of criminal contempt. 
    Stevens at the outset raised a constitutional question but Regan never raised it until he came here for certiorari. 
    Most important though is the question of the immunity statute. 
    At the time of Regan, we had an absolute immunity statute. 
    That was not the case in June 26, 1964 when Stevens was called before the grand jury. 
    There was no absolute immunity statute. 
    It was a selective type of statute. 
    More to -- in essence it said, the District Attorney may confer when it's explicit in the record here that it was never his intention to give immunity to Stevens so that Stevens could never receive the full immunity bed that Regan had at that time.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="1633.104" stopTime="1651.924">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Did Stevens base his refusal to reply on the asserted denial of immunity or put it the other way around? 
    Did Stevens at anytime say that he would answer the questions if he were given immunity?
speaker="john_p_schofield" startTime="1651.924" stopTime="1666.756">
    Mr. John P. Schofield 
    Alright. 
    Stevens never answered at that way Your Honor but Stevens at all times answered that he's been on his constitutional rights. 
    In fact, it was explicit of rights of the Fifth, Sixth and the Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution not to incriminate himself.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="1666.756" stopTime="1666.911">

    He never asked the way Your Honor asked that question.

    And he never had offered -- never said that he'd answer the questions if he were granted immunity.
speaker="john_p_schofield" startTime="1676.157" stopTime="1711.867">
    Mr. John P. Schofield 
    It was neither attended to him. 
    We -- outside the grand jury in conversation with the District Attorney, asked him at many times whether he was offering immunity to Stevens. 
    And he said that it was their contention that they didn't have to and he made it explicit in the record that no matter what his counsel said that Stevens was not going to receive immunity by any immunity statute. 
    In fact, if there was an immunity statute, it was an anonymous one because it was never even mentioned by the District Attorney at anytime when Stevens appeared either in the court or in the grand jury that if he answered these questions, he would receive immunity.

    Mr. Eugene Gressman 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court. 
    In connection with the change in this immunity statute, there is no question to what there has been a significant constitutional change or at least in its impact the -- this Court as stated in the Regan opinion itself, recognize that a change had occurred but that it was not applicable in that case because the operative effects in Regan had occurred before Section 381 of the New York Penal Law had been amended. 
    And -- but the change is noted in the footnote to the -- in the opinion and it is several times referred to in the opinion that it was critical to the decision in that case that the immunity statute read as it did at the time of the operative effects in Regan. 
    But a change significantly occurred and we maintain that the change is such as to cause that the Regan case and the rationale to be completely inapplicable because no longer is there absolute immunity given to the witness called before the grand jury that the -- under Section 381 has amended and the new Section 2447, it becomes discretionary with the grand jury whether or not it will confer immunity.

    Mr. Eugene Gressman 
    It is. 
    It -- I think that's true Your Honor. 
    Now the New York Court of Appeals in People versus Laino which is cited in all of the briefs I believe, has authoritatively construed this change in the immunity statute. 
    And is -- did so in this case -- in these words, that the defendant merely by testifying and that is what Regan did or would have done, did not -- does not receive automatic immunity for all time as to any transaction, matter or thing revealed by him as he would have prior to the enactment of Section 2447 of the Penal Law. 
    Prior to Section 2447 at the time of Regan, of course, in a conspiracy or bribery case, the applicable statute provided for such automatic immunity unless the witness executed that waiver --

    It seems to me that it was not the function of the New York court to declare whether immunity has been established or not here because the procedural steps had not yet occurred and this is precisely the reason why this is constitutionally different because it's not up to the courts to say anymore, the New York state courts to say, you have automatic immunity because you are directed to answer or because you claimed your privilege because it have to go through the precise automatic -- the precise discretionary steps that have been outlined in the new Section 4447 and Section 381 says, “In those circumstances, the grand jury then may infer immunity if it so sees that it in its discretion and not as a matter of automatic immunity attaching by virtue of the statutory command.”

    Concluding my references to the change in the immunity statute, I would like to summarize the change in this sentence. 
    If Regan had gone ahead and testified and the waiver were later bound to be invalid, there's ab -- there was absolutely no question but under 381 as then written, he would have been assured of receiving immunity from prosecution. 
    In Stevens' case on the contrary, Stevens gone ahead and testified and the waiver were subsequently found to have been in -- and legally induced. 
    There is no assurance that he would have had immunity at that point. 
    It would have been depended upon the discretion of the District Attorney and the grand jury as to whether they would have conferred immunity and it is entirely possible that in their discretion and under the circumstances of this case, they would not have bargained an answer in return for conferring immunity at the time of the grand jury proceeding.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Just before you leave the -- your claim difference in the kind or nature of immunity in this case from that which was conferred in the Regan case. 
    As I understood, let's put to one side for a moment the statute which applies to public officers. 
    Let's just take an ordinary witness who was called in there. 
    Now, in the -- in a grand jury investigation of bribery or whatever it is that this statute covers. 
    He is asked questions by the grand jury. 
    Well now, he hasn't any constitutional right to refuse to answer those questions on the ground that they might incriminate him. 
    And the grand jury might be sat -- or be satisfied with that. 
    They might not be that interested in his testimony so then he doesn't answer and that's the end of it. 
    But in order for them to compel him to answer, they have to at that point, tell him and explicitly tell him, do they not, that he say, having conferred upon him immunity from any prosecution, immunity as broad as the constitutional privilege, that's much is clear isn't it?

    In this -- and in this case assuming that the grand jury did -- was willing to grant him immunity the District Attorney was not because he said, "He gave warning every time that if the man testified, they're going to prosecute him on his own testimony, and is that right?
speaker="eugene_gressman" startTime="2990.071" stopTime="3539.118">
    Mr. Eugene Gressman 
    That's right Your Honor. 
    At the very least, you cannot say with assurance as you could -- as you said in Regan that Stevens would have received (Inaudible) complete immunity from the grand jury. 
    That -- and that assurance was what -- was the predict -- essential predicate of the Regan rationale. 
    I would also like to leave with you one further thought in distinguishing the Regan case and that is the confusing entrapment to which the Assistant District Attorney put this petitioner, having told him that you've waived immunity. 
    He constantly says, “And you understand that any time, you can invoke your privilege against self-incrimination under the United States Constitution.” 
    And when he proceeded to do that, he then found himself entrapped into a contempt citation and a jail sentence. 
    Now, we maintain that under the similar facts and decision in Raley v. Ohio that this constitutes an unconstitutional entrapment which was not involved in the Regan case. 
    And is sufficiently different on the whole factual atmosphere of the case -- two cases to distinguish the situation here from that in Regan and to make its reasoning inapplicable. 
    But to go ahead to the ultimate constitutional question which is before Your Honors, I submit that the combined effect of the state constitution and city charter provisions is to run directly contrary to the principle established by this Court in Malloy v. Hogan as applicable to states to wit the principle that the Fourteenth Amendment forbids the states to resort to imprisonment to compel him to answer questions that might incriminate the individual. 
    And why is that true in this -- and with respect to these two provisions? 
    I think the answer to that lies in the corollaries to the basic principle which were recognized in Malloy v. Hogan. 
    The first of which is that every person has a right to remain silent in the unfettered exercise of his own will which necessarily implies that you have a right to waive your immunity in the unfettered exercise of your own will. 
    And the second principle in Malloy v. Hogan is that the individual shall suffer no penalty or burden because he freely elects to remain silent. 
    Now here, I submit that both of those principles were violated. 
    This petitioner, because practically at the invitation or the advice of the Assistant District Attorney to the effect that he had this privilege against self-incrimination, and because he exercised it, he suffers not only the loss of his employment, contention rights, but he goes to prison for having refused to answer an incriminating question in reliance upon the federal privilege what the prosecutor repeatedly said was available to him. 
    Moreover, and perhaps even more importantly, the impact of these provisions at the time he invoked the privilege or made the determination as to whether to invoke it or not, completely destroyed his unfettered exercise of his own will. 
    The choice at that point was no longer whether he should remain silent or whether he should speak. 
    The question was -- put to him in these terms, either you waive your privilege and speak and incriminate yourself if we're right that there was no complete immunity available to him or you will lose your job, your employment rights and your pension rights, and in addition, you will go to jail for contempt in refusing to answer an incriminating question. 
    Now, it seems to me obviously that that time of a choice is one that no state can constitutionally impose upon an individual when confronted with an incriminating question. 
    It's precisely the kind of an unconstitutional choice which this Court referred to in Frost against Railroad Commission as a choice between a rock and a whirlpool. 
    An option to forego a privilege which may be vital to his livelihood such as public employment or to submit to a requirement which may constitute an intolerable burden to wit waiving an immunity and incriminating himself. 
    And the fact that this petitioner did sign a waiver of immunity without advice of counsel and did then to the pressure of this choice does not change the situation, one with constitutionally speaking because the coercive impact of this upon the petitioner was nonetheless obvious by virtue of the fact that he took the choice which seemed to him at the moment to be in his best interest. 
    But it was nonetheless a choice which the state could not have forced upon him constitutionally. 
    And the result of that choice I repeat is to run back directly to what was outlawed in Malloy v. Hogan that he has been imprisoned as a result of making one of these choices put upon him, imprisoned because he refused to incriminate himself and relied instead upon his privilege against self-incrimination. 
    Now what justification does the state offer for this illegal choice? 
    They say various things. 
    One is that a waiver of the Fifth Amendment is a valid condition of public employment. 
    And if the state must have freedom to ferret out crime among its employees that policemen are especially obligated to cooperate in investigations into their official conduct. 
    But the critical question is how can the state's interest if that would be a valid interest, be manifested under the constitution. 
    Well, I suggest that if that interest is recognizable, it is recognizable solely in terms of the employment relationship and that is not involved in this case whatsoever Your Honor. 
    In answer to -- with the reference to the Chief Justice's earlier inquiry, I suggest that we do not have to reach the question whether the employment forfeiture and discharge of this petitioner was valid or not. 
    That is not the questions involved. 
    These are solely contempt proceedings and if there's an independent proceeding going on as to whether the employment discharge here was valid or not. 
    But in any event, the question as to whether the states interests in -- and in waiving -- having the employee cooperate is something that can be exhibited only in terms of proper disciplinary proceedings involving possibly discharge and pursuant to due process requirements. 
    And that is all the courts have ever held that have indicated that policemen or public employees are under an obligation to cooperate and not to plea the Fifth Amendment. 
    The state's interest is solely in terms of the employment relationship but I suggest that the state cannot exert its interest here in such a way as it has in this case so as to destroy the public employees' privilege against self-incrimination until the result being to put him into imprisonment for having elected to remain silent in the face of an incriminating question. 
    But the Fifth Amendment put it differently, said that no person shall be compelled to incriminate himself in a criminal proceeding and there is no exception in terms of public employees or policemen, and so that no more than an employee cannot be imprisoned by a state for having asserted the First Amendment of free speech no less should a state would be prohibited from imprisoning an individual and a public employee if you will because it wants him to incriminate himself and that he has relied instead upon his privilege against self-incrimination. 
    So that anyway you look at it, these provisions get back to the principle which Malloy v. Hogan and prior cases that long since established that the state simply cannot resort to imposing such a choice as these provisions may, a choice upon the individual to compel him to answer questions that might incriminate him and particularly so in the absence of an absolute automatic immunity statute available to him without any discretion whatsoever on the part of the grand jury or the District Attorney.

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Well, Mr. Gressman, apart from this argument, do I correctly understand you to contend that the constitutional and charter provisions, since failure to waive means loss of a job, impose that kind of pressure for waiver that the only possible consequent constitution if there is no waiver and the privilege you derive upon it, no matter what they say about we give you immunity, no matter what they say about that, that that's the kind of pressure which means that at least under the doctrine in Malloy and Hogan, there may not be a criminal prosecution or even a criminal contempt proceeding followed but the maximum effect could be the loss of the job.

    Mr. Eugene Gressman 
    That is precisely the argument that that kind of coercive pressure put upon him even before and he thought he could've been given about immunity. 
    But to tell him to -- that even before he went in the grand jury room, you've got to sign this waiver or you're going to lose your job. 
    You've got to testify or you've lost your job. 
    Now this is a kind of choice that completely destroys the essential freedom that surrounds the Fifth Amendment privilege and what -- whether immunity then follows or not it seems to me, constitutionally speaking is irrelevant in these peculiar circumstances.

   Argument of H. Richard Uviller

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Gressman, because our questioning deprived you with your five minutes that I know you want to reserve, you may have five minutes in rebuttal and Mr. Uviller, you may have extra five minutes if you wish it too.

    Mr. H. Richard Uviller 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    I should like to address myself at the outset to a matter which has obviously troubled the Court during the presentation by the petitioner. 
    And that is the question of whether he would have received immunity under New York law. 
    Had he been correct in his contention that his waiver of immunity was invalid? 
    I'm sure they were all agreed to the outset that if the waiver was indeed a free and valid waiver of immunity then a contempt conviction could lie for compelling him to answer questions pursuant to such a waiver. 
    The real question is, could he be compelled to answer questions if he was right and his waiver of immunity was in fact --
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="4172.343" stopTime="4173.630">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Well, Mr. Uviller --

    -- invalid.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="4173.987" stopTime="4200.579">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    The answer Mr. Gressman just gave me doesn't indicate that what you've said he agrees with that assuming that it was a valid waiver, I thought his whole point was that no matter what kind of immunity they gave him, the course -- and as he phrases it of the loss of job which invokes the waiver in it of itself is sufficiently of course so that at least for the purposes of a criminal prosecution even a criminal contempt that the statute is unconstitutional.
speaker="h_richard_uviller" startTime="4200.579" stopTime="4215.686">
    Mr. H. Richard Uviller 
    As I understand his position Mr. Justice Brennan, it is that the coercion invalidated the waiver and so that the question of whether this -- the New York constitutional provision is unconstitutional really goes to his contention as to the validity of the waiver.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="4215.686" stopTime="4218.317">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Well, perhaps if that that's what he meant, I didn't understand it.
speaker="h_richard_uviller" startTime="4218.317" stopTime="4286.549">
    Mr. H. Richard Uviller 
    As a matter of fact, he has asserted our position from the outset. 
    At the time that he was before the judge in the Supreme Court where -- ordered him to answer, he asserted that position that the constitutional provision was coercive and the waiver has not been freely given and consequently, he couldn't be compelled to answer pursuant to that waiver. 
    It was the people's position at that time and it still is the people's position that that waiver was not coerced and it wasn't valid in finding waiver. 
    But with respect to Regan, the question that we must ask ourselves is what if he was right. 
    I suppose the waiver was invalid for one reason or another or would he have been completely protected? 
    I suggest to the Court that on that question, this Court is bound by the decision of the Court of the State of New York. 
    And moreover, it is not merely implicit in that court's reliance on Regan, it is quite explicit and I quote now from the record in 210 where the memorandum decision of the Appellate Division is reproduced on page 43 where the Court says, “If the waiver were invalid, petitioner would have received immunity from prosecution under Sections 381 and 2447 of the Penal Law.

    As amended?
speaker="h_richard_uviller" startTime="4309.563" stopTime="4438.420">
    Mr. H. Richard Uviller 
    Yes. 
    The previous automatic immunity was under the former Section 381 but there is still a 381 which provides that immunity may be granted in prosecutions for a certain nature of crime pursuant to the provisions of 2447. 
    2447 is the new statute that provides the procedures. 
    The Second Circuit Court of Appeals was exactly as explicit on page 61 of 290. 
    That court said, and I'll have to skip a few words, but it said in effect, “Indeed if Stevens' waiver is defective as we view the relevant provisions of the State Penal Law, immunity from prosecution will automatically follow,” and they cited 2447. 
    So that there is -- I suggest at this point nothing for this Court to decide as to whether or not he would have received immunity from prosecution pursuant to state law if he had followed the Court's directions and responded. 
    Now if that is conclusive as we submit it is, then this case is factually indistinguishable from the Regan case. 
    Now it's true that there has been a major change in the law in New York as there has been the federal law as to the procedures by which immunity is granted prior to the enactment of 2447, anybody witnessed or target called before a grand jury who was asked an incriminating question and answered that question received immunity and that was that. 
    2447 was intended to be a benefit to the prosecutor. 
    2447 obviously was to protect the sleepy -- the nodding prosecutor from an inadvertent grant of immunity to a witness who -- to his surprise came out with a self-incriminatory answer. 
    And it provided that in order to get immunity, the witness must himself alert the prosecutor that he has about to become immunized by asserting his privilege. 
    At that point, certain procedures have provided by which he can be commanded to answer and if he does, receives immunity. 
    The federal procedure is precisely the same.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="4438.420" stopTime="4445.034">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    You mean, if he -- if the command itself, is there any requirement that you say to the witness and that we're granting him?
speaker="h_richard_uviller" startTime="4445.034" stopTime="4509.627">
    Mr. H. Richard Uviller 
    No there is not. 
    The -- under the competent authority section of 2447, it is provided that the form in -- on the expressed request of the District Attorney shall order the witness to answer does not say that he shall explain to him that he has received immunity. 
    It also says that the Court may order a witness who asserts his privilege to answer presumably without the question of the District Attorney in a matter except a proceeding before the grand jury. 
    So the only real question here is whether or not the Court in this case in ordering, it was acting on behalf of the form and whether or not he was a competent authority. 
    I suggest there's no real question here in as much as it was decided below that immunity would have been granted. 
    And furthermore, it's -- I think quite unusual to assume that a District Attorney could under these circumstances ever assert in the future that the man had not been granted immunity because the technical requirements of 2447 were not complied with. 
    And the law of the case as decided by the Appellate Division is to that effect. 
    Now, in the Laino --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="4509.627" stopTime="4520.720">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Uviller, is there any discretion in the District Attorney as to whether a man will get immunity for his testimony before the grand jury?
speaker="h_richard_uviller" startTime="4520.720" stopTime="4678.537">
    Mr. H. Richard Uviller 
    Yes Mr. Chief Justice, there is. 
    As to immunity in the Counselman against Hitchcock sentence, immunity in the Counselman against Hitchcock sentence may be conferred only pursuant to 2447 in New York and that does require the District Attorney to make an election just as it requires the witness to make an election of asserting his privilege. 
    However, we do have in New York and this is where it gets really unfortunately complicated, another kind of testimonial protection and that is the type of testimony and protection that was involved in the Laino case. 
    That is not, strictly speaking, immunity in the Counselman against Hitchcock sense. 
    It is not complete protection against prosecution of such a nature as it will supplant or replace privilege against self-incrimination but it is a form of protection. 
    And what it is, is simply this and this is decided in the case of People against Steuding in New York cited in our brief by Judge Fuller, written by Judge Fuller. 
    Judge Fuller says that notwithstanding the provisions of 2447 in New York where a target of an investigation or a potential defendant is called before a grand jury he is there illegally at the start. 
    He said that a potential defendant derives his rights against self-incrimination directly from Article I, Section 6 of the New York Constitution which provides that he shall not be a witness against himself. 
    So that if the prosecutor does in violation of his rights call him and swear him as a witness before the grand jury, he acquires a certain type of protection and that protection is that he cannot be indicted by that grand jury. 
    He cannot be punished for contempt if he fails to answer. 
    He cannot be punished for forgery if answers falsely because the oath is not validly administered to say and he cannot be prosecuted on the basis of any evidence that may have been uncovered by virtue of his testimony. 
    However, as occurred -- as was upheld by the appellate courts when Steuding's co-defendant was reindicted by a fresh grand jury he maybe reindicted or indicted by an -- only if a different grand jury acting upon fresh and independent evidence. 
    In effect, it is the kind of protection which this Court's action in Murphy against The Waterfront by overruling the Kelvin case. 
    Nonetheless, this is a form of protection which does attach in New York automatically if the potential defendant himself is called as a witness. 
    That was the basis of the Laino holding and that was the basis of Steuding against Ryan.

    In any event, at the time just before he was held in contempt of the court, there was a colloquy, a discussion before the judge who held them in contempt to court at which time, and this is in the record as well, at which time the District Attorney discussed the applicability of the Regan case which I just come down at that point. 
    And the District Attorney maintained in the presence of defendant and his counsel to the Court that the Stevens case was indistinguishable from Regan and that the same double protection which was accorded to Regan under the statute which was then applicable would be available to the defendant in this case. 
    He did not, mind you, abandon his theory that the defendant had waived his immunity. 
    But he did indicate that if he was wrong in that theory, the defendant would be accorded so that, again, the law of the case is -- from the very outset, the very issues which we are now arguing were known and were before the court and in the defendant's knowledge. 
    Now I was about to say that the Steuding case and the Laino case have revived the efficacy of this waiver of immunity. 
    When 2447 was enacted, the slip of paper which is called the waiver of immunity might be thought to have been a -- an anachronistic relic of no further significance because obviously if the only way you get immunity is by asserting your privilege, then presumably the correct way to waive immunity would be to answer the question without asserting the privilege. 
    And in the point of fact, I'm informed that that is precisely the way potential defendants waive their immunity in federal proceedings. 
    Nonetheless, we have this slip of paper called a waiver of immunity which before is the people's theory, it is, was binding upon the defendant. 
    Well the efficacy of that slip of paper becomes apparent when you consider the Steuding case because the Steuding case returns the potential defendant and this petitioner was denominated a potential defendant from the outset. 
    Returns him to the position he was in, as Regan was, before 2447 not that he receives complete and total immunity but that he does receive very extensive Murphy type of protection if you will. 
    Consequently, if he did not execute this waiver of immunity, before being sworn, he would have received protection against indictment by that grand jury, a protection against the use of his testimony or his moots in any future proceeding. 
    Consequently, if that waiver of immunity which he signed was a legally significant and operative act from which legal consequences flow. 
    In point of fact, there is a law in New York that no potential defendant may be called before a grand jury unless he executes a waiver of immunity. 
    Consequently, his entry into the floor, the opportunity to express his side to learn the questions which were being asked to see the financial questionnaire which he received in this case and so on was all conditioned upon his execution of that instrument known as a waiver of immunity. 
    A legally operable act, an act which an adult knowingly undertakes having been fully advised of the consequences is normally binding. 
    And as a waiver, it is no more, no less finding than in the other legally operable act. 
    It is not an insignificant promise, a mere undertaking not to assert any privilege but is a significant and operable act.

    Mr. H. Richard Uviller 
    We have -- no but that is our -- indeed my position. 
    And as a matter of fact, that has been our position from the outside by asserting as we have throughout the Regan case and by obtaining decisions based on the Regan case throughout. 
    We were and the courts were in this case, adopting precisely that position and that is that Regan is still operable, it still sound that it is controlling. 
    This Court did not take certiorari interestingly enough on the question of whether Regan has been modified by Malloy. 
    It took certiorari on a quite different question. 
    But we have nonetheless asserted throughout that Regan was offered and I do suggest to the Court that if for one reason or another this Court disagrees with us and believes that Regan has been in some way overruled or has lost its force in effect as a result to either of the change of immunity laws of New York or as a result of Malloy against Hogan. 
    Then this case should be remanded to the state courts for an opportunity to pass upon the merits of the constitutionality of the New York Constitution where this Court accepted certiorari in the case on the question of whether or not this particular provision of a constitution is parallel to the New York City Charter. 
    It was unconstitutional. 
    And that question or low grades was explicitly bypassed by every court below on the grounds that Regan was controlled. 
    As a result, the case comes to this Court as a case in which the issue, the very issue on which grant was cert -- of certiorari was given, was never decided either in this case or in any other case in the State of New York. 
    And I suggest that -- for that reason although I propose now to discuss the merits of the question on which cert was granted that certiorari was improperly granted and should be dismissed because I think it is not only as a question not drawn an issue by the decision below but I think that if this Court would be properly reluctant to construe or to rule upon the constitutionality of such an important provision of the state constitution without affording the courts of that state an opportunity to do so first.

    Before you go to the merits, may I ask you just one more question. 
    I'm trying to clarify in my own mind the precise issue. 
    Is there an issue between you and the petitioner's counsel as to the effect of immunity? 
    Let me put it this way. 
    Do you understand that petitioner's counsel intend that even if Stevens got a complete immunity, even if he got a complete immunity, he still could not be compelled to testify. 
    Do you understand that to be their (Voice Overlap)?

    Mr. H. Richard Uviller 
    That's the way it sounded to me Mr. Justice Fortas. 
    I don't know why he says that because it seems quite clear to me that contempt is a proper means of enforcing a testimony from a reluctant witness who cannot be harmed that way and it has been repeatedly held by this Court and in some quite recent cases that a Counselman against Hitchcock type of immunity does effectively supplant privilege.

    And together, they say, that he shouldn't be called but if he is called and immunized, he must answer because no immunity case has ever come up in New York involving anyone except potential defendants.

    What was --

    What is the Steuding type of protection?
speaker="h_richard_uviller" startTime="5672.031" stopTime="5708.799">
    Mr. H. Richard Uviller 
    The Steuding protection is that he cannot be prosecuted for contempt. 
    He cannot be prosecuted for forgery because the oath was not properly administered to him. 
    His testimony cannot be used against him in any future prosecution and any evidence that is discovered by virtue of his testimony cannot be used against him in any future proceeding. 
    The only thing that's left, the only area, the only gap between the Steuding protection and Counselman against Hitchcock protection is that he maybe pre -- indicted in the future by a different grand jury on a wholly fresh and independent evidence, and that in effect did happen in the Steuding case and was upheld.

    He must be --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="5717.195" stopTime="5722.195">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    And the court -- has the court said that?
speaker="h_richard_uviller" startTime="5722.195" stopTime="5921.368">
    Mr. H. Richard Uviller 
    I don't know that it was that explicit Your Honor but I don't think it's subject to any other construction. 
    I think that the -- there is only that -- in fact, the Court did say in the Steuding case itself but one thing we're not passing on here is whether he can be subsequently reindicted by a fresh grand jury on fresh evidence. 
    And then in the subsequent case, they did pass on that question and said yes. 
    So, that seems to me the Steuding case gives protection up to that point and complete protection up to that point which is I think the protection which was sanctioned in the Murphy case when you have a cross jurisdictional question. 
    Now there was a great deal made during the oral argument and in the brief about the petitioner here, of the fact that the District Attorney somehow during these proceedings had consistently and repeatedly told the defendant that he had the privilege still available to him and he uses this as a leaver in order to bring the Raley against Ohio decision to bear upon the case. 
    In effect, he asserts that we entrap Stevens into the assertion of his privilege and then prosecuted him for it. 
    I think this is based upon a misconstruction of the record. 
    And again, I would like to refer to the facts, the procedure that is followed -- the procedure that was followed here. 
    This defendant signed, physically signed the paper that is called a waiver of immunity before coming into the grand jury. 
    This is customarily done. 
    After he got into the grand jury, before he was given the oath and before any mentioned was made at the waiver of immunity, before he acknowledged the signature under oath, he was asked his name and so forth and given instructions by the prosecutor giving advice, very full, very complete. 
    He was told at the outset that he was a potential defendant and he was told that as a potential defendant, what he said could be used against him. 
    He was told that as a potential defendant he had the right to assert his privilege against self-incrimination at anytime. 
    That is the language which he relies upon. 
    The prosecutor having said, you may assert your privilege at any time. 
    But mind you, it occurred prior to the administration of the oath during the general instructions as to his rights that were being given to him. 
    He then was asked, do you see these piece papers? 
    You know what it is? 
    You understand what it means? 
    He was also told by the way about the constitutional provision and said that if you do assert your privilege, don't sign a waiver. 
    You're subject to forfeiture of your job and was shown the paper, acknowledged the signature, said it was his. 
    He said he understood what it meant, explained to him again and then he was given the oath. 
    It is -- the reason for this procedure and the theory behind it is that until he acknowledges that waiver of immunity in the grand jury under oath that it is not an operative document and that the instructions that you may assert the privilege anytime mean that you may refuse to sign the waiver and refuse to acknowledge it, refuse to waive your privilege before this party. 
    Now it does not mean that having executed the waiver is going to be, you may withdraw that document and rely upon your privilege.

    Is that in the record?
speaker="h_richard_uviller" startTime="5945.538" stopTime="6492.483">
    Mr. H. Richard Uviller 
    I -- your -- I dare say it is. 
    I'd see if I can find the precise page for you Mr. Chief Justice. 
    Now, I mean to proceed at this point to the merits of the question which is whether or not the provision of the New York State Constitution and the comparable provision of the City Charter which require public officers as a condition of continuing in public office to testify before a grand jury under waiver of immunity to answer questions, bearing upon and only bearing upon their performance of their public office. 
    It has been argued that this provision provides a penalty upon the assertion of the Fifth Amendment privilege. 
    It has been argued that the economic consequences to a defendant who does assert his privilege is within the proscription of the language in Malloy against Hogan proscribing a penalty. 
    The other side of that coin and I think the more proper way of phrasing it is that the economic consequences of failure to waive the privilege constitutes a coercive element which interferes with the exercise of his free will and that free will being necessary to a valid election to speak. 
    The reason I say that is that a penalty taken in it of itself within the context of the Fifth Amendment undoubtedly means prosecution, the -- if a person is prosecuted on -- for an account of evidence which it gives then the Fifth Amendment is violated. 
    A penalty does not mean within the context of the Fifth Amendment itself simply an adverse effect. 
    However, if the word penalty is read together with the sentence in which it appears in Malloy, I think it is clear that all what it means is that there must not be such consequences, such penalizing consequences as would interfere with the exercise of free will. 
    The issue it seems to me can be phrased and should be phrased in this manner. 
    Does a public officer have the right to continue in that office free of any regulation which comports with the nature of his job or is he subject to reasonable regulations and expectations which do reasonably relate to the nature of his job notwithstanding the fact that such regulations may in some degree encroach upon his constitutional privileges. 
    Now, this Court has stated in both Wyman against (Inaudible) and of the (Inaudible) case itself that if a -- that a public officer may be subject to reasonable regulations as long as they are not either discriminatory or arbitrary. 
    Now, it seems to me that under the established doctrine of those cases and the others which this Court has handled, the only inquiry here is not -- whether or not a regulation, the requirement that he testify encroaches upon Fifth Amendment or for that matter New York state privileges against self-incrimination but rather, whether it is a reasonable regulation consistent with the nature of his duty. 
    It is our contention and it has been our contention throughout that it is. 
    We -- it takes no great stretch of the imagination to realize that there are many forms of public employment which are conditioned upon at least partial relinquishment of constitutional rights. 
    Federal employees may not associate themselves with others in certain types of political activity. 
    They may not express their political beliefs in certain respects and still be public employees. 
    Certainly, in the military and I should think for example that a teacher employed by a municipal government who insisted upon conducting religious services in her classroom in the exercise of her freedom of religion might nonetheless be constitutionally discharged from her duty -- from her duties for the assertion of that privilege. 
    It doesn't seem to me in and of itself either shocking or repugnant that certain forms of public employment have certainly reasonable restrictions upon the exercise of constitutional rights. 
    A penalty, the threat of loss of a job, it seems to me cannot be taken without regard to the nature of the public employment which is to be forfeited. 
    A police officer, indeed a public officer of any sort is responsible not only to his superior officers but is responsible to the community at large who are in a very real sense, his employers. 
    No one I don't think would doubt the authority of the police commissioner of the City of New York to call in a lieutenant albeit a man who has 17 or 18 years on the force and ask him the question which was asked him before the grand jury. 
    Have you taken bribes in order to protect gamblers? 
    I'm sure that nobody doubts that if an officer elected to stand on his constitutional privilege had refused to answer that. 
    The police commissioner could remove him from his office. 
    Now, whether he is removing him from his office solely on the basis of the assertion of his Fifth Amendment privilege or whether the assertion of that privilege demonstrates a form of unfitness, I think is an academic question. 
    I think that the power is certainly there. 
    Now if the police officer chooses to answer the question and thus admit -- answers truthfully and thus admit that he has done certain acts which would subject him to criminal punishment, I don't think that anyone doubts that the superior officer could proceed to the District Attorney's Office or directly to the grand jury and have a criminal action instituted against him and even used that admission against him. 
    In order words, a superior officer does not have the power to grant immunity in exchange for asking the officer with his privilege against self-incrimination. 
    Now the real question here it seems to me is whether or not the situation is changed by the fact that the forum changes. 
    And the police officer rather than being before his superior in the role of employee if you will or at certain is before the grand jury which is a quasi -- independent quasi judicial party. 
    We submit that the situation is not changed at all. 
    In the first place, there is a special relationship between the public servant and the grand jury which does not exist between private individuals in the grand jury. 
    He is not a private citizen who is threatened with criminal punishment appearing before an alien body. 
    He is in a very real sense, the employee answering to the agents of his employer. 
    His salary is paid by the community. 
    He is subject to public scrutiny for the performance of his duty and indeed this relationship is recognized by a statute in the very same constitutional provision which we are here dealing with where it is provided that the grand jury does have special powers to oversee and supervise the conduct of public office. 
    Consequently, as an employee, it seems to me that he can expect no greater benefit from the incidental fact that the grand jury unlike his superior officer has the power to confer immunity. 
    Indeed, the power to confer immunity by the grand jury is limited to certain types of crime. 
    The police officer who is called by a grand jury to answer as to an investigation into burglary or sale of narcotics or something of that sort could not receive immunity from that grand jury under any circumstance. 
    Just because the grand jury is looking into bribery, just because the investigation happens to concern conspiracy, does he thereby obtain benefits which he would not merely have before his superior officer?

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well, except that -- I begin to understand that you apparently have various grades and kinds of immunity in New York but generally speaking, if a person asserts his constitutional privilege against self-incrimination, if then there is conferred upon him immunity as broad as the privilege then he loses his right not to answer, does he not?

speaker="h_richard_uviller" startTime="6569.584" stopTime="6571.637">
    Mr. H. Richard Uviller 
    Yes, but the real question here is --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="6571.637" stopTime="6575.115">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    -- then the question is to what if anything can the employer do about it?
speaker="h_richard_uviller" startTime="6575.115" stopTime="6642.231">
    Mr. H. Richard Uviller 
    Exactly. 
    And the important fact, what we are talking about is a law that says what the employer can do about it. 
    The law says the employer can dismiss him. 
    It doesn't say that he shall not have the right to assert it whether its narcotics or anything else. 
    It says what the consequences are and I suggest that particularly within the framework of the facts of this case where it's a police officer involved there can be no doubt that in the essence of his part either to conceal evidence from a grand jury or to attempt to shield the perpetrator even if the perpetrator is he himself. 
    It is clearly inconsistent with his duties as a police officer. 
    Now, we can't prosecute him for that, we don't intend, we don't try, we don't want to prosecute him for that, but we do say that the constitution in giving us the right to dismiss him for that is not in anyway act -- an unreasonable restriction. 
    Consequently on the pure question before the Court, the only question upon which certiorari was granted, the reasonableness of the provision of the constitution of the State of New York, I suggest that it is permanently reasonable. 
    Now, I --

    Justice Byron R. White 
    But you -- in that -- you equate his -- the -- you equate the privilege of the employer to fire if he refuses to answer before the grand jury to the privilege of the employer to demand a waiver of immunity in advance before he knows what he's going to be asked and --

    Mr. H. Richard Uviller 
    Yes sir. 
    In other words, the employer, the personal employer whether it would be a private or public officer asks for the answer with the understanding, I presume, that if he gets an incriminatory answer, there is no way in which he can protect the man from use of that.

    There is no waiver of immunity before the superior officer. 
    But there certainly is no immunity either.

    Mr. H. Richard Uviller 
    That does not appear from the record but I suggest that this was a continuing investigation involving many police officers and under those circumstances, it's not at all uncommon to have more than one grand jury investigating the same incident. 
    And indeed, sometimes when a second grand jury is called in when it becomes apparent that the investigation there is an enlargement and so if the witnesses are repeated before a second grand jury. 
    I was about to say that the -- it seems to me that if the waiver itself was not unduly coerced because the requirement of the constitution under which it was signed was a reasonable restraint then it would follow that if it were a legally operative act from which legal consequences flow, it could not be thereafter withdrawn. 
    I suggest that the ticket of entry which he received by virtue of this waiver of immunity into the precincts of the grand jury was a legal consequence of significance equal to that which an ordinary defendant obtains when he takes an oath in the trial on his own behalf. 
    Obviously, there is in no way in which a defendant once he takes the stand in his own behalf can “hope” to the questioning which occurs and that it should not be. 
    He has -- as long as the waiver of his right to remain off the stand without adverse comment --

    When I look at that piece of paper, that piece of paper does not say anything about a waiver of his privilege against answering incriminating questions, do you agree with that?
speaker="h_richard_uviller" startTime="7076.638" stopTime="7077.564">
    Mr. H. Richard Uviller 
    It does not.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="7077.564" stopTime="7112.670">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Alright. 
    Then we come to your Constitution of New York and that's where I find a provision to the effect that if a public officer refuses to answer a relevant question with two parts, one, if he refuses to sign the waiver, or two, if he refuses to answer a relevant question etcetera before the grand jury, then he is subject to dismissal, right?
speaker="h_richard_uviller" startTime="7112.670" stopTime="7113.424">
    Mr. H. Richard Uviller 
    Right.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="7113.424" stopTime="7150.596">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    So that what we have before us now if I correctly understand it is the contempt punishment of Stevens for refusing to answer questions before a grand jury and he refused to answer those questions not because -- and the problem there arises not because of anything in this waiver that he signed.
speaker="h_richard_uviller" startTime="7150.596" stopTime="7155.606">
    Mr. H. Richard Uviller 
    But Mr. Justice Fortas, we don't have any full evidence rule limiting us to the language of the waiver itself.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="7155.606" stopTime="7159.777">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    But when a man sign the -- the questions, what he did sign, isn't it?
speaker="h_richard_uviller" startTime="7159.777" stopTime="7172.622">
    Mr. H. Richard Uviller 
    Well, it's what did he sign and what have he acknowledged before the grand jury, in other words, the meaning of this was quite clearly outlined to him by the District Attorney before that waiver became an operative act.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="7172.622" stopTime="7190.259">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    So you're saying that despite the language of this or in addition of the language of this, Stevens has to be held on the state's theory to have waived his right of privilege not to answer and not to claim the privilege against self-incrimination.
speaker="h_richard_uviller" startTime="7190.259" stopTime="7199.018">
    Mr. H. Richard Uviller 
    Well, there shouldn't be no doubt about that Mr. Justice Fortas. 
    I mean, 210, record 210, page 10, question (Voice Overlap) --
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="7199.018" stopTime="7207.004">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Well, I'm not talking about that, that is -- I'm not talking about whether he was asked or whether he responded. 
    I'm talking about whether he signed?
speaker="h_richard_uviller" startTime="7207.004" stopTime="7255.356">
    Mr. H. Richard Uviller 
    Yes, but I would take the language of the waiver itself in conjunction with the explanation. 
    Unfortunately, that waiver is one sentence. 
    It runs for a -- practically a full page of the record. 
    It is obviously drafted by a lawyer in a statutory language and it's for that reason that before we find the defendant by the waiver, we haven't acknowledge orally the import and significance and he was told, do you understand -- it means that if you signed the waiver of immunity which requires you to answer questions concerning the conduct of your public office that what you will say -- what you say will be taken down and recorded and so forth and so on. 
    So that it's quite clear and this is before that waiver became operative and binding. 
    At this point, he could still say no and walk out the jury.

    Well --

    -- when he has a constitutional right?
speaker="h_richard_uviller" startTime="7364.404" stopTime="7497.690">
    Mr. H. Richard Uviller 
    There is a -- there is some state law Mr. Chief Justice, which does indicate that under the law of New York there must be accurate advice given as to the significance of the command to answer. 
    And the decision there which is cited in our brief is People against De Feo. 
    In that case, the -- what have happened was the -- during the early stages when it wasn't quite clear to anyone what 2447 meant. 
    The foreman of the grand jury said to the defendant, “You answer the questions and if you answer those questions, you will be immunized against the prosecution for conspiracy or bribery.” 
    The defendant refused to answer questions and was held in contempt. 
    The contempt was set aside on the ground that that advice was inaccurate that in point of fact he would have been immunized against any crime which he'd given an incriminating answers to. 
    And because of the fact that the advice was inaccurate, he couldn't have been held in contempt for having continued to refuse to answer. 
    That's the De Feo case. 
    Based upon that case, it does seems to me that there is some state law in New York which does require accurate appraisal of the significance of the immunity conferred on the extent of it. 
    But I do also suggest to this Court that that is not a federal question. 
    And that if this case should be remanded to the state courts for consideration of the issue which is now before this Court that the Court may, I don't concede the point because there may be arguments on the other side as well. 
    But the Court may feel that the contempt conviction was invalid in as much as he was not accurately appraise of the significance of the immunity under De Feo. 
    Now I can report that there is a good deal of confusion in New York as to the significance of De Feo but it does seem to indicate that as a matter of state law, there is some requirement of accurate advice. 
    I insist that this is not based upon the constitution of the United States. 
    It's not based upon the Fifth Amendment or the Fourteenth Amendment because whether or not he did received accurate advice and whether immunity attaches whether he receives accurate advice or not or whether a contempt conviction can be sustained whether he receives accurate information or not, it seems to me as a matter of local law.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="7497.690" stopTime="7515.665">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well, didn't he raise -- didn't he give your courts the full opportunity to discuss it and then decided it? 
    Didn't he raise it in -- from the very beginning? 
    And isn't he here on conviction after having raised the constitutional question?
speaker="h_richard_uviller" startTime="7515.665" stopTime="7517.084">
    Mr. H. Richard Uviller 
    Well, of course the Appellate Division --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="7517.084" stopTime="7521.597">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Is he to blame before the court not -- commenting on that or not writing an opinion?
speaker="h_richard_uviller" startTime="7521.597" stopTime="7580.794">
    Mr. H. Richard Uviller 
    No I don't think he is to blame for it and I don't suggest that this courts of New York or the lower federal courts are forever precluded from reaching the question. 
    I just suggest that where the lower court relies upon a decision of this Court to the effect that this is not the proper time for litigating the issue that they have not drawn the issue into question. 
    In other words, what do we -- when we talk about Regan, what we're really concerned with, we're not concerned with whether or not he'll ever have an opportunity to decide whether he had immunity or he didn't have immunity. 
    We're merely saying what is the proper time for deciding that question and I suggest that there are many interest to be served by continuing with the proceeding under way. 
    Interlocutory fields are generally forbidden. 
    When a proceeding is under way such as a grand jury investigation is extremely difficult to hold it and obtain an answer from the appellate courts which could take unfortunately a very long time as to whether he had immunity or he didn't when in the point of fact he hadn't answered in either case.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="7580.794" stopTime="7582.245">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    In point of fact what?
speaker="h_richard_uviller" startTime="7582.245" stopTime="7649.633">
    Mr. H. Richard Uviller 
    He had to answer in either case whether he had immunity or didn't have immunity. 
    That is the rationale underlying Regan and I think a very sensible one that applies here too.If he had -- if he -- a prosecution was ever brought against him on account of his answers, that would be the first time where he was threatened with any sort of harm with the result of his testimony and would be early enough for him to litigate the question as to whether he received immunity. 
    There is no need for him to satisfy his curiosity or to find out whether he's guessing right or guessing wrong as to whether he is receiving immunity because in either of that, he has to obey the order of the court to answer. 
    And there is a paramount interest it seems to me which overrides his interest in knowing whether he is receiving immunity or not and that interest is to continue with the grand jury investigation or it might be another case of trial which is actually under way at the time. 
    It would be extremely difficult that every time the person was ordered to answer before he had to go back to that grand jury which is waiting for him a few floors below, he could go through the Appellate Division, the Court of Appeals and the Circuit Courts and back to this Court.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="7649.633" stopTime="7677.477">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    But your lower court held that whichever way he decide it to, he was in trouble. 
    It says here on the one -- Judge Marks said on the one hand, if the waiver of immunity is still valid, petitioner no longer has any privilege to refuse to testify. 
    On the other hand, if he doesn't, he has to testify anyway.
speaker="h_richard_uviller" startTime="7677.477" stopTime="7680.184">
    Mr. H. Richard Uviller 
    Its -- well, isn't that quite right, because if the waiver is valid --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="7680.184" stopTime="7681.421">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Although it is (Voice Overlap) --
speaker="h_richard_uviller" startTime="7681.421" stopTime="7752.674">
    Mr. H. Richard Uviller 
    -- if the waiver is valid, he certainly has no more privilege. 
    He's waived -- if the waiver is invalid, he has to testify because by testifying, he receives immunity. 
    And if he receives immunity, he cannot be prosecuted in the future and his privilege is lost, the grant of immunity have supplanted it. 
    Consequently, I think Judge Marks saw the issue precisely the way I am arguing it now even at that early date. 
    And he was obviously facing that reasoning upon the Regan case which held just that. 
    Now having relied upon the rationale of that decision by this Court, it seems to me that the question of whether the issues drawn in question here is a very real one. 
    This isn't the case where the state courts on some whim or on a refusal to face the question had refused to decide the federal question and thereby precluded this Court from deciding it. 
    This is a case where in good faith and in good conscience, very imminent courts below all felt that they were on safe ground in accepting this Court's rationale as to the timeliness of the challenge to the waiver. 
    Whether this waiver of immunity is coerced will be litigated if this defendant is prosecuted.

    In other words, it's not Counselman against Hitchcock immunity and it is not complete immunity. 
    It is not the type of immunity that will replace the privilege against self-incrimination because it does leave the possibility of prosecution on fresh evidence. 
    What it is, is this sort of limited testimonial protection.

    Do you claim (Voice Overlap) have been more than that.
speaker="h_richard_uviller" startTime="8006.918" stopTime="8043.046">
    Mr. H. Richard Uviller 
    Positively. 
    And not only do I claim but in so holding, the court below specifically cited 2447 and 2447 is the New York statute by which complete protection against any future indictment or prosecution is provided for. 
    So when I use the word immunity this afternoon so there's no mistake, I mean complete immunity, Counselman against Hitchcock immunity. 
    And if I mean anything less like in Laino or in Steuding, I'll try to modify the word by going at either protection or unlimited immunity or a Steuding type of immunity. 
    So, this -- the Steuding --

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Assuming the Stevens had reason to believe that he would get some kind of immunity if he answered the questions, how would he know whether he was going to get the Counselman type of immunity or the Steuding type of immunity? 
    And would not that make a difference and would not a man have a right to make a decision depending upon whether he got one or the other?
speaker="h_richard_uviller" startTime="8073.540" stopTime="8100.007">
    Mr. H. Richard Uviller 
    There's a simple answer to that Mr. Chief Justice I think, and that is that he was expressly and explicitly told by the judge prior to being held in contempt for the first time. 
    Because the judge told him at that time that this case was indistinguishable from the Regan case and he was represented at that time on a very competent counsel who had cited all these cases to the Court and obviously know the meaning of Regan. 
    And the Regan type of immunity was the complete immunity.

    What do you say about Raley here?
speaker="h_richard_uviller" startTime="8101.899" stopTime="8154.966">
    Mr. H. Richard Uviller 
    Well, what I say about Raley Mr. Justice Clark is simply this. 
    Raley was the most peculiar case and indeed, I would venture to say that the case was sui generis because if you recall in the Raley case, witnesses before the state investigating committee were encouraged virtually to assert their privilege against self-incrimination. 
    They did it repeatedly. 
    It was always clarified, the chairman treated them very graciously indeed and there was not one word said to anybody at that time to indicate that this privilege was not available to them. 
    Then no one would hold that after they deserted the privilege all this time, somebody finds out that there's an automatic immunity provision in the State of Ohio and that they were compelled to answer. 
    They didn't have the privilege at all and they were all charged with contempt for asserting the privilege. 
    And well that seems to me is most outrageous sort of case and probably sui generis and this Court seems to me quite sensibly concluding that there was a kind of an entrapment.

    One way, we haven't -- we haven't got somewhat the same situation here because repeatedly, the District Attorney said to him, “Now you may waive your -- you may waive your privilege at any -- no. 
    You may claim your privilege at anytime but I want to tell you, no matter what your lawyer tells you or no matter what anybody tells you, we're going to prosecute you on your own testimony.” 
    Now, if you testify now, isn't that just about as strong as we had in Raley?
speaker="h_richard_uviller" startTime="8187.734" stopTime="8217.714">
    Mr. H. Richard Uviller 
    No, with all due respect Mr. Chief Justice, I suggest it's exactly the contrary because what is he being told there in effect? 
    He's being told, you don't have a privilege against self-incrimination. 
    He's being told by everybody including the Court, “You signed the waiver of immunity. 
    The waiver of immunity is valid. 
    The waiver of immunity deprives you of your privilege. 
    You can't assert your privilege, you have no privilege.” 
    And he can persist in asserting it and he's held in contempt for that. 
    There was in the one case that he is told he did have the privilege and punished for asserting it and the other, he is told he didn't and was punished for asserting it.

    -- it depends on how you read that language of the District Attorney.

    Well, that only occurred one other time and that was before a different grand jury where he did claim this -- his privilege. 
    He wasn't told that he -- he would -- look, that is a correct advice, is it not Mr. Chief Justice? 
    In other words the (Inaudible) -- the District Attorney it seems to me is obligated to tell the defendant that if you waive your privilege, that means that what you say maybe used against you. 
    Now we intend -- we don't intend to give you immunity. 
    We want you to know that you are a potential defendant which means that there's a likelihood that if you say anything incriminating, we will use it against you. 
    That's only fair it seems to me to the witness.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="8310.136" stopTime="8323.181">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    It seemed fair to me too but I wouldn't go on and tell him now, you also have the right however to claim your privilege any time you want. 
    Now what does he get from the claim of privilege under those circumstances?
speaker="h_richard_uviller" startTime="8323.181" stopTime="8412.258">
    Mr. H. Richard Uviller 
    How he -- I -- this -- unfortunately the record is maybe somewhat ambiguous but I think a fair reading of the record Mr. Chief Justice indicates that what he was doing at that time was instructing the witness that he had a right not to sign the waiver at all and to stand on his privilege. 
    Now it's true he said at any time but if you look at the context in which at anytime occurs before he'd ever executed the waiver, I think that it is clear that what he meant was at anytime up to the time he was sworn. 
    You may refuse to come in here under a waiver and stand on your privilege. 
    That's your right which it was. 
    And in assessing whether he want to do that, I must tell you that if you come in here under a waiver you will be prosecuted. 
    Now there maybe a slight ambiguity there but I don't think it's substantial and I think that the petitioner understood it full well because on the subsequent occasion he refused to sign his waiver and did stand on his Fifth Amendment right. 
    He is a police officer. 
    He has considerable experience. 
    He is lieutenant who has passed two police examinations to achieve that rank and I think it's fair to think that he took the reasonable explanation of it and did not think. 
    Particularly, he said, he was told by the court again you see, before he was held in contempt the first time. 
    The court again said to him, you don't have a privilege. 
    Now you answer this question. 
    He could not possibly have thought that he had -- after signing the waiver that he still have the right to assert a privilege at any time. 
    I think that's really inconsistent with the plain meaning of the record. 
    Thank you. 
   
   
   
   Argument of Eugene Gressman
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="8412.258" stopTime="8415.369">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Gressman.
speaker="eugene_gressman" startTime="8415.369" stopTime="8546.132">
    Mr. Eugene Gressman 
    Mr. Chief Justice, I only want to make two brief remarks in connection with the -- these cases. 
    The first goes to the point Your Honor was just speaking about the applicability of the Raley case. 
    It seems to me the longer the discussion has ensued in these cases, the more obvious it becomes that we have an almost exact parallel with the Raley situation where the defendant was told expressly on numerous occasions. 
    On almost every occasion he appeared before the grand jury up to and including the last time on January 11th, 1965. 
    He again, as repeat -- is repeated to him referring to the original appearance in there that you were told at that time that you could invoke the federal privilege against self-incrimination at anytime. 
    This was repeated to him on the second occasion when he appeared before the grand jury as well as at the first time. 
    So that I think that -- then he add to that effect that the immunity possibilities were never discussed or referred to by the Assistant District Attorney. 
    In the contrary, he was told expressly that it's the position of the people that you do not have immunity and it was stated to him that you can and will be prosecuted on the basis of any incriminating testimony that you will give or may give before this grand jury. 
    Then we find subsequent to these convictions the flat statement by the Appellate Division and by the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit that you had absolute immunity under these ambiguous provisions of New York State law. 
    That is exactly what the Ohio Supreme Court had held in Raley. 
    After they've gotten through those confusing proceedings without any reference to an immunity statute, subsequently, the convictions are affirmed. 
    And for the first time that it is stated affirmatively that the Raley defendants had immunity all the time.

    Mr. Eugene Gressman 
    I think that that's a legal -- illegal analysis could be made to that effect. 
    Yes, I think that -- but I -- and I don't think the Raley situation was one of legal analysis as it was a fairness in the minds and in the treatment of the witnesses in those cases and so here, I suggest that it's not a question of the legal analysis as it is of the -- what the defendant was fairly led to assume what was available to him.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="8599.222" stopTime="8622.616">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, didn't the -- at least the Appellate Division decision intervene between his first conviction and his third? 
    And didn't -- hadn't the Appellate Division then at least as to that later refusal. 
    Have -- hadn't the Appellate Division said flatly that there are -- as you say flatly that there was immunity and didn't -- didn't he know then he -- at the least, the time of his later refusal --
speaker="eugene_gressman" startTime="8622.616" stopTime="8623.310">
    Mr. Eugene Gressman 
    Possibly --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="8623.310" stopTime="8625.868">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    -- that the New York court had said he did have immunity.
speaker="eugene_gressman" startTime="8625.868" stopTime="8640.341">
    Mr. Eugene Gressman 
    Well, that again -- that when he was -- on the basis of his third conviction in the third contempt that occurred. 
    Again, it was then repeated to him that he had the right to assert the privilege. 
    So while that --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="8640.341" stopTime="8644.140">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    No, but if he had the right to assert it, there's also immunity if he answers them.
speaker="eugene_gressman" startTime="8644.140" stopTime="8757.518">
    Mr. Eugene Gressman 
    Well, again as a matter of legal anal -- treatment of the problem, yes. 
    But as a matter of practical matter, that was not certainly indicated to the defendant at the time he was called upon the third time to answer this incriminating question. 
    But in any event, I think the Assistant District Attorney here, Mr. Uviller has very candidly observed and properly so that the immunity of 2447 does not operate automatically that there is room -- a necessary room here for discretion. 
    And in answer to the Chief Justice, he conceded that the District Attorney did not exercise a discretion to bring the complete immunity under 2447 into operation. 
    And I suggest that is the only way that this record can be analyzed and the only way in which this immunity problem can be handled that it was not an automatic immunity and if there'd be any question as to it, certainly I suggest that there should be some form of a remand to the state courts either to determine the extent of any immunity if there was such or under the Murphy decision to have a completely new proceeding before the grand jury in which the rights of this defendant are adequately and properly and fairly explained to him. 
    And you will note at the very end of Murphy v. Waterfront Commission in remanding the case in that instance, they cite the Raley case where there was this confusion and the unfairness which certainly has been exhibited in this case. 
    Thank you.
