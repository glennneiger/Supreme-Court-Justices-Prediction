    Mr. Peter Hearn 
    Thank you sir. 
    This appeal from the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania challenges the constitutionality of a Pennsylvania statute which provides that when a defendant is acquitted of a misdemeanor, the jury may, nevertheless, impose court costs upon him enforceable by commitment to jail. 
    In this case, following defendant's acquittal, the costs were assessed upon him. He thereupon filed a motion for relief of costs which was granted by the trial court because it held the act was unconstitutional in that it was void for vagueness and that it violated certain procedural due process protections. 
    The statute --

speaker="peter_hearn" startTime="159.647" stopTime="189.392">
    Mr. Peter Hearn 
    The statute itself contains no standard whatsoever on its face. 
    It merely provides that the jury may impose costs upon an acquitted defendant. 
    If the jury does, the court and to use the statutory language, “shall forth with pass sentence to that effect and order him to be committed to the jail of the county until the costs are paid, unless he gives security.”
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="189.392" stopTime="191.942">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    How old is this case?
speaker="peter_hearn" startTime="191.942" stopTime="352.657">
    Mr. Peter Hearn 
    The particular statute was enacted in 1860. 
    However, its predecessor was -- which was exactly the same in statutory language was enacted in 1804. 
    Therefore, on its face, the statute provides no standard which restricts in any manner the uncontrolled and arbitrary discretion of the jury in its practice. 
    Furthermore, the decisions have not removed this unconstitutional vagueness and I submit that the jury charge in this particular case was typical of jury charges in Pennsylvania and was in-line with the Pennsylvania authorities which attempted to construe this act. 
    In this case, the jury was charged where defendant is found not guilty of a misdemeanor, but the jury finds that he is been guilty of some misconduct less than the offense which is charged, but nevertheless, misconduct of some kind as a result of which, he should be required to pay some penalty short of conviction. 
    The costs of prosecution may be placed upon him if his misconduct has given rise to the prosecution. 
    This charge stems primarily from an 1818 Pennsylvania decision which construes the act of 1804 which as I stated to Mr. Justice Brennan was the exact predecessor of the interns of statutory wording of the act which is now before the Court. 
    In that case, the court construed the statute and the situations in which it would be imposed as saying that costs would be imposed upon a defendant whose conduct may have been reprehensible or whose innocence may have been doubtful and the costs are imposed for impropriety of conduct or grounds of suspicion. 
    The result therefore is that not only did -- does the act not have a standard on its face but as construed, it is unconstitutionality vague. 
    There is no standard to guide the jury in its deliberations. 
    Furthermore, a trial court in attempting to ascertain whether the jury abused its discretion has no standard to guide it.

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr.

    Mr. Peter Hearn

    Well, I do know that in a case pending the results of this appeal, the costs have exceeded $2000. 
    That case involved a misdemeanor of macing and involving political activity wherein there was a verdict of acquittal, but costs in excess of $2000 were assessed against the defendant and a motion for -- in arrest of judgment has been taken and it has been held pending the results of this appeal. 
    I -- there's also another Pennsylvania case involving criminal liable where -- also, awaiting the results of this appeal where I believe, although it does not appear from the published opinion that the costs exceeded $1000 and in that case, there was also a verdict of acquittal.

    No, sir. 
    It applies only in the cases of misdemeanors which are tried by jury. 
    It does not apply in the case of summary offenses nor does it apply in the case of felonies and in the case of felonies and misdemeanors -- excuse me, summary offenses, it is expressly proscribed by statute.

    Mr. Peter Hearn 
    Yes sir it is.

speaker="peter_hearn" startTime="539.572" stopTime="540.807">
    Mr. Peter Hearn 
    No, it does not?
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="540.807" stopTime="546.602">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    In other words, you not only have a time for misdemeanor with the right to jury trial, but you actually have to have a jury trial?
speaker="peter_hearn" startTime="546.602" stopTime="636.661">
    Mr. Peter Hearn 
    That's right. 
    But Mr. Justice Fortas, I might point out that in a -- another count tried at the same time as the case here on appeal involving the same appellant, there was a directed verdict for the defendant, but the issue of costs was still submitted to the jury with the possibility that they would be placed upon the acquitted defendant. 
    However in that case, they were placed upon the county, but I think this shows that the practice is that even though the case on the misdemeanor is not sufficient to take it to the jury, still the costs issue does go. 
    So that -- as construed the standard here provides no basis for an appellate court on review to determine exactly why the jury acted as it did. 
    It's entirely possible for the jury to punish some defendants and not others, merely as it chooses, entirely in its arbitrary discretion. 
    While Pennsylvania is the only state which I know of which has the statute, I submit that other states would not be precluded from enacting such a device to abuse defendants if this statute were affirmed here?

    The -- the charge as indicated in the appendix to our brief directs the jury to -- if they decide to place the costs upon the pros -- private prosecutor to name him and in this case, it would be as I understand the term that complaining witness.

    Mr. Peter Hearn 
    Well sir, I think I would because -- while it's not a strong case, it still involves no standard for the imposition of these costs. 
    Yes, it is a different case because a prosecutor always has the option of whether he wishes to embark upon this particular part -- area, whereas the defendant does not. 
    But even so, I would think that there is no standard for this particular county because even in that case, the fine or the costs may be enforced by commitment to jail.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="794.618" stopTime="825.389">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    There's some indication of a -- some sort of a standard on page 2 (a) of your brief. 
    The judge's instructions to the jury saying that if they decided that the -- if you find that the prosecution instead of being brought in good faith for the reasons set forth in the charge was on the contrary brought out of malice or some ill will or other improper motive, they -- the jury should then impose the costs on the prosecutor. 
    So at least, there's that much of a standard set out for him, isn't it?
speaker="peter_hearn" startTime="825.389" stopTime="826.190">
    Mr. Peter Hearn 
    Yes, sir. 
    I --

    Mr. Peter Hearn 
    Yes, sir. 
    That's correct. 
    I -- that is exactly correct, yes, sir. 
    So that the -- if another State did enact a statute of this sort with which to abuse acquitted defendants, I think that it is entirely possible that it would sweep within its purview perfectly legal and even constitutionally protected acts. 
    Certainly, in the areas of political activity or civil rights demonstrations or the like, it would be entirely possible for a jury to be completely out of sympathy with the costs which the defendant espoused, even though there had been no case made out on misdemeanor.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="884.882" stopTime="887.455">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Is there any other state that allows this?
speaker="peter_hearn" startTime="887.455" stopTime="1019.454">
    Mr. Peter Hearn 
    None that I know of. 
    I believe Mr. Justice Harlan, that Pennsylvania is the only state. 
    The vagueness of the statute permits this arbitrariness. 
    However, there are further and additional constitutional infirmities which deal with its implementation at trial. 
    Here, there are numerous procedural due process objections, each of which is sufficient to render the act unconstitutional, but taken cumulatively, they leave no doubt. 
    Initially, there's a lack of requisite notice of the grounds for which this penalty may be imposed. 
    The defendant has no idea, only the costs may be assessed. 
    The only hearing is the hearing on the misdemeanor itself. 
    There is no hearing on this misconduct charge. 
    Therefore, any defendant who seeks to show that he -- the absence of misconduct or the existence of good conduct, would not be permitted to do so. 
    The basic defense is further prejudiced by the fact that he might have to take the witness stand in his own defense merely to rebut the cost possibility whereas otherwise he would not. 
    And under Pennsylvania practice, if the defendant seeking to rebut against costs offered evidence of good character, the prosecution could come back with the -- a record of prior convictions which it would not be otherwise able to do. 
    So that the -- the defendant is forced to elect, and if he elects to defend against costs, he prejudices his defense on the merit. 
    Accordingly, I respectfully request that this Court reverse the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania and hold that the Act is unconstitutional insofar as if it -- as it is applied to acquitted the defendants. 
    Thank you. 
   
   
   
   Argument of John S. Halsted

    We'll recess now.

    Mr. John S. Halsted 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    I think at the outset, it might be helpful for the Court if they perhaps understood the basic position of costs in criminal cases in Pennsylvania. 
    To answer some of the questions, costs in felony cases follow the conviction. 
    If the felon is found not guilty the costs are paid by the county. 
    In misdemeanor cases only as we have here, the costs can be placed three places by the jury; on the prosecutor, on the defendant or in the county. 
    The jury also has the option of splitting them between the prosecutor and the defendant.

    Mr. John S. Halsted 
    I cannot -- Mr. Justice Stewart. 
    Usually the court in these matter charges of the jury that police officers or rather other public officials during their duty should not have the costs placed upon them unless it's a clear abuse of their power. 
    In other words, clearly a case where the officer was using his authority to persecute someone, but it -- it applies to all prosecutors, be they -- officials or a private prosecutor --

    Mr. John S. Halsted 
    You can only speculate from the history of the Act. 
    Back in 1791 when the legislator first started to deal with this, the preamble says, that if the defendant always paid the cost whether he was guilty or innocent and that this worked as injustice on the defendant and therefore, they sought to relieving. 
    In 1804, they reenacted the statute and they added the part putting the defendant and the prosecutor making them possibly both of them liable. 
    And then in 1860, they reenacted it with some more embellishments providing for the divisions and a percentage placed in their cost.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1553.308" stopTime="1571.916">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well -- may I ask, this -- is there any reason that it has been stated why they would do this with the jury? 
    Why they would have a jury assess cost whether if a man didn't waive the jury, it didn't have a jury that the Court could not assess which cost against him?
speaker="john_s_halsted" startTime="1571.916" stopTime="1590.440">
    Mr. John S. Halsted 
    I have no idea unless they felt that the jury were better able to assess what they thought was improper behavior which led to the prosecution. 
    And the any other reason that I can give possibly when the statute was written, I would suppose that the jury trial were more prevalent. 
    I'm only speculating on.

    Justice Byron R. White

    Mr. John S. Halsted 
    There -- there some dispute of that. 
    As they say in England that this was not so but the Pennsylvania, the early Pennsylvania case say that at least in Pennsylvania and there's evidence in Delaware, some cases there that guilty or not guilty, the defendant paid the cost. 
    And there's a --

    Of -- the only thing I can observe is what the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania observed that may the public interest in felony prosecutions was great enough that they would bear the costs in all cases. 
    You might from the legislative history go further and speculate that it's the misdemeanor cases which are most likely to arise out of personal feuds if you will or things of that nature. 
    And that the -- perhaps the public doesn't have the greatest interest in some of them as they do in the felonies. 
    I would with regard to the summary matters of the justice of peace has broad power to dispose of the costs as he sees fit.

    Mr. John S. Halsted 
    I see. 
    Of -- our first point is that Mr. Hearn makes the point for the appellant that there's no guidelines in the statute and we say, you'd have to look to the cases which have developed and applied this over the 161 years that's been in operation and traditionally from these cases the guidelines are -- if the court charges them some misconduct which has given rise to this prosecution. 
    In other words, some possibly antisocial behavior which you feel that the county should not have to bear the cost for the defendants' behavior and you wish to punish him, if you will, in some regard and also relieve the county from the burden from these costs. 
    So the statute does not contain this language. 
    Only the way the Court supply it and the way that the Pennsylvania Supreme Court has interpret it, they say, “Of course, you could not make a defendant pay cost in a case where his conduct was completely unrelated to the -- to the prosecution. 
    For instance, it would be abuse of discretion, I believe, should the jury quite the cost on a defendant who is found not guilty because there was some doubt about identity or he'd being the person who was actually perpetrated the misdemeanor.

    Mr. John S. Halsted 
    That's right. 
    It's not even -- it doesn't have to be sentenced that way, although courts usually do.

    Yes, yes.

    Mr. John S. Halsted 
    The next point that say that the statute puts the defendant on clear notice that this is a possibility. 
    It doesn't say under what conditions but it says if you go to trial and if the grand jury finds a prima facie case and if the Commonwealth makes out a prima facie case and the case goes to a jury and the jury finds you not guilty, you may not be off the hook, you still may have to pay the cost of prosecution if they decide that the -- your conduct has led to the prosecution and that we say that statute clearly notifies the defendants that this is a possibility. 
    There's an objection that there are no other guidelines. 
    We would say that if the evidentiary rules which control the evidence which would be produced at the trial of misdemeanor would keep excess or nondescript or unessential facts from the juries so that the -- it wouldn't be any prejudicial information come in because they are circumscribed by the rules of evidence. 
    And say that there's a further safeguard that the court, if they feel the jury has abused there discretion and clearly, mismanaged the question of costs, the Court can relieve the defendant or the prosecutor if it seize fit of from the payment of these costs. 
    So we say, those are the safeguards which are defined them these statutes --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="2086.775" stopTime="2097.685">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    What are the guidelines given to the jury? 
    Did I understand you to say when they had told that if you put the defendant, you may also assess costs against? 
    What are the guidelines of the Court?
speaker="john_s_halsted" startTime="2097.685" stopTime="2115.325">
    Mr. John S. Halsted 
    The -- the guidelines traditionally used are -- if you find that the defendant has been guilty or has committed some misconduct which has given arise to the prosecution in this case, you may assess the costs against it. 
    If you find that --

    He's been guilty of some --

    Mr. John S. Halsted 
    No! 
    No, which has given rise to this prosecution, that is the way it's usually charged. 
    Some misconduct --

speaker="john_s_halsted" startTime="2139.784" stopTime="2193.124">
    Mr. John S. Halsted 
    I would suppose so. 
    If I may take the facts of this case as an illustration, the defendant here was charged with pointing and discharging a deadly weapon which is a misdemeanor. 
    His defense at trial was it -- it was a blank pistol which he discharged. 
    In other words, no -- if the pistol is inoperative, then there's no crime under Pennsylvania law. 
    But the jury, I suppose found it because he discharged this blank pistol and because the people brought the prosecution had no way of knowing it was blank until he so testified that his conduct had given a rise to the prosecution and that he should pay the costs. 
    That -- that's how it works. 
    To answer you question, it is possible to having pay the cost for something conduct it is not a crime.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2193.124" stopTime="2224.615">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Suppose this conduct was in connection with an assault on someone and the defense was self-defense, no other defense except just self-defense and the jury found that he was not guilty because others -- of his defense of self defense and then it chose to assess these costs against him, would that be sustained?
speaker="john_s_halsted" startTime="2224.615" stopTime="2254.844">
    Mr. John S. Halsted 
    Well, I could -- I think it probably would if -- it was his conduct with which gave rise to this and the jury felt that he was very lucky in missing the conviction so to speak and should relieve the county of the payment of cost. 
    It's a case-by-case application. 
    That's why the jury, I suppose, is asked to make the determination. 
    They are ones who have to view the facts and come to some conclusion about it.
