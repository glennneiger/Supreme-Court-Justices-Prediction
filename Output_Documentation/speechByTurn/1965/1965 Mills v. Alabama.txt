    This case concerns Section 285 of the Alabama Corrupt Practices Act, regulating election practices. 
    And specifically, that portion of the Act which provides as follows. 
    It is a corrupt practice for any person on election day to do any electioneering or to solicit any votes for or against the election or nomination of any candidate, or in support of or in opposition to any proposition that is being voted on, on the day on which the election affecting such candidates or propositions is being held. 
    Mr. Mills is editor of the Birmingham Post-Herald, a morning newspaper published daily in Birmingham, Alabama, and distributed throughout the State of Alabama. 
    The circulation of this paper is approximately 85,000 as being the second largest newspaper in the State.

speaker="alfred_swedlaw" startTime="115.644" stopTime="127.015">
    Mr. Alfred Swedlaw 
    Yes, sir. 
    There's an afternoon paper, the sister paper of the Birmingham Post, it's the Birmingham News and it has a circulation of approximately 130,000, I think Your Honor.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="127.015" stopTime="128.713">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    And this is the only morning newspaper?
speaker="alfred_swedlaw" startTime="128.713" stopTime="326.285">
    Mr. Alfred Swedlaw 
    This is the only morning newspaper. 
    On November 6 of 1962, a municipal election was held in Birmingham to determine whether the existing commission form of city government would be retained or would be replaced by the so-called mayor-council form. 
    Mr. Mills authored an editorial which was published on election day in his newspaper. 
    The editorial appears in full on page 25 of the record and as Appendix K on page 35 of the appellant's brief. 
    In this editorial, Mr. Mills criticized the then mayor of Birmingham for promising pay raises to city employees and for saying that he would instruct city employees to neither give out news to nor discuss with reporters of the Birmingham Post-Herald, or its sister paper, the Birmingham News, any public business. 
    The Mills editorial stated that the proposed pay raises were -- was another good reason why the voter should vote overwhelmingly today in favor of mayor-council government. 
    As to the news blackout threatened by the mayor, the editorial comment was, if Mayor Hanes displays such arrogant disregard of the public right to know on the eve of election, what can we expect in the future if the city commission should be retained. 
    Birmingham and the people of Birmingham deserve a better break. 
    A vote for mayor-council government will give it to them. 
    The publication of this editorial marked the beginning of the chain of events ultimately leading to our appearance here this morning. 
    A criminal complaint was filed against Mr. Mills on November the 13th, 1962 issued from the Jefferson County Criminal Court charging Mills, head by the editorial in question. 
    Electioneered or solicited votes on election day in contravention of Section 285 of the Alabama Corrupt Practices Act. 
    If guilty of this misdemeanor as charged, Mr. Mills is subject to a fine of not more than $500 and he may also be imprisoned in the county jail or sentenced at hard labor for six months, but not more than six months on behalf of the county. 
    Demurrers to the complaint were filed on Mills' behalf, testing the constitutionality of the statute as applied to the editorial on both the Alabama and the federal constitutions. 
    The lower court -- the criminal court sustained these demurrers thereby, in effect, declaring the statute as applied unconstitutional.

    I see.
speaker="alfred_swedlaw" startTime="344.857" stopTime="600.659">
    Mr. Alfred Swedlaw 
    The statute having been declared unconstitutional, as provided by Alabama procedure, the State appealed directly to the Supreme Court of Alabama. 
    Reversing the judgment of the trial court, the Supreme Court of Alabama held that Section 285 clearly applied to the Mills editorial and that the statute as applied was constitutional under the police powers for the State of Alabama. 
    The order of the court remanded the case to the trial court. 
    We filed a timely application on behalf of Mr. Mills and this was overruled by the Alabama Supreme Court. 
    Mills then appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States and this Court by its order of December the 6th, 1965, postponed jurisdiction for further consideration to the hearing of the case on its merits. 
    Under those circumstances, we will address ourselves first to the question of this Court's jurisdiction, if it please the Court. 
    The jurisdictional issue in this case arises because on its phase, the judgment of the Alabama Supreme Court does not necessarily conclude the litigation between the State of Alabama and Mr. Mills. 
    Alabama procedure would permit Mills on an actual trial of the case below to interpose defenses other than the unconstitutionality of the statute in question. 
    In reality, however, Mills has no other defense either in fact or in law to the charge against him. 
    He freely concedes that he wrote the editorial complained of and caused it to be published on election day. 
    And the Alabama Supreme Court specifically held that this constituted a violation of the statute and the statute as thus applied is constitutional. 
    Therefore, may it please the Court, the federal question, that is the constitutionality or not of the Alabama statute is the only question remaining in this case. 
    There is nothing more to be decided. 
    Under these circumstances, the decision of the Alabama Supreme Court constituted a final judgment for the purposes of Title 28 U.S.C. Section 1257. 
    In the case of Pope versus Atlantic Coast Line Railroad Company which was decided by this Court in 1953, a railroad employee invoking the Federal Employers Liability Act sued his employee -- employer for injury sustained in the course of employment. 
    The injuries occurred in Georgia but the employee sued in the Alabama courts and the railroad filed a proceeding to restrain the Alabama action. 
    The trial court sustained the general demurrer which raised the provisions of the federal statute as a bar for the power of the Georgia Court to issue the injunction. 
    The Georgia Supreme Court reversed the trial court's order and the employee appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States. 
    As an out case, the jurisdictional question in Pope was whether or not the judgment of the Georgia Supreme Court was final. 
    The Supreme Court held that it was a final judgment because the issue was right for adjudication. 
    There is Hill. 
    The petitioner conceded that he had no other defense in opposed and that his case rested upon his claim under the federal statute and nothing else.

    -- to act. 
    But it's an alternative -- it's an alternate basis of decision in the Curry case, the Court cited Pope and relied on Pope which was apart completely from the question of the jurisdiction to act, power as I understand it. 
    The Pope --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="904.001" stopTime="906.404">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    You're most completely on the Pope approach.

    Justice Byron R. White 
    But you also -- as I read your brief, you also rely on not because on its facts the same on Dombrowski notion that this is a First Amendment problem and in that sense that even if these were not a final judgment for purposes of our review, it may be decided.

    Mr. Alfred Swedlaw 
    We think -- we think this is very true and a very cogent reason. 
    The Dombrowski case of course involved the question of -- the doctrine of abstention. 
    But the analogy is certainly clear. 
    We feel that Mr. Mills should not be subjected to a criminal prosecution and conviction in order to obtain a declaration of his constitutional rights. 
    This matter has -- it began in 1962 of November, some two and a half years have already elapsed since that time and we are now after that long delay here in the Supreme Court. 
    If we are compelled to go back to the Alabama courts and went our way through the torturous appellate procedure to get back here, it would be anticipated that another two or two and a half years would expire.

    Exactly, Justice Black. 
    We feel that not only -- not only would this be an intolerable situation insofar as the appellant is concerned but there are other rights besides those of Mr. Mills here involved as in the Dombrowski case. 
    The question of the effect that the Supreme Court's decision has had on First Amendment rights in Alabama must be considered. 
    The broad sweep of the Alabama Corrupt Practices Act to encompass an editorial has necessarily in the words of Dombrowski had a “chilling effect”, if you please, on the Alabama press generally. 
    The blanket of silence which has descended upon the press of Alabama each election day since the arrest of Mr. Mills continues to insulate the people of Alabama from editorial comment and press information to which we feel they are entitled and that they're entitled to this without restraint.

    Now, you say we're bound to regard the editorial as electioneering or solicitation of votes. 
    And the pamphlet in the example I'm putting to you would the electioneering or soliciting of votes that both occur on election day.

    Mr. Alfred Swedlaw 
    Whatever form the electioneering may take. 
    We see no legitimate legislative purpose in this sought of restraint. 
    This is not a case of a man being prosecuted for standing within 20 or 30 feet of an election booth and blocking or harassing people coming to vote. 
    This is not a regulation of conduct. 
    This is a regulation of speech. 
    And we see no legitimate interest for the State of Alabama in such restraint. 
    In fact, we -- it's our contention that the public interest lies completely in the other direction. 
    Not in the direction of curtailing expression but in the direction of giving full vent to public expression concerning matters of general interest and public interest elections particularly. 
    Now, as far as the construction of the statute being binding on this Court irrespective of the -- when it's emanated -- the expression emanated, it is binding on this Court, the Alabama Supreme Court's application of it. 
    This was decided in Herndon versus Lowry, in the Terminiello case just to the same effect as though -- the statute had said that no editorial shall be written or published on election day.

speaker="alfred_swedlaw" startTime="1807.902" stopTime="2085.985">
    Mr. Alfred Swedlaw 
    Yes sir, this is true. 
    We feel that -- as I've said in the Schneider case trying to regulate the distribution of pamphlets on public streets under the guise of this being a regulation that would keep the street from being littered. 
    And this statute was struck down under the guise of regulating conduct, those statutes regulated free expression. 
    Now, that's exactly what is happening in the Alabama statute. 
    It would be only of small step from the Alabama Supreme Court's decision in the Mills case to say -- well, for a benevolent legislature to say well it would be in the interest of the public, we think, in this -- in times of trouble and stress such as we are now enduring, it would be in the public interest that there'd be some surcease, some respite from all of these tension, all of the bad news. 
    And therefore, let's say that only on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, we'll have no editorial appear in newspapers, we'll have no television, news broadcast of any sort because the people are entitled to this sort of euphoric atmosphere in which their tranquility is undisturbed. 
    This is the danger of the Mills case that's decided by Supreme Court of Alabama. 
    This is speech control. 
    If you will, this is thought control. 
    If I may just take a moment and quote from the Mills' opinion to give the Court an idea of what was here involved. 
    This Court, this is the Alabama Supreme Court. 
    This Court holds in accordance with the great weight of authority that a law cannot be held to be invalid because unreasonable unless and until it appears beyond reasonable controversy that it necessarily impairs to the point of practical destruction, a right safeguarded by the Constitution. 
    As it already has been pointed out, the law under consideration lies within the police power field and impairs, and please listen -- and impairs only the right of free expression. 
    Now, by whatever theory or by whatever rationale this decision is tested, we think that the Alabama statute as applied to Mr. Mills was faux. 
    The Alabama Supreme Court and this is fundamentally objectionable, is that -- is the assumption by the Court that the State has the power to provide the voters of Alabama an intellectually, antiseptic atmosphere on election day. 
    This is not true. 
    This is a monstrous assumption, if you will, in a free society. 
    This is the danger of the Mills case. 
    The gradual, by slow degrees, encroachment on First Amendment rights by the states or by the Congress, it should not be tolerated except in very clear cases. 
    And then as this Court has pointed out in the Roth case, the door should be left ajar only for the purpose of restricting what have to be restricted in the public interest, and then the door should be tightly closed because the matter of free expression is not just free expression, it is the essence as this Court has recognized, it is the essence of self-government. 
    And we ask that the Court take jurisdiction and then it reversed the Alabama Supreme Court, my colleague, Mr. Perrine will argue the vagueness objection to the statute. 
    Thank you.

    Alright, yes sir, I would be glad to.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    You don't need to use all your time but we would like to know --
speaker="kenneth_perrine" startTime="2108.878" stopTime="2226.440">
    Mr. Kenneth Perrine 
    I would like to save some for rebuttal because mine is all mixed up in that situation. 
    This statute, Section 285 provides that for anyone, anywhere in the State of Alabama to communicate with anyone on any election day, and it could be interpreted as being solicitation for electioneering. 
    Now, we have no quarrel whatsoever with a -- the Corrupt Practices Act as such which is directed to particular and specific conduct, but where it goes out into the field as so vague as to what might be any solicitation or any electioneering on election day, then we go into a field whereby an intelligent person might well ask but what do they mean. 
    What conduct is subscribed in this particular situation. 
    Now, what is it that I might do or I might not do that would be consistent with electioneering and solicitation? 
    Now, while we recognize mostly that solicitation and electioneering is understood by the average layman, yet we find that there are many faces of endeavor in which we could wonder whether or not we are absolutely in that particular category. 
    If you wish to take literally this field of solicitation as it is here, it would mean simply this. 
    That upon election day, that a person could not even speak to his wife and ask her to go down to the polls and vote for his friend because that would be solicitation or electioneering.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2226.440" stopTime="2227.755">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Or vice versa?
speaker="kenneth_perrine" startTime="2227.755" stopTime="2288.113">
    Mr. Kenneth Perrine 
    Or vice versa. 
    Usually, it's vice versa. 
    A Chamber of Commerce, I believe, has been mentioned. 
    A Chamber of Commerce who has been sponsoring a bond movement to be voted on, on a particular day, and also, as any Chamber of Commerce has done has gone into an active campaign for getting out the vote. 
    And yet if on election day, they proceeded with this campaign of getting out the vote, it could be interpreted as it was in this statute -- in this case by the Supreme Court of Alabama. 
    It could be interpreted that the members of the Chamber of Commerce were guilty of electioneering. 
    Because it could be said and truthfully so, that their interest, one of their interest not only in getting out to vote as the civic proposition but their interest in getting out the vote was to pass the bond issue in which they were interested in. 
    Then we have --
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="2288.113" stopTime="2302.256">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    I gather that these two rely to this argument, doesn't it, pretty much under First Amendment aspect of electioneering and soliciting and if you have some business coverage in which you said were dealing with First Amendment finding.
speaker="kenneth_perrine" startTime="2302.256" stopTime="2303.440">

    Mr. Kenneth Perrine 
    There is no definitive wording here that we might know what solicitation would be. 
    For example, it is common practice in all campaigns to use billboards for the candidate to express his platform and what have you, alright. 
    They say no election -- there shall be any electioneering on election day but what is the situation with the -- this billboard still being up on election day where you can read it going to the poll, is that not electioneering? 
    And under this statute which says there can be any no electioneering, no solicitation on election day, that would be a violation of this Act and subject the candidate or whoever put up that billboard to a criminal penalty. 
    In the same terminology in all kinds of campaigns, there have been certain types of literature that has been put out by the candidates. 
    And if this is in evidence on election day, under this statute, then too it could be determined to be electioneering or solicitation.

    Mr. Kenneth Perrine 
    What did he do in this particular case, if Your Honor please, was that he first stated the facts which were news items and appeared in the news items in other parts of the paper. 
    And then he gave his comment upon that particular news item. 
    There was no question that the mayor had attempted to bribe the people on votes. 
    There's no question that the mayor had attempted to put a blackout on the city hall of news. 
    And he merely said his comment in an editorial that that is another good reason to vote for the city -- change in the city form of government.

    I think it was a solicitation of votes, yes sir.

    But I might call the attention here. 
    I believe it has been mentioned before in this particular statement in this regard that -- pamphlets that could be issued by the Chamber of Commerce obtaining the same comment. 
    But here is the solicitation by a newspaper which is only published and obtained by paid subscribers. 
    It's not some pamphlet that's handed down up on the street corners as you pass by or as you approach the polls and does not come in that category.So there is some question as to whether or not it is vague in that regard.

    Yes sir, not only -- not only to the billboards, it applies as vague as to individuals, as to the press, as to the radio, as to the TV, or in fact any type of communications under this section. 
    And I believe that that was adequately expressed by this Court originally in the Thornhill against the State of Alabama case in which this general principle was involved, that you could not subscribe to and curtail the freedom of speech unless it is specific or directed to certain conduct. 
    And this is no conduct directed here. 
    There's no particular act involved.

    He said.
speaker="kenneth_perrine" startTime="2642.745" stopTime="2819.521">
    Mr. Kenneth Perrine 
    What he said, his speech. 
    This broad no solicitation rule, I believe, was asked as far as not in the federal Corrupt Practices Act. 
    It's not in 46 states. 
    I believe there are only four states that have a similar broad rule as we have here, Alabama being one of them. 
    And none of those states has yet passed upon the constitutionality of this particular act as it had been brought before us. 
    We do not think that it can be presumed that the people will know in their own minds what is solicitation and electioneering. 
    Now, if you have specific conduct directed as it has been many times in many statutes within 100 feet of the poll, that you will not have the passing out of pamphlets, you will not have the button holding of people who would be obstructed in their line of march to the polling place, that you will not have loud sound trucks, all of those things are specific conduct which can be defined. 
    Yes, they are all electioneering and they're all solicitation but where you put any solicitation or any electioneering without any specific conduct being prescribed in that particular area, then you will think that there can be no communication. 
    Now, if you read this statute in its entirety as to what it says, this Section 285. 
    Now, we're not attacking the Corrupt Practices Act of the State of Alabama as a whole, but only this one particular section. 
    And what this one particular section says, that on any election day, anywhere in the State of Alabama, it doesn't matter if it's a municipal election, a county election, a state election or a federal election, just so an election is being held, that anyone in the State of Alabama whether it's an individual, whether it's an editor of a newspaper, whether it's a radio or television who solicits any vote or does any electioneering on that date, and as expressed that the State -- if the election as being held in Birmingham but the statement is made in Mobil, it's still a violation of this Act because there's no conduct prescribed, and there's no time element involved. 
    There's no place involved in this particular thing. 
    It was not delimited in any direction. 
    And we state that from the standpoint of being vague and indefinite, that this statute does not meet the requirements that have been handed down by this Court particularly when those requirements are infringing upon the First Amendment rights.

    Mr. Kenneth Perrine 
    I think that part of it is there and if they stop there, it would be fine but if you go on, I'll show the -- how inaccurate this section are loosely drawn and then it goes on to prescribe that any person who hires a vehicle to take into the polls, or any person who hires out a vehicle is guilty of a violation on this Act. 
    And which should mean that if a voter did not have an opportunity to go to the polls, he couldn't hire a taxicab because if he did, that's hiring a vehicle to go to the polls, and he would be guilty of a violation of this Act.

speaker="kenneth_perrine" startTime="2936.896" stopTime="2966.003">
    Mr. Kenneth Perrine 
    Yes sir, but I was illustrating how this particular section was so loosely drawn as to be unconstitutionally vague in that regard because I'm sure that they didn't intend to say that a taxicab should be guilty of a crime by merely hired it, taking a passenger to the polls. 
    And yet, that's what this statute says. 
    And therefore, in that standpoint, it would be unconstitutional restrictions of rights there.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="2966.003" stopTime="2990.949">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Suppose the labor union had a meeting on election day, got its members together and the labor union officials who rang them and pull them out to vote. 
    And they were then -- go into the polls, would you consider that the statute is unconstitutional as applied to that sort of situation?
speaker="kenneth_perrine" startTime="2990.949" stopTime="3120.727">
    Mr. Kenneth Perrine 
    Yes sir, I do because I think that that would be an invasion of their freedom of speech and their right of expression. 
    And in that connection, I might call your attention to the National Labor Relations Board in the holding of their elections. 
    And they have held their elections in the atmosphere of the clinical laboratory. 
    And yet in the National Labor Relations Board, they say that you can talk to your people as long as it's not within 100 feet of the polling place. 
    They also confined it to the times when the polls are open. 
    Here, you got a 24-hour period involved. 
    The polls open from 7:00 to 7:00 and yet a blanket of silence is placed upon all of the electorate of the State of Alabama for the entire day, not for just the time the polls were opened. 
    The National Labor Relations Board elections is only the time that the polls to vote -- or open, that the requirement is that you cannot electioneer or you cannot solicit the employee within 100 feet of the polls. 
    Now certainly, with all of the care that they have used in the NLRB in holding their elections, to say that the people of the United States cannot use their own intelligence and talk to people any time, any place in the State of Alabama for the day is such a vague proposition that it would run right into the teeth of the constitutionality and this Act should be declared unconstitutional. 
    Does that answer that portion of the question regard to the -- as I have previously stated, there's nothing here in regard to the geographical area. 
    Everywhere in the State of Alabama is restricted. 
    That is the vagueness of this particular statute. 
    And it's difficult to talk about the vagueness of the statute without going into the First Amendment rights because they're all mixed up together and the same as it is with the jurisdictional rights. 
    They're all intertwined and I've attempted to bring out at this time the vagueness with saving some time for rebuttal.

    Mr. Leslie Hall 
    Mr. Chief Justice and members of the Court. 
    I want to address myself first a little bit to this matter of jurisdiction. 
    It seems to me in my impression from the argument given by Mr. Swedlaw, was that he was asking this Court to give an advisory opinion. 
    I don't think this Court has been in the habit of doing things like that and I hope it doesn't start doing it now. 
    But be that as it may, the Court has reserved decision on the jurisdictional question in this particular case.

    Mr. Leslie Hall 
    Now, as far as this particular editorial is concerned, it didn't fall in the category of news. 
    There's a distinction between news and a distinction between editorializing and solicitation of votes on election day. 
    Something was read here with regard to the last paragraph in that particular editorial in which it said, Birmingham and the people of Birmingham deserve a better break, a vote for mayor-council government will give it to them. 
    But we should backup a little bit and go back to the preceding paragraph. 
    And the preceding paragraph has only one sentence. 
    Let's take no chances. 
    That was the thing that I believe Mr. Justice Stewart was referring to a little while ago as to what actually that editorial meant. 
    It meant to the people to come out on that particular day and vote for that particular proposition. 
    And I admit that and not against.

   Argument of Burgin Hawkins
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3604.225" stopTime="3611.439">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    But we'll -- we'll recess now, we're so close to adjournment.
speaker="burgin_hawkins" startTime="3611.439" stopTime="3811.487">
    Mr. Burgin Hawkins 
    -- prior to that time, many acts of corrupt practice at the polls, intimidation of voters getting them drunk, buying votes, there are many types of corruption. 
    Of course, those -- all those laws were passed to give the elector a right to go to the polls unmolested, undisturbed, and vote his choice. 
    Now, the question here is whether or not this statute prohibiting all electioneering and solicitation on an election day transcends the right of a legislature to put certain reasonable restraints on the Constitution, the First Amendment of the Constitution of the United States. 
    So we get right down to the mead of it, to ask ourselves, is it a reasonable regulation? 
    And I think the second question then is, what do you mean by electioneering? 
    What do you mean by solicitation? 
    How broad? 
    Does it give or does it take the breath away from a First Amendment or can the First Amendment still breathe easy with that statute on the books? 
    I think every statute has to be governed by what the intent and what evil was sought to be cured. 
    The evil sought to be cured here was to prevent corruption at an election. 
    Congress has just recently given to literate thousands in our state a franchise to exercise their right to vote. 
    And many of them, illiterates, will have many difficulties confronting them when they reach the polls. 
    And I think that this Court should give serious consideration to any acts of a legislature that will carry out the purposes and intent and a motive behind that act. 
    Now, theirs is no reason -- or no place here for idle talk about a man at a breakfast table asking his wife won't she vote for a certain candidate? 
    To me that's in a -- on a golf course, in a tennis match, that's idle conversation. 
    What we are talking about is something that is done, enacted as done with the intent to swear on election or to decide on election. 
    I even put up your billboards, talk about your billboards, they're ought to be taken down, maybe in some sense that is electioneering. 
    Maybe in some sense that billboard does solicit your vote.

    Mr. Burgin Hawkins 
    Urging people to vote?

    Mr. Burgin Hawkins 
    Justice White, I don't believe that that was the original intent of this legislature --

    -- but to prohibit people from getting numbers of people out to the polls. 
    In our county and in our state, the city organizations put plaques across the streets, “Go to the poll, this is election day. 
    Exercise your constitutional right”. 
    I don't think that that is electioneering as it was meant when it was adopted in 1915 in the State of Alabama.

    And to that, I don't think that that's -- I don't think that's what the statute means. 
    Now, I think that if you furnish for the purpose and motive of getting those people that you picked up and carry to the polls to vote your particular sentiments or to vote your particular issue or to vote for your particular candidate I think is electioneering. 
    Not just to furnish somebody or transportation to the polls, you might be on your way to the polls and pick up a passerby and carry him to the polls.

    Well, it's a question you get down to what is the meaning of the word solicitation and electioneering. 
    How broad in scope is it? 
    Is it -- does it have such a meaning that a man of common intellect and common knowledge understands this meaning or is it a meaning that that is not understood.

    Mr. Hawkins, apparently, those two words are used in different sentence though is it not, if you do any electioneering or to solicit any votes. 
    Now, what you've been talking about and what your response to Mr. Justice White, it seems to me before went in to solicit the electioneering obviously, will tend to be voter management. 
    At least (Voice Overlap) --
speaker="burgin_hawkins" startTime="3992.817" stopTime="3997.723">

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Well might it not -- might it not be broad enough to reach what Mr. Justice White suggests, just a plea, get out and vote without saying vote for whom.
speaker="burgin_hawkins" startTime="4007.048" stopTime="4012.918">
    Mr. Burgin Hawkins 
    Well, it says to for any candidate or any issue --
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="4012.918" stopTime="4037.190">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Well, but that's my point it seems -- the way that it's exactly driven. 
    It seems to distinguish between electioneering, on the one hand, and soliciting votes or promising to cast any vote or against the election or nomination of any candidate or in support of or in opposition of any proposition. 
    Electioneering seems to be something distinct from any of those other things.
speaker="burgin_hawkins" startTime="4037.190" stopTime="4039.370">
    Mr. Burgin Hawkins 
    Well, it could be so.

    At least your (Voice Overlap) --
speaker="burgin_hawkins" startTime="4039.897" stopTime="4040.982">
    Mr. Burgin Hawkins 
    It could be so interpreted --

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Your Supreme Court has not told us.

    What?
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="4043.618" stopTime="4049.929">

speaker="burgin_hawkins" startTime="4049.929" stopTime="4222.720">
    Mr. Burgin Hawkins 
    No sir. 
    Now, if the statute has a field of operation and it's not too broad, I think it plays the most important part in having an orderly election. 
    You say that the statutes, I think the courts have so held that the prohibiting of a solicitation of a vote within a certain distance from the poll is a valid exercise of the police power of the State. 
    It seems to me that more damage could be done in a printed word through a mass media, and then would be by having a statute that's limited to the prohibiting and solicitation of votes within 100 feet of the poll. 
    I think that all of these -- all of these statutes has to be looked at with common sense. 
    All lies go hand in hand with common sense. 
    And I don't think it was ever intended that a person would be prosecuted if that abridged party, one lady said to another one, “I wish you'd vote for a certain candidate or vote on a certain issue.” 
    Its sole purpose is to have orderliness, peace and quiet. 
    Let the editor of that paper for 364 days out of the year, expound any cause he desires. 
    We're not arguing that he doesn't have the right to advocate any issue or to support any candidate. 
    But we do think that the statute is not asking too much to say that on one day, out of the year, don't publish an editorial soliciting votes for a particular candidate or on a particular issue.

    Mr. Burgin Hawkins 
    Yes sir. 
    And I think that you can create a disorder at the polls by allowing a newspaper to create certain editorial on certain subjects, just the same as if they went to polls, holding someone and trying to convince them in. 
    So I think that's --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="4602.355" stopTime="4604.451">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    They wouldn't do that at the polls.

    Mr. Burgin Hawkins 
    Oh yes, he'd be back up then. 
    Now, there are some questions here about -- on jurisdiction. 
    I think Your Honor that this Court should render an authoritative decision on this question. 
    It's of vital importance to the people of Alabama. 
    And if we went back through the courts, I can tell you what I think would happen in the face of the Supreme Court's decision although there is a trial de novo, I think if an evidence was, as presented to you here, the Court would give a request in favor of the State under a general charge, that if they believe that they would have to convict Mr. Mills. 
    So now in this type of a statute, in any complaint or sworn affidavit or indictment, the facts alleging a solicitation or the electioneering would necessarily have to be in that complaint or sworn affidavit. 
    And I think if any person, prosecuting attorney or anyone else attempted to use the statute in a -- and under the facts that wouldn't constitute solicitation or demurrer filed to the indictment, a demurrer filed to the complaint raising a question that it does not constitute a violation of the law under the State of Alabama, the courts would have a review of the conduct of the individual to determine whether or not the Court in its opinion thought that this alleged, where it might be who was accused of violating it, did electioneer or solicit votes for an individual or candidate on election day. 
    I thank you.

    May I ask you another question, Mr. Hawkins? 
    As I recall Alabama, it does not have a provision in the Constitution which makes the jury the judge who brought the law in facts and criminal libel cases, does it?

   Rebuttal of Alfred Swedlaw
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="4789.577" stopTime="4798.611">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Thank you, Mr. Hawkins. 
    Mr. Swedlaw.
speaker="alfred_swedlaw" startTime="4798.611" stopTime="5190.457">
    Mr. Alfred Swedlaw 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    In rebuttal, Mr. Hawkins has stated that in his judgment, various acts which the statute by its terms proscribed would not be so construed and would not be -- this is not the intendment of the statute. 
    The language of the statute is clear in these various respects and this, this is one of the faults, the vagueness fault in the statute that it brings within its ambit and within its purview otherwise harmless conduct and proscribes it and makes it a criminal offense. 
    The statute does not require that it'd be done with a criminal intent. 
    The statute says thus and so shall be forbidden on election day. 
    Now, one of the concerns of the State apparently and Mr. Hawkins has expressed here and I think that this paternalistic attitude is permeated in the State's position throughout these proceedings. 
    Questionably, the right of the public to be protected, Mr. Hawkins said that he thought that one of the purposes would be to prevent a voter from forming a role and opinion. 
    Now, this is precisely -- this is precisely the thought -- that sort of thing that we are urging on the Court here to take cognizance of the fact that this is not a legislative interest that the State has a right to protect, Thornhill decided that. 
    Thornhill decided that -- the fact that people might be persuaded to take the position contrary to their best interest or to adopt an indirect opinion are not dangers which government has any right to prevent. 
    The antiseptic atmosphere of an election is not something that is a matter of legislative interest -- legitimate legislative interest. 
    There's nothing it says we need to have peaceful, and calm, and tranquil atmospheres on election day. 
    We must defend out -- like to speak out robustly as the State has said, even to the point -- as this Court has said, even to the point of criminal libel unless done with malice as this Court held in the Garrison case with regard to public officials. 
    If the Court will permit with the remaining time we have at hand, we should like to revert to the question of jurisdiction notwithstanding that the State is in effect graciously conceded that it makes no issue of the jurisdictional question. 
    But since a state in its brief has made certain comments and distinctions, for example the State has made much of the -- of an alleged distinction on the finality question between the Pope case, for example, in our case and that this case is a criminal procedure whereas in Pope, criminality was not involved. 
    We submit that if there is any such distinction, it lies in favor of the appellant in this case for the reason that it's of much more pertinence, much more concerned that this man, that Mr. Mills not be subjected to a criminal trial and risk having a conviction against his record in order to test his constitutional rights. 
    The distinction is not made in the statute. 
    Section 1257 requires no distinction such as the State would urge between criminal and civil proceedings. 
    Now, the State also relies on the Polakow case which was decided by the Supreme Court on a writ of certiorari, not decided, the writ of certiorari was denied. 
    And in Polakow, there was involved the procedure of indictment against certain persons in Alabama for selling real estate without a license as prescribed by the statute. 
    The constitutionality of this statute was likewise tested by demurrer and the matter went to the Supreme Court on certiorari but the Supreme Court denied the writ. 
    Now, the distinction between the Polakow case and the case involved is a fraud that appears in Polakow. 
    The defendant there had other defenses to interpose in a trial of the case. 
    That is not true as we have pointed out in the case involved. 
    Moreover, the Court has moved away from Polakow to the point that it maybe said that Polakow has by being ignored been overruled. 
    The Pope case, the Richfield case, the Curry case have all departed at least implicitly from the Polakow holding. 
    And this Court has recognized that the threat of sanctions, the threat of First Amendment restrictions, can even more or can almost as much as the imposition of the sanctions themselves infringe upon constitutional rights. 
    As late as last month in the Fanny Hill case, for example, this Court in passing on the -- on its jurisdiction in the -- on the Massachusetts proceedings, in which there had been an in rem declaration of obscenity against the Fanny Hill book but there had been no prosecution, there'd been no criminal trial, been no criminal conviction albeit. 
    But this Court noted that the declaration of obscenity is likely to have a serious inhibitory effect on the distribution of the book. 
    And that this probable effect is in no small measure derived from the possible collateral uses of the declaration in subsequent prosecution under the Massachusetts statute.

    Mr. Alfred Swedlaw 
    The parallel between the Fanny Hill case and the Mills case we think is evident. 
    Mr. Mills' editorial like Fanny Hill stands condemned by the highest court of the State as being in violation of state law and thus irrespective of what may or may not happen in future proceedings below. 
    The freedom of expression is now seriously impaired just as this Court felt that it would be in Massachusetts although no criminal prosecutions had actually occurred. 
    And it might be said in conclusion. 
    It might be said within the Pope case for example for all that appears of the railroad company might have waived its injunction proceedings which was sanctioned. 
    And these are possibilities, but the practical effect of this situation, as we have said, is that Mr. Mills has been tried on the merits by the Alabama Supreme Court. 
    And we feel that under the circumstances, the matter is right for adjudication and nothing is left to be decided, and we urge the Court to take jurisdiction and reverse. 
    Thank you.
