    Well, this seems to be a rather specific statement to do that which you say you wouldn't object to this. 
    That was all it did entering into continuing and operating all the facts on imposing in the agreement that understanding as any customer or prospect [Inaudible] imposing any conditions which as the purpose or effect of precluding these customer, a prospective customer from independent determination whether shoes would be purchased by first customer, prospective customers of any concern --

    We're not clear Mr. Justice whether that will be construed as Mr. Justice White suggests only as prohibiting us from entering into an agreement not to carry conflicting line but permitting us to say to our dealers, “If you will carry an adequate and a representative stock of our shoes. 
    We will get you these services as long as you do so.”

    Mr. Robert H. McRoberts 
    It is a practical matter you cannot do it, a small store.

    Mr. Robert H. McRoberts 
    That is not said Your Honor, but it does say that where the effect of it is to protrude in from independently determining whether they'll be shoes would be purchased from the competitor. 
    Now, the Commission is contending that that is what is the effect of our present plan as it is now being operated. 
    And the record shows that five out of six of every one of these dealers, five out of six of 573 actually were carrying conflicting shoes, not lines but conflicting shoes without objection. 
    And the testimony shows, if Your Honor please --

    Justice Byron R. White 
    Oh, I hope that it will -- this just proves that -- this just proves that the -- what are you worried about that because carrying a whole line won't keep them from dealing with every other.

    It keeps them from carrying a conflicting line as a practical matter, practical economic matter.

    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Well, a real difference maybe I suggest to you whether you have a -- whether the Federal Trade Commission is going to acknowledge or admit that Brown Shoe Company can buy agreement or commission or otherwise imposed upon a retailer the decision as to who's shoes he is going to carry and as I read this Federal Trade Commission says the Brown Shoe Company, you cannot directly or indirectly impose upon -- you cannot directly or indirectly deprive a retailer of the right to exercise as independent judgment as to what shoes he's going to carry and you disagree with that?
speaker="robert_h_mcroberts" startTime="257.062" stopTime="267.399">
    Mr. Robert H. McRoberts 
    No. 
    We say, if Your Honor please, we are not interfering with their independent judgment. 
    We're saying that so long as you'll concentrate on our lines, we'll give you these benefits.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="267.399" stopTime="275.224">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Well, he thinks that's only the thing with their judgments. 
    The Trade Commission thinks that that's interfering with their independent judgment.
speaker="robert_h_mcroberts" startTime="275.224" stopTime="293.765">
    Mr. Robert H. McRoberts 
    They -- they feel that if you offer services here which they're admittedly needed and they want them, they free to lay the plan in any way it's an inducement, but they're offering this extra aids and extra benefits and what --
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="293.765" stopTime="347.436">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    And what you're doing whether or not it's a violation of (2) (d) or (2) (e) of the Robinson Patman Act, it is in there for a valuable consideration namely the offer of these services. 
    And you are obtaining from the dealer, this is a Trade Commission's argue -- conclusion as I see it. 
    You are obtaining from the dealer whether it's by explicit agreement or understanding or whatnot and undertaking that this dealer will adhere to Brown Shoes views as to from whom he ought to buy some or all of these stock. 
    And the Trade Commission says, no matter how you cut that, how you define it, how thin you slice it, you cannot do that and that's the issue in this case, is it not?
speaker="robert_h_mcroberts" startTime="347.436" stopTime="420.566">
    Mr. Robert H. McRoberts 
    I think that is correct. 
    They say this is an exclusive dealing agreement or if it is not strictly speaking an exclusive dealing agreement that it's -- of a type equivalent to an exclusive dealing agreement which prohibits the dealers from buying shoes of other people. 
    Now, the Commission as I see it has shifted its ground on this many times. 
    This case was started as strictly a Section 3 case. 
    It was tried on that case. 
    The hearing examiner decided it on that case, on that theory, but then when he undertook to determine the substantiality of the effect, he said, “If you measure this against the national market it won't be substantial. 
    Therefore, I will measure it against the market represented only by these stores, the area in which they do their retail -- have their retail businesses.” 
    Now, the Commission came along and found it was substantial. 
    The Commission came along and said, “No, that's for long” and struck out those findings and substituted it's own.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="420.566" stopTime="425.833">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Are you telling us that the complainant one time decided the violation of Section 3?
speaker="robert_h_mcroberts" startTime="425.833" stopTime="427.852">
    Mr. Robert H. McRoberts 
    Section 3 was not used, Your Honor.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="427.852" stopTime="429.849">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Section 3 was never recited on this complaint (Voice Overlap) --
speaker="robert_h_mcroberts" startTime="429.849" stopTime="431.511">
    Mr. Robert H. McRoberts 
    It was not mentioned by then.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="431.511" stopTime="434.805">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Is that you're saying the complain under Section 5 was (Voice Overlap) --
speaker="robert_h_mcroberts" startTime="434.805" stopTime="764.175">
    Mr. Robert H. McRoberts 
    Complained under Section 5 charging exclusive dealing and substantial effect. 
    At conclusion of the hearings which lasted a year -- a year and a half, the trial examiner, the hearing examiner considered it was a Section 3 case and so stated. 
    He decided as I say on the theory that he had defined substantial effects upon competition as you do under Section 3, but the Commission struck out those findings because the retail limits were not the correct limits of the relevant market and said, “We find that to violate Section 5, it's akin to a tie-in arrangement. 
    Then having found that akin to a tie-in arrangement, the Commission considered our contention. 
    No you have to measure it against the effect upon the competition and said that that's immaterial and reiterated again. 
    We find it violates Section 4 but added in any event in fact and I'm not quoting the exact words that in any effect we find that the competitor's standards had been met. 
    Now before the Court of Appeals, the argument of the Commission was this is akin to a tie-in arrangement and they cited Northern Pacific and half a dozen other cases and the Court of Appeals analyzed those cases distinguished them and said, “No, it's not akin to tie-in arrangement.” 
    Now in the brief filed here, the word tie-in only appears twice and as I understand that the Commission has abandoned the tie-in theory and as I understood the counsel to say their position is that the standards of Section 3 is met namely the substantial effect upon competition and we do rely upon tamper, tamper was a 20-year prohibition, 20-year exclusive dealing or requirements contract affecting a little less than 1% of the market. 
    Here is an agreement that's terminable at will. 
    The market is not foreclosed to these other dealers and they actually are selling in this market. 
    They're selling door stores not as much as they would like to sell and we don't sell as much as we would like to sell, but they're actually selling in it. 
    The foreclosure here is only temporary. 
    When anyone buys, if I would buy a pair of shoes not much of the market is foreclosed and preempted until they wear out and need another one. 
    Whenever a dealer buys his fall stock or his winter stock or his spring stock that market is preempted agreement or no preempted and when he comes to replace that he can buy those shoes from anyone he sees fit. 
    If he persists in buying a conflicting line and dividing his forces so that he cannot operate an efficient and prosperous store, we do terminating rarely but occasionally we do more often than we would like to and these services which we give the dealers are beneficial. 
    The record shows that these dealers hated by our advice of our servicemen, of our field men, their rate of return is 16% on their investment on the average compared to an industry rate of return 11.5%, 35% more. 
    And if any true words were spoken in this case whereby one of these manufacturer witnesses that the Commission put on in this agreement when he said dealers need these services. 
    Now, we can't in the first place afford to give services unless there's a comparable volume to sustain this expense nor can we give services that are worth having to tell a dealer how to merchandize another line of shoes. 
    For us, to try to tell the dealer how to merchandize an international shoe brand of shoe or some other brand shoe, we don't know their patterns. 
    We are not familiar with how they perform. 
    We don't know their key quoted numbers. 
    The only way we can tell what they are is to go look in the box and see what the shoe is like. 
    Our servicemen or field men are familiar with our patterns. 
    They know how they're performing. 
    They can advice these dealers on purchases and upon merchandising. 
    It's interesting to note that these field men, these services which are of so great value. 
    They're paid on a salary basis. 
    They have no incentive to force shoes on these dealers. 
    Their success is measured by the dealer's success. 
    He runs a prosperous store and is successful, they're successful. 
    The salesmen of course were working on a Commission and have an interest to sell all the shoes they can while these field men of course want them to concentrate on Brown lines. 
    They don't go out there and urge them to concentrate on someone else's lines. 
    They are there to help these -- these retail dealers to help them survive and help them prosper and the services of company just that very purpose.

    Mr. Robert H. McRoberts 
    I think the consanguinity is so remote that it is not. 
    Now, this Court of course in Atlantic Refining held that that was akin to or have the effect of a Tie-In Clause, although, it was not strictly speaking, a Tie-In Clause arrangement, but there you had a situation where there was coercion, where there was appraisal, where there was the use of economic power in one market to coerce the dealers in another market. 
    These services which we rendered we have no leverage over, no power over, they're not unique, they're offered by many other dealers, and the Commission has stipulated not just that these large companies in general and international and the like have these plans but that virtually all, virtually all of the manufacturers in competition with us offer some or all of the following services and among those you will find this service of advice to business advice including the advise on proper methods of merchandising.

    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Now, as I understand the law if they -- to -- if an allowance of service is offered to some customers and there are other customers who are not equipped for one reason or another to receive that same service and the equivalence has to be offered to them, its your understanding?
speaker="robert_h_mcroberts" startTime="1175.429" stopTime="1184.574">
    Mr. Robert H. McRoberts 
    My understanding is that it has to be offered to everyone on the same classification or everyone on the same rule. 
    We don't have to classify all of your customers the same way.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="1184.574" stopTime="1188.465">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Yes, but you have to classify them so that there is a practicality --
speaker="robert_h_mcroberts" startTime="1188.465" stopTime="1194.093">
    Mr. Robert H. McRoberts 
    So there is some practicality there, you can't do it in a discriminatory way.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    How about the 50,000 outlets that Mr. Spritzer mentioned, the smaller ones and ones that perhaps don't carry a full line with due carrier shoes, is this -- is this available to them?
speaker="robert_h_mcroberts" startTime="1211.962" stopTime="1260.708">
    Mr. Robert H. McRoberts 
    It is not available to anyone who -- basically this is offered to the family shoe stores, to the people who carry the three lines of shoes, men's, women and children. 
    Now there are exceptions. 
    There are few instances, very few instances where for some reason or another a store may carry just for example women's and children shoes but their volume is sufficient to justify and it's offered to them, but it's not offered to the store who carries just a few pair of shoes, a few -- odd lots of Brown Shoes or even a single line of Brown Shoes generally speaking. 
    It is only offered to those who concentrate on all three lines of Brown Shoes.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1260.708" stopTime="1266.718">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    But then your figure at 1% is rather low, isn't it?
speaker="robert_h_mcroberts" startTime="1266.718" stopTime="1275.476">
    Mr. Robert H. McRoberts 
    It is -- the figure of 1% is simply an entire shoe outlets and we're simply measuring, these are not open (Voice Overlap)
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1275.476" stopTime="1277.562">

    But your -- your program isn't open to --
speaker="robert_h_mcroberts" startTime="1277.562" stopTime="1312.834">
    Mr. Robert H. McRoberts 
    The program is not -- the program is not open. 
    I think the 1% is used, Your Honor, in connection with the volume of the shoe business that is affected by this anti competitive effects. 
    It is the total numbers of shoe store. 
    There is no evidence in the record incidentally as to the total mark. 
    There's no evidence in this record as the total volume of shoe sales in dollars at retail or at wholesale. 
    The record is silent on that.

    Mr. Robert H. McRoberts

speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1318.643" stopTime="1335.621">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Is it fair to say that you just cut the white meat out of the shoe industry and deal with that so far as the -- these contracts are concerned?

    Mr. Robert H. McRoberts 
    Well, I don't know that I would characterize it just that way, but we do only offer it and I think you find that statement made in our brochure that it's offered only to the aggressive modern up-to-date progressive dealer who wants to move ahead and something to that effect in finding.

    Mr. Robert H. McRoberts 
    Well, the Commission is suggesting, but why don't you just charge the people. 
    Why don't you say, ‘We'll get the advisory services for a fee?” 
    But as I attempted to point out, our services would be of no value in trying to advise on other people's shoes that little had no value, we could keep some records perhaps but it's not practical to do that.

    Now, the Commission suggested if the dealers who enjoyed your plan at a higher profit margin than the others, there could be many reasons for that I suppose but --

    That the Commission seemed to indicate that this was one of them. 
    There's a difference of three or four points in the profit margin. 
    See those dealers who are in your plan and those dealers who weren't. 
    It must be that there are some -- something financial.
