   Argument of Donald F. Welday
speaker="donald_f_welday" startTime="103.718" stopTime="308.246">
    Mr. Donald F. Welday 
    Mr. Chief Justice and members of the Court, may it please this honorable Court. 
    We present a case wherein -- as we have recited the issue, there seems to be some difference of opinion as to what the actual issue is in this case between our position, the position of the respondents and that of the Solicitor General. 
    But we think that we have accurately phrased it, when we said that has Congress in enacting the National Labor Relations Act exempted from the jurisdiction of the state courts, all rights and all remedies in the case of nonviolent tortuous conduct even though there maybe -- committed even though there maybe some kind of a labor dispute or relations or incident involved. 
    Has it been the intent of Congress to deprive an individual of his right of action for tortuous conduct committed against him in the state courts or in this case, a federal court because of diversity of citizenship. 
    The facts, on December the 7th, 1962, Mr. Linn who is the petitioner here, was an Assistant Regional Manager for the Pinkerton National Detective Agency. 
    And he had under his -- or in his area the Detroit, Michigan area, and on that date, December 7, 1962, a leaflet was published and delivered to various employees of the Detroit office of the Pinkerton National Detective Agency. 
    In that leaflet, Mr. Linn was expressly referred to by a name, described as a manager. 
    Also in that leaflet, it was said that the Pinkerton managers have been lying, have been cheating, have been robbing, and perhaps maybe subject to criminal penalties. 
    There was no Labor Relations matter, no labor dispute, and no incident up to that point. 
    One year previously, on the 7th of December in 1961, there had been a certification election for the Pinkerton employees in the Detroit office -- the bargaining agent which had represented those employees up to that point was voted out. 
    So on December the 7th, 1962, when this leaflet was published, there was no problem, there was no dispute, and there was no incident.

    Mr. Donald F. Welday 
    The record does not show. 
    We don't know. 
    Now it has been alleged here in the facts, in the respondent's brief that this was an organizational campaign. 
    And very frankly, we don't know whether there was an organizational campaign. 
    There had been an election a year previously. 
    But up to this point, -- insofar as we know, and insofar as this record is concerned, there had been no organizational campaign.

    Mr. Donald F. Welday 
    No, sir. 
    This is one of the features of this case, is that there is no evidence at all in it. 
    Really, it's a question of whether or not we can present evidence. 
    Subsequent to the circulation of this leaflet, which contained language which was -- and assumed to be by the Court of Appeals, clearly libelous insofar as the petitioner here is concerned, the petitioner's employer filed an unfair labor practice charge with the Detroit office to the National Labor Relations Board. 
    Now the petitioner did not, of course, he is an intermediate supervisor employee of the Pinkerton Detective Agency, the respondents here are that group which apparently sought to represent the guard employees of the Pinkerton Detective Agency. 
    But the Pinkerton agency filed an unfair labor charge. 
    Within a matter of a few days, the petitioner here filed his libel action. 
    The local office of the National Labor Relations Board acting upon the Pinkerton, the employer's application, refused to issue a complaint.

    The complaint does say that Mr. Linn was elsewhere named in the leaflet. 
    I have the leaflet here. 
    I can't tell the Court exactly where it appears. 
    The complaint says that he was named. 
    And the complaint was it -- or the leaflet was attached to the complaint as an exhibit. 
    What we recited specifically was the language used which we claimed was libelous reciting that it referred to -- the language said the managers have been doing this. 
    Mr. Linn was otherwise and elsewhere named as a manager and we attached the entire leaflet to the complaint as an exhibit.

    Justice William O. Douglas 
    Oh we would only go on what -- what was before the District Court.
speaker="donald_f_welday" startTime="644.688" stopTime="810.098">
    Mr. Donald F. Welday 
    I appreciate that, sir, and I'll see to it that that if that complaint or -- excuse me, if that circular is made available. 
    But again, I say that it is -- there has been no question about what Mr. Linn was in fact described elsewhere in this circular as being one of the managers. 
    Factually then, if I might go on, the National Labor Relations Board, the local office in Detroit, refused to issue a complaint on the Pinkerton complaint, finding certain facts, finding as a fact that the respondents here had no part in the preparation of this libelous material. 
    Now the National Labor Relations Board did not have a hearing. 
    They made this finding of facts after some kind of an investigatory process. 
    An appeal was taken from that to the general council of the National Labor Relations Board. 
    And he sustained the local opinion not to issue a complaint. 
    Now these things were brought to the attention of the District Court. 
    We feel that they had really no part in the lawsuit filed by the petitioner here. 
    But nevertheless they were brought to the attention of the District Court. 
    Also, a motion was made to the District Court to dismiss the petitioner's action on the now familiar Garmon language that if an activity is arguably subject to Section 7 or 8 of the National Labor Relations Act, it is preempted to the National Labor Relations Board and the local courts would have no jurisdiction. 
    And it was specifically, on that ground, that the District Court dismissed the petitioner's complaint was no hearing was ever held before the National Labor Relations Board or before the District Court the truth of falsity of the allegations. 
    The libelous material has never been gone into. 
    It has never been pursued at all. 
    But as a practical matter, it never can be under the District Court's opinion in this case. 
    When the complaint was filed, it was filed against the Union, its two principal officers, and another man by the name of Doyle. 
    And the allegation was that they acted in concert in preparation of this libelous material.

    But as a practical matter, he receives orders in his headquarters or the people that tell him what to do or in New York City. 
    He's not autonomous by any means. 
    And the action was taken through the direction of his home office in New York City. 
    And he had absolutely nothing to do with the filing of the complaint before the National Labor Relations Board.

speaker="donald_f_welday" startTime="875.355" stopTime="901.264">
    Mr. Donald F. Welday 
    Yes, requests were made by the local National Labor Relations Board of a written statement of the respective positions of the Pinkerton people who had filed the charge and the Union as a respondent to it. 
    Insofar as I know, no other investigation was undertaken by the Board. 
    Certainly, nothing was done insofar as this petitioner is concerned.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Yes.
speaker="donald_f_welday" startTime="904.703" stopTime="1015.434">
    Mr. Donald F. Welday 
    Doyle, who was the last named defendant in the original lawsuit, was not dismissed from the case. 
    He did not join in the motion to dismiss. 
    And the order of the District Court dismissing the lawsuit as to the defendant union and its officers specifically said that the -- with dismissal of the other defendants, I'm reading from page 37 of the record in the District Court's opinion. 
    With dismissal of the other defendants, both suits are reduced to simple common law tort actions. 
    Local 114 has disclaimed any responsibility for the activities of defendant, Doyle, and this disclaimer has been upheld by both the regional director and the Office of Appeals of the NLRB. 
    If as alleged, Defendant Doyle libel Pinkerton's or Linn, this is a private matter which may aptly be resolved in this Court if usual jurisdictional requirements have been satisfied. 
    We find that curious. 
    We can't really understand one; how the principle of Garmon which was relied on by the District Court would be applicable to the respondents here and not applicable to Doyle. 
    And number two, we find it interesting that the District Court apparently adopted as findings of fact for its use and which would govern the petitioner here, those things which the National Labor Relations Board had found in a matter involving the petitioner's employer and these respondents, where this petitioner never had an opportunity to be heard.

    I suppose that if I had to argue, I would say that that -- that language and that pleading I now candidly concede it's not the best.

speaker="donald_f_welday" startTime="1305.173" stopTime="1927.385">
    Mr. Donald F. Welday 
    Well, yes as a -- certainly as an aider and abettor than a conspirator in the perpetration of what is in effect crime in the State of Michigan, not in effect with this -- by statute, a crime in the State of Michigan. 
    Aiding and abetting in the conspiracy would all make everyone libel as principles whether it be just published or whether they all set down at the big table and grafted this material. 
    The upshot of the District Court's position left this plaintiff in a position where he felt that he had been libel with malice grievously and there was absolutely nothing that he, as an individual, could do about it. 
    The Court said that under Garmon, the Court can't do anything about it. 
    The National Labor Relations Board wouldn't hear the complaint of this petitioner's employer and we point out that even if they had agreed to hear it, there wasn't a thing that the National Labor Relations Board could do under any circumstances to restore this citizen and this individual to a position where he would have been before he suffered a personal injury. 
    And we submit that libel is a personal injury, that it's a serious one, and that it's a grievous one. 
    The Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court's action specifically on this Court's opinion in Garmon and pointed out the interesting proposition, as the Sixth Circuit interpreted it. 
    Garmon says, an individual might quickly recover from the -- I interpolate somewhat, an individual might quickly recover from the bruises and wounds of a physical assault and that little expense have a crimpled fender bumped out. 
    But a lifetime may not be sufficient to restore a reputation hurt by the circulation of a vicious libel. 
    We are persuaded however, that Garmon has drawn the distinction which permits the one to be remedied by traditional court action and limits the other to the relief, if any, that may come from an order of the NLRB. 
    And if a regional director's refusal to issue a complaint is sustained, the libeled individual is at the end of the remedial role. 
    Mr. Linn is at the end of the remedial role under this interpretation of Garmon. 
    Very frankly, Mr. Linn doesn't like that situation and he feels that there must be some place where the truth can be established. 
    Is Mr. Linn a crook and is he a liar, and is he a thief? 
    Does he have to go through life because of National Labor policy branded this way? 
    Or may he not, in a court of competent jurisdiction refute these allegations, and may he not clear his name. 
    We think that in some respects, this case raises the issue which was suggested and foretold in the concurring opinion in Garmon and also suggested in Mr. Justice Douglas' dissent in the Borden case. 
    That is, has Congress prevented a resolution by the courts, what is essentially a private dispute, a personal injury tort? 
    When that dispute incidentally arises during the course of what might be called the labor relations incident. 
    When we say it might be called a labor relations incident, because in this case particularly, there was no incident, there was no dispute. 
    There was nothing. 
    People went to work and all of a sudden, there was a circular distributed. 
    Curiously enough by following Garmon, the national policy which we think is to promote the peaceful settlement of labor problems if we promote or if we allow Garmon, the interpretation of Garmon that was attached by the lower courts in this case, then we've created the dispute where none existed. 
    If we say that libel is an activity which nothing -- no court can remedy, which no court can hear and the National Labor Relations Board maybe might do something about it, then in effect, we give a license to libel. 
    We create disputes and we think in some respects that the position of the respondents here isn't asking for a license to libel. 
    Because the practical issue has to be faced that no order of the National Labor Relations Board could do anything about can possibly correct or stop that pass line. 
    Ultimately, it may say don't ever libel again. 
    Don't ever defame again. 
    But it can't do anything about what has transpired in the past. 
    And we think this is a license. 
    We think this creates a dispute where none has existed. 
    The answer to whether or not libel may be prosecuted even though there is a labor incident attached to it, the answer to that question, we think, comes from the dissenting opinion of the Chief Justice in the Russell case, commenting on the Laburnum case. 
    Laburnum simply holds that a tort-feasor should not be allowed to immunize himself from liability for a wrong having no relation to federal law simply because the means he adopts to affect the wrong, transgresses a comprehensive code of federal regulation. 
    And that I think in a nutshell is the situation here. 
    The tort-feasor has committed a wrong which incidentally is involved with the National Labor Relations Act, the National Code. 
    But otherwise, it has no connection to it. 
    It's essentially a private dispute between Linn on the one hand and those people who happened to be connected with a labor union on the other hand. 
    I think there is no possibility of a competition between the courts in this matter and the National Labor Relations Board. 
    They're looking for two separate and distinct approaches. 
    The Board's approach is, does a given circumstance, does a given incident, is it coercive? 
    Not truth. 
    That's not the issue before the Board. 
    Is it coercive? 
    The court is concerned with the truth regardless of whether it is coercive or not coercive. 
    It makes no difference. 
    These two tribunals then are looking in different directions. 
    They can decide these issues. 
    They can hear these issues without any relationship to each other, without any competition between each other. 
    And if the problem, if the reason for the preemption doctrine of Garmon which is what has controlled this case so far is a prevention of competition between the national policy and the various substantive laws and modes of regulation of the several states. 
    That competition problem is not present under this set of circumstances because the tribunals are not looking towards the same answer. 
    The Fourth Circuit, in the Bouligny case which we understand is before this Court but on another question, but the Fourth Circuit summed up we think, the whole proposition in one neat little sentence. 
    The question before it in part was the jurisdiction of a Court to hear a libel permit or committed in the course of some kind of a labor incident. 
    And the Fourth Circuit said the National Labor Relations Act is concerned only with the coercive effect and it is not concerned at all with the effect of libel as a common law tort. 
    That's what we're concerned with here. 
    And Mr. Linn says, this petitioner says, can I clear my name? 
    Can I have this matter heard? 
    I don't think it is any answer to say but the matter will still be heard in relation to the remaining defendant Doyle because, if we go back to the District Court and we try the matter insofar as Doyle is concerned and if we prove everything which we have alleged in our complaint. 
    And this case is the -- the decisions are allowed to stand as they are up to this point, then we approve the complete defense of Mr. Doyle because he's a part and parcel of the Union and he is in concert with him and Garmon would preempt the action. 
    So it is no answer to say that the matter still remains viable insofar as Doyle is concerned. 
    We are --

    Well I appreciate that, sir, but would it not also create the same kind of a defense that the Garmon rule has created so far. 
    That's why I say if we go back and prove everything which we've alleged in our complaint, we are very likely to be met with the same defense. 
    And suppose we go back and try the case against Doyle and he says, “Ah, but I'm going to prove that I wasn't member of the Union. 
    Doyle hasn't been heard from either. 
    And the mere fact that the National Labor Relations Board has made this finding on what evidence we don't know, just a disclaimer is not going to resolve the issue in the District Court.

    This question -- the question isn't before us.

    If he's just a man, Mr. Doyle, third party, then the whole question has been briefed and argued here isn't really here.

    Now it says this is just John Smith who libeled your client.

speaker="donald_f_welday" startTime="2054.629" stopTime="2129.368">
    Mr. Donald F. Welday 
    Well, but the question before the Court here is not whether John Smith did it. 
    It's whether or not we can go into Court and prove that the Union did it. 
    Insofar as Mr. Linn is concerned, the individual who some place in the middle between the worker down here and the employer up here, he stands in the middle. 
    Now what can he do? 
    Can he file a lawsuit alleging that the Union and its officers libeled him and somebody else too, maybe a whole group of people. 
    That doesn't make any difference. 
    We're concerned only with the part in it that the Union is playing and the District Court said, “No, you Mr. Linn, cannot do this because the act says that you're an employer by definition, even though you're just a supervisor and you have to take directions too. 
    So you can't do this. 
    You must get whatever relief you can get from the National Labor Relations Board and the Court of Appeals says and they can't give you any.” 
    And as a practical matter, Mr. Linn has no right to go before the National Labor Relations Board only if he can persuade his employer to file a complaint. 
    And the Board will hear it. 
    So he is in a real state of limbo insofar as this circumstance is concerned.

    Section 7 and its legislative history demonstrates that no unlawful activity is a protected activity. 
    And no standard definition of unlawful activity is given in the Act or in the Section 7. 
    Therefore, I would assume that what we generally conceive under the definitions of the several states as unlawful activity must be what is meant in Section 7.

   Argument of Thurgood Marshall
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="2397.150" stopTime="2738.072">
    Mr. Thurgood Marshall 
    Which substantial sums have been sought in defamation suits growing out of statements made doing labor disputes. 
    Now this will give you an idea of importance of the issue because these suits seem to be a relatively new phenomenon in racial -- I mean in labor relations. 
    But that tendency to discourage vigorous organizational campaigns is obvious. 
    Significantly many of these suits set out in our appendix involve words which although probably defamatory under traditional criteria of libel and slander cases, nevertheless cannot fairly be said seriously to injure the reputation of the parties to a labor dispute. 
    Claims that an employer is unfair or that is using the big live tactics of Hitler, or then an employee is by hiding tax, and draw him into driveway. 
    Let me point out, that most American jurisdiction, the law of defamation is quite strict. 
    Casual use of the words like liar or cheat, or unfair may expose one to heavy general damages, even though actual injury to one's pocket book may not be proved. 
    It is the Board and this Court has recognized Union organizing campaigns tend to be heated affairs in which the participants would get themselves and speak intemperately. 
    Indeed, I imagine some of us know some labor leaders that if you prevent him from cursing, you take all that free speech away from them and a negotiation that goes on. 
    And it's recognized its feelings run high rough languages not in frequent. 
    Such campaigns of organizing in a labor dispute, they're not conducted in the language of the college classroom or the drawing room. 
    Words and other context might constitute serious insults are generally viewed by the participants in labor disputes as no more than ordinary rough and tumbled organizing tactics. 
    Unfortunately, many courts apparently have not recognized this fact of industrialized so that if the courts were permitted to apply the traditional strict standards governing what is defamatory to statements made during union organizing campaigns and the same measure of damages were applied. 
    Many of the typical comments invariably and inevitably uttered during such campaigns could subject the speaker to very heavy damages. 
    To impose strict defamation liability of the participants in such campaigns could thus throw a real monkey wrench in to the scheme of National Labor Relations Act. 
    Instead of the parties to the dispute being able to talk out and indeed curse out their differences in a board supervised campaign and election. 
    The dispute would in effect be dragged into the courts to be fought out as any other defamation action. 
    This would be most disruptive, further it's unnecessary because the kind of abuse that might in other context cause real harm or ordinarily be discounted were made by a party on the other side of a labor dispute. 
    We say then that the policy and integrity of the federal labor scheme simply cannot count on its unlimited liability for defamations arising from Union organizational efforts. 
    The unbridle existence of the threat of heavy damage of words but defamation added during the cause of union organizing campaign would have to say the least of killing effect upon the freedom of communication that is so necessary to the exercise of the employee's statutory right under Section 7 of the Act to bargain collectively, to represent it as of their own choosing. 
    Union organizers would be most reluctant to speak out freely and inevitably if they knew that words which a customary employee in such campaigns, well it might seem defamatory to persons not familiar with the actual conduct of labor disputes or to judges and juries hustle to the goals of the Union could subject them to heavy damages. 
    The probable effect of permitting such suits would therefore be to tort the effective exercise of these granted statutory rights. 
    But we also think that there's an area in which the State would be able to grant a remedy for defamation. 
    After all, the States traditionally have had a strong interest in protecting reputation and in awarding damages for injuries thereto. 
    And therefore, we think the federal scheme should be viewed as displacing the same state authority in this area only to the extent necessary to protect the federal scheme of labor relations throughout the country. 
    There are some kinds of defamation which are so harmful and unjustifiable that the State interest in that suppression is compelling and as to which suppression would involve no appreciable danger of serious interference with federal labor policy. 
    State power of such defamation is needed not and should not be deemed preempted.

    And in another area, it might hold back management. 
    And the very threat of it was freedom of speech.

    If you start from the point of view of the NLRB jurisdiction, perhaps it would seem that the more extreme the language, the more malicious, the more outrageous the language is, the more the interest the NLRB might have in it in the sense that it might – that's a sort of case, might more readily rule to be an unfair labor practice than a more general and polite terms of abuse.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="3206.360" stopTime="3227.052">
    Mr. Thurgood Marshall 
    Well, the cases as I read them with the NLRB decision, that usually comes up when the union member uses some very good language and he subsequently discharged. 
    And he comes up on that and then the Board actually decides as to whether the language is --
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="3227.052" stopTime="3277.187">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Yes, but take the present case. 
    This is a case where an unfair labor practice complaint was made to the NLRB. 
    Now if the language was totally extreme and as outrageous, outrageous enough to come within your definition. 
    And it occurred in the course of a labor dispute, would it seem that to you that the NLRB might have more interest and not less but more interest in it, than if the term abuse were within the limits of the polite jargon which you have so vividly described as being customarily used in these situation.

speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="3292.006" stopTime="3313.614">
    Mr. Thurgood Marshall 
    Well, the real trouble is that if the NLRB finds that this Union is given to -- you have an unfair labor practice in what they call management, there's nothing they can do. 
    They can't give management damages. 
    That's the real problem. 
    It's a double assault.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="3313.614" stopTime="3318.278">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    And as if the problem I was trying to get some more light on your answer.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="3318.278" stopTime="3460.314">
    Mr. Thurgood Marshall 
    Well, I mean, I started off with saying, this is a real difficult one and I wish we could draw most specific lines that would make a better presentation but we run into that real difficulty. 
    The state laws on libel, slander of course very strict yet bare this in mind that whereas in the violence cases, if the man sues for damages for assault and battery and the jury is a rather hostile jury to labor unions and they're bringing an outlandish verdict. 
    The judge can very clearly set that aside because there are certain guidelines about a broken eye or broken arm. 
    But as we find in these liable cases, there's no stand that a judge can use on the verdict. 
    If an outlandish verdict comes in, it's pretty hard for the judge to put his expertise over that as a jury. 
    And we therefore think that in this is a more important area to keep away from the state courts as much as we can and at the same time, leave the state what it needs to maintain its peace in good order. 
    And at the same time, it's in keeping with the national policy of the NLRB as I see it that in this freedom of speech, it not go beyond certain limits. 
    You don't recklessly destroy a man's reputation. 
    Because if you do, then you provoke the violence which the whole act was said people to keep away, I think the two are tied in together. 
    But the only thing I am sure of that the government and the NLRB itself do not want it left wide open. 
    We're convinced that if it's left wide open, there's an inherent danger of destroying what was intended to be the complete freedom of speech. 
    And then the other one is we -- we're stuck in between the two I think.

    Is there anything in the law, which you could tell us about that would preclude an action by the company. 
    Let us say the employer against the individual who uttered the libel, even if it were held that action against the Union is precluded. 
    Let me try to restate that. 
    It's conceivable that the doctrine might be that the NLRB jurisdiction prevents libel action between the company and the Union based upon the events and the course of a labor dispute. 
    Is it your understanding that that doctrine would necessarily also preclude an action involving the individual's concern rather than the employer and the Union as such.

    But if the answer to that is that the action against the individual propriety and individual concern against the individual concern leaving out the company and the union.

   Argument of Winston L. Livingston
speaker="winston_l_livingston" startTime="3852.467" stopTime="4300.351">
    Mr. Winston L. Livingston 
    Mr. Chief Justice, Associate members of the Court. 
    Prior to commencing argument, I should like also to make reference to factual matters that was touched on in an argument by the petitioner. 
    The record does affirmatively show that Mr. Doyle was not a member or agent or an officer of the Union. 
    That's on page 50 and 60 of the record. 
    In conjunction with this, the record also affirmatively shows that the National Labor Relations Board at the administrative level did conduct a full scale investigation. 
    The affidavit of Mr. Bilbri(Ph) in the record shows the extent of the investigation. 
    They even checked the original membership card of Mr. Doyle to ascertain that he had not been a member for almost a year. 
    The third point discussed by petitioner which I believe needs clarifying such an effect that there can be no question that under the National Labor Relations Act, Linn, as an individual has the right to file a charge. 
    Section 10(b) of the Act starts out when it is charged and the Board has said that any individual has the right to file a charge so that Mr. Linn did have access to the procedures and policies of the National Labor Relations Board. 
    Although the issue in this case is narrow, I think it's important to the furtherance of our National Labor policy cannot be under estimated. 
    We would define the issue in the following terms. 
    Shall a further exception to the preemption doctrine stated in San Diego Building Trades versus Garmon be made in cases of claim defamation uttered in the context of a labor dispute. 
    Respondents urge that no such exception should be made. 
    It is not necessary nor even desirable. 
    On the other hand, any such exception would create havoc and confusion in this area which has so many times been described as an area of delicate balance between the competing interest of the federal government and our National Labor policy and those of the state. 
    We believe the exception urged by respondent would destroy the effect of Garmon which has been so successfully followed by the lower courts since its decision in 1959. 
    The exception proposed by respondent would open a wide area of conflict between the federal labor policy and the policy of the 50 different states relating to defamatory statements in this labor relations field. 
    Respondents cannot accept either as workable, the limited exception proposed by the government in its brief. 
    Respondents assert in its brief that Garmon was not the end of the preemption road. 
    Respondents believe it was, is, or should be the end of the preemption road. 
    I think just a brief review of the background of all of the preemption cases that gave rise to Mr. Justice Frankfurter's decision in Garmon would throw a light on the reason Garmon -- the Garmon rule was enunciated and the reason it has proved so workable since that day. 
    Mr. Justice Frankfurter noted that the preemption issue there was a variant of a familiar field. 
    The notes that preemption began with Allen Bradley versus Wisconsin Board and was greatly intensified by litigation which flew from the enactment of the Taft-Hartley Act. 
    And the preemption issue was brought before this Court in almost a score of cases during the decade immediately preceding the Garmon decision. 
    Thus there were a large number of cases stating specific areas of preemption and also delimiting state areas of conduct. 
    The titles and propositions of these cases are familiar to every labor law practitioner and I'm sure to this Court Hill versus Florida, UAW versus O' Brien, Garner versus Teamsters, Weber versus Anhieser Bush, and a host of others. 
    Now in the Garmon decision, Mr. Justice Frankfurter hold together this almost score of preemption cases. 
    He reconciled them and concluded that over the years, a clear pattern had evolved from the previous decisions. 
    And he stated that this -- that with Garmon, with the decision in Garmon, it may safely be claimed that this long series of adjudications have hope translated into concreteness, be consistently applied principles which decide this case. 
    What was the clear pattern? 
    The familiar test of an activity that is arguably subject to Section 7 or Section 8 of the Act. 
    This clear pattern recognized only two exceptions. 
    One, the -– then just preceding decision in the Gonzales case relating matters of peripheral concern, the other was in those cases which touched so deeply and local feelings that state should be allowed to intervene i.e. conduct marked by violence and eminent press of the public court. 
    It's a very simple rule. 
    It has proved very workable. 
    To use a colloquial expression was the greatest thing since the bow and arrow to practitioners in the field and to the judges of the lower courts. 
    I think only a review of all of the cases pending in the lower court on this subject in this area of libel showed that the federal court would -- or the federal courts and the state courts, the judges that have been called upon to decide where their libel and slander occurring in a labor dispute is preempted by Garmon almost unanimously hold in applying Garmon that it is preempted.

    What if somebody not through any intentional violence but simply through negligence, why does somebody get kicked him and his leg is broken, do you think Garmon will hold that he has no right of action against the organizer who negligently kicked him them and broke his leg?

    Well, I think the important thing too in that situation would be the accidental kicking of another in the chin would have no relevance or relationship to Labor Relations policy and --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="4360.684" stopTime="4378.884">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    We can by my -- I'm inventing this case and maybe it will never happen but by hypothesis, it does. 
    It's in the course of picketing or of an organizing campaign, or by my hypothesis, it has -- it's in the course of something that's protected or arguably protected or prohibited by the Act.
speaker="winston_l_livingston" startTime="4378.884" stopTime="4558.281">
    Mr. Winston L. Livingston 
    That is correct but I would not -- I would not say that such would be preempted by Garmon because of the distinctions which I have just stated. 
    The substance of this point is that the trial judges at all level understand Garmon and they know how to apply it. 
    And without exception, when they do apply it they hold that Garmon preempts all activity or conduct that does not involve violence or eminent threats to the public peace. 
    Let's say the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in the Myer's decision however held that Garmon did not apply to this type of action. 
    On the other hand the Supreme Courts of Arizona and Alaska had held Garmon applied to this type of action. 
    As the district judge in this case had no trouble in applying Garmon finding preemption, the Court of Appeals likewise. 
    I don't believe that anyone, any party can seriously dispute that Garmon is the case to be considered in this context. 
    So the first question is the activity of Mr. Doyle arguably protected by Section 7 are prohibited by Section 8. 
    I believe this point is so clear that it does not require any extended discussion. 
    Here was an employee appealing to fellow employees to support the Union, to support self organizational efforts during an organizing campaign. 
    The statements were certainly relevant. 
    The petitioner never really challenged that it was not protected or prohibited until filing a brief in this case. 
    The government concedes that if Garmon applies, the statements would be protected under Section 7 of the Act because if the statements were true, then clearly such statements would be protected, therefore, it is arguably so. 
    We further submit that the trial court which made the statement that it was prohibited by Section 8 was also correct. 
    It could arguably be prohibited by Section 8. 
    The petitioners recognized this. 
    I should I say the petitioners but the petitioner's employer recognized this by filing a charge before the National Labor Relations Board alleging a violation of Section 8(b) 1(a) which is the section prohibiting a union or others from interfering with restraining or coercing employees in the exercise of their Section 7 rights. 
    The other point which must be considered --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="4558.281" stopTime="4565.380">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Excuse me, this is your point here. 
    That you are suggesting that the bringing of this suit violates the Labor Act?
speaker="winston_l_livingston" startTime="4565.380" stopTime="5098.505">
    Mr. Winston L. Livingston 
    No sir but I do suggest that as another part of the argument that in many instances, the institution of a libel suit such as this suit may violate the Act because it may have a coercive effect upon a union's organizational right or during the course of the labor dispute. 
    A small union with very limited funds that is faced with a -- half a million or a million dollar lawsuit such as in this case may very well conclude that it will bargain away any right to organize the employees for the company dropping the lawsuit or dismissing it. 
    It may also scare the employees to where they will be afraid to engage in any activity. 
    And I might say -- state this parenthetically -- earlier Mr. Doyle mentioned quite frequently, he apparently still is in the case. 
    Although this does not appear in the record, I thought it might be of some interest after the charge was filed and the suit was filed against him and he was served, he went back to England and has never returned. 
    I'm not saying that this may have been the result of the lawsuit but the fact is that it is mentioned so that it will explain why no further action has been taken with respect to Doyle in the lower courts. 
    I might add there too, this question has come up that I say no distinction between Doyle as an individual and the Union as an entity with respect to the protection from such suits because the employees of Section 7 have the right to engage in these activities. 
    Therefore there should be no distinction between the suit against the employee or the suit against the Union. 
    Much is made in the brief of petitioner that there is a compelling state interest. 
    There's such a compelling state interest and the respondent's conduct that the State should be free to interfere with the federal policy. 
    Again, the conduct of respondents, if true, was all concerned with an organizing guide. 
    I think that we should bear in mind that we are here today deciding this case on the basis of the facts in this case, not fact as suggested in the brief of the Solicitor General or the facts as suggested in briefs filed by other amicus curiae in this case. 
    This is the run of the Mill case that comes along in a libel and slander situation in a labor dispute. 
    And I think it's helpful to believe at a point a little bit. 
    Petitioner was a resident and a citizen of Ohio. 
    He wasn't even a citizen of Michigan. 
    His only relationship to Michigan, it was one of several Northwestern states that he -- in which he exercised supervisory control. 
    It's part of his duty to prevent and to resist the organizational efforts of his employee. 
    Part of his job, he is the manager. 
    He was an employee of Pinkerton and Doyle was an employee of Pinkerton. 
    And it was Doyle who wrote the letter to fellow employees. 
    It is rather crude. 
    It doesn't even appear on union stationary. 
    Very crude but it is not such as to shot conscience. 
    I have seen and heard many worse statements that were contained in this leaflet. 
    It does not even impute the commission of any specific crime other than the submission of false information to the National Labor Relations Board. 
    There is no hint of violence or threat to the peace. 
    What overwriting state interest is involved then to justify Michigan taking this action away from the National Labor Relations Board? 
    Petitioner's only answer is that the individual has an interest to protect his reputation. 
    And the government's answer is that the protection of a citizen against damage to its reputation is the traditional concern and responsibility of the States. 
    Now the individual of course has an interest in this reputation. 
    But just what interest does the State have? 
    What compelling interest does a State have? 
    The only conclusion that can be drawn is that the state's interest is the individual's interest. 
    They're the same because there is no overwriting possibility of violence. 
    Now of course, it has been suggested in one of the briefs or two that defamatory statements may tend to provoke a breach of the peace but there are no proofs to support this. 
    At the point, defamation reaches the violent stage. 
    For example, defamatory words uttered on a picket line against non-obstructive has been held to constitute such eminent danger to the peace as to justify state interference. 
    The Youngdahl versus Rainfair, I think this was also involved in the Meadowmoor Dairies case, the earlier case. 
    And injunctions have been sustained against being calling as well as others. 
    So if defamation reaches the point that it constitutes a danger to the domestic peace, the States may act under the present Garmon rule. 
    I believe the dissenting opinion in the Myers case in Pennsylvania, sums up respondent's position better than I could rephrase it. 
    In view of the lack of authority for the proposition that the State's interest in defamation is as great as the State's interest in physical violence. 
    I prefer to follow the well reasoned federal and state authorities to the effect that State based actions for defamation arising out of the labor dispute are precluded because regulation of the conduct in question is subject to the exclusive primary jurisdiction of the National Labor Relations Board over unfair labor practice proceedings. 
    In summary, on this point, petitioner and the government then equate the individual's interest in protecting his reputation with the State's interest and maintaining domestic peace. 
    They are not the same. 
    Let us consider for a moment the potential areas of conflict. 
    In this case, if we were to allow this defamation action to be maintained. 
    I think of the outset, we should note, that there is not one single irrelevant statement made in this leaflet. 
    There's no allegation of any sexual misconduct on the part of Mr. Linn or any other grave type of defamation. 
    Everything pertains to the employment relationship. 
    When Mr. Linn first started this suit, his peace suit for $500,000 damages, now no special damages were alleged, didn't allege, he lost his job or that he was -- that he suffered in the other pecuniary loss. 
    Then because the plaintiff in the proceedings below had not made the necessary allegations respecting citizenship upon amendment to correct this defect by leave of court, the damages were suddenly increased to a million dollars. 
    Again, no reason given why Mr. Linn's damages should suddenly jump from $500,000 to one million dollars.

    Mr. Winston L. Livingston 
    Well, I believe that it shows a different motive, Mr. Justice Black. 
    And that is the background for my argument here. 
    NLRB, might find as in fact it did in this case and I'm talking about the administrative determination that was made by the investigative machinery. 
    And I think before we knot the effect of this determination, we should bear in mind that this is the same type, this is the same machinery that Congress provided should be set up for determining the processing of unfair labor practice charges and complaints. 
    So that NLRB found that the Union was not responsible for the publication of this -- these leaflets or the distribution of it. 
    On the other hand, a jury might find that the Union was responsible. 
    The effect, of course, in this instance, would be to undermine the prestige and the authority of the National --

    To Justice Brennan's question pointed out the reason I was asking you what that was. 
    Your position and that of the government seems to me that what we should decide is, that well there's some that the Board had and some it doesn't have. 
    Any serious and whether there's not –- somebody got to decide that but you go ahead and try to the state court, I understood the Garmon doctrine and all the other cases along the other line, but to the effect if you didn't leave things like that to be tried in the state court that it would arguably before the Board is there and that finished the case, decided it permanently, the State couldn't proceed.

    Yes. 
    It has been decided but my argument was directed to those instances where in the gray area, I still say that there are some that are so clearly irrelevant to a campaign that no determination would be clearly the Board will have jurisdiction.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="5931.880" stopTime="5949.484">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Counsel, I wonder where all that leaves you on the facts of this case. 
    Now as I read your record, I maybe wrong about this. 
    The official of the NLRB be passed on this was the acting regional director.
speaker="winston_l_livingston" startTime="5949.484" stopTime="5950.486">
    Mr. Winston L. Livingston 
    That is correct, sir.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="5950.486" stopTime="5971.131">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Now let me ask you first. 
    Is it your position that that is adequate in the event that some pre-clearance or whatever one might call it with the NLRB is required, is the action in your opinion of the acting regional director enough.
speaker="winston_l_livingston" startTime="5971.131" stopTime="5973.648">
    Mr. Winston L. Livingston 
    Yes, sir. 
    I would state so and qualify.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="5973.648" stopTime="6020.531">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Now my second question is this. 
    In this particular case, as I read the record, the acting regional director found that the employee who prepared and circulated the material was not an officer of the Union and wasn't acting as an agent of the Union and that the Union was not involved in this in any way. 
    Now does that mean that the state court is free to go ahead. 
    In short, as I take it here that in effect the NLRB decided that this was not within its jurisdiction?
speaker="winston_l_livingston" startTime="6020.531" stopTime="6040.500">
    Mr. Winston L. Livingston 
    I think quite the contrary the Board asserted jurisdiction by making an investigation and as a result of the investigation, the record will show, they check the membership cards of the local, took the investigative machinery and reached a conclusion, there wasn't any evidence against the Union. 
    I would consider that --
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="6040.500" stopTime="6047.379">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    No but they held that –- they found as I read it that the Union was not involved in the libel.
speaker="winston_l_livingston" startTime="6047.379" stopTime="6048.212">
    Mr. Winston L. Livingston 
    That is correct, sir.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="6048.212" stopTime="6085.895">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Now if the Union wasn't involved in the libel, is the amount still under the NLRB and let me put in as precisely as I can. 
    In view of the fact that the NLRB held that was a short -- that the Union was not involved in this libel. 
    Does it still follow that the NLRB exercise jurisdiction so that the state court or the federal court was precluded from proceeding with the trial of the case.
speaker="winston_l_livingston" startTime="6085.895" stopTime="6086.447">
    Mr. Winston L. Livingston 
    Yes.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="6086.447" stopTime="6115.192">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Let us say an investigation doesn't settle the matter, does it, after the investigation. 
    If the NLRB investigates the claim and then comes out with the conclusion that this was not part of the labor dispute in the sense that the Union was not involved in it nor was anybody involved in acting on behalf of the Union.
speaker="winston_l_livingston" startTime="6115.192" stopTime="6124.967">
    Mr. Winston L. Livingston 
    My position is that this was an effective type of determination (Voice Overlap)
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="6124.967" stopTime="6136.054">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    I'm sorry to take your time but let me ask you this specifically. 
    I think you said Mr. Doyle resigned from the Union a year before all of these happened.
speaker="winston_l_livingston" startTime="6136.054" stopTime="6137.936">
    Mr. Winston L. Livingston 
    About a year, yes sir.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="6137.936" stopTime="6209.402">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Now I suppose that after Mr. Doyle resigned from the Union, he had prepared and circulated this libelous material. 
    And let us suppose that he was not joined, just to make it easy, let's suppose that he was -- yes, he remained as a defendant in the state case. 
    Now the NLRB conducts an investigation on the basis of a complaint of an unfair labor practice. 
    And it then finds and concludes that the Union had nothing whatever to do with this. 
    But that Mr. Doyle, an individual outside of the Union and on his own, circulated -- prepared and circulated the allegedly libelous material. 
    Is it your position that the District Court would still be precluded from going ahead with this action against the Union and against Mr. Doyle?
speaker="winston_l_livingston" startTime="6209.402" stopTime="6268.208">
    Mr. Winston L. Livingston 
    Yes sir. 
    That is our position. 
    The other areas of conflict, of course, are fairly obvious. 
    One area mentioned by the Solicitor General is for the employer discharge the employees. 
    Suppose Mr. Doyle was discharged by Mr. Linn and the Board would investigate, issue a complaint and order reinstatement with back wages. 
    If the libel suit were permitted to continue the jury or our judge might award Mr. Linn damages that would far exceed the amount of back wages or the lifetime earnings even of Mr. Doyle.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="6268.208" stopTime="6293.849">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    I suppose your suggestion is that that would be outrageous but I don't think -- I don't see why -- what if Mr. Doyle negligently ran over the employer and that cut both his legs off, he'd be subject to pay for the heavy damages. 
    And he also might at the same time be reinstated with back pay because of some labor practice against him. 
    The two are quite unrelated.
speaker="winston_l_livingston" startTime="6293.849" stopTime="6294.029">
    Mr. Winston L. Livingston 
    My point is --
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="6294.029" stopTime="6296.459">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    There were two differences that had standard.
speaker="winston_l_livingston" startTime="6296.459" stopTime="6441.136">
    Mr. Winston L. Livingston 
    My point is this, Mr. Justice. 
    The Board is to effectuate the National Policy. 
    The Board acts in the public interest as a matter of public policy. 
    So it orders the employer to take back an employee who has been discharged because of his union activity. 
    A huge award against Mr. Doyle would mean that that policy could not be effectuated because Mr. Doyle would obviously quit his employment and go elsewhere or rather than to have his legs taken to satisfy a judgment with this employer. 
    This is where I see that the conflict, it prevents the Board from effectuating the National Policy. 
    Another area of conflict is -- when NLRB holds an election and the Union should win in this case. 
    And the employers move to set him aside on the basis of the leaflet. 
    And NLRB finds this as merely permissible activity which indeed I think it would. 
    And then a jury awards you to damages against the Union which far exceeds the facets. 
    In this instance, the policies of the Act, that employees are to have complete freedom of choice in selecting their bargaining agent might be frustrated because the Union might abandon its efforts to represent the employees and go out of existence in order to satisfy in a judgment. 
    Huge or libel action seeking huge damages in effectively stipple the free exchange of use. 
    I like the language used in the New York Times case, libel actions maybe used as a tool by which expression is repressed, if you think that applies with the libel actions. 
    After Garmon, the use of injunctions and labor disputes especially in the area of peaceful picketing, have been almost completely eliminated. 
    Then all of a sudden, beginning about 1960, right after Garmon was decided, there has been a space a large number of these libel actions in the lower courts, most of them involving huge sums of money.

    If the Union wins the strike, the lawsuits disappear. 
    If the Union looses, the lawsuit is pushed in those instances or else treated for something else. 
    My main point here is that libel actions is just -- are being used just as another tool of management and it's' arsenal to fight unions. 
    And when injunction actions, were stopped as a result of the Garmon, then the libel actions came into play. 
    And the purpose of it is to list public support.

    I doubled check my own record, sir, during the recess period. 
    The circular was not filed with the complaint. 
    It was held as ultimately and potentially exhibiting the matter.

speaker="donald_f_welday" startTime="6674.372" stopTime="6771.326">
    Mr. Donald F. Welday 
    I didn't mean to suggest that there wasn't. 
    I did mean to suggest that there wasn't -- there was nothing to suggest a dispute as we understand that term. 
    I don't know. 
    It's been assumed here that there would be a -- not on drag on fight. 
    And I don't know that we can make that assumption. 
    I would like also to say that all the tests which have been suggested by the Solicitor General, by the respondent, and by Garmon, insofar as the Solicitor General's test of -- is concerned, we think that the questions posed by the Court demonstrate that the severity part of it or the grave part of it or the nasty part of it, is actually unworkable. 
    Frankly, on behalf of the petitioner, we could accept a test of malice or deliberate false suit insofar as allowing the state courts to retain jurisdiction is concerned. 
    If this is a retreat from our position that all actions for libel under these circumstances should be maintained, then we retreat to that point when the allegation is -- that there is a deliberate or a malicious, or knowingly false statement made, we think that that perhaps maybe a workable test. 
    The relevancy test suggested or the arguably subject test --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="6771.326" stopTime="6774.959">
    Justice Byron R. White

    Well the Solicitor General adds to it. 
    His is not a malicious or grave -- as I understood his test, it was malicious and grave. 
    And I don't think that you can use that gravity test any place. 
    I think it's just too hard to work.

    Justice Byron R. White 
    How about the suggestion Solicitor General made that within an elimination of punitive damages.
speaker="donald_f_welday" startTime="6809.356" stopTime="6916.649">
    Mr. Donald F. Welday 
    I, personally would have no objection because and particularly in the context of this case where some form to provide the truth is what the petitioner seeks here. 
    And this is what's been denied in. 
    He has no place to go to establish that he is not a crook, not a liar, and not a theft, not a robber. 
    And this is what he wants. 
    And this is what's been deprived because his employer did something on one hand and the Union made the statement on the other hand. 
    He's left out in the middle of the ocean with no ores. 
    And that seems to me to be contrary to what we are -- what this country is building around. 
    These people are entitled to maintain their reputations arguably subject the test that's suggested in the Garmon is fine if you can compel the labor board to hear these matters in the first place but you can't. 
    They can refuse to entertain the complaint or refuse to hear the matter. 
    So if we let the labor board say whether or not it is arguably subject, I would think we'd have to say that the Labor Board must make that determination but it doesn't. 
    The Garmon test actually provides three exceptions, one for violence, one for activities which are peripheral concerns of the Labor Management Act, and an exception in the case of compelling state interests. 
    The deliberate or malicious libel is much like violence in that it is an intentional means of destruction or something else now whether it happens to be a car or a building or an arm or a client relationship, or a reputation it still is an intentional destruction. 
    We think that it corresponds to violence.
