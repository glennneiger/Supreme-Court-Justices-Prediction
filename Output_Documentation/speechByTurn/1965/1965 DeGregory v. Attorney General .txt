speaker="howard_s_whiteside" startTime="34.900" stopTime="361.118">
    Mr. Howard S. Whiteside 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    This case arises on an appeal from a decision of the Supreme Court of New Hampshire which affirmed a decision of the Superior Court of New Hampshire, ordering the appellant in this case committed to jail for one year or until he purge himself for a civil contempt. 
    Involved is a statute of New Hampshire which is quoted on page 2 of my brief, Chapter 588, Section 8 (a) which is part of the New Hampshire Subversive Activities Act. 
    And the first sentence says, “At any time when the Attorney General has information which he deems reasonable or reliable relating to violations of the provisions of this Chapter, he shall make full and complete investigation thereof and shall report to the general court for results of this investigation together with his recommendations, if any, for legislation.” 
    This case originated in November of 1963. 
    You recall the statute, I just read says, if the Attorney General has information -- reasonable and reliable information concerning violations of the statute. 
    Now, what triggered the start of this investigation in November of 1963 was no new evidence of subversive activities in New Hampshire. 
    No sudden reappearance of the Communist Party of New Hampshire. 
    What triggered it was that Hugo DeGregory, the appellant in this case came into the Superior Court in New Hampshire and purged himself of contempt in a previous proceeding by answering in the negative the question, “Are you presently a member of the Communist Party?” 
    So, he left the court a freeman and two days later, the Attorney General issued a subpoena to have him appear for further investigation. 
    I have referred to the previous proceeding here. 
    The New Hampshire Subversive Activities Act was passed in 1951. 
    In 1953, a temporary statute permitting investigation by the Attorney General was adopted which not only provided that he might investigate as to violations of the chapter but provided that he might investigate as to the presence of subversive persons within the State of New Hampshire. 
    This was continued in 1955. 
    In 1957, the legislature adopted the present statute which dropped the clause about the presence of subversive persons in New Hampshire and reads as I read it to this Court. 
    The previous statute was involved in the cases of Sweezy versus New Hampshire and Wyman versus Uphaus both of which came to this Court. 
    The present statute was involved in the previous DeGregory case, DeGregory versus the Attorney General of New Hampshire which was decided without argument per curiam by this Court, 368 U.S. 19 with four justices dissenting. 
    Now -- and thereby upheld a New Hampshire decision saying that the Act was constitutional on its face and constitutional as applied to the facts in that case. 
    So as a result, I did not argue below the constitutionality of the statute on its face, although, it would be open to this Court to reconsider it if it so wanted. 
    My argument was based on whether the construction court on the statute by the New Hampshire courts went so far as to deny to appellant his rights under the United States Constitution, the First Amendment, the Fourth Amendment as guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment. 
    And so when he was summoned or let me interject this. 
    This case depends very much on the facts, the law has been cited, the cases have been cited which are very familiar to you, Sweezy, Uphaus, Watkins, Wilkinson, Braden, Barenblatt. 
    They're all cited in the briefs and it seems to me that it is more profitable to determine on the facts of this case, what is the applicable law? 
    Now, I might also advert to the fact that I have cited cases and among the cases which I already spoke off, some of those also say it but on page 13 of my brief, I've quoted two recent United States Supreme Court cases. 
    Where there is a significant encroachment upon personal liberty, the State may prevail only upon showing a subordinating interest which is compelling, Bates versus Little Rock. 
    And again, the decisions of this Court have consistently held that only a compelling state interest in the regulation of the subject in justified limiting First Amendment freedoms. 
    So, I turn to the start of this proceeding before the Attorney General and --

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    The -- those quotations you read by the duty of this Court to balance, is that right? 
    Balance the (Voice Overlap).

    Mr. Howard S. Whiteside 
    Yes. 
    On the -- on the majority decisions of this Court, that is true. 
    They balance the rights of the individual against the rights of the State under the circumstances to see whether the State as such urgent reason for action as to warrant infringement of what otherwise would be the individual's rights under the Constitution. 
    You will find that --

    But the individual has rights under the Constitution he hasn't, doesn't he --
speaker="howard_s_whiteside" startTime="397.169" stopTime="423.215">
    Mr. Howard S. Whiteside 
    Well, there is the view -- there is the view Mr. Justice that the First Amendment is exactly what it says and cannot be limited but that is not then the majority view of this Court. 
    The majority view of this Court as said that the rights of the individual under the First Amendment or the Fourth Amendment maybe infringed only when the State shows an urgent necessity or compelling reason for doing so.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="423.215" stopTime="428.801">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    I didn't know that the Court had ever held that. 
    I decide--
speaker="howard_s_whiteside" startTime="428.801" stopTime="430.878">
    Mr. Howard S. Whiteside 
    Well, maybe limited. 
    Did I say infringed?
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="430.878" stopTime="434.998">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    If you have a right under the Constitution, it can't be infringed at all, isn't that right?
speaker="howard_s_whiteside" startTime="434.998" stopTime="781.472">
    Mr. Howard S. Whiteside 
    I think I get what Your Honor is driving at. 
    The right of the individual is limited under certain emergency circumstances so that the use of the word 'infringed' is wrong, I should have used the word 'limited'. 
    Now, the record of the hearing before the Attorney General under this summons is found on page 26 of the record and it goes on for some pages. 
    And the appellant through his attorney inquired immediately as to what the foundation of the Attorney General was for this new proceeding, what he was investigating. 
    And the Attorney General said that first of all, he didn't admit that he had to show any basis for investigation. 
    He have to show a form of probable cause and then he -- on page 28, he referred to -- in very general terms, the Communist Party as it existed in the late 1940s nationally and internationally. 
    And then he said, there is extensive documentary -- documented sworn testimony to the effect that Hugo DeGregory has been for a long active within the Communist Party of the state and on the later page, he said that -- no, I'll leave it with that. 
    And with that, the attorney for the appellant said, when, where, what is this sworn testimony? 
    What year does it applied to? 
    Where was it? 
    And the Attorney General went no further. 
    And so the appellant made the following sworn statement in this proceeding and I may interject. 
    He later repeated that under oath in the Court when the proceeding got to the court. 
    “I would like to state Mr. Gall that I am not now a member of the Communist Party and have not been at any time since the authority you have cited for Revised Statutes Annotated Chapter 588, Section 8 (a) that I have no knowledge of any Communist activities in New Hampshire during this period or of any violations RSA 588 during this period of six and one-half years. 
    In fact, I am not even aware of the existence of a Communist Party in the State of New Hampshire at any time the authority you have cited, Section 8 (a) has been on the statute. 
    And in view of the foregoing, I do not understand what it is I have to face here today.” 
    And the only reply of the Assistant Attorney General was, “Well, we have some questions to ask you.” 
    And so, proceeding from there, he asked questions such as, “Have you ever been a member of the Communist Party? 
    Have you ever been an officer of Communist Party?” 
    And each time the appellant would say, “When? 
    What period are you talking about?” 
    And the Attorney General would say, “Any period.” 
    And so the appellant under those circumstances and in view of the sworn statement that he gave declined to answer those questions. 
    And then we came to the next stage before the Superior Court. 
    The Attorney General filed a petition in the Superior Court under the appropriate New Hampshire statute to have the appellant ordered to answer the questions or held in contempt. 
    The appellant filed an answer which among other things set up the unconstitutionality of the proceeding as so applied. 
    In the court, there was a long discussion as to foundation. 
    The Attorney General again said that he didn't really feel that he needed to establish it. 
    And then he went on to mention again the sworn testimony in the file and he was challenged repeatedly on that. 
    “Produce it. 
    What year does it refer to? 
    Where is it?” 
    And the court never ordered him to produce it or spends part of the year and he never did. 
    And in fact, the court's decision later was not based on this statement of unknown sworn statements in the file. 
    It was based solely on a report which I will get to shortly. 
    It developed that the Attorney General really was relying on the 1955 Report of the Attorney General of New Hampshire to the legislature. 
    That report was attached as an exhibit in the Uphaus case in 360 U.S. here and is on file, a number of copies in this Court. 
    In view of that, the parties in this case have stipulated that we would not file the whole document. 
    It's about 250 pages and it's getting very scarce and I say, there are so many cases on file in the courts among other things. 
    And so, I named pages 204 to 206 of that document as part of the record because they had been referred to in the court hearing and because they deal specifically with the appellant. 
    The appellee, Attorney General, asked me to stipulate that he would have the right to refer to other parts of the document and argument and I so stipulated. 
    And in appendices to his brief, he has referred to other parts of the document which he does not give a page number on so I don't know where they are. 
    I don't even have a copy of that document at this point. 
    But I do have some notes as to certain references he made.

    Well -- are you arguing staleness here.

    Mr. Howard S. Whiteside 
    I am Your Honor. 
    That is one of my arguments. 
    I argue lack of foundation. 
    I argue that the construction of the New Hampshire Court goes so far that it would permit almost any state investigation in this field, whatever foundation was laid. 
    The foundation here is so flimsy. 
    I want to go into the appellee's brief in which he makes certain allegations of fact which are not supported on the record. 
    He says and he repeats it. 
    And he repeats it time after time. 
    He describes appellant DeGregory as Secretary-Treasurer and organizer and leader in New Hampshire of the Communist Party. 
    Well, I refer this Court to the record that portion of the 1955 Report which I already said which is found on page -- pages 23 through 26 of the record. 
    And there it shows, “Yes, Hugo DeGregory was in the Communist Party in 1946 in Massachusetts and there's no later showing as to that.” 
    Yes, he was a paid functionary with Communist Party according to this report in Massachusetts and not New Hampshire in 1947 and 1948 no later record shown. 
    Now, as to his being a leader in New Hampshire of the Communist Party, that is not shown at all and in a couple of places.

    Mr. Howard S. Whiteside 
    Yes, but when?

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    That's where the questions were directed at, to finding out when at all, isn't that correct?
speaker="howard_s_whiteside" startTime="1059.231" stopTime="1106.454">
    Mr. Howard S. Whiteside 
    Well, in answer to your question, it does come out on page 19 of the transcript of the record, statement of Mr. Gall near the top of the page in which inquiry was made by me as to what period he was inquiring about and he replied or has stated to the Court, Your Honor, based on the information that is in the report covering that period of years which is any period during the period that is reflected in the report. 
    In other words, he was inquiring as to 1954 and previously. 
    He was not inquiring as to Communist activities or subversive activities current in New Hampshire at the time he brought those summons.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1106.454" stopTime="1111.350">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    I thought the question was or the following questions was, “Were you ever or have you ever?”

    Mr. Howard S. Whiteside 
    Yes, and --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1112.755" stopTime="1120.486">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well, that's pretty clear if you -- it's just an ordinary meaning of English words that doesn't say 1954 or previously, that says ever.
speaker="howard_s_whiteside" startTime="1120.486" stopTime="1142.865">
    Mr. Howard S. Whiteside 
    That is correct and DeGregory have already testified as to the previous six and a half years and questioned the constitutional authority of the Attorney General to go into the period before unless he had some current activities which would permit him as ancillary to those current activities to go into activities that long ago passed.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="1142.865" stopTime="1149.389">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Is there a period of limitations in the Subversive Activities Act?
speaker="howard_s_whiteside" startTime="1149.389" stopTime="1237.433">
    Mr. Howard S. Whiteside 
    It is the general New Hampshire's statute of limitations which is six years. 
    Now, the statement in the appellee's brief that DeGregory was the leader of the party in New Hampshire is based on the following and on page 9 of the report, quote, he cites page 9 of the report for this and this is the only thing on page 9 that I can find which would justify, “A long time Communist Party official, Hugo DeGregory, currently a functionary in New Hampshire may currently be the power behind the party in this State”. 
    That makes him a New Hampshire leader of the party according to the appellee in its brief. 
    Then the appellee also makes another statement in his brief which I must challenge. 
    As one of the bases, as one of the foundations that he says he has for going forward with this investigation. 
    He says, first of all, he has the report. 
    Second, we have still the same airfields, military installations in New Hampshire which would be vulnerable to Communist activity and then he says, page 27 in his brief, “There are also presently residents of New Hampshire who are many of the individuals discussed in said report” and there's absolutely nothing in the record to back that up. 
    You search the record, there is nothing there to back up that statement.

    I point out Your Honor that that was not the appellant's position. 
    He made this one statement as to the period since June of 1957 disclaiming membership, knowledge or any part in Communist Party or subversive activities and if the Attorney General had believed that he was not telling the truth, it was open to him to cross-examine on that and he never did so. 
    That testimony of DeGregory stands uncontradicted by any cross-examination or any independent evidence.

    Here we are at page 31. 
    "Have you ever been a member of the Communist Party?” 
    "When did you join the Communist Party?” 
    "Were you a paid member of the Communist Party?" 
    “Were you an officer?” 
    "Did you have access to -- well and so on?” 
    And before the Attorney General, each time the appellant asked “When? 
    What period are you speaking of?” 
    And he never got any specification to any period as the reply. 
    And in that --

    Mr. Howard S. Whiteside 
    Alright, but it has been made clear by the Attorney General's own statement that he was investigating the period of 19 -- early 1950s and back rather from the present. 
    Now, I may say the appellee has cited and cited a certain quotation from the case of Communist Party versus the Subversive Activities Control Board in which he says, “Where the current character of an organization of the nature of its connection with others is an issue, of course, past conduct is pertinent” and goes on like that, and this of course I admit. 
    Of course, past conduct is pertinent to explain present statements or present conduct but here we don't have any present statements or present conduct. 
    The Attorney General is not investigating it at present. 
    He has summoned the appellant -- the appellant has testified as to the present. 
    The Attorney General has produced nothing else as to the present which would permit him to investigate under this statute as to subversive activities.

    In Watkins versus The United States, 354 U.S., cited on my brief at page 8. 
    It was said, the First Amendment may be invoked against infringement of the protected freedoms by law or by lawmaking and that was the case of a legislative investigation.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1648.102" stopTime="1661.358">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    How can -- this certainly, it's very possible that in the course of a legislative investigation there might be an infringement of the right of a free press or the free exercise of religion but I just wonder what the claim was here.
speaker="howard_s_whiteside" startTime="1661.358" stopTime="1746.113">
    Mr. Howard S. Whiteside 
    The claim was here without a foundation to go forward or without a legal foundation that the Attorney General could not properly proceed and if I may put it in three short statements. 
    The Attorney General can constitutionally investigate current subversive activities, if he has evidence of them. 
    There is no evidence in this record. 
    He can inquire at a past conduct to throw or lay down the present, if he has some evidence of the present. 
    There is no such evidence in this record. 
    He can inquire that the trick posted by the Communist Party in New Hampshire, if he has some evidence that there is a Communist Party in New Hampshire. 
    There is no evidence in the record that there has been a Communist Party in New Hampshire since 1953. 
    I cited in my brief the case of Pennsylvania versus Nelson to show the limited power of the State. 
    The State is not defending the whole United States now reference as to as Adam spies of the Berlin Wall are not apposite here. 
    This is the safety of the State of New Hampshire and the Attorney General is confined to his defense of that and should produce for the record what he has to justify his investigation as to that. 
    Therefore, I submit to Your Honors that this investigation has gone beyond the grounds of the Constitution and the order of the New Hampshire Court should be reversed. 
   
   
   
   Argument of R. Peter Shapiro
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1746.113" stopTime="1750.531">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Very well. 
    Mr. Shapiro.
speaker="r_peter_shapiro" startTime="1750.531" stopTime="1778.683">
    Mr. R. Peter Shapiro 
    Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    The only issue before the Court that I see is the constitutionality of the application of New Hampshire, RSA 588 (a) as applied in the facts of the instant case. 
    The constitutionality was not raised below and I believe it was decided by this Court in Wyman v. DeGregory, 368 U.S. 19. 
    The basic --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1778.683" stopTime="1783.188">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    This complicate the constitutionality as applied to the facts of this case was certainly raisable.
speaker="r_peter_shapiro" startTime="1783.188" stopTime="1783.828">
    Mr. R. Peter Shapiro 
    Yes, that's correct.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1783.828" stopTime="1784.123">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Is it?
speaker="r_peter_shapiro" startTime="1784.123" stopTime="1784.967">
    Mr. R. Peter Shapiro 
    That is the only issue --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1784.967" stopTime="1790.275">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    You're not suggesting that the issues which have been argued by your brother are not before us, are you?
speaker="r_peter_shapiro" startTime="1790.275" stopTime="1790.618">
    Mr. R. Peter Shapiro 
    No.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1790.618" stopTime="2064.730">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    No, alright. 
    Not with that respect. 
    Now, the basic legal test to be employed by the Court is, has the interest of the State in this instance to adequately inform itself in order to protect its legitimate and vital interest, then pressed into fatal collision with the constitutionally protected rights of defendant. 
    This was brought out in the Uphaus v. Wyman case and it was I believe restated in Gibson versus Florida Legislative Committee, 372 U.S. 
    It's actually a balancing test between the rights and responsibilities of the Government on one hand and the constitutional rights of an individual on the other hand. 
    Now, our courts, New Hampshire Supreme Court is very familiar as I cited on page 10 of my brief with this type of proceeding. 
    They've been informed in the Sweezy case and the Uphaus case by this Court the proper application to be applied in this instance and they have been affirmed in the second Uphaus case and later DeGregory case as to the application of the statute. 
    It's our contention that once the appellate court concludes that the lower court has applied the appropriate law, the proper law of the case, it's not the duty of the appellate court to substitute their judgment but that of the lower court but whether or not there is adequate evidence in the record to sustain the position of the lower court. 
    Basically, three problems that I find involved this case, one, that has been raised would be the staleness issue which relates to the nexus between the subject under investigation and the individual witness Mr. DeGregory. 
    The compelling interest of a state would be the second interest involved. 
    Now, the one point which distinguishes the present case of DeGregory versus the Attorney General from the prior case is a lapse of time of roughly three years. 
    Everything else is basically the same. 
    Now, once the Court has determined that there is a valid fact-finding hearing and investigation has been started properly, it's the duty of the State to tie the witness into this investigation to show a proper nexus. 
    Now, the subject under investigation here is generally communism in and affecting the State of New Hampshire. 
    The basis being that the interest here is self-preservation -- which has been -- of the State of New Hampshire which has been long stated by this Court as a valid interest of investigation by the State. 
    The subject of investigation is the Communist Party which has been held by this Court in the Barenblatt case specifically as a -- the Communist Party is different than any other political party. 
    Its basic nature, its aim, the ultimate overthrow of our form of government, our democratic form of government, has been held to be a valid area of investigation. 
    And the vehicle for the investigation has been held valid as I've cited in the cases in my brief is the legislative fact-finding committee. 
    In this case, the Attorney General is appointed as such. 
    And -- now with reference to the nexus involved, the following is a brief resume of the witnesses' relationship to the subject under inquiry. 
    In Appendix K of my brief, cited at page 78, it indicates that DeGregory was a candidate in Massachusetts for Lieutenant Governor in 1940. 
    The Daily Worker named him as a member of the Communist Political Association in '42. 
    In '45, he was on the letterhead of the Communist Party in Massachusetts as Secretary-Treasurer. 
    Now, this is in Massachusetts. 
    He was active in the Communist Party in Massachusetts in 1949. 
    He was a paid functionary in 1949. 
    Now, in Appendix H of my brief at page 65, it describes the relationship of Massachusetts -- following New England states is for the exception of Connecticut were considered District 1 of the Communist Party and they all were tied up together. 
    Now, in 1950, DeGregory moved to New Hampshire where he presently resides also it indicates, I'm now back to Appendix K, that he was active in New Hampshire from '46 to '48 which would tie up the relationship between Massachusetts and New Hampshire.

    I think they were in good deal, largely though?
speaker="r_peter_shapiro" startTime="2431.417" stopTime="2435.156">
    Mr. R. Peter Shapiro 
    With reference to the concept of nexus, there are --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="2435.156" stopTime="2436.225">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    With reference to what?
speaker="r_peter_shapiro" startTime="2436.225" stopTime="2690.049">
    Mr. R. Peter Shapiro 
    The concept of nexus, the relationship of the witness to the subject under investigation. 
    I have cited in my brief roughly seven cases starting with the Gibson case and the rest of the Florida. 
    And here, we had an investigation of Communist infiltration into organizations in the race relations area. 
    The witness at that time was the President of the NAACP in Florida and what the State was after at that time were membership list primarily plus other information. 
    Now, in this case, you have this Court held that there was no nexus, basically, because the president was not a Communist -- there was no Communist tie up at all, either the president or any of the members of the party. 
    This is the far end of the gamut in nexus. 
    Sweezy case would be the next one in line which the Court did not overturn the case on the basis of no insufficient nexus. 
    I believe the primary thrust in this instance was the Court was not aware of whether or not the New Hampshire legislature wished to be informed on this matter. 
    And -- but the area or the compelling interest in this case of infil -- Communist infiltration into the area of education in New Hampshire was deemed, I believe, in that instance to be a compelling interest. 
    Now, the remaining cases starting with the Watkins case where it was a federal investigation at that time into the area of infil -- Communist infiltration and subversion, in this case, two prior witnesses pinpointed Watkins as a Communist. 
    He is a Communist recruiter from 1942 to '47, roughly eight, nine, ten years before the case finally came before the Court. 
    And this was considered a sufficient relationship to proceed to examine the individual and this case too was reversed but not for the reason of an insufficient nexus. 
    It was because the witness was unable to understand the nature of the question asked to him, the pertinency aspect which I will get in to a little bit later in my argument. 
    Now, the Wilkinson case and the Braden case also a federal case as in the federal were investigations of communism into the area of communism, this time by the Federal Government and again, this was considered a compelling interest to proceed with the investigation. 
    In both of these cases, the witnesses were not tied up as of the present time. 
    There was a relation back of their position in the Communist Party. 
    And again, we have the Uphaus case which is a New Hampshire case, a state investigation into subversion in affecting security of the State of New Hampshire and Mr. Uphaus was the executive director of the World Fellowship which was a group where 19 to 20 known Communists were meeting and discussing on what we believe more than an academic level area of communism. 
    We -- it was sufficient to trigger our investigation of this area, the Court held and it was a compelling interest. 
    Now, the key case, I think which is almost in point with us is the Barenblatt case. 
    In here, Mr. Barenblatt was an active member of the Communist Party from '47 to '50 while a student and a teaching fellow at the University of Michigan. 
    Now, this was another federal investigation into the area of subversion into education. 
    There was no major tie up from this individual, Barenblatt from '47 to '50 in that area to the present, the same position as DeGregory. 
    The record was quite espoused in that area. 
    Now, the Court upheld the position that there was a valid nexus between the parties in this case and this is -- this is pretty much what we have in the DeGregory case and of course --

    Justice Abe Fortas 
    May I ask you in that connection. 
    Is it your position that you satisfy the first sentence of 8 (a).
speaker="r_peter_shapiro" startTime="2703.334" stopTime="2703.768">
    Mr. R. Peter Shapiro 
    Yes, it is.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="2703.768" stopTime="2729.369">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    By reason of the evidence that you have that six and a half years prior to the term of the examination, DeGregory is connected with Communist Party or was a Communist official or whatever it might be. 
    Is that net -- net of the position?
speaker="r_peter_shapiro" startTime="2729.369" stopTime="2760.935">
    Mr. R. Peter Shapiro 
    If I might explain, I'm not -- not completely. 
    No, Your Honor. 
    What our position is as our Supreme Court held that taken the nature of the Communist Party and its motive and aims coupling this with the report of the Attorney General that the -- that our Attorney General, the present Attorney General at that time, had reasonable and reliable information to trigger his investigation into subversion in and effecting the State of New Hampshire.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="2760.935" stopTime="2784.114">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Now, is it your position that if he can investigate subversion that he had legal authority and legal justification for investigating a subversion but he doesn't have to make any showing whatsoever with respect to any particular individual who is called to testify? 
    That's not your position, is it?
speaker="r_peter_shapiro" startTime="2784.114" stopTime="2793.346">
    Mr. R. Peter Shapiro 
    No, it's not our position that he have to show with reference with particular individual that he has specifically committed a crime or he is --

    Justice Abe Fortas

    Yes, we do.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="2798.007" stopTime="2828.998">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    And so from your point of view, that doesn't make any difference whether DeGregory was connected with the Communist Party or not, that is to say, if the Attorney General have general -- have some reason to believe that he is ought to invest -- he is authorized to investigate the Communist Party, he could call anybody, is that right? 
    The Episcopalian Minister or the Baptist Minister or the Governor of the State or whatnot, is that right?
speaker="r_peter_shapiro" startTime="2828.998" stopTime="2835.732">
    Mr. R. Peter Shapiro

    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, you asked questions having to do with six and a half years ago. 
    You must have thought the State had a legitimate interest in finding out about the Communist Party as it existed six and a half years ago as a purview to finding out what's happened to it since that time.
speaker="r_peter_shapiro" startTime="2905.611" stopTime="2910.153">
    Mr. R. Peter Shapiro

speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2910.153" stopTime="2938.926">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Now, what if it -- what if you'd have information on DeGregory that he had been a member of the Communist Party of 1931 and he had said that I have not been -- you had information and he says, “I have not been a member and I'm not a member of the Communist Party now and I have not been a member in the last 30 years.” 
    And you said -- and then you asked him, “Were you a member in 1931?” 
    Is there some limit to this or not?
speaker="r_peter_shapiro" startTime="2938.926" stopTime="2945.139">
    Mr. R. Peter Shapiro 
    Yes, there is and I would think this might be -- very well be the limit because of a nexus factor that --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2945.139" stopTime="2969.207">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    When does that come? 
    When was that -- how can you recognize it when that line comes? 
    That they say, the -- the petitioner says it's come already, six and a half years is too long. 
    You shouldn't have to -- they shouldn't be entitled to make inquiries at all in that stale. 
    Would it be 10 years or 15 or what?
speaker="r_peter_shapiro" startTime="2969.207" stopTime="2987.649">
    Mr. R. Peter Shapiro 
    I don't think there's any specific period. 
    I believe that this nexus concept is a case-by-case study of the position. 
    Now, if all you have was one sworn statement that an individual was a Communist in 1931 and you had nothing else, I think the State's position would be extremely weak.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2987.649" stopTime="2993.107">

    Mr. R. Peter Shapiro

    Mr. R. Peter Shapiro 
    I would think -- assume that the legislature would want to know the extent of Communist activities in and affecting the states so that they can either possibly maybe repeal this law or add new laws, change or amend it. 
    It's our contention that the legislature just can't operate in a vacuum.

    If you didn't -- as a fact there for this question, you didn't include any information whatsoever about whether there was or was not a Communist Party operating in New Hampshire at the time the questions were asked.

    Isn't it true? 
    There's no evidence in the record that at the time you ask these questions that are involved here that the Communist Party wasn't -- was in existence or had any activities whatsoever in New Hampshire or even had any members there. 
    Is there?

    Mr. R. Peter Shapiro 
    I have to answer by yes or no on this.

    I think for where starting point, with the position of our Supreme Court that it's -- its basic fundamental, I believe, the nature of the Communist movement, its ideals, its aims, its aims, its threat and I can't -- and if you take this and you couple it with the record here. 
    Now, I'll move myself back to the prior DeGregory case which we had and the case law has always been the same. 
    The position on the Communist Party had been the same and it hasn't change up to date. 
    The world situation with communism was known to the courts at that time and it is -- I feel accelerated somewhat.

    With the information available in our files that we would present a formal report if required.

    What's the legislature done about it?
speaker="r_peter_shapiro" startTime="3323.037" stopTime="3332.716">
    Mr. R. Peter Shapiro 
    The legislature has felt that the law which we have is operating well and that they intend to keep it as such.
speaker="tom_c_clark" startTime="3332.716" stopTime="3335.796">
    Justice Tom C. Clark 
    And then Machiavelli in '55 of course.
speaker="r_peter_shapiro" startTime="3335.796" stopTime="3342.075">
    Mr. R. Peter Shapiro 
    Yes, they did because that's when they made it a continuing operation after '55 and '57.
speaker="tom_c_clark" startTime="3342.075" stopTime="3346.835">
    Justice Tom C. Clark 
    You know that that's been -- you did not enact a substantive law.
speaker="r_peter_shapiro" startTime="3346.835" stopTime="3358.934">
    Mr. R. Peter Shapiro 
    No. 
    There was a bill before the House last year but it was defeated with reference to Communist speaker to state institution. 
    Similar law which I think South Carolina has.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="3358.934" stopTime="3366.687">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Would that suggest that your legislature doesn't think there's much of a danger existing in New Hampshire?
speaker="r_peter_shapiro" startTime="3366.687" stopTime="3378.257">
    Mr. R. Peter Shapiro 
    I wouldn't think so because the nature of the law that I think got blown out of proportion by political problems involved, side issues and personalities as opposed to the actual need of the law.
speaker="tom_c_clark" startTime="3378.257" stopTime="3386.541">
    Justice Tom C. Clark 
    For reindictment what you have said, if I understand, the purpose of you to inform a legislature --
speaker="r_peter_shapiro" startTime="3386.541" stopTime="3386.648">
    Mr. R. Peter Shapiro 
    That's correct.
speaker="tom_c_clark" startTime="3386.648" stopTime="3388.083">
    Justice Tom C. Clark 
    Perhaps you're investigating?
speaker="r_peter_shapiro" startTime="3388.083" stopTime="3389.107">
    Mr. R. Peter Shapiro 
    That's correct.
speaker="tom_c_clark" startTime="3389.107" stopTime="3408.357">
    Justice Tom C. Clark 
    You made in the court's term a rather comprehensive report 7 years ago and (Inaudible) probably continued by the committee. 
    I just wonder what your accomplishments are.
speaker="r_peter_shapiro" startTime="3408.357" stopTime="3427.669">
    Mr. R. Peter Shapiro 
    The prophecy would be, I feel legislatively. 
    I feel the state is doing a proper job in this area and they are being properly informed on the present state of the record and the present state of the facts which we have that there's no necessity to change the law. 
    Now, if I might add with reference to --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3427.669" stopTime="3444.071">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    How many -- may I ask this? 
    How many other witnesses were called by the committee at or about the time Mr. DeGregory was called, if any?
speaker="r_peter_shapiro" startTime="3444.071" stopTime="3449.507">
    Mr. R. Peter Shapiro 
    Possibly half a dozen witnesses or so at that time.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="3449.507" stopTime="3454.941">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Was that at the time that DeGregory was called initially or later?
speaker="r_peter_shapiro" startTime="3454.941" stopTime="3461.430">
    Mr. R. Peter Shapiro 
    I believe the question was directed to -- at the time of the second hearing, 1963.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="3461.430" stopTime="3462.746">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    That's your answer.
speaker="r_peter_shapiro" startTime="3462.746" stopTime="3463.455">
    Mr. R. Peter Shapiro 
    Yes.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3463.455" stopTime="3466.925">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Where we find that in the re -- where do we find that in the record?
speaker="r_peter_shapiro" startTime="3466.925" stopTime="3467.802">
    Mr. R. Peter Shapiro 
    No, you will not find that.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3467.802" stopTime="3475.259">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Is there any record made of that by the committee for the use of the legislature?
speaker="r_peter_shapiro" startTime="3475.259" stopTime="3477.065">
    Mr. R. Peter Shapiro 
    It would be in our file.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3477.065" stopTime="3478.869">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    There's no report of any kind?
speaker="r_peter_shapiro" startTime="3478.869" stopTime="3513.842">
    Mr. R. Peter Shapiro 
    No, there's no written report, no. 
    The procedure has been for the Attorney General to go before the committee and orally present the basic facts at that time as requested it would be. 
    Again, we do have a problem with gathering this information by the reluctance of the witnesses to testify and also, our files -- well we have no access to the files that any of the federal agencies with the information which they have in this area that all on our own basis, we have to go out and gather this information.
speaker="tom_c_clark" startTime="3513.842" stopTime="3521.612">
    Justice Tom C. Clark 
    Do you think counsel that the citation of the prosecution derived out of the other states applied here?

    Mr. R. Peter Shapiro 
    Not to my knowledge.

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Would we be able to assume of the fact that nothing has been done during this last six and a half years. 
    Legislature has done nothing. 
    The New Hampshire is not in extreme imperative danger of being overthrown at this time?
speaker="r_peter_shapiro" startTime="3548.217" stopTime="3566.254">
    Mr. R. Peter Shapiro 
    Well, I think you have to look at it from the position as I cited in my brief. 
    The threat is not like the horse of the Mongols coming out of the woods and overthrowing our State. 
    The problem is the nature of the Communist Party, the infiltration of the probing.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="3566.254" stopTime="3579.104">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    But the problem, I suppose, was the basis of your legal right to do this is, as I understood you to say, that the right of New Hampshire to preserve itself from destruction.
speaker="r_peter_shapiro" startTime="3579.104" stopTime="3580.961">
    Mr. R. Peter Shapiro 
    That's correct.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="3580.961" stopTime="3599.012">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    And would we be have a right to assume that there's no immediate likelihood of that destruction by the fact that you haven't found anybody and haven't found the five witness even to ask questions during the last six and a half years.
