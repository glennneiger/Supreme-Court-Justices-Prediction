Surowitz v. Hilton Hotels Corporation
speaker="richard_f_watt" startTime="0.000" stopTime="789.835">
    Mr. Richard F. Watt 
    Mr. Justice Black, if the Court please. 
    This matter is before the Court in a writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, which in March of 1965 affirmed the dismissal of a stockholder's derivative suit which had been filed in the District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. 
    Very briefly stated, and I will come back in a moment to give more detail. 
    The ground for dismissal was that the plaintiff shareholder had filed a false verification required by Rule 23 (b) of the Federal Rule of Civil Procedure. 
    Federal Rule 23 (b) specifies that in derivative suits, the complaint shall be verified and it also specifies certain matters which shall be set out in the complaint. 
    The petitioner's view that this raises an important issue under the Federal Rules and one that goes far beyond the outcome of this particular case because it poses directly the question as to whether a procedural Rule can be used to impose upon admittedly a poorly educated and ignorant stockholder, a very substantial obstacles to her bringing a derivative suit where alleging misconduct on the part of officers and directors of the corporation in which she own stock. 
    The record is clear that the petitioner here is a foreign-born, ill-educated seamstress in her mid 60s. 
    As a matter of fact, the record on the deposition below indicate that she had difficulty in spelling her son-in-law's name, his name is Irving Brilliant. 
    The complaint here was filed in December of 1963. 
    It consists of 11 counts, eight of which alleged violations under the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities of Exchange Act of 1934. 
    Very briefly, it charges that the officers and directors who are named as defendants, wrongfully and in violation of the Securities Act made used of the corporation for the purpose of purchasing shares of stock of the corporation and also, Hilton Credit Corporation and that included in the shares of stock which were purchased were very large amounts of shares from the officers and directors themselves with the result that approximately $12 million of Hilton Hotels Corporation funds that were used for this purchases. 
    Approximately $4,800,000, were used to purchase the shares of the officers and directors, and those funds were paid to those officers and directors for the purchase of their stock. 
    The complaint is filed, was signed by three attorneys and it was verified by Mrs. Surowitz in accordance with the provisions of Rule 23 (b). 
    She verified as true and correct, certain facts, very largely the facts of her stock ownership and the other facts which would indicate that she has standing or status to sue as a stockholder. 
    The balance that is the charges of wrongdoings were verified by her on information and belief. 
    Before answer was filed, the defendant moved to take Mrs. Surowitz's deposition. 
    Upon receipt of that notice, we appeared in Court and asked the District Court to postpone the taking of the deposition until the defendants had filed some pleadings or answers so that we would have a better idea as to what issues might be raised. 
    The District Court declined to postpone the deposition, and therefore, the deposition was taken in February of 1964 prior to any pleading having been filed by the defendants. 
    The deposition was concluded and on the same afternoon, at approximately 3:30, as counsel for the petitioner, we were served with notice that on the next morning, the defendants would appear before the district judge and present a written motion. 
    Now, the motion appears in the transcript of record at page 117. 
    In that motion, two grounds were asserted for dismissal. 
    One, that the pleading was a sham pleading; and secondly, that Mrs. Surowitz was not a proper party plaintiff. 
    The following morning, when we appeared in Court, the defendants filed an affidavit which indicated that the records of the corporation showed that she had not become a stockholder of record until October of 1963 and this was presumably the basis for asserting that she was not a proper party plaintiff because she did not have the contemporaneous stock ownership required by Rule 23 (b). 
    The district judge at that time initially was inclined to have the matter argued immediately but at our request, he gave us 15 days in which to file affidavits. 
    In response to the motion therefore, we filed two affidavits, the affidavit of Irving Brilliant, Mrs. Surowitz's son-in-law, and the affidavit of Walter Rockler, one of the attorneys. 
    The matter was argued later on March and the Court at the end argument announced the order would be one of dismissal. 
    Thereafter, at the Court's request, counsel for the defendants' prepared detailed and lengthy findings of fact and conclusions of law which were discussed in Court on March the 27th and the order of dismissal was actually entered on March 30, 1964. 
    In Mrs. Surowitz's deposition, she was able to testify that her son-in-law had purchased stock for her with her money and at one point, she indicated the stock was purchased in 1957. 
    That in late 1962 or early 1963, she received certain communications from Hilton Hotels Corporation turned them over to her son-in-law and in effect asked him what they were all about. 
    Now, later in March after a further discussion between Mrs. Surowitz and her son-in-law, he brought to her a letter of protest which is a document attached to the deposition. 
    And in that letter of protest which she signed, stated that she opposed as improper the two stock purchase transactions which I have mentioned. 
    In the summer of 1963, the dividend on Hilton Hotels Corporation was passed. 
    She again spoke to her son-in-law. 
    He advised her that he was looking into the matter and it was of the opinion that certain officers and directors had acted improperly. 
    Subsequently, in December, the son-in-law brought the complaint to her which had been prepared by counsel in Chicago. 
    He read and explained it to her, and following that, she signed the verification. 
    The deposition also indicates and we do not dispute this at all that so far as her ability to explain or answer the basis for the complaint in the sense of articulating the facts or the basis for certain allegations, she was unable to do that. 
    She answered repeatedly that she did not know. 
    She could not say it on her own words. 
    She did not understand. 
    She didn't know. 
    She left it to her son-in-law. 
    She also stated, however, that she knew that her stock was not right and that she indicated that when the complaint was brought to her after these previous discussions that I've indicated following her son-in-law's explanation, she signed it. 
    The affidavits of Mr. Brilliant and Mr. Rockler indicate, it seem to me beyond question that before this complaint was prepared and filed, a very substantial amount of investigatory in research work had been done both by Mr. Brilliant and by Mr. Rockler and his associates in Chicago. 
    A great deal of effort was made to go to records, to track down transactions, to look at financial statements and so on, and those are set out in some detail. 
    Mr. Brilliant also states in his affidavit that when he presented the complaint to his mother-in-law, Mrs. Surowitz, he told her that it represented the result of work that he had done and that the attorney in Chicago had done, and that it was his opinion that it was soundly based. 
    I think it is important to note in this connection that Mr. Brilliant himself has legal training. 
    He has acted as an investment counselor for a number of years and it is quite clear from the record, that since 1957 in connection with the small investment she has made, Mrs. Surowitz has relied upon her son-in-law for his recommendations and for his judgment. 
    Now, the Court of Appeals in affirming, held at the verification was false and it held that it was false because in her deposition, Mrs. Surowitz indicated that she lacked requisite knowledge and understanding to know what she was verified. 
    The actual words of the Court which I think are significant for purposes of the issue now here at the -- at record 237, the Court said, she lacked completely -- she completely lacked any knowledge of the basis of the complaint at the time when she signed the same and swore to the verity thereof. 
    At the bottom of 235 and 36, the Court said that the verification requirement, that is Rule 23 (b), is designed to compel a plaintiff to begin such suit with sufficient knowledge of facts and information to show by his verification that there is a substantial basis to support the complaint which she made. 
    It is our view that this is not a proper interpretation of Rule 23 (b) and that the decision of the Court of Appeals should be reversed, primarily for two reasons. 
    Rule 23 (b) is a procedural Rule. 
    We believe that should be liberally construed particularly in light of the important public policy considerations where it's in -- where -- which is in -- which are involved in causes of action arising under the Securities Act and the intent of Congress that stockholders would act in effect as ancillary enforcers of those Acts. 
    Secondly, we believe that if one studies the history of Rule 23 (b). 
    It is quite clear that its principle purpose was to prevent collusive resort to the federal courts and that it was not intended and no Court has held that it was intended to impose a kind of comprehension test upon a plaintiff stockholder before that stockholder would have a right as the instigator to bring a corporate cause of action to Court. 
    Very briefly, let me indicate why in the context of the facts here, we believe the public policy considerations are significant. 
    It is no longer the case in this country that stocks are held only by a relatively limited class of persons. 
    All the statistics indicate that stock ownership is becoming much more widespread. 
    Significantly enough, the largest single group of stockowners in the United States today are housewives and unemployed women. 
    Elderly women, in particular, hold substantial bodies and quantities of stock. 
    The Securities Act, if one looks to the legislative history, were particularly designed to protect unknowledgeable, and gullible, and uninformed, and uneducated individuals who might invest in the stock market. 
    Consequently to Rule -- to construe Rule 23 (b), as a qualification upon the comprehension of a stockholder before that stockholder can bring a derivative suit is very likely to bar the very individual sought to be protected by the Securities Act. 
    Now, from coming to the courts at all with complaints based upon alleged wrongdoing by corporate officers and directors.

    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Does 23 (b) require verification by the plaintiff?
speaker="richard_f_watt" startTime="794.526" stopTime="824.257">
    Mr. Richard F. Watt 
    It does not in so many words, Your Honor. 
    There is no definitive holding on that point by this Court and as a matter of fact, there is a decision by the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit which we did not cite in our brief which cast serious doubt upon the right of anyone other than the plaintiff himself could verify. 
    That is Consumers Gas Trust Company versus Quimby, it's found at 137 Federal 882.

    Mr. Richard F. Watt 
    No, sir. 
    This is a 1905 case.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="840.607" stopTime="846.090">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    But apart from that 1905 decision, you know of anything else that --
speaker="richard_f_watt" startTime="846.090" stopTime="851.531">
    Mr. Richard F. Watt 
    There has been some District Court cases which have held that in attorney may verify.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="851.531" stopTime="855.929">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    A 1905 decision wouldn't be construing this Rule?
speaker="richard_f_watt" startTime="855.929" stopTime="903.366">
    Mr. Richard F. Watt 
    It was construing the old Equity Rule 94 which was the predecessor of Rule 23 (b). 
    94 became Equity Rule 27 and Rule 23 (b) is modeled very closely after that. 
    We would say in response to that that since the principle purpose of Rule 23 (b) and old Equity Rule 94 was to guarantee to the federal courts that their jurisdiction was not being invoked collusively by an arrangement between the corporation and the stockholder in order to obtain the requisite diversity of citizenship that the plaintiff himself, the stockholder, is the individual most likely to have knowledge of specific facts which would demonstrate the facts non-collusive character at present. 
    He would know best when he acquired the stock.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="903.366" stopTime="913.081">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    We have verification by counsel that might have some meaning even in the context of this Rule, don't you agree with that?
speaker="richard_f_watt" startTime="913.081" stopTime="932.781">
    Mr. Richard F. Watt 
    Yes, it might, Your Honor, but under those circumstances, that if in any case counsel might verify then Rule 23 (b) and the derivative case would add absolutely nothing to Rule 11. 
    Because under Rule 11, counsel is required to certify to the best of his knowledge information and belief, the case is soundly grounded.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="932.781" stopTime="981.710">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Well, it's a little more to 23 (b) than that as I read it. 
    The other thing if you have the time, I wish you would help -- help me, if you will too, by pointing out in what respects the affidavit of Mrs. Surowitz is in conflict with her deposition. 
    I don't want to interrupt your argument but I would like to know that and I take it from what you do, I correctly understand in what you said earlier that her deposition is not in conflict with the -- the specific affirmations and after being made under 23 (b) subparagraphs 1 and 2?
speaker="richard_f_watt" startTime="981.710" stopTime="1037.251">
    Mr. Richard F. Watt 
    Only in one respect and that is when she was asked whether what fact she had supporting the allegation that this was not a collusive suit. 
    She indicated that she did not understand the question. 
    However, she did testify that she did not know any of the defendants, had not had any conversations with any of the defendants, and no conversations with any of the defendants had been reported to her which would the facts justifying the collusion -- a conclusion of lack of collusion but she stated she did not understand the question. 
    That is not so novel, as a matter of fact, because there's one of the early Rule 94 cases in which the largest single stockholder, The People's Gas Light and Coke Company in Chicago, when asked on deposition whether the suit was collusive, initially, said that he understood but it was not and then stated that he did not understand the question.

speaker="richard_f_watt" startTime="1141.836" stopTime="1160.791">
    Mr. Richard F. Watt 
    No, it does not, Your Honor. 
    Rule 23 (b) is a derivative or secondary cause of action by a stockholder where the corporation itself has not asserted the cause of action. 
    And that must be verified according to Rule 23 (b) and that prove back to --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="1160.791" stopTime="1166.142">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    I look at the Rule (Inaudible) statute?
speaker="richard_f_watt" startTime="1166.142" stopTime="1300.953">
    Mr. Richard F. Watt 
    We held our Rule 23 (b) Your Honor set out at the end of our brief at page 58 and it is described as an action brought to enforce a secondary right on the part of one or more shareholders in an association and so on because the association refuses to enforce the rights which may properly be asserted by it. 
    We have argued in our brief that the principal purpose of Rule 23 (b) was to prevent collusive resort to the federal court. 
    And if one reads Hawes versus Oakland which was decided in 1882, it is quite clear that the Court felt that many corporations not desiring for one reason or another to go into the state courts and not wishing to have their causes of action tried as ordinary actions at law would seek out a friendly stockholder, have that stockholder who have the requisite diversity of citizenship, initiate a proceeding in the federal court which by that circumstance would be a suit in equity. 
    The doctrine goes back to an 1856 decision of this Court, Dodge versus Woolsey and in Dodge versus Woolsey, the concept of the derivative suit by a stockholder asserting a cause of action which the corporation would not assert was established. 
    But when one reads Dodge versus Woolsey, it is clear that the argument was made there that collusion existed and the Court decided that there was not evidence of collusion. 
    But the dissenting justices stated quite clearly in Dodge versus Woolsey that this practice would open up the federal courts two collusively sought jurisdiction. 
    And that apparently is what happened because when the Court reviewed the matter in Hawes versus Oakland, it said that the Dodge versus Woolsey doctrine had been abused in this fashion and it therefore sought to close the door. 
    The corporations are ranging through friendly stockholders to obtain federal jurisdiction in this fashion. 
    We say that it is -- that is its principal purpose.

    Justice John M. Harlan 
    I think --
speaker="richard_f_watt" startTime="1301.037" stopTime="1301.617">
    Mr. Richard F. Watt 
    There were --
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="1301.617" stopTime="1303.741">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    -- the language goes beyond that, isn't it?
speaker="richard_f_watt" startTime="1303.741" stopTime="1396.875">
    Mr. Richard F. Watt 
    The language goes beyond that Mr. Justice Harlan in the sense that I think there are certain basic elements of equity which are also in the Rule. 
    The concept that someone should not bring a suit of this kind if he did not have stock at the time of the transactions complained of, that has a thrust against the collusive suit problem but it probably goes beyond that. 
    We would conceive that certainly. 
    There are decisions since then in which it is asserted that one of the purpose of the Rule was to bar strike suits, to bar speculation and litigation, to bar purchase claimants from being brought into the courts. 
    But even if one assumes that there are these additional reasons beyond the principle one which I have asserted, I cannot see how those reasons justify the interpretation of Rule 23 (b) as it is been made by the Court of Appeals below. 
    It's obvious that if someone is a professional strike suiter or if an attorney is a specialist in what might be described the bringing of strike suit. 
    All he needs to do is to find the stockholder who can recite well what the stockholder is told. 
    Now, the fact that a stockholder can be posed well and articulate what the attorney has told him is certainly no guarantee that that individual is not a strike suiter.

    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Well, let's -- let's assume now that the this is -- that the plaintiff here had verified this compliant and without qualification and let -- let assume that from deposition, it appears that the plaintiff had no knowledge whatsoever of the facts to its plaintiffs for. 
    Now, and -- now, what is the remedy for that or is it your position that that should be overlooked completely?

    Is there any remedy other than striking the complaint?
speaker="richard_f_watt" startTime="1446.388" stopTime="1584.085">
    Mr. Richard F. Watt 
    I think the clearest example of the kind of situation that you have reference to Mr. Justice Fortas is in Freeman versus Kirby which is one of the cases that we cited on our brief. 
    And there were two cases that arose out of the same general Alleghany Corporation litigation in the Southern District of New York, Murchison versus Kirby which we believe sustains the position that we assert here, and it's the other case Freeman versus Kirby in which it was clear that the stockholder had no contact whatsoever with the lawyer at all. 
    All that the lawyer had sought out a stockholder and in which the lawyer himself had virtually no information except a memorandum on which to base the facts which he set forth in the pleading and under those circumstances, it would held that the attorney had violated the Rule 11. 
    Now, the Murchison case which we contend is extremely close to the situation here.Mr. Murchison, the plaintiff on deposition was asked questions endeavoring to ascertain what facts he had supporting certain allegation, questions which from the decision appeared within quite similar to questions posed to Mrs. Surowitz here. 
    Obviously, a man with many investment experiences so he was able to answer it but what is significant is that he stated that this information was general that he relied upon his attorneys that he asked his attorneys whether they thought they could make a case out of this and they assured him that they could. 
    It was asserted there that the violation of Rule 11 was due to the fact that the attorneys had knowingly procured a false verification by their client, Mr. Murchison. 
    As a matter of fact, when this motion was first presented in the District Court when it was asserted that this was a sham pleading that Mrs. Surowitz's was pleading with the sham pleading, it certainly appeared to us now that this was a Rule 11 charge because there is no other place than the Federal Rules where the term sham pleading appears except in Rule 11. 
    It is now been turned about by the District Court and the Court of Appeals always though the thrust of the motion was it -- it was the motion to dismiss for a false verification.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="1584.085" stopTime="1600.997">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    What about that? 
    It is a motion that dismissed the false verification that what -- assuming that the deposition demonstrates that the verification was false. 
    What is the remedy for that other than dismissal?
speaker="richard_f_watt" startTime="1600.997" stopTime="1663.231">
    Mr. Richard F. Watt 
    If a party in litigation has in that fashion abused the processes of the Court, that party should be punished but I do not think that here, the remedy is dismissal of the case where it is used for purposes of punishment and we would go back to the line of cases that beginning with Hobby versus Elliot and down to the more recent cases in this Court which indicate that there is a real due process problem. 
    If dismissal under Rule 41 (b) is used as it needs in punishing a litigant. 
    There must be a basis for assuming that the misconduct by the litigant justifies the presumption that the merits are against the litigant and that instance accordingly dismissed under Rule 41 (b). 
    But if it is a means of punishment for wrongdoing, then it is depriving the litigant of substantive rights and this Court has indicated that the -- that ordinarily, that will not be permitted.

    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Is there anything in the record to indicate like counsel for Mrs. Surowitz did not -- after the ruling he had file another complaint, was a statute verified by counsel. 
    Was there a statute of limitation is problem or something of that sort?
speaker="richard_f_watt" startTime="1681.648" stopTime="1818.124">
    Mr. Richard F. Watt 
    No, there was not, Your Honor. 
    Now the problem quite succinctly was this. 
    We obviously could not seek out another plaintiff. 
    Mr. Brilliant owned shares only in a fiduciary capacity. 
    His wife who own shares was a chronically ill woman. 
    It was our position that an important issue was raised. 
    We were not completely certain that any difect -- defect might be cured by somebody else's verifying to the reason that I have stated. 
    And furthermore, the District Court was inclined to dismiss by charging the counsel had violated the Rule -- a local rule, Rule 39. 
    But we were therefore in a position in which an appeal from our standpoint was essential. 
    We felt that this issue mainly the use of Rule 23 (b) in the fashion that was used here was one that should be brought up and determined. 
    And that was the reason that we acted as we get through. 
    Now, finally if I might very briefly call the Court's attention to one argument made which I would like to comment on. 
    Namely, that Mr. Rockler's affidavit cannot be possibly suffice us a verification, because of the reservation at the end of it which appears at the record 143. 
    I think it is quite clear that that reservation is an order to safeguard the attorney client privilege and the work product of the attorney but Mr. Rockler clearly states, under oath, in that affidavit that in his view the case is soundly grounded and that the proof will establish the essential veracity of the facts alleged. 
    If there is a defect in the verification, It would be our position that the Court is entitled to search the record to see if the defect is made up anywhere in the same as the Court may search the record to see at a possible defect and allegation of citizenship is made elsewhere -- made up elsewhere in the record. 
    So that whether Mr. Rockler's ver -- affidavit was labeled a verification or not, it serves the essential purpose of assuring to the Court that there is a basis for the allegation.

    Mr. Richard F. Watt 
    We are in dilemma. 
    If it cannot be satisfied by the verification of counsel, obviously, then the suggestions that have been made elsewhere during the course of this case would not have enabled us to remedy the defect. 
    If it can be made up or if it can be verified by someone else then we believe that the affidavit of Mr. Rockler served the purpose. 
    I would like to call the Court's attention to one comment that has appeared on the decision in the Court of Appeals. 
    It should appear after our brief was filed in Volume 40 of the New York University Law Review at page 978.

   Argument of Samuel W. Block

    Mr. Samuel W. Block 
    Mr. Justice Black, may it please the Court. 
    The action of the Court of Appeals in affirming the order of dismissal entered by the district judge, does not affect the vitality of the cause of action which the plaintiff here sought to enforce. 
    For that cause of action belongs to the corporation. 
    Any corporate cause of action still exists and in fact is the subject of a suit which is presently pending in the State of Delaware which is referred to at footnote at page 61of our brief, the blue brief which was filed on behalf of the individual respondents. 
    As a matter of fact, the action of the Court of Appeals does not affect even the right of the plaintiff here, Mrs. Surowitz, to participate in any judgment which might be recovered in said other action as a shareholder. 
    The only result of the order which is here appealable is the action of the verifier of this derivative complaint who filed the false affidavit in purported compliance with Rule 23 (b), perpetrated a fraud on the Court and failed to comply with the Rules of -- Federal Rules of Civil Procedure governing derivative action and then refused to take advantage of the invitations to cure those defects and comply with the rules.

    Mr. Samuel W. Block 
    Your Honor, starting with the 15 days which were provided by the original order of the Court to file any documents which were considered necessary. 
    Then there are references in our brief to the specific suggestions of the court below of the District Court at -- to the plaintiffs, then plaintiffs, now, petitioner's counsel to file a proper affidavit and a verification sought by someone who knew the facts which were being verified or obtain another plaintiff because by that time it was clear that Mr. Brilliant who had filed this affidavit without in any way verifying by oath the truth of the allegation, but that Mr. Brilliant was a shareholder in his own right or as a trustee or represented family members of his family who were stockholders. 
    Now, the specific statements of the Court are set forth at pages 19 and 20 of the blue brief of -- the brief of the individual respondents. 
    It was further pointed out at the time of the argument on the findings and conclusions that the petitioner -- that the plaintiff had not asked for leave to file a substitute verification for an amended complaint. 
    That was the finding and there was a conclusion that the verification of this complaint is false and sham and the compliant must be strict since the plaintiff has not sought leave to substitute any other verification or filed an amended complaint, the action will be dismissed and the counsel for the plaintiff did not accept in any way to that finding or to that conclusion.

    This is from the Court of Appeals' opinion. 
    But if the verification provision of the Rule is to have any real meaning, it requires that a plaintiff must have knowledge of his own position and relationship to the suit, of the official identity of the parties against whom suit is brought. 
    And in this is what I want to ask you about, And that the plaintiff must have a general knowledge of the wrongful acts which he alleges as a foundation for his complaint. 
    Now, is that the summon substance of the position that you would take in response to Justice White's questions.

    Justice Abe Fortas 
    I get your point. 
    But in the case then where the plaintiff for good reason or bad reason the error or misadventure verifies that, you're saying that there would be an inquiry under plaintiff's knowledge of the substance of the complaint even if it's an accounting case or what not and that unless the plaintiff can show a general knowledge of the wrongful acts, if the plaintiff has made verification on information and belief, the complaint is to restrict her. 
    That's the position.

    Mr. Samuel W. Block 
    That's right. 
    And Your Honor, there is -- the very good reason for that. 
    The derivative action in which these verifications are required has been referred to as having peculiarities by this Court. 
    It is a -- it's a different breed really of lawsuits because it requires the individual to take over as it were the control from the Court -- from the elected corporate managers. 
    Now, there must be, we respectfully suggests, some assurance that that kind of taking over of corporate control is based upon the allegations of wrongdoing which someone, some person, responsible is willing to verify under oath. 
    And that is why the answer to the question about whether if it's a verification must there be that general knowledge. 
    You -- the person who is saying, I'm going to take over this cause of action, must be willing to say, I feel these are responsible allegation.

    If this -- if this verification as she made it, modified only by it being all on information and beliefs been cited by Mr. Brilliant or Mr. Rockler without any other qualification, you would say that satisfied 23 (b)?

    Mr. Samuel W. Block 
    Yes. 
    Because I think that that you would have a responsible person who would make the affidavit and it would not be the basic fraud on the Court. 
    There would not be the concern for what here appears, I respectfully suggest, to be a kind of trafficking in litigation which is deprived by the earliest of the cases.

    I have no personal knowledge or any of these facts. 
    I do not understand that anything about the basis of my cause of action except that everything I have said here has been given me by my lawyer and in my own confidence with my understanding with the investigation.

    There is no restriction as has been suggested by counsel for the petition on the use of a procedural rule to impose on an uneducated plaintiff a very substantial obstacle to bringing a derivative suit. 
    This could have been verified by anyone with knowledge of the facts that were -- that were alleged on knowledge to be in the knowledge of affiant or on information and belief as to those others.
