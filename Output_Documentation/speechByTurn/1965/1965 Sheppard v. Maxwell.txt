    Samuel H. Sheppard, Petitioner versus E. L. Maxwell, Warden. 
    Mr. Bailey.
speaker="f_lee_bailey" startTime="24.263" stopTime="250.700">
    Mr. F. Lee Bailey 
    For the petitioner Your Honor, Dr. Samuel H. Sheppard. 
    This case comes to this Court on writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit which on May 5th last reversed, two to one, a judgment of the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, voiding the Ohio conviction of Dr. Samuel H. Sheppard which was recorded in 1954. 
    The district judge in his opinion noted five independent federal constitutional violations, each of which in his judgment, warranted granting the writ of habeas corpus and he determined that the five of them constituted this case as it was tried and carried through the state courts a mockery of justice. 
    On July 3rd, 1954, Dr. Samuel H. Sheppard was an osteopathic neurosurgeon living in the hamlet of Bay Village, Ohio a few miles west of Cleveland. 
    He was 30 years old as was his young wife Marilyn. 
    They have one child, age seven. 
    They lived on the shore of Lake Erie. 
    He was a busy and successful doctor as were his two older brothers, both surgeons and his father, also a physician. 
    The four of them run a clinic and they were active in the Bay View Hospital located in Bay Village. 
    The Sheppards entertained that night some friends named Ahern. 
    At some time during the evening while on television, a movie was being observed called, Strange Holiday, Dr. Sheppard fell asleep on the couch. 
    The Aherns left some time around midnight and bade Marilyn Sheppard goodnight at the door and she was never seen alive again. 
    Some time around six o’clock in the morning, a man leaving two doors distant from Dr. Sheppard, J. Spencer Houk the Mayor of Bay Village received a telephone call. 
    He recognized the voice of the petitioner, who said words in substance, “Spen, come quick. 
    I think they have killed Marilyn.” 
    Mayor Houk got up and get dressed, got his wife up and got her dressed, and they got in the family automobile and drove about 75 yards to the Sheppard home. 
    When they entered the home, they found Dr. Sheppard lying on the floor downstairs. 
    Mrs. Houk went upstairs and found Marilyn Sheppard lying in a pool of blood. 
    Authorities arrived, the Bay Village Police, the Cleveland Police, the County Sheriffs office, the County Prosecutors office and the County Coroner’s office. 
    An investigation was immediately commenced. 
    No witness, save of Dr. Sheppard has ever reported any facts from his own knowledge as having occurred between midnight and six o’clock on the fourth day of July 1954. 
    And what Dr. Sheppard had to say was this and still is, “That at some time during the night and he does not know the time, he awoke from a deep sleep by what he imagined to be screaming and thought his wife who was then pregnant was having convulsions, that he rushed up the stairs to the bedroom which was on the second floor. 
    And that the bedroom was dimly lit, and as he reached the top of the stairs or as he entered the bedroom, the point about which he was uncertain, he noticed a white shape or form, apparently a human form standing near the head of the bed. 
    As he entered the room and attempted to attack or grapple the form, he was struck from behind and rendered unconscious. 
    At some later point, he awoke on the floor of the bedroom and heard noises on the first floor. 
    He got up and run down the stairs.”

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Is there any question about whether this form was a human being or not?
speaker="f_lee_bailey" startTime="256.110" stopTime="269.661">
    Mr. F. Lee Bailey 
    I think the inference is that it was a human being. 
    Dr. Sheppard said, he could not be sure except that it had a white top as it stood next to the bed. 
    I think it is a human being, the question being whether it was male or female, the question remaining in the evidence.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Is there an inference that there was more than one person if he was grappling with the -- this form as you call it and was struck from behind? 
    Is that -- there an inference if there were two people there?
speaker="f_lee_bailey" startTime="279.158" stopTime="309.440">
    Mr. F. Lee Bailey 
    Very strong inference that there was more than one person Your Honors. 
    We see the state of the evidence in the record, it would have been impossible for the person. 
    Dr. Sheppard was about to attack to struck a rabbit punch in the back of his neck 
    .We believe there were two, one of whom was a woman. 
    As Dr. Sheppard charged down the stairs, he observed the man fleeing out the screen door toward the lake and he chased him. 
    He chased him down to certain wooden steps to the shore of the lake and their grappled with him and became in some manner held around the neck and was again rendered unconscious.

    That was a man was it?
speaker="f_lee_bailey" startTime="311.888" stopTime="359.960">
    Mr. F. Lee Bailey 
    There is no question this time, but -- that this was a man at one time described as having had bushy hair, a bushy-headed man. 
    When Dr. Sheppard awoke for the third time, the Sun was breaking over Lake Erie and he says that he got up, he was half in and half out of the water and indeed later on the sand was found in his pants and trouser caps and his trousers were wet, his t-shirt was missing. 
    He ran up to the bedroom where his wife lay covered with blood, checked her pulse and found that she was gone, put his knee against the side of the bed as he did so and later it was discovered that the only blood showing on Dr. Sheppard was a spot on the knee diluted with water and then he went down the stairs and called Mayor Houk and then fell to the floor.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="359.960" stopTime="363.075">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Did they ever find the t-shirt?
speaker="f_lee_bailey" startTime="363.075" stopTime="436.864">
    Mr. F. Lee Bailey 
    A t-shirt was found. 
    It was never determined whether or not it was Dr. Sheppard’s. 
    It's in my recollection that it had no traces of blood whatsoever. 
    I don't believe that it was an important piece of evidence in the case. 
    Dr. Sheppard's older brothers Richard and Steve upon receiving notification of the tragedy, rushed to Sam's house. 
    Dr. Steven Sheppard made an examination of Sam Sheppard and determined that he was in shock that he had spasm in the neck and he ordered him removed to the Bay View Hospital and this was done. 
    He was taken there by Dr. Steven and by an orderly who had responded to the call. 
    At Bay View Hospital, he was X-rayed and was found to have a bone chip in the second cervical vertebrae. 
    His teeth were loosened and he had severe bruises about the face. 
    He was questioned almost immediately by county authorities, who over the next two or three weeks questioned him intensively and extensively. 
    Before the day was out, an accusation had been tossed to Dr. Sheppard that he was the number one suspect principally because no other suspects had turned out. 
    He was asked to take a lie detector test. 
    Dr. Sheppard asked --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="436.864" stopTime="441.079">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Who would toss this accusation and who asked him to take the lie detector?
speaker="f_lee_bailey" startTime="441.079" stopTime="607.735">
    Mr. F. Lee Bailey 
    Deputy Sheriff Carl Rossbach I believe was among the first who told him that he was a suspect and said, “Will you take a lie detector test?” 
    And Dr. Sheppard asked how it worked and was informed that it worked as a result of certain physiological phenomenon measured by a machine called the polygraph and he replied at that time, “I don't feel that my physical condition is sufficient to make the test accurate” and he declined. 
    Later on in the day because of the attitude of the police, the family lawyer [Inaudible] so he hired a well-known criminal lawyer, William J. Corrigan to give advice to the Sheppards because it was apparent that the trial was up. 
    The police demanded to interrogate Sheppard and they did interrogate him at sometimes under certain conditions set by Attorney Corrigan. 
    The newspapers of course reported this incident with every column inch they had available. 
    And for many days, speculation ran right from the community as to what sort of bushy-headed bloody monster was running about and ready to strike again. 
    But after a time, other news occurring here and there on the face of the earth began to force the Sheppard case out of page 1 column 1 and this disturbed according to a certain documented product which is reproduced in our petition for certiorari, the editor of a Cleveland newspaper with a circulation of 300,000. 
    And he felt -- he said that because Dr. Sam Sheppard was the police surgeon in Bay Village and because the family was well to do and well-known in Bay Village that the fix was in or something tantamount to influence covering up a murderer. 
    And so he says fearful that the case would drop out of the public mind and noticing that the other newspapers were beginning to turn their attentions elsewhere, he unleashed his editorial artillery. 
    His paper, the Cleveland Press kept the case on page 1. 
    Thereafter an article was published or I should say an editorial saying that someone was getting away with murder. 
    This editorial appeared on the front page directly below as statement, Sheppard sat for a new quiz. 
    The plain import of the editorial was that Dr. Sam Sheppard was getting away with murder, but nobody moved to arrest him perhaps for lack of evidence. 
    Then the Cleveland Press demanded that the Cleveland police take over the investigation because they are by far the more competent and after all Dr. Sheppard would not have the his influence with the Cleveland police and with an hour of two of this editorial demand, the Cleveland police were called in by the fathers of Bay Village and then the press demanded that the Coroner called an inquest.

    I believe they were called in by the town of Bay Village to take over the investigation on the ground that Bay Village didn't feel itself competent to handle the immense problems of technology and of the difficulties involved Your Honor.

    Mr. F. Lee Bailey 
    I should like to point out at this juncture that the police immediately claimed that their inability to interrogate Dr. Sheppard was the Bugaboo in the case and that he would not come down to police headquarters. 
    He had of course been interrogated many times sometimes with his counsel at present but it was suggested that an appropriate grilling and that word was used in an editorial, a third degree to which he should have been instantly subjected in the view of the Cleveland Press, might produce the desired result. 
    He did not go to police headquarters although the prosecutor, John J. Mahon issued a public statement saying if he does not come voluntarily to police headquarters we will convene an inquest and compel him to testify. 
    Cleveland Press then ran an editorial entitled, “Why no inquest?” 
    Isn't this murder worth an inquest? 
    And substituted for the same text in a later edition of the same paper, the mandate rather than the rhetorical question, “Why no inquest, do it now, Dr. Gerber.” 
    Dr. Samuel Gerber, a doctor, a lawyer and elective Coroner of Cuyahoga County for many years. 
    Within a few I should say minutes or perhaps an hour of the appearance of this edition on the streets called an inquest. 
    He did not hold the inquest in the county morgue as was his custom but in the gymnasium in Bay Village.

    Mr. F. Lee Bailey 
    If it had occurred an isolation Your Honor, I would think it would afford no ground or relief or complaint. 
    In the total context of the manipulation of public officials by the Cleveland Press, I think that an important piece of evidence. 
    I think the editorial calling for the inquest to have been unfair and the purpose for which it was called was unconstitutional, that was to force Dr. Sheppard to testify.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Did I understand you to say Mr. Bailey that you -- it's your position that the inquest was unconstitutional because it was for the purpose of compelling Dr. Sheppard to testify against himself?
speaker="f_lee_bailey" startTime="1108.187" stopTime="1135.771">
    Mr. F. Lee Bailey 
    The extent that it appears to have been for that purpose, I think it -- to have been an improper proceeding especially in view of the fact the defense counsel was ejected from it forcibly. 
    However, I offer it as part of the total context of this case contributing to the envenomed atmosphere which occurred in Cleveland on October 18th, 1954 when the trial began because this Court has in Estes versus Texas, indicated that pretrial hearings and the like maybe relevant to an assessment of the total atmosphere of trial.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1135.771" stopTime="1145.761">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Was the counsel ejected from the inquest room because he was a lawyer and they're representing a defendant or because of conduct that was complained of by the Coroner.
speaker="f_lee_bailey" startTime="1145.761" stopTime="1195.665">
    Mr. F. Lee Bailey 
    It was conduct Your Honor, certainly, he was objecting to the methods of the Coroner. 
    I should point out that we contend and I think the record shows that this inquest was more of a circus than an inquest and that apparently it was intended to satisfy the people. 
    At least this is what Mr. Gerber testified to in the Court of Common Pleas when challenged in the point and ask why he didn't hold it in the morgue as was his usual custom. 
    In any event from the inquest, flowed a threat by the Coroner I could hold Dr. Sam Sheppard, hold him for the grand jury, however, he did not do so. 
    Finally, the Cleveland Press printed an editorial which I submit to this Court as the most outrageous.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren

    The inquest is frankly very puzzling to me.

    And for the third time, Cuyahoga County responded to the Cleveland Press and Sam Sheppard was arrested. 
    There is in the record absolutely no indication that within the past 24, 48 or 72 hours any new evidence constituting probable cause which had theretofore been lacking, had been deduced or arrived at by the Cleveland authorities.

    Mr. F. Lee Bailey 
    I don't think so. 
    None of great significance, the others were before you then. 
    Now the editor of the Cleveland Press said that the whole question confronting the press as a newspaper, concerned about the whole structure of law enforcement the community was “Shall we permit a protective wall to shield a solution to this murder by saying and doing nothing?” 
    Or “Shall we move in with all of our editorial artillery in an effort to bring the wall down?” 
    There were risks both ways. 
    One risk -- one represented the risk to the community, the other was a risk to the press. 
    We chose the risk to ourselves. 
    As editor of the press, I would do the same thing over again under the same circumstances.

speaker="f_lee_bailey" startTime="1377.721" stopTime="1470.326">
    Mr. F. Lee Bailey 
    It's not a part of the record. 
    Initially, it was filed in the District Court in the habeas proceedings as part of the publicity and explanation report. 
    As I began to point out Your Honor, not considered in the deliberations with Mr. Seltzer was the risk to Sam Sheppard that the editorial should be unleashed upon an innocent man. 
    Now, there is a fashionable hue and cry these days to throttle the newspapers, silence them until all these court proceedings are at an end in criminal cases and might have been said about the dilemma. 
    I think that there's ample reason in the records of this case and in the exhibits before this Court to be concerned about newspapers that used their editorial pages to prod elective officials into action when they are hesitant because of the lack of what to his lawyers are supposed to move on and that is evidence of probable cause, but I do not think that the failure in this case is one of the press. 
    I do not think that this is an occasion to suggest new ideas for shackling the press or exercising or broadening the contempt procedure. 
    The failures and repeated failures of the entire system so far as control of the lawyers and the judge and the police are blatant and repeated and I think that these primarily caused Dr. Sheppard any chance for fair trial. 
    Repeatedly in the exhibits which are before you, police are announcing that Dr. Sheppard is guilty. 
    If they had a chance to interrogate him without counsel, they would have extracted his confession.

    Mr. F. Lee Bailey 
    No Your Honor, what I mean is this. 
    That, although a trial by a newspaper presents a serious problem, we have sufficient remedies within the law which were not exhausted in this case, to dispose of this case on a failure of those remedies without coming to the question at least in this case of what must be done to silence the press. 
    And if all of those remedies had been exhausted, the continuance of the change of venue when the prosecutor who could learn to keep his mouth shut about what he was going to present, and still there was a conviction then perhaps and only then in my judgment might it be time to think about restraints on the press.

    I suggest to this Court as one of the remedies which ought to evolve from this case that lower courts should be urged that they upheld to sequester juries. 
    They cannot be protected from news media by instructions asking for self-serving answers that the witnesses heard the most damnable and outrageous material about the defendant but will not be influenced. 
    The compact mentalization of the human mind is not yet sufficient to exclude information such as was broadcast by Mr. Winchell and Mr. Considine in this case damning the defendant even during his trial and yet disregarded in making that kind of total assessment of a man which a jury verdict is.

    Mr. F. Lee Bailey 
    I think the damage was this Your Honor and that is why in my brief I have suggested that this does not fall squarely within the cases you have earlier decided in the same general area. 
    There was no confession in this case. 
    There was no criminal record announced. 
    There was no preliminary hearing at which evidence was taken and then broadcast. 
    There was -- began initially by Mr. Seltzer and picked up by the other newspapers and new media the notion that Dr. Sheppard was hiding the evidence. 
    It is implicit in all of the publicity and especially in those editorials that were published during this period and I believe that it conditioned the community to find him guilty unless he could prove his own innocence. 
    For that reason, I think that the publicity was so prejudicial as to have required a continuance of change of venue at that point. 
    Either remedy might have been of tremendous help but I think that no man can be expected to go to trial even with the continuance or change of venue if a newspaper will be permitted to do what the Cleveland Press did the day that the Sheppard trial began, that is the day the jury was impaneled and that is to print a front page editorial saying, “Who will speak for Marilyn?”

   Argument of Bernard A. Berkman
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1876.796" stopTime="1878.091">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Berkman.
speaker="bernard_a_berkman" startTime="1878.091" stopTime="1969.488">
    Mr. Bernard A. Berkman 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court. 
    The problem which confronts the Court in this case is one of the most complex and serious and compelling in the administration of criminal justice and in our constitutional law. 
    How do you guarantee an accused the fair trial by an impartial judge and an uncontaminated jury in the context of contemporaneous, detailed, colorful and pervasive crime reporting by the news media. 
    How do you keep the evidence off the news stand and in the courtroom under appropriate due process safeguards without interfering unduly with the public's right to know, the public's right to be informed and the press' right to print. 
    We recently add tragic evidence of the need to solve this urgent problem and to solve it now. 
    The experience in Dallas, the Warren Commission has reported, is a dramatic affirmation of the need for steps to bring about a proper balance between the right of the public to be kept informed and the right of the individual to a fair and impartial trial. 
    In the line of cases beginning with Bridges against California 25 years ago and continuing up at least through Wood against Georgia in 1962, this Court has rejected the English solution which subordinates of press to the courts. 
    As Mr. Justice Douglas has put it in a Law Review article, “we have concluded that a free press has the same dignity as an independent judiciary. 
    We have made our choice refusing to sacrifice freedom of the press to whims of judges, for we know that judges as well editors can be tyrants.”
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="1969.488" stopTime="1995.711">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Well let's see then, I want to get this. 
    I understood Mr. Bailey to say that they're not -- you're not pressing the issue of unfairness merely because of publicity but rather unfairness because there was this excessive publicity and no steps were taken by the trial judge or by the prosecutor to arrest its possible impact on jury, is that right?
speaker="bernard_a_berkman" startTime="1995.711" stopTime="2005.698">
    Mr. Bernard A. Berkman 
    I think that is correct that the impact caused by the material which appeared in the press before and during the trial must have -- should have been controlled in order to guarantee a fair trial.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="2005.698" stopTime="2008.675">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Well is that -- is that the argument?
speaker="bernard_a_berkman" startTime="2008.675" stopTime="2053.029">
    Mr. Bernard A. Berkman 
    What I merely mean to suggest Mr. Justice Brennan that there is nothing about what we propose which would in anyway inhibit the freedom of the press and I wish to make that point in advance because of the hue and cry which has come up to shackle the press which is not our argument. 
    We ask the Court today to hold that the publicity which precedes and surrounds notorious criminal trial maybe of such a character on its face as to be inherently prejudicial to the accused whether or not the transcript of voir dire discloses that the jurors admitted that they have preconceptions of guilt or promised to be impartial whether or not reports of confessions of the accused were actually published and whether the source of the damaging publicity was newspaper, radio, television --

    Mr. Bernard A. Berkman 
    I think the transcript does not indicate that the individual themselves so said. 
    There are a couple of instances of rather peculiar performance by the jurors which are indicated. 
    One of them a recital by one of the jurors that despite the fact that the Cleveland newspapers were delivered to her door that she had never read any of them. 
    And another, an indication by somebody who -- as soon as his name appeared in the panel, decided that he would read every particular item to make certain that he would be able to be qualified to be the juror.

    There could have been control, some intense questioning imposed. 
    I think that at the time of a nationwide broadcast by Robert Considine comparing the defendant to Alger Hiss with respect to his credibility, there could have been some direct and intensive questioning of the jury and perhaps a grant of mistrial even at that point.

    I wonder why the counsel hasn't, if this was so important as it wants to appear at the time of the trial, why wouldn't the experienced counsel ask to sequester the jury?
speaker="bernard_a_berkman" startTime="2296.639" stopTime="2329.058">
    Mr. Bernard A. Berkman 
    I think that Mr. Bailey has indicated that up until this time it had not been the custom to sequester juries. 
    It may very well had been that because of the fact that the trial was going to be a lengthy one, defense counsel determined as a matter of tactic at the time although I suggest to you that I'm only guessing that it might have been better not to keep the jury away from their families in order to attempt to have them be more minimal to listening to the evidence. 
    I don't know the answer to that question. 
    I only speculate.
speaker="tom_c_clark" startTime="2329.058" stopTime="2335.375">
    Justice Tom C. Clark 
    Well is that a real problem in the criminal case of lengthy time, the jurors might be compelled to stand out.
speaker="bernard_a_berkman" startTime="2335.375" stopTime="2337.874">
    Mr. Bernard A. Berkman 
    I think it is an extensive problem.

    Justice Tom C. Clark 
    It's a problem for the defendant if the -- at the state as to what the adverse effect it might have on the jury to hold it.
speaker="bernard_a_berkman" startTime="2344.204" stopTime="2414.302">
    Mr. Bernard A. Berkman 
    That in itself it might be prejudicial Your Honor. 
    We are asking the Court to describe in detail for those who are concerned with fair administration of criminal justice and future cases, the nature of the publicity to describe it with particularity, the kind of publicity which will be held to be inherently prejudicial, insofar as the facts of this case will permit. 
    And we ask further that the Court articulate detailed guidelines of the trial court's affirmative responsibility toward the accused under circumstances where he alone stands between the massive publicity and due process for the accused and one point I would like to make it clear. 
    This is not a matter of letting a presumption substitute for actual proof. 
    Actually, this is a question of which of several presumptions will be indulged by the Court. 
    Will it be the presumption that a jury which asserts impartiality on voir dire is not prejudiced, no matter what kind of damaging publicity can be shown objectively or will it be that presumption that given the kind of accusatory and damaging publicity in this case, our criminal trial was contaminated by due process standards. 
    I think that a selection of one presumption or another is an absolute essential in this kind of situation.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2414.302" stopTime="2435.262">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well Mr. Berkman, aren't you going to detail to us, pardon me, what the Court should have done in this case to keep and -- what it didn't do to keep this publicity from the jury. 
    I think that's quite -- I would think that would be quite essential here.
speaker="bernard_a_berkman" startTime="2435.262" stopTime="2436.086">
    Mr. Bernard A. Berkman 
    Yes --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2436.086" stopTime="2445.009">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    If the jury never heard of this, if they never read any of those items that didn't come to their attention, you wouldn't be here, would you?
speaker="bernard_a_berkman" startTime="2445.009" stopTime="2446.129">
    Mr. Bernard A. Berkman 
    That's quite true.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2446.129" stopTime="2456.661">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Now -- now what -- what should the judge have done which he didn't do that makes this an unfair trial.
speaker="bernard_a_berkman" startTime="2456.661" stopTime="2472.253">
    Mr. Bernard A. Berkman 
    At the outset, a motion was filed by the defense counsel for either a continuance until the publicity would have an opportunity to die down or for a change of venue to a remote county in Ohio where perhaps the pressures engendered by the newspaper publicity in a prosecution feeding --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2472.253" stopTime="2475.013">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    What county in Ohio would have been remote on that?
speaker="bernard_a_berkman" startTime="2475.013" stopTime="2510.191">
    Mr. Bernard A. Berkman 
    Well I admit that in the circumstances of this case, this would have been a problem, but it seem to us that since the defendant who is actually taking the risk and was on trial and made the request for a continuance, the thing that confronted the judge was whether or not the individual could get a fair trial in this particular county. 
    And as far as speculating as to what county he could have gotten a fair trial and this was the charge to the defendant at least if he waived his right to be tried in the county in which the crime allegedly took place, it would seem to us at least he ought to have the right to make the selection under the conditions that prevailed under these circumstances.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2510.191" stopTime="2512.962">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Do you think that's a constitutional question?
speaker="bernard_a_berkman" startTime="2512.962" stopTime="2516.283">
    Mr. Bernard A. Berkman 
    The question of whether or not -- whether or not a change of (Voice Overlap) environment.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2516.283" stopTime="2520.251">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well, he has the right to say where he'll be tried?
speaker="bernard_a_berkman" startTime="2520.251" stopTime="2553.073">
    Mr. Bernard A. Berkman 
    It would seem to me that in a situation where there's massive publicity throughout the nation as in this case, the way in which a court may attempt to escape its constitutional responsibility to provide a fair trial is to say that there isn't a county in which the case might have been tried. 
    It seems to me that that's a question that need not be asked when a defendant himself has moved to have a change of venue. 
    I think that under appropriate circumstances, the venue might necessarily be changed several times as this Court found it necessary to do in Irvin against Dowd.
speaker="tom_c_clark" startTime="2553.073" stopTime="2556.041">
    Justice Tom C. Clark 
    Do you have any statutes in the records to that?
speaker="bernard_a_berkman" startTime="2556.041" stopTime="2578.840">
    Mr. Bernard A. Berkman 
    I beg your pardon? 
    The present situation is that the matter of -- or a change of venue is a matter solely within the discretion of the court, Your Honor. 
    And we submit that there are some circumstances such as the instant case in which this is not the kind of protection which is sufficient. 
    I think that to leave the matter entirely to the discretion of the Court is not a sufficient answer.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2578.840" stopTime="2600.292">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    I suppose in those circumstances, we'd have to say today where we have so many news media, the television, the radio, newspapers that no trial could be had in a big city if the defendant wanted to go to some place else.
speaker="bernard_a_berkman" startTime="2600.292" stopTime="2656.952">
    Mr. Bernard A. Berkman 
    Not necessarily, Your Honor. 
    I think it depends upon the quality of the newspaper publicity. 
    We don't suggest that every notorious trial is per se a denial of due process just because there happens to be a lot of publicity. 
    That isn't the point. 
    What we've tried to suggest in our amicus brief is that there are certain kinds of publicity which by their very nature are so inherently prejudicial that if they appear in a particular case that under such circumstances a continuance or a change of venue or some other protection by the Court ought to be granted. 
    We suggest for example that where -- as here, the prosecution has induced to cooperative in the trial by newspaper which has occurred here and which is a matter of record that under those circumstances, word can be demonstrated as clearly as we can demonstrate here that the prosecution actually attempted to create the atmosphere which is presently before this Court. 
    Under those circumstances --

    Mr. Bernard A. Berkman

    That we have or --

    Mr. Bernard A. Berkman

    Mr. William B. Saxbe 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court. 
    Some 45 years ago, there was a murder in Massachusetts. 
    There were two men charged on that, Mr. Sacco and Mr. Vanzetti. 
    The evidence indicated that they were guilty and the jury so found them. 
    But from that trial there came and from he defendant's brief in that trial came a story that has persisted through two generations of bleeding hearts that they were persecuted because they were anarchists, because they were Italians, because they were draft dodgers and that the fact they were guilty, never entered the thing. 
    Just last week, a new book came out where they reexamined the evidence and they found it conclusive that they were guilty, Sacco's gun fired the bullet -- fired the bullet and yet so eminent the jurist as Justice Frankfurter once wrote a book on this and used the defendant's brief for most of the facts.

    He said, “Your name is Dorothy Kilgallen?”

    Whom are you employed and so on? 
    And other asked to who she is and what she is. 
    “Would you tell us when you started to cover the case?” 
    She said, “I went out on early Sunday and what's -- after what's my line right in Cleveland. 
    I did a broadcast in my husband's station, station Cleveland and New York and then I went to the courtroom.” 
    “Was impaneling a jury going on?” 
    “I was certainly there during the impaneling of the jury, it was Monday. 
    The trial judge Edward J. Blythin.” 
    “Did you have or have a case and have a conversation with Judge Blythin?” 
    “Even before the impaneling of jury I had a conversation with Blythin. 
    They arrived in the court, they're rather reporters and photographers. 
    As soon as I got into courtroom, a deputy or someone conducted with Judge Blythin perhaps the secretary who I got to know, but I don't recall his name,” said Judge Blythin likes to see you in chambers? 
    “So I went in the chambers, that where I met Judge Blythin. 
    “Did you have a conversation?” 
    “Yes.” 
    “What happened during the course?” 
    “He's very [Inaudible] I'm sure can. 
    I'm glad to see. 
    I watch you on television.” 
    “But why come all this way to New York to cover this trial?” 
    All he said it says, “All the ingredients of a good murder. 
    It is a very attractive victim who was pregnant. 
    The accused is an important member of the community and so on and so forth.” 
    And Judge Blythin said, “Mystery. 
    It's an open and shut case.” 
    What do I mean? 
    I was going to take in the back because usually I've talked to judges but don't get me an opinion.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    What said Mr. Attorney General and now I'm reading from the opinion of the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit on -- which appears on S 34 of the petition for writ of certiorari. 
    The Court of Appeals says, first of all says, the district judge held that the petitioner's constitutional rights were violated because the trial judge failed to recuse himself sua sponte from presiding at the Sheppard trial. 
    The basis of this conclusion was some pretrial remarks which Judge Blythin has alleged to have made indicating his belief that Sheppard was guilty. 
    Then it says, the material from which this finding was made came to light after the instant petition for habeas corpus was filed. 
    There was put in evidence a statement of a New York columnist, one Dorothy Kilgallen Kumar wherein she stated that at the beginning of the trial, she was invited into the chambers of Judge Blythin and there told of the judge's belief that petitioner was guilty as hell and so on. 
    So the Court of Appeals at least unequivocally stated that that statement was put in evidence.

    Mr. William B. Saxbe 
    This hearing on habeas corpus was in Dayton at that time and the judge was willing to accept this. 
    We were opposed to it constantly. 
    And in my opinion, it added nothing to the Court except what the District Court wanted to believe and I, from looking at the statement of the District Court, I mean the opinion of the Court, I don't believe he looked at the record. 
    I believe they accepted the defendant's brief and I certainly can't find any place in there for the actual facts of the case as pointed out in the record were brought out. 
    I have here some 37 instances of misstatement of facts in the petition for certiorari in this Court and I mean some of them is going to judge -- he said no matter how, a set of circumstances which has never changed to this day. 
    He in fact gave nine different versions of what happened after he awoke on that couch. 
    He was dis -- shown to the judge or to the jury as an absolute liar, unworthy of belief. 
    And the jury that considered these facts, considered the evidence that was in Court and we have evidence in the record again of the numerous safeguards that the judge took. 
    This voir dire examination is 1600 pages. 
    Now you raised repeatedly the question of venue or continuance. 
    The judge didn't rule on this and that is he didn't deny he continued them and he said, let's see if we can get a fair jury. 
    Let's see if we can get a good jury. 
    They spent 1600 pages and nine days I believe it was in examining these people or the jury. 
    They had a panel of 75. 
    They did not exhaust the panel, periphery charges remained for the defense.

    There was one on each side periphery that was not used. 
    The voir dire examination went into the publicity. 
    It went into the understanding that they had of the case, all of the normal questions and went even further than the normal thing. 
    Now one of the basis of -- we find forward in here is the statement that Judge Edwards, the dissenting judge in the Circuit Court agreed with the Circuit judge or with the district judge in the pretrial publicity and this is not true. 
    Judge Edwards in his dissent found no fault with the pretrial publicity. 
    He based his dissent on the trial publicity which was basically a report of what actually went on in the courtroom.

    Mr. William B. Saxbe 
    In some -- in some instances, they followed the record and I would say in all instances, the Court of Appeals evidently read the record, they followed the record. 
    And the things that Judge Edwards based his dissent on, the Jekyll-Hyde thing, the similar things as that were factual, things that happened, but a great many other things actually did not happen. 
    Now for instance this story just like in the [Inaudible] idea that he was hounded by the law enforcement people that somehow he suffered greatly by the people moving in on it. 
    Ten minutes after he called Mary Houk, he was spirited away by his brother to their private hospital. 
    He was interviewed not continuously as would have you believe here but he was interviewed I think twice in the hospital. 
    He came downtown and made a statement to the police even before the inquest. 
    These facts have become confused to the point and repeated so often that you would believe them to be true, now in my brother Bailey statement this morning, you would gather from him that this was a trial, a civil trial against Cleveland Press. 
    This statement, this book, this chapter of Mr. Seltzer from his book, The Years Were Good was written about the time that this case came to the Supreme Court -- this Court in 1956. 
    At no place was in the agreed statement of facts and there was again an agreed statement of facts which was not followed in the pleadings, but was brought in by the ear so to speak by including it as an appendix to his brief which he filed in the District Court. 
    Now the reason that the attack was taken this morning, that this press was not really so bad, that this presumption of prejudice could then overcome if the Court had behave properly, if they had run a trial properly. 
    I submit that this was a trial by the book. 
    It was a good trial, Judge Blythin on a strict courtroom. 
    He maintained order and he cautioned the jury every time they left the jury box about receiving or carrying on any discussion, conversation, reading about the case. 
    He couldn't have done more and a review of the record is the only thing that is going to bring this out. 
    Now why to impute to this Court a failure simply because your cases which have build up over the years must involve a failure on the part of the state some place. 
    In other words, the action of the newspapers or the TV is not enough. 
    You must impute this to the judge that he allows this to get in that the state is somehow negligent. 
    In the Rideau case, the sheriff appears on TV with the -- with the prisoner. 
    The Irvin case, they permitted this confession to get out. 
    In the Estes case, they tolerated the cameras in the courtroom. 
    In other words, to bring this over, you've got to involve the state in the situation.

    Mr. William B. Saxbe 
    Yes, this is not uncommon to take people's pictures with their permission when there is actually nothing happening in the courtroom. 
    Now there were pictures taken that you'll find in the brief and they allege that these pictures were taken in jurors' home and that this therefore was prejudicial. 
    This is not the case. 
    There was a Mrs. Mansini who was a juror. 
    She never took part in any deliberations of the jury. 
    She sat there with them. 
    The pictures which are purported to be in a juror's home are in the home of Mrs. Mansini who was in fact for the purposes of this case not a juror at all.

    Justice Abe Fortas 
    I don't know whether this is in the record but I notice from the clipping of the Cleveland Press, November 3, 1954, it appears that counsel for Dr. Sheppard did object to these photographs. 
    Do you know whether that's in the record?
speaker="william_b_saxbe" startTime="5085.134" stopTime="5100.598">
    Mr. William B. Saxbe 
    He did object to it. 
    I believe, you will find that he did object, but he objected that they were taking the defendant's photographs and Judge Blythin replied that if the defendant didn't want to be photographed, all he had to say was he didn't want to be and they -- he would not be.

    Mr. William B. Saxbe 
    He objected. 
    The judge said that there will be no photographs before or during and this objection I believe came up on a motion for a new trial. 
    And the actual testimony of the jurors that -- and by the way, there were three jurors put on at this motion for a new trial to determine if the so-called prejudicial statements of the press during the trial had any effect on them or whether they were in fact prejudiced and the results were negative. 
    The --

    Mr. William B. Saxbe 
    Juries are not sequestered in Ohio and it is in a very unusual occasion when it is.

    Mr. William B. Saxbe 
    Usually by agreement of the parties that is by the prosecutor and the defense attorney or the defense attorney would go to the judge and give reasons for it, they would be sequestered. 
    But this --

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    But in Hamilton County, Ohio a different part of the state to be sure, things might have changed there. 
    It is my distinct recollection that in a first degree murder case it was almost automatic to have the jury sequestered. 
    It's not automatic. 
    It was the usual thing to do. 
    I don't remember any first degree murder case in which it was not done.

    Mr. William B. Saxbe 
    This was discussed in the brief. 
    It was discussed in Mr. Bailey's brief. 
    Mr. Bailey took the attitude that -- and there again, we're talking about a deceased man, Mr. Corrigan probably did not object because he felt that the sequestering over a period of time would be more harmful than it would be to helpful. 
    Of course after they go into deliberation after they got the case they are sequestered and they were sequestered during all of their deliberation.

    Well that wasn't I was talking about.

    Mr. William B. Saxbe 
    They were -- they were permitted. 
    I think three of them. 
    They sat with the bailiff sat by the telephone, called the number and sat there and listen to all what was said. 
    Now in a minute or two that I have, I would like to say this and I for one and I know that this is a great issue in this case. 
    I don't feel that we have to throw out the First Amendment to preserve the Sixth. 
    I think that they can continue together and I don't think that that's the only choice that we have. 
    I think the choice that we're faced with in this case is basically one of the court handling of the man. 
    And this, Mr. Bailey and I agree the fact that I don't find any capability or any inclination on the part of the judiciary or the legislative to infringe upon the First Amendment and you have good press and you have a bad press. 
    Now are we going to extend to them the privileges of the First Amendment when they have good press and take it away when they have bad. 
    I think that in this particular case, the judge maintained a strict decorum. 
    I think he ran the trial by the books. 
    I think he got a good jury and I think Sam Sheppard was convicted because he was shown by the exhibits and the witnesses to be guilty and that the facts that were brought in to the courtroom on his behalf might have shown that he was a good fellow but certainly had nothing to show in regard to his innocence as charged.

    Mr. John T. Corrigan 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court. 
    At the outset, may I address my remarks to some of the statements heretofore made to this Court. 
    One was regarding the question of photographs in the courtroom. Judge Blythin of the outset had instructed counsel on both sides that he would permit photographs to be taken when the Court was not in session, provided that the taking of the photographs was without objection. 
    A substantial number of photographs were taken of the counsel for the defense and the defendant and it was not until many days had passed and many photographs had been taken that objection was made and when the objection was made then of course no photographs were taken thereafter. 
    With regard to the question of the sequestering of a jury, the practice in Ohio has been that unless and until a case is presented for deliberation, the jury is not sequestered. 
    In the last session of the legislature, this was changed so as to provide for a sequestering of the jury throughout the entire trial in the instance of a first-degree murder case.

    Mr. John T. Corrigan 
    Yes sir. 
    Gentlemen, the issues before this Court as I see them are those upon which the District Court had predicated its decision and there are four separate issues. 
    One, the newspaper publicity before and during the trial, pardon me, which was assigned as error in the original appeal. 
    Secondly, the issue that the trial judge should have disqualified himself because of prejudice, this was not assigned as error. 
    Thirdly, evidence that the defendant had refused to submit to a lie detector test, this was not assigned as error in the trial court although it was raised in the Court of Appeals, and although it was raised in the Supreme Court. 
    And fourthly that the bail in charge of the jury after the case was submitted to it improperly allowed individual jurors to make telephone calls to their families. 
    With regard to issue number one, the newspaper publicity before and during the trial, the District Court's decision I believe is somewhat equated with the case of Irvin versus Dowd and Rideau versus Louisiana, the facts of which I will not repeat here for the Court is well aware of the facts in those instances. 
    It is significant however to point out that in the Irvin versus Dowd case, the prosecutor and police officers issued press releases stating that the defendant had confessed to six murders. 
    This is not the case here. 
    There was no press releases, no statements made relative to a confession of any sort.

    A comparison between the Irvin versus Down and the Sheppard case reveals that in the Dowd case there were 430 persons who were of the original panel whereas there were 75 in the Sheppard case and not all of the 75 were exhausted. 
    And of the 75, 11 of them were immediately excused for justifiable reasons or were not found. 
    In the Rideau case, the Court conceded or considered conceded circumstances and that was on the voir dire, the counsel for Rideau had requested the certain jurors who later decided the case be excused for cause. 
    There were two deputy sheriffs who sat on that jury. 
    No such incident occurred in the Sheppard case. 
    There were two members of the jury or three members of the jury rather who had convicted whom who had stated on voir dire that they had seen and heard Rideau's testimony or Rideaus's statement televised -- I mean television station.

speaker="john_t_corrigan" startTime="6126.039" stopTime="6148.987">
    Mr. John T. Corrigan 
    Your Honor, on one day the defense counsel called to the attention of the Court the fact that Winchell had made a statement on another day that Considine have made a statement. 
    Now with regard to one of them and I cannot for the moment tell you exactly which one, the Court then questioned the jury as to whether or not any of the jurors have heard that broadcast.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="6148.987" stopTime="6149.370">

    This was Winchell --
speaker="john_t_corrigan" startTime="6149.370" stopTime="6329.155">
    Mr. John T. Corrigan 
    One of the jurors had indicated that they have. 
    He then ask whether or not that juror would still follow the admonition of the Court relative to predicating his decision and the evidence in the court room and putting out of his mind any outside influence. 
    This juror had responded to the court that while he heard -- heard on the radio, he did not listen to it. 
    Now in a subsequent day when defense counsel called the other broadcast to the Court's attention, the court said this, “I'm not going to question the jury. 
    I am going to again admonish them as I have each time that we have come into session, but I'm not going to question them because we cannot daily badger the jury as to whether or not they heard or they read something.” 
    And if you will please, it would point up a place wherein they might go to look for information if daily, the court were to say, did you read this in the Cleveland Press? 
    Did you read this in the Cleveland News and so on? 
    I submit gentlemen that in this case here, we have on trial the jury system in the United States and I am going to permit the great writ of habeas corpus to provide a time after trial has had and after appeal has had, and pardon me of the use of the vernacular, but are we going to permit the throwing in of the kitchen sink and now claim that the defendant was denied a fair trial when the record very clearly points out that all of his rights were afforded him by an unbiased judge, by a judge that had ruled in a manner wherein there is no error made manifest whatever by the record, by a jury that was selected by competent counsel on both sides, by a jury that was subjected to a voir dire examination that lasted a couple of weeks, by a jury that subsequently on a motion for a new trial was brought back and questioned again. 
    Now at this time, the defense counsel did not see fit to point out that this juror was in anyway contaminated or prejudiced. 
    Now with regard to the statement of Dorothy Kilgallen, a statement of a dead man, a hearsay statement, the raucous kind of evidence, but what do we have to rebut it? 
    We have the statement of Fred Garmone, one of the defense counsel who in a deposition hearing said that he was satisfied that Judge Blythin was in no way prejudiced or whatever. 
    I might have too that the record bear out that Judge Blythin coincidentally is one of the finer judges in our county or was. 
    The record points out that Judge Blythin said to the defense counsel, “If you have any idea that I may be prejudiced in this matter in any way whatever, I will step down.” 
    Our law of Ohio provides that defense counsel must file an affidavit of prejudice but Judge Blythin in this instance, indicated that that wouldn't be necessary, but merely upon their request, he would step down and not hear the case.

    The State of Ohio was represented by the Attorney General because the action is the petitioner against the warden and the warden is represented by the Attorney General.

    Mr. Corrigan, one more question. 
    What would be your view if -- if the evidence were quite clear that the trial judge had remark from Miss Kilgallen that he believe that the defendant was guilty and that he had said to a court officer that he believed the defendant was guilty and he went right ahead and tried the case. 
    What do you think the --

    Mr. John T. Corrigan 
    Certainly, I believe that if the attending judge at this preconceived opinion, he should disqualify himself and if he failed to do so, it would seem to me that his preconceived opinion and idea would someway, somehow creeped into the record (Voice Overlap) that will affect his judgment.

    But in any event, I can say that on the record, we will not find that Judge Blythin was biased or prejudiced in any way and I can say to this Court which of course -- what are we doing here, we are equating the statement of Dorothy Kilgallen with the reputation of a judge, with the statement by defense counsel Garmone to the effect that he was satisfied that he was in prejudice with the fact the people have tried the case, the defense counsel never raised this issue and the first time it comes before this Court is ten years later on an unsworn statement, statement that's undoubtedly made and one which could not be rebutted because of the death of a man that presumably made the statement.

    And he worked in what was known as room 1 where they pass upon motions generally and hear matter in equity and he did have contact with Judge Blythin. 
    And again, it was some eight or ten years later that Mr. Murray made this statement that some several months before the trial in a general discussion, Judge Blythin made a remark something to the effect that he believed that Sheppard was guilty.

    What page?
speaker="f_lee_bailey" startTime="7163.700" stopTime="7256.488">
    Mr. F. Lee Bailey 
    On page 380 (a). 
    The concluding paragraph of the second and last brief filed by the state in the District Court and here is what was said about the statements relating to Judge Blythin's state of mind. 
    The respondent is aware that the petitioner is going to present statements to the effect that the trial judge expressed his belief in the petitioner before the trial commenced. 
    Accordingly, respondent invites the court's attention to the recent case of Hendrix against Hand 312 F.2d 1962 wherein the Court of Appeals in a habeas corpus proceeding held that the mere fact that a trial judge in a state criminal prosecution signed a statement in advance to a trial relating to the judges belief that the defendant was guilty of the crime charged and did not establish any infringement of defendant's right to a fair trial. 
    Now this issue was met on the merits. 
    The evidence was not disputed by my brother Saxbe in the District Court and indeed until he sent for a copy of the docket entries in order to put together his appeal, it seems likely that he did not know for some reason this Kilgallen statement which was in fact furnished to Judge Weinman had not been noted in the record. 
    But when Judge Weinman was advised on May 6, 1964 in his chambers, all counsel present that evidence of Judge Blythin statement was available. 
    He left it to counsel to bring that evidence to the Court as they saw fit, testimony on open court, deposition under oath, affidavit or anything mutually satisfactory.

    I don't think I have to recite anything not in the record Your Honor because on May 9th, 1964, I flew, Mr. Kessler and another Assistant Attorney General to New York and we went to Miss Kilgallen's house. 
    She offered to get a notary from around the corner and we agreed to that it was not necessary and I made this statement.

speaker="f_lee_bailey" startTime="7315.159" stopTime="7442.952">
    Mr. F. Lee Bailey 
    Page 388 (a). 
    Mr. Saxbe omitted to read this when Your Honors asked him to read the statement of Miss Kilgallen. 
    This is the opening. 
    Mr. Bailey, this statement taken for submission with a stipulation resulting from the order of the Court of May 6, 1964 is agreed by the parties to have the status of a deposition. 
    By agreement of counsel, no oath is administered since the integrity of the witness is not in dispute. 
    If counsel doesn't have the power to make that kind of agreement in a civil case such as habeas corpus, it is news to me, but if counsel having made such an agreement, have the right and the entirety to come to an Appellate Court and deny it and say the district judge have no right to accept the claim they made objections which were never made to castigate the district judge for holding in-camera hearings when in fact no hearings were other held then I think that new rules need be formulated in the habeas corpus proceeding. 
    Now the statement of Judge Blythin is as distasteful to me as to the judge who had to decide this issue and he could well have passed it. 
    He passed some that he said have significant merit, but most decisive in your determination Your Honors as to whether or not this jury entered that jury box ready for their voir dire unbiased and whether or not you should pass up the voir dire is a presumption that Judge Blythin was an honest judge and intended to do his best with this case and from some source had persuaded himself in July before there was an arrest and in October for a word of evidence was taken solely from the news media because there was no other source that Sam Sheppard was guilty as held but worse that his case was open and shut. 
    How in the United States with a concept of due process anywhere extent cannot judge a human being with that frame of mind to make decisions such as whether a continuance or change of venue to the great [Inaudible] of newspapers which could castigate him in the face of an upcoming election. 
    Whether or not -- excuse me Your Honor.

    May I ask you this question? 
    What is your answer to the statement of the Attorney General that defense counsel stated to the Court and I think he said it was in the record that he did not challenge the fairness or the bias of the judge in any way shape or form.
speaker="f_lee_bailey" startTime="7467.093" stopTime="7483.561">
    Mr. F. Lee Bailey 
    That's correct Your Honor. 
    My answer is that given by Judge Weinman in the footnote to his opinion. 
    He said, if the defense counsel had had an inkling of the frame of mind of the district judge which he did not, he certainly would have challenged. 
    These statements were not known to defense counsel and Mr. Garmone in his deposition said --

speaker="f_lee_bailey" startTime="7543.157" stopTime="7648.916">
    Mr. F. Lee Bailey 
    Now I wish to mention very briefly two remaining issues. 
    First, on the lie detector evidence, it is true that although tardy the objection was made to the introduction of evidence that Sheppard have refused the lie detector, it was not appealed to the Ohio courts. 
    Judge Blythin, I'm sorry, Judge Weinman, I believe as I read Fay against Noia had the authority if he saw fit to interpose as a bar to Sheppard's claim of this constitutional violation waiver. 
    He did not elect to do so. 
    The Sixth Circuit usurped that function and speculated that Corrigan wanted the jury to know this fact and therefore waived objections to his admissibility. 
    I think this was unwarranted and I think it was error. 
    The Sixth Circuit also ruled that the phone calls from the jurors to their homes which were not monitored. 
    The bailiffs testified that they could only hear the words spoken, not the words received by the jurors. 
    It did not give rise to a presumption of prejudice such as this Court has held in many similar circumstances and therefore, although the district judge took note of all these presumptions and did not require petitioner to produce the evidence, suddenly in the Circuit Court we find that we should have and therefore we are foreclosed. 
    I think that as to the other issues, I must leave them to the brief due to time limitations. 
    I think that the Sixth Circuit paid short trip to the district judge's opinion that they took away his power to find the facts and disregarded it as you will find in their amended order and that they should at least have sent the case back for remand so that many of the issues not yet litigated should have been but I think there's more than enough here to warrant the issuance of the writ and I think that Dr. Sheppard ought to be retried if the company has any -- I'm sorry, the county has any stomach for this case left within the 60 days allowed by the district judge, I thank Your Honors.
