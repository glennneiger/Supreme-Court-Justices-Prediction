Baxstrom v. Herold
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="0.000" stopTime="12.128">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Number 219, Johnnie K. Baxstrom, Petitioner versus R. E. Herold, Director, Dannemora State Hospital. 
    Mr. Polsky.
speaker="leon_b_polsky" startTime="12.128" stopTime="303.466">
    Mr. Leon B. Polsky 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    Essentially, this case involves the question of the rights to be awarded to the mentally ill and the procedures whereby their mental illness is determined and they are placed in custody. 
    Mr. Baxstrom was convicted of a crime in the State of New York and he received a sentence of two-and-a-half to three years. 
    After completing service of that sentence, he was committed to the state hospital where he presently is in custody having served far in excess of the original criminal sentence which was imposed on him. 
    At the time of his commitment, he appeared before the Surrogate's Court in Clinton County. 
    He received notice that a commitment proceeding was being instituted against him. 
    He was afforded a hearing of sorts. 
    He was not offered counsel. 
    He was not represented by counsel. 
    And he took no real part in the proceedings other than to indicate that he did not believe he belonged in the institution to which he was going to dissent. 
    Thereafter, he sued out several writs of habeas corpus, the last of which has reached this Court. 
    We claim that the commitment of the petitioner after the exploration of this criminal sentence was the kind of proceeding to which the right to counsel attaches. 
    We claim this as a right to counsel under the Fourteenth Amendment. 
    We claim this right to counsel as a specific incident to the due process right to notice and hearing. 
    We maintain that there is no hearing and can be no hearing in a case of this type if the man is not represented by counsel. 
    Looking specifically at the record which shows the kind of commitment proceeding we have in this case, Mr. Baxstrom was given notice that he was going to appear in the Surrogate's Court on December 6, 1961. 
    He appeared there without counsel. 
    The trial judge had already read the certificates of two physicians who were independent of the hospital and when the state law had examined him. 
    Neither those physicians testified at this hearing, yet their certificates were instrumental in having Mr. Baxstrom committed and their certificates with the basis upon which the finding of mental illness was made. 
    In their certificates, two physicians stated that Mr. Baxstrom possibly had a tendency to be dangerous. 
    I am not certain what this means but I certainly would hope that had there been an attorney there to represent Mr. Baxstrom at this commitment, he might have developed that possibly has a tendency to be dangerous is not a committable state of being in the State of New York. 
    In a subsequent habeas corpus hearing, a position testified that he had examined petitioner and found basically that the petitioner was an epileptic and diagnosed, there was no objective sign of this but he diagnosed that there might be brain damage or brain deterioration flowing from the epilepsy and then he described Baxstrom's condition that the patient was irritable, confused, and aggressive after his epileptic seizures like all other epileptics. 
    Now, I am not trying to re-litigate or litigate because this has never been litigated, the question of whether this man is or is not insane or, was or was not insane.

    Mr. Leon B. Polsky 
    First, there is some doubt as to whether or not the new procedure applies to the “criminally insane” because this is a hospital, maintained by the Department of Correction as distinguished from the Department of Mental Hygiene. 
    So, there is that first question of whether or not this new procedure or service is available to him. 
    I've tried to find out but it is all -- it's in the process of being setup. 
    If it will apply to patients at Dannemora, they will probably get to him in several years.

    He will get none of that.
speaker="leon_b_polsky" startTime="498.213" stopTime="670.858">
    Mr. Leon B. Polsky 
    There is a statement in the State's brief that the service can represent the patient that is just not so -- that is not their function. 
    Now, as I understand the State's arguments in answer to our contentions, they say on the one hand this is a civil proceeding and the right to counsel doesn't apply to civil proceedings. 
    And then they say in response to our other arguments dealing with the constitutionality of the several statutes involved that those statutes are not unconstitutional because here we're dealing with the criminally insane. 
    Now, it seems to me the State is taking rather ambivalent position. 
    We lose on the right to counsel because this is a civil case. 
    We lose on the right to a jury trial and to the patient's right to have a broader determination of whether he should be in an institution such as Dannemora because that is a criminal kind of proceeding. 
    It seems that the State is asking too much. 
    Now quite frankly, essentially, we are dealing with statutes which have been amended and re-amended and re-amended from time in memorial. 
    The people who are involved in these cases are people who, quite frankly, no one has ever really cared about one way or the other. 
    The statutes have grown up as hotchpotch statutes to meet specific situations. 
    Each time a court decides a case, a statute gets amended but never in relation to the overall picture. 
    In this case, while I could limit this case to very specific instances of prejudice which are demonstrated at this point, we feel that we are entitled to ask that people subject to this kind of awful imprisonment, well that is what it is, should have some minimum safeguards attached to their custody. 
    I cannot see how Mr. Baxstrom could be entitled to the full scope of the Constitution when he was charged with assault in the second degree and was sentenced to two-and-a-half to three years imprisonment and now that he -- and not have at least something close to those rights when the State seeks to put him away from what essentially is going to be the rest of his life.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="670.858" stopTime="684.648">

    Mr. Leon B. Polsky 
    No, Your Honor. 
    The -- there is testimony in the record that Baxstrom's epilepsy, this was speculation, was caused by either an infection that he got or a case of malaria that he contracted while serving in the Pacific. 
    So his --

    The basic -- (Voice Overlap) excuse me sir.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="719.233" stopTime="756.094">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Second question I want to ask you is, I notice the way you phrase the first question you presented. 
    And because of the way you phrase that, I want ask you whether it's your position that the State has a duty to assign counsel in these situations or whether you're limiting your position here to proposition that he should be afforded the opportunity to obtain counsel, which is the way this is phrased.
speaker="leon_b_polsky" startTime="756.094" stopTime="811.815">
    Mr. Leon B. Polsky 
    Well, if I may explain sir. 
    I do have a slight embarrassment in the way that this record was created. 
    This was a pro se proceeding throughout all of the state courts and in all of the separate habeas proceedings. 
    There is no proof in this record that Mr. Baxstrom was indigent. 
    I cannot claim -- I therefore felt that I could not say that basis for our relief should be his indigence and his lack of knowledge of counsel. 
    I've couched it in terms that the State must afford each person in these situations, the opportunity to be represented by counsel, which means if they can afford it then they can go out and hire a lawyer, which means if they can't afford it that the State must assign him counsel.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="811.815" stopTime="812.528">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    I thank you.
speaker="leon_b_polsky" startTime="812.528" stopTime="893.563">
    Mr. Leon B. Polsky 
    I couched it specifically to meet that situation in the record sir. 
    Now, the intertwining of the statutes, I think, is very significant to show how these criminally insane are shunted out of rights which other people similarly situated except for their conviction received. 
    Every person in the State of New York, if they are picked up on the street and brought to a receiving hospital, and then a complaint or a proceeding is instituted against them to have them committed, may as a matter of right at some point demand a jury trial. 
    They have this first, an initial determination by a court that this person should be committed, then there is a de novo review of this commitment at which the defendant is entitled to a jury trial.Every civilly committed patient in New York receives that jury trial if he knows enough to request it and if he does request it.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="893.563" stopTime="897.220">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Does he have a right to counsel at that stage?
speaker="leon_b_polsky" startTime="897.220" stopTime="906.543">
    Mr. Leon B. Polsky

    Justice Abe Fortas 
    And the -- I'm asking if it isn't possible that what we have here or what New York Court may have had before it was a question as to whether the statute did not guarantee this petitioner the rights that any other person would've had, had he been subject to civil commitment proceedings. 
    In other words, that his rights that any peculiarities going from the fact that he was a criminal, sees that the exploration in the sentence and then question is, did the statute applied to him as of that time?
speaker="leon_b_polsky" startTime="983.183" stopTime="1031.474">
    Mr. Leon B. Polsky 
    Well, there is only one exposition on this by a higher New York Court in People against Kamisaroff, in 13 New York 2d where the Court does interpret the statute, that is the -- Section 384 of the Correction Law. 
    Also in that case, they do discussed the right to counsel question and it actually didn't appear to have been raised in that case but it was discussed and it was closed over by the majority opinion as not -- as not applying in that specific case. 
    Now, I would -- because of the lateness of the hour, I would like to shorten my argument perhaps, save a few moments.

    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    There are four facts that I would like to establish if at all possible. 
    First, the fact that the petitioner is retained in a state mental hospital and not in a prison, and for that reason, the expiration of his prison sentence does not affect his continued retention. 
    Second, the fact that there is a rational basis for grouping the dangerous criminally insane and that their rights under due process and equal protection are fully protected by the State of New York with meaningful hearings upon due notice. 
    Third, the fact that their rationale of the Gideon versus Wainright case, assigned counsel whenever the patient or prisoner or defendant does not have the money to get counsel, that rationale does not fit the special circumstances of a sanity hearing of the criminally insane. 
    And by the same token, the right to a jury trial which is given to the civilly committed for good reasons -- again, it's not applicable.

    I have a little trouble with your defining in this criminally insane. 
    I thought of that as some who commits what would otherwise be criminal offenses but which are not because he is insane and therefore, he cannot be convicted and sent to prison and yet this man was convicted and sent to prison as somebody who presumably was not criminally insane but was simply criminal.

    And he -- then he served his sentence and it was thereafter that he was committed and the question certainly is as you suggest at the outset does not whether or not the -- not whether he can be held at a hospital if he's insane but how he got there, how he got there, how he was put there as compared to other people who were committed in your state.

    Mr. Anthony J. Lokot 
    Well, may I -- that phrase criminally insane is used more among psychiatrists and I checked that very carefully. 
    Of course, there is a distinction between the insane criminal and that certainly petitioner was. 
    He was convicted of a -- as a multiple offender, was sent to prison and after being certified as insane, was then transferred to the New York Hospital for the felons who become insane while they're in prison. 
    But now, --

    Suppose -- suppose somebody would pick up on the street and the civil commitment proceedings in the State of New York and this type is uniformly without exception testified that he is -- the person was insane and mad, they were confident that unless confined, he would commit violence. 
    Now, would he then be criminally insane so that he would go to Dannemora rather than to an institution under the jurisdiction of Mental Hygiene Department?

    Well then, you are making your distinction here because as I understand it, one of the problems in this case it's been raised by the petitioner, is that he was held in Dannemora --

    Mr. Anthony J. Lokot 
    Your Honor, about half of the patients, almost half of the patients are insane criminals. 
    In other words, they're serving their sentences technically while they are hospitalized for their mental condition. 
    The other half are patients whose terms have expired. 
    So, we just have to make some kind of distinction and as I've indicated before in checking with psychiatrist that is the term used that -- I'm referring to the term “criminally insane” as meaning those who are violent with proclivities or tendencies toward criminality even if they have never had a record.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="1467.504" stopTime="1496.137">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Well, my point is -- my question to you is that, you get two types of persons who are within that same psychiatric category and they are treated differently in one group that's -- here is someone who's criminally insane and just picked up in the streets, this type is criminally insane in the sense that you described and he gets a jury trial, he may have a right to counsel, right?

    Mr. Anthony J. Lokot 
    No, that -- I'm sorry Your Honor, but perhaps I'm confusing the Court in this respect. 
    When I talked about criminally insane, I'm not talking about the man in your hypothetical case who has been taken off of the streets and because he's violent or dangerous. 
    He is committed as a civilly insane person even though he's dangerous. 
    There is that distinction, it's only when the record shows I think it was Mr. Justice Clark who made that distinction in the -- over Holser case that those who are criminally insane are certainly a greater risk to society than those who are just civilly insane. 
    So, the man was picked up that way. 
    He may be sent to Matteawan, but in Dannemora there are only those who have been convicted and a few civilly insane people who become so dangerous and violent that there are no security precautions in civilly insane hospitals that can manage them. 
    So, they send those to Dannemora.

    Alright, in the case of a civilly insane person who is alleged to be civilly insane, there, a jury trial as I think I try to point out in my brief, so many side issues may be created and raised. 
    There's a danger of being railed into a hospital or framed and that is often the case. 
    So there, a jury trial is almost a necessity.

    Mr. Anthony J. Lokot 
    I don't believe that that is quite correct. 
    I believe that what happened there, -- there was a discussion about his being sent back home to Maryland and in light of that discussion, Doctor Kerr was asked this question as to whether or not he was -- could be sent to a civil hospital. 
    Naturally, the State has no motive to keeping these people who were there because of the gradual expense and because they want to reduce those expenses and reduce the population of these places. 
    So, they were talking about that. 
    Well, that all petered out because of the fact that his family down in Maryland did not want him, they were indigence and that's when Kerr was talking about him being transferred to a civil hospital, the VA hospital.

    But I thought -- I thought the Court said this, addressing the patient, “You were examined by Doctor Foster on November 27. 
    He is a representative of the Department of Mental Hygiene. 
    He will make a report. 
    If he reports that he thinks you were subject for transfer to a civil hospital then you will be transferred. 
    It is entirely up to that department.” 
    And then the Court addressing Doctor Herold who represented the Department, “Have you any objection that this man is transferred to a civil hospital to the Department of Mental Hygiene?” 
    So did he, “None, whatsoever.” 
    The Court, “And I sir, agree with you. 
    I have no objection to this transfer at the Department of Mental Hygiene so finds.” 
    Then he said -- ends up by saying, “I hope that he will be transferred to a civil hospital.

    Mr. Anthony J. Lokot 
    Well, Your Honor, I interpret that in light of this colloquy about Baltimore and then returning to Baltimore, the entire responsibility of releasing him as the Court pointed out was not the Court's, that was the responsibility of the Department of Mental Hygiene depending upon their findings or whether or not this man was still dangerous and should not be let out.

    Mr. Anthony J. Lokot 
    Extremely violent. 
    His entire record, although it's not in this record on appeal, even as recently as last month according to the records, daily records kept on this man, three or four times a month, he would attempt to assault either another patient or one of the attendants and it was not always because of an epileptic seizure. 
    The fact remains that oftentimes it would be over civil rights question and causing near riots there in the last couple of months as a matter of fact.

    Near riots among the patients themselves. 
    You see, at Dannemora, they do not have individual cells. 
    Most of the patients are kept in wards and dormitories. 
    They have a number of rooms where single patients are kept, but for the most part, they're kept in dormitories about 20 or 30 and 40 patients at each one.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well, as I read -- what I read from the briefs would indicate that he did not have a hearing beforehand and that this was after his term expired, he was taken before the Court and these two doctors testified and then the Court says, “Do you have any question, you would like to ask to Doctor Herold, Mr. Baxstrom?” 
    The patient, “Doctor Herold, I am at the Dannemora State Hospital since June 1st?” 
    And Doctor Harold says, “Yes, you came to our hospital June 1st.” 
    The patient, “I asked, I know that it is a mental hospital, am I right but I don't know how I got there.” 
    And Doctor Herold says, “You don't know how you got there, you were sent to the Dannemora State Hospital by an order of transfer signed by A. J. May (ph) acting warden of Attica Prison.” 
    The patient said, “I know that I'm an epileptic but I did not know that this is a form of insanity. 
    I would like to recommend sir, that the staff of the hospital review my case”. 
    Wouldn't that -- and the judge then and the hospital attendants took no umbrage of that apparently -- apparently, he had no hearing before this.

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    As I gather, maybe that's the claim they're making exactly, I'm not sure. 
    As I gather, what happens to him is that since he -- undoubtedly he will -- will say he's already -- he was put in there correctly while he was under sentence, state could do it -- choosing, thinking that would be a better place to keep him in prison. 
    But when his term expires and they no longer have a right to keep him, the only way he can get out, as I understand it, is of course for doctors who examined him and say that he can now get out.

    Mr. Anthony J. Lokot 
    Well, I can only go reading between the lines of that statement there by the Court. 
    It would seem that the Court was satisfied that this man was still dangerously insane and that it's because it follow that up with an order retaining him judicially. 
    And led it up to the Commissioner of Mental Hygiene and whose custody was to determine from then on whether they were going to -- the Commissioner has the power to release him if they find that he is harmless or if they find that he can be transferred to a civilly insane hospital without doing violence to anybody.

    At the time it was instituted, Baxstrom was still a prisoner with only several weeks to go. 
    The Court entered an order dealing with his future confinement after the expiration of his sentence. 
    Now, going back to question, I believe, Mr. Justice Fortas asked and to carry it a little further about the man who was picked-up on the street, that man is entitled to a jury trial on the question of whether or not he is insane. 
    If he is found to be insane, he is committed to a civil mental hospital, if while he is at that hospital, they decide that this man in addition to his insanity is particularly dangerous, most insane people are dangerous or possibly most than more. 
    But he is particularly dangerous, they then must institute a new commitment -- a new proceeding under Section 85 of the Mental Hygiene Law, and at that new proceeding, there are specific things which must be proven, and if they are proven then he may be transferred to a hospital within the jurisdiction.

    Now, is that a judicial proceeding?

    Mr. Leon B. Polsky 
    Yes, Your Honor, it is.

    Does he have a right to counsel at that one?

    Mr. Leon B. Polsky 
    I would say --
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="3202.174" stopTime="3204.968">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Well, let me ask does the statute say that he does or doesn't.
speaker="leon_b_polsky" startTime="3204.968" stopTime="3216.244">
    Mr. Leon B. Polsky 
    The statute says he may have counsel, the Second Circuit in the Carroll case where they held a portion of a related statute unconstitutional assumed that he would have counsel.

    How about jury trial?

    The answer is he doesn't.

    Mr. Leon B. Polsky 
    On the issue of the whether he is uniquely dangerous, no he's not entitled to a jury trial. 
    We do not -- we don't claim the right to a jury trial --

    At that stage?

    -- on the question of unique danger.

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Yes.

    Mr. Leon B. Polsky 
    We claim the right to a jury trial on a general question of insanity to which all other persons in the State of New York are entitled. 
    As to the question of right to representation, it doesn't matter what kind of proceeding we're talking about, New York does not give it, except in connection with a specific criminal charge where you have a plea of not guilty by reason of insanity or where you have a claim made that the defendant cannot stand the trial.

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Well, Mr. Lokot, I can see that I understood that had this petitioner not developed this ailment until after he'd served his prison terms, and then going to pick up on the street, everything you'd said about civil commitment would have follow then clearly, confinement initially in the civil rather than in institutional like Dannemora, is that right?
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3281.142" stopTime="3292.164">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    And does the New York right to jury trial apply when you -- once before been committed that you can release as cured and then --
speaker="leon_b_polsky" startTime="3292.164" stopTime="3306.437">
    Mr. Leon B. Polsky 
    Yes it does. 
    It would -- I would say the exception would be if the release were a conditional release, I would think that if there's unconditional discharge and a new commitment proceedings brought, then the statute requires --

    Justice Byron R. White 
    You don't -- you don't suggest that a jury should second guess the Mental Health Commissioner on type of the institution on which you --

    No, I do not.
