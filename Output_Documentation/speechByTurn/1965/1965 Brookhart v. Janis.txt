Brookhart v. Janis

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    James Brookhart, Petitioner, versus Martin A. Janis, Director of the Ohio Department of Mental Hygiene and Corrections. 
    Mr. Conway, you may continue your argument.

    Mr. Leo J. Conway 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    At the termination of my argument yesterday, I believe that it had been established that this procedure that was followed in the trial in this case, the prima facie case in which the State was only required to prove beyond the reasonable doubt all of the charges that was made. 
    But that the defendant in the case had waived his right to cross-examination and he was not going to present any evidence in his own defense was initiated to the Court or mentioned to the Court for the first time by defense counsel. 
    And it is submitted by respondent that he also had the last word as to what procedure was going to be followed.

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Do you know something about this prima facie practice? 
    Is that -- is this just something that is followed in some of Ohio counties?

    Mr. Leo J. Conway 
    Mr. Justice Brennan, I can't say definitely how many counties this is followed in but I do know that it is followed in Stark County where this case was tried. 
    The basis, as I understand it, for the allowance of this type of procedure arose as a result of traffic manslaughter cases wherein the defendant had no defense against the charge but if he were allowed or if he were required, the man had plead guilty to the charge then this plea of guilty could be entered against him or could be considered by the Court in a civil action against him. 
    In another words, it practically met that when he went in to a civil action, he had confessed his guilt. 
    Now, I believe that and I can only say this from what I've been told in Stark County because personally I'd never heard of that procedure before myself.

    Mr. Leo J. Conway 
    The only effect is that he would not admit it.

    Yes.
speaker="leo_j_conway" startTime="286.100" stopTime="477.693">
    Mr. Leo J. Conway 
    And that the situation is this, that the man came in and by his counsel said, “We are going to proceed by prima facie case.” 
    The court immediately then said, “Well, in a prima facie case then you will not do any cross-examining.” 
    I'm saying this in my own words. 
    It is in the record exactly as the court said it. 
    The court told them there would be no cross-examination. 
    The defense counsel then said, “Well now if something comes up that may not implicate the defendant, I think I should be allowed to cross-examine.” 
    At that point the court told him, “Well now, we want everybody to understand what procedure we're to follow and if you are not -- if you don't want to proceed by the case that you have already propose to this court, maybe we should just have a jury trial of it and let it go with that.” 
    Then the court told them what he considered to be a prima facie case, a case in which not technically or legally. 
    The defendant is admitting his guilt but requires the state to prove it. 
    Now, in other words, in such a procedure the burden of proof does not shift. 
    There are still is no presumption of guilt on the part of the defendant because the State still must prove beyond any reasonable doubt that this crime was committed. 
    Now, at that time, it's when the defendant got up, he'd been listening to these proceedings and he said to the court under no circumstances, “Am I admitting guilt -- or pleading guilty?” 
    Then the court said to him, “Well now, I would be happy to let you have a jury trial if you so desire even though you waived your retrial.” 
    The defendant says, “No, I want to be tried by this court, I've been in jail for 18 months.” 
    Now, as a matter of fact and this is born out by his petition that he had not been in jail for 18 months but only two months, 16 of the 18 months have been spent in another institution. 
    The court said, “In all fairness to him then, well you make your mind whether you want a full trial or whether you want a prima facie case?” 
    Now, it seems to me that the court was trying to give him every conceivable opportunity to have this case proceed in any way that he wanted it. 
    At which point then, his counsel got up and said, “Your Honor, all we want is a prima facie case.” 
    In other words, his counsel had the first and the last word in this proceeding. 
    Now, counsel for petitioner has said that he didn't understand this proceeding himself. 
    Well, this man is a lawyer, let's assume that he has passed the bar and --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="477.693" stopTime="486.743">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    I think in passing the bar wouldn't give him any knowledge of this procedure, you never heard it?

    Mr. Leo J. Conway 
    Justice White, I'm sure that that happened, otherwise it would never have them -- this case never would've been approached the way it was. 
    In other words, this is an action that would've had to -- have been determined between the prosecuting attorney and defense counsel before it got into court.

    What he say --

    -- but that is not in the record.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="529.591" stopTime="541.719">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Do you say that court was willing to give him any kind of a trial he wanted but it really wasn't, was it? 
    He gave him a choice between a prima facie -- prima facie trial and a jury trial?
speaker="leo_j_conway" startTime="541.719" stopTime="543.595">
    Mr. Leo J. Conway 
    No sir, Your Honor, he did not.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="543.595" stopTime="544.120">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    He didn't?
speaker="leo_j_conway" startTime="544.120" stopTime="587.849">
    Mr. Leo J. Conway 
    It is our contention that the last thing that court said to him, “Make up your mind whether you want a prima facie case or a full trial of it.” 
    Now, on the State of Ohio, once a man has pleaded -- has waived jury trial and elected to be tried by the court, he has a right to be tried by the court. 
    There are cases I believe and under federal law that that is something that is strictly within the province of the court is to whether he will allow. 
    But in Ohio that is not the case. 
    If a man waives trial by a jury, then the court must try him. 
    So in other words, the trial court was not --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="587.849" stopTime="598.396">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Could you explain to me then why the defendant or the defendant's counsel would choose a prima facie case rather than a full trial by the court without a jury?
speaker="leo_j_conway" startTime="598.396" stopTime="646.074">
    Mr. Leo J. Conway 
    I think really there were -- he had about three reasons for doing it this way and I think the one reason and probably the one that who was foremost in his mind at the time was that he hope that by not putting the State to the expense of a long and protected trial that he would be able to do something by a way of mitigation of the sentence of the -- of his client. 
    In other words, if he had required the State to bring all this witnesses, handwriting experts perhaps to prove the signatures and all of that sort of thing, the court could've been inclined that it given the maximum sentence. 
    In other words, you run all of the sentences consecutively.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="646.074" stopTime="650.542">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    That's a pretty poor reasoning. 
    Give him a total maximum sentence, I suppose.
speaker="leo_j_conway" startTime="650.542" stopTime="656.100">
    Mr. Leo J. Conway 
    Well, I -- it may be but I don't know what was in the mind of defense counsel --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="656.100" stopTime="656.358">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Right.
speaker="leo_j_conway" startTime="656.358" stopTime="684.985">
    Mr. Leo J. Conway 
    -- but certainly he had -- and another reason was that he had no defense. 
    His man had told him that he had no defense. 
    He couldn't afford him, the names of any witnesses or anything of that nature. 
    And I believe that the court would've -- if he had said, “I want a trial by jury or a trial before this Court.” 
    The court would've said, “Fine, then let it go with that.”
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="684.985" stopTime="700.610">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Well, apparently it developed that he had not afford to win Jimmy Cox's, that he had, I gather, forged somebody else's but then in the middle of trial and the charge never made. 
    You amend the indictment, that's all.
speaker="leo_j_conway" startTime="700.610" stopTime="706.287">
    Mr. Leo J. Conway 
    Justice Brennan, that is another thing that I'd like to clear up at this point.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="706.287" stopTime="710.394">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    And then while you're doing it they also dismissed to other accounts --
speaker="leo_j_conway" startTime="710.394" stopTime="710.925">
    Mr. Leo J. Conway 
    Right.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="710.925" stopTime="712.359">

    -- for failure of proof.
speaker="leo_j_conway" startTime="712.359" stopTime="890.538">
    Mr. Leo J. Conway 
    That's right. 
    In this particular case, a great number of checks had been forged. 
    The one of the co-defendants had signed the name of Mr. Buchanan, Buchanan, I believe it was, who was the treasurer or allegedly the treasurer of the company on which in the checks were drawn. 
    Now, that signature, L. J. Buchanan was the thing that constituted the crime of forgery. 
    That is this thing which enabled or which directed the bank to pay these funds. 
    Now, I'll admit that there was a very sloppy practice done by the stenographer who has working for the grand jury, instead of setting forth each one these checks -- four checks that were used in this particular case she copied the same check in each one. 
    Now, the pay is named on three of these checks was Jimmy Cox. 
    The pay is named on the fourth one was James Brookhart. 
    Now, the record will show that at page 35 and again, I believe at page 42 that he had in his possession some identification papers that he had receive from some acquaintance of his by the name of Jimmy Cox. 
    And those papers were at once that were used for the purpose of passing these checks that were made out to Jimmy Cox. 
    On Exhibit C which was the basis for the fifth and sixth indictments, the named instead of Jimmy Cox was his own name. 
    When they got into the trial of the case, the court allowed and actually after some consideration there, he at first, as far as the numbers of the checks was concern in a small amendment in the amount of some of them, he didn't consider any question at all but when it came to the question of allowing the amendment as to the name of the payee, he did have some concern about it and it took a recess and after he came in and had apparently have a chance to look up the law, he said that this was only an amendment as to a matter of form, in other words the name of the payee on the check is not a thing that constituted the crime of forgery and he allowed the amendment.

    It really comes down to, isn't it, here as whether or not there was a waiver because certainly you and I would agree I suppose that the right to plead not guilty and thereafter the right to confrontation. 
    Those are very, very important constitutional rights. 
    But on the other hand, I suppose we'd both agree that those rights can be waived. 
    And they are waived by a voluntary plea of guilty. 
    And I suppose they could be waived by an agreement between the prosecution and the defense of voluntary and free agreement and it doesn't this case falls down to the question of whether or not there was such a waiver?

    There was a waiver of right from the very beginning and that that waiver was understood by the defendant in the case and that at no time, did he object to this procedure as such either prior to or during the trial nor even at the time of sentencing?

    Well, at the outset, perhaps. 
    But I -- reading the record myself, I believe that the Court made it adequately clear to defense counsel as to what his concept was. 
    Now after all, he was a trial judge and he indicated what he believed it to be. 
    And after he indicated what he believed it to be, defense counsel then said, prima facie case is what we urge (Voice Overlap) --

    And there seem to be a, shall I say, slight ambiguities from time-to-time with the judge's mind on that concept. 
    Mr. Conway, may I ask you this question? 
    I note that the prisoner's statement, the accused statement on page 22. 
    Prior to trial is a prisoner out there held in the county jail and then if he is convicted he is sent to a penitentiary, is that the way it works?
speaker="leo_j_conway" startTime="1312.017" stopTime="1321.750">
    Mr. Leo J. Conway 
    In Ohio, he is supposed to be sent to the penitentiary -- well, in five days after conviction, unless he appeals.

    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Now before -- while he is there waiting for trial for these two months that he was in the county jail, he -- for two months, he was in the county jail, is that right?
speaker="leo_j_conway" startTime="1331.682" stopTime="1332.572">
    Mr. Leo J. Conway 
    Yes, that's right, Your Honor.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="1332.572" stopTime="1349.041">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Now, is a county jail a place of closed incarceration and is there a distinction between what happens to a prisoner of a county jail and what happens to him in the penitentiary? 
    In other words, is a more liberty available in --
speaker="leo_j_conway" startTime="1349.041" stopTime="1349.592">
    Mr. Leo J. Conway 
    Well, I would say less.

    That's right.

    Justice Abe Fortas 
    That's what I thought because as I read this, it seems to me -- on page 22, it seems to that what the prisoner said about the middle of the page. 
    He says, he have been -- he first, he said he's been incarcerated now for less 18 months in the county jail. 
    You said that's inaccurate. 
    And then he says, “For over two months, my nerves have been -- I couldn't stand it out there any longer. 
    I would like to be tried by this Court.” 
    And as -- and the question it would seem to me perhaps of some relevance as to the whole background in this case, as shown by this colloquy that this man had been in mental institution for 16 months, was in for two months in the close quarters, I assume of the county jail, is that right?

    No I -- you're -- that's right Your Honor. 
    I think -- what I'm trying to convey is that the judge said something, this came as a surprise to him as a result of the very first witness being on and before anything was done, the man objected and the judge said that made the statement, “Why -- I don't know and I'm not sure what the statement meant and I don't know what he had in mind when he made it.”

    Weren't that pretty ambiguous proceeding entitled when there are no rules, there'd no way either lawyer or clients could know what kind of a trial he was going to get and to have you here in the Supreme Court, the United States say that you don't know to this day what the judge meant what he said certain things and you doubt if the judge himself knew. 
    But instead you say there was a clear waiver on the part of this man after he once told the judge that he was in no sense pleading guilty.
speaker="leo_j_conway" startTime="1553.513" stopTime="1584.089">
    Mr. Leo J. Conway 
    I still think that he understood that the Court -- that the State was going to have to prove a case against him beyond any reasonable doubt and I think that the record as a whole indicates of the State did and this is a one count that was not proved by the State, the judge found him not guilty. 
    I think that the judge throughout use the constitutional standard of innocence or guilt and acted accordingly.

   Argument of Gerald A. Messerman
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1683.587" stopTime="1685.874">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Messerman.
speaker="gerald_a_messerman" startTime="1685.874" stopTime="1878.224">
    Mr. Gerald A. Messerman 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    In the few minutes remaining, I should like to address myself to two questions propounded by members of the Court. 
    Mr. Justice Stewart has asked whether or not the fundamental question involved in this case is whether there was a waiver of the basic fundamental constitutional rights which were admittedly denied. 
    I submit that upon this record, it cannot be found that there was a waiver as a constitutional matter as this Court said as long ago as Johnson versus Zerbst, a waiver is ordinarily and intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right or privilege. 
    Upon the circumstances of this case, there cannot be found an intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right or privilege for at least five reasons. 
    One, it's quite obvious that the judge didn't know what kind of proceeding was involved in this case. 
    Two, it's quite obvious that defense counsel did not understand the nature of the proceeding which was about to ensue. 
    He did not understand for example that he could not reserve the right to cross-examination. 
    Three, even today, the State doesn't understand the nature of the proceeding which did in fact ensue upon whom to the burden of proof rests and the State's own brief that suggest that perhaps it rested upon the defendant, perhaps not the standard of proof is unclear entirely too much confusion to assume that anyone knew what kind of right was being waived. 
    Four, and perhaps most importantly, this is not a case whether the defendant remain silent. 
    This is a case where the defendant specifically asserted an objection. 
    And it's quite clear from the record that the objection was asserted in plain enough terms for the Court to understand what the objection was, and that is that this objection satisfied the requirement established by this Court for purposes of determining procedurally whether an objection is adequate. 
    It brought to the attention of the Court the fact that a matter was being protested on page 22 of the record when the defendant, now petitioner did object, the Court responded, “Make up your mind, whether you require a prima facie case or a complete trial”, that court understood that an objection was being made. 
    Part from the fact that there was a specific objection being made in this case, an additional factor which would indicate that the waiver was not voluntary and intentional as the fact that defendant had been incarcerated. 
    Petitioner had been incarcerated and that this decision on his part to forego a jury trial was motivated at least in part by his reason to get this case over with. 
    Now, Mr. Justice White has asked, what kind of choice the defendant or petitioner was confronted with and whether or not the offering by the Court of a choice between a nonjury trial -- I'm sorry, between a jury trial and a prima facie case presents a constitutional question. 
    Of course, it doesn't. 
    If in fact the choice of a prima facie case had been made, the requirement of Ohio law that the defendant be permitted to waive jury trial if he decides to do so is a not a constitutional requirement. 
    But that is not the choice that confronted the petitioner in this case. 
    The choice that confronted him was a choice between a trial and no trial. 
    He chose a trial. 
    He was denied a trial. 
    For these reasons, petitioner urges that the judgment below be reversed.
