    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court. 
    After trial, petitioners were convicted by a judge sitting without a jury of violating La. Rev. Stat. 14-103.1, which states in substance that whoever with intend to provoke a breach of the peace or under circumstances such that a breach of the peace maybe occasioned thereby and subdivision (1) provides in substance crowds or congregates with others in or upon in a variety of different places both inside and outside public and private, including a public building and who fails to move on when ordered to do so by a police officer or any authorized person shall be guilty thereof. 
    The oral opinion of the court is filed on -- is referred to on pages 139 and 140 of the transcript herein.

    Mr. Carl Rachlin 
    This Court granted certiorari on May 3, 1965 and they brought all appropriate proceedings in the court below. 
    The various constitutional and federal questions were raised which I hope to refer to during the course of my presentation. 
    On Saturday, March 7, 1964, shortly before noon, the Parish sheriff in Clinton, Louisiana, Mr. Doughty saw the petitioners, all Negroes, go past his place of office of business. 
    The sheriff testified that he had been expecting them all morning. 
    He further testified that he had heard that they, as members of the Congress of Racial Equality, were going to integrate the public library in Clinton, Louisiana. 
    As soon as he saw them on the street go past his place of private business and enter the library which is just a short distance from his place of business, he called the jail and directed his deputies to proceed to the library, and he himself shortly thereafter within a matter of moments went himself. 
    The sheriff had testified below that up until that moment, he had never observed any Negroes enter the -- this library which is part of a three Parish system involving three buildings and two bookmobiles.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="225.930" stopTime="226.765">

    Two what?
speaker="carl_rachlin" startTime="226.765" stopTime="326.886">
    Mr. Carl Rachlin 
    Two bookmobiles, mobile library systems which I will refer to in a moment. 
    The three branches, the Clint -- the one and which we are concerned with here was the administrative office of the three Parish library system known as the Audubon Library. 
    And there was a -- in addition to the administrative office, there was a library there as well as in two other communities and two bookmobiles, a red one for White persons and a blue one for Negro persons and the blue bookmobile as the testimony in the record has been -- has indicated serves and has registered all the Negroes in the parishes, the three parishes with which we are concerned. 
    The testimony also indicated that if a White person had come to the blue -- blue bookmobile, that is the one for Negroes, such a person was refer either to the red bookmobile, that is for Whites or to one of the branches. 
    The Negroes weren't, according to the testimony, were never known up to this moment to have used any of the branch libraries. 
    In any event, Brown and the other petitioners herein entered the library and when met and I quote from the record by just giving the testimony of the librarian, “between the tables by Mrs. Reeves, the librarian” and this was in what was term by the administrative official of the library as the adult reading room which has sometimes been in the record below, been called the lobby.

    Five persons entered the library, all Negro. 
    She was -- her testimony was that she was alone. 
    However, at one point, the sheriff indicated that he wasn't certain -- he may have -- may or may not have seen another person enter but then the testimony was vague and that the hard testimony was precise, there was no one else in the library at that time.

    She was -- no she wasn't. 
    She was moving around the library and as I indicated, apparently, she met them between the reading room -- reading table of some eight by four and her desk in that room. 
    In any event, Brown asked her for a book. 
    Mrs. Reeves testified that she went to the index system and was not able to find the book and indicated that she would have the book sent to Brown after she ascertained that he had been a registered member of the library.

    Mr. Carl Rachlin 
    Yes, Your Honor. 
    The State indic -- the librarian indicated that that there was some confusion about the name but I think if you permit me, sir, the record shows that the library actually obtained the book from one of the state institution either Louisiana State University or Tulane and in fact as the record -- as it was admitted into evidence in the record, the book was mailed to Mr. Brown with a card saying that he could either return it by a mail or he could return it to the blue bookmobile.

    Mr. Carl Rachlin 
    Well, I -- it is hard to explain that. 
    I think the only answer is that the stenographer below did not correctly get the name of the author. 
    The author's name, if -- if you look at the -- there is a -- a certain overlapping of the names between the name that -- wrote down and the name of the book in fact and I think that was more --do more.

    Mr. Carl Rachlin 
    But -- I think the examination shows certain and probably was in fact the same book that was merely a stenographic error in the court below. 
    But I -- that is of no significance because there's no question that we don't and we don't question whether the book was or was not there. 
    We think that is highly irrelevant to the proceeding and we're not disputing that Mrs. Reeves -- I don't -- we don't claim for a moment that Mrs. Reeves attempted to in some way prevaricate the truth.

    Mr. Carl Rachlin 
    Well one was the -- the story of a Negro by Arna Bontemps, I can give you the correct title of the -- I have that here. 
    After she met them between the tables, they asked her for a book and what -- the -- the way it reads in the record on page 97, question, what is the name of the book that one of the accused asked for? 
    Answer, I copied it from the paper he handed me, Wendall Arna, the Story of the Negro: Bontems. 
    Now the reason I suggest without actually knowing so they did not participate in the trial is that Arna Bontemps is a well known Negro author and I think the whole thing was just a stenographic confusion with the name that was not at that time known to the -- the -- to the – to the actual stenographer.

    Justice Byron R. White 
    112?
speaker="carl_rachlin" startTime="592.603" stopTime="713.992">
    Mr. Carl Rachlin 
    I -- just for a moment, sir. 
    Yes, on 112 when -- on cross-examination of the administrative head of the library, Mrs. Perkins, the question was, I asked her in form of a statement. 
    I'll show you what purports to be a postcard of the United States postal service addressed -- I'll skip a few words to Henry Brown, Jackson, Louisiana which reads “Memo to Henry Brown from the Audubon Regional Library, bookmobile number two. 
    We are mailing to you on the separate cover the copy of Arna Bontemps: The Story of the Negro. 
    And then, neither the Audubon nor the state library could verify such a title by Wendall. 
    You -- you may return the book either by mail or to the book -- the blue bookmobile whichever way is most convenient.” 
    I suggest though, I don't think it's significant that this was just a confusion over the correct name of the author. 
    In any event as I've indicated and as the record shows, the choice of return was not in person to the library but either to the blue -- blue bookmobile, the Negro bookmobile or to the -- through the mails. 
    In any event, at this point, Mrs. Reeves wasn't certain whether Brown asked to see the United States constitution. 
    She asked Brown and the others to leave and they indicated that they would not. 
    They indicated that she testified quite clearly that all during this time, they maintained absolute quiet. 
    There was no unusual conduct or any disorderly conduct -- conduct of any kind. 
    No boisterous talk. 
    No noise talks because these all comes from the testimony of Mrs. Reeves by the way as well as the other witnesses who testified in behalf of the state. 
    She called her superior and he --

    She asked them to leave before calling her superior.

    She asked them to leave.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="721.479" stopTime="734.692">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well is it correct or not that she did not ask them to leave until after she had taken the order herself trying to find the book there, failed to find it, and then told them that she would send the book and let him know.
speaker="carl_rachlin" startTime="734.692" stopTime="737.623">
    Mr. Carl Rachlin

    She did not ask him to leave prior to --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="737.623" stopTime="747.787">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    So there was no -- maybe I'm -- am I fairly stating the factual conclusion when I say there was no refusal of service by her to these people.
speaker="carl_rachlin" startTime="747.787" stopTime="750.917">
    Mr. Carl Rachlin 
    There was no refusal to take the order, certainly that was true. 
    Yes, sir.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Or of any other requested service?
speaker="carl_rachlin" startTime="752.436" stopTime="809.228">
    Mr. Carl Rachlin 
    Well, there was some question as to whether they have – they had asked to see the United States constitution because the sheriff later testified that when he, at the time he asked them to leave, Brown and one of the others who was not identified by the sheriff said they wanted service and the sheriff refers specifically to the fact that there was a request discussion about the United States Constitution and as a matter of fact, the librarian herself when she -- that is the administrative head of the library, when she testified after Mrs. Reeves, she also testified there was discussion about the United States Constitution. 
    So that when I answered your question, it was not meant to be a base of it but merely that there was further discussion unquestionably and -- but there wasn't -- sir, I can't honestly say that she refused to permit them to see the United States Constitution. 
    She did however agree to take the order. 
    And that order, as I -- as the record shows was in fact filled by mail.

    Mr. Carl Rachlin 
    Well in any event, Mrs. -- Mrs. -- Mrs. Perkins, the administrative head of the library, indicated that there were couple of tables in this room variously referred to as the adult reading room, but I think Mr. Kilbourne at the trial as the lobby and the record on 101 indicates that they were both talking about the same room when he was questioning Mrs. Perkins. 
    And that, from time to time the public did sit in the reading room and -- and do whatever people customarily do in libraries. 
    As Mrs. Perkins came out, there was this talk about the Constitution. 
    I think that is referred to, Your Honor, on page 104, I think is where -- let me see -- well that's where -- I'm sorry, that is not -- that is not accurate.

    Mr. Carl Rachlin 
    Well Mrs. -- well Mrs. Perkins also referred to the Constitution -- oh yes -- yes, on 108, Your Honor, near at the top of the page, question, of course a question by Mr. Bell here, isn't a fact that the defendant, Mr. Brown -- Henry Brown asked you for a book on the Constitution of the United States? 
    He didn't answer. 
    He did not ask me for a book on the Constitution of the United States. 
    Question - Didn't you previously testify about the Constitution? 
    He said to me, what about the Constitution which your reply was that we owned it -- that we owned the copy that we owned several copies. 
    In any event, Mrs. Perkins then shortly thereafter asked them to leave. 
    And again, in -- in --
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="940.920" stopTime="949.503">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Well this episode about the Constitution or whatever it was, was this before or after they were asked to leave.
speaker="carl_rachlin" startTime="949.503" stopTime="1080.227">
    Mr. Carl Rachlin 
    This was -- this was after they were asked to leave by Mrs. Reeves. 
    Mrs. Perkins came out after they refused to leave when Mrs. Reeves -- after Mrs. Reeves' conversation. 
    In any event, Mrs. Perkins asked them to leave and again, as I say, there was this little conversation about the Constitution. 
    They did not leave, but again, there was no question they were orderly and not noisy. 
    At this moment, I refer back to what took place at the very opening of my presentation when the sheriff now comes in. 
    He had meanwhile assembled his deputies but this was only a matter of minutes at most, perhaps 10 minutes the whole incident took and the sheriff comes in. 
    The deputies came in separately. 
    No one had -- by the way, the record is very clear as to the sheriff had testified that -- that on record 107, that no one had asked the sheriff to come to the library certainly not at this moment. 
    Mrs. Perkins said, in her testimony that she was planning to ask the sheriff, but the sheriff proceeded on his own motion and arrived in about -- about 10 minutes after -- so after the incident had started. 
    Sheriff indicated -- asked to -- apparently ask Mrs. Perkins whether she'd asked them to leave. 
    She indicated she had asked them to leave and they had not. 
    He then asked them to leave. 
    At this point, Brown said, it was a public library and they wished a service. 
    And they -- this is on records 116 through 118 and they also said, according to the sheriff's testimony that they wanted to check out books and wanted, according to sheriff's testimony, at some point to integrate the library. 
    At record 120, the sheriff said as follows - I arrested them because the occupants of the building had asked them to leave and so had I. 
    It was a public building and they refused to leave. 
    On next -- the next question, probably succeeding question --

speaker="carl_rachlin" startTime="1221.467" stopTime="1321.897">
    Mr. Carl Rachlin 
    Yes. 
    It was -- there was a substantial testimony given by a Mrs. Spears who until shortly before this proceeding, a Negro lady, had been a librarian there on the blue bookmobile. 
    Her testimony begins at 136 of the record. 
    And she, for example, in the middle of 137, questioned, what procedure is adopted in registering a person for books? 
    Well we issued a card to a person who filled the required information out and the card stamp with the word “Negro” and the date. 
    Now little further on, do you ever register any White persons to borrow books? 
    Her answer to that question was no. 
    And little -- at the end of the page, have you ever registered any White persons? 
    No. 
    On the top of the next page, why is it that you haven't? 
    Answer - On 138, well the only persons who use the blue bookmobile is Negroes and the blue bookmobile serves the three parishes for all Negroes. 
    And occasionally if a White person would come to the blue bookmobile, I would give them a schedule telling them when the red bookmobile would come or the nearest branch to that. 
    That Negroes customarily used the branch library located in City of Clinton. 
    In addition, Mrs. Perkins had testified that to the best of her knowledge as administrative head of the library, every Negro who was registered in the library system, the three parishes was registered only in the blue bookmobile.

    Mr. Carl Rachlin 
    None at all. 
    The only sort the Negroes could use was the blue bookmobile or the mails there. 
    And as -- as indicated in this -- in the book in this very case, the one which was so mixed up about the title, the card that came to Brown indicated to return it either to the blue bookmobile or return it by mail. 
    And that was specifically as I say is part of this record. 
    And now the -- I think a significant question that was asked on page -- on the record 121 of the sheriff, so the disturbance of the peace if any in this case consisted of refusing to leave when order to do so by you, is that right? 
    Answer by Sheriff Doughty, that's right. 
    They were convicted as indicated and the judge in his opinion, I think also makes very clear in the middle of page 140 and I would like to briefly refer to that because I think it indicates what we consider the constitutional violation. 
    In the middle of the page, clearly this is the judge's all opinion.

    Mr. Carl Rachlin 
    140, sir, record 140, the middle of the page, this is the judgment -- judge's opinion. 
    Clearly the evidence shows that these parties did not congregate when they came to the town of Clinton to the Audubon Parish Library, merely for the purpose of seeking service that they had a specific motive and a specific intent. 
    And that was, as was shown beyond any reasonable doubt, to refuse to leave the library even after they had been served and after they had been requested three times. 
    Now the statute however in the -- is somewhat different. 
    And we -- this Court has had occasion to look into the statute and make well known in the case of Cox against Louisiana. 
    The statute says, whoever with intend to provoke or under circumstances such that a breach maybe occasion, crowds or congregates with others in any public place or building and who fails or refuses to move on when ordered to do so. 
    The sheriff arrested them as we've indicated solely because they refused to leave the public building in his mind at least as his testimony shows that would consisted nub of disturbance of a peace. 
    And as the judge indicated nub for disturbance of the peace, again, with the same thing to refuse to leave the library after they had been served and after they had been requested to do so.

    Frankly, Your Honor, that I -- we think that the library is a public building and the people have a right to be in a public building providing they are orderly and providing that they are not breaking any of the reasonable rules. 
    We certainly would recognize that the position that this Court has taken in Edwards and some of the other cases that the State has a right to set reasonable limitations and reasonable regulations for the use of public property.

speaker="carl_rachlin" startTime="1781.256" stopTime="1919.525">
    Mr. Carl Rachlin 
    I would say that Louisiana would be bound by the interpretation of this decision of-- of the Court -- of this Court in Cox and I think there probably is something left of the statute if interpreted probably for example in -- in the case that is so often cited by many of the courts, particularly in southern courts but northern as well as in New York, we, in New York has called People against Galert which -- which cited the proposition that you have an automatic obligation to obey an order of a police officer no matter how -- no matter -- under what circumstances made. 
    Well, in the case really, it does not stand on this proposition. 
    All I would hope that this Court would lay that proposition to rest particularly in light of its decision in Shuttlesworth which is not identical with this case. 
    It has many overlapping observations. 
    For example in Galbert the opening indication was that there was an actual obstruction of the street unhappy that there had been many people congregating on the street. 
    In other words, the presupposition of facts in Galprin was that the speed was obstructed and the police officer therefore asked everybody to move on. 
    And in fact Judge Lehman there made it very clear when he said the police officers are not the final arbiters of the rights of citizens. 
    So that for reasons that we have set forth specifically in our brief, we urge that this is -- the connection must be reversed that the interpretation of the statute by Louisiana is an unconstitutional interpretation, it is hopefully broad. 
    It does advice citizens of how to perform under this Act any event the Act was -- as Judge Harlan was suggesting was perhaps that the First Amendment right that we think ought to be protected. 
    And lastly our argument -- next, our argument is that the -- that the -- there was a -- we think there is any statement here under the Title 3 of the Civil Rights Act because the Title III was passed several months -- and that the Act was passed several months after the arrest here and Title III made it very clear that these -- that such -- we think that such kind of this was legal conduct. 
    And therefore any statute which made it illegal was improper.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1919.525" stopTime="1950.709">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    The difficulty with that argument and it was much of what you said this morning for me is that this -- there was no refusal of service to these people. 
    They were served and I've just look through the record again. 
    As far as I find every request that they made was responded to with courtesy and with service. 
    That -- that is the ultimate basic crucial fact that for me makes much of your argument irrelevant. 
    I mean because it's -- it's -- this is unlikely of these other cases that you've been citing to me.
speaker="carl_rachlin" startTime="1950.709" stopTime="1993.367">
    Mr. Carl Rachlin 
    Well Your Honor, I think that in a sense and if it's known, this is a common not library. 
    People will have to -- I don't think the person has an obligation to explain his presence in a public place and I would hope that -- that this Court would recognize that there were times and occasions where you don't have to tell why you're at some place. 
    You may have a right to stay there providing your behaving in an orderly and proper manner. 
    The record is clear that these people are behaving in a properly orderly manner. 
    And to me, at least if you permit me, sir, it is highly irrelevant whether they were or they would not served. 
    They were in publicly owned building doing nothing to disturb anybody. 
    The only reason they were rejected is because they were the first Negroes to enter that building and the record is clear on that and the sheriff himself said he hadn't seen any Negroes in there before.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1993.367" stopTime="1995.799">

    Mr. Carl Rachlin

    Maybe it's a -- I trust it's not a perfect commentary on life in Clinton and I'm sure Mr. Kilbourne could indicate that there are many more people who use the library more often than twice.

    If they hold the state, the State of Louisiana's entire case is based on the fact that the petitioners went in to the library and requested service.

    They had no further business there and when they just -- just sat there and looked, vacant stares into space, the librarian testified that she repeated statement that they didn't have the book and that she would try to get it -- get it for them.

    He wasn't told it -- it was going to attempt to integrate the library or anything of that kind.

    The sheriff testified -- I remember that he testified that on previous occasion when they have had the demonstrations of any kind by the Congress of Racial Equality that he was advised in advance because obviously there was always a possibility of something that might get out at hand and that was to enable him to take precautions to preserve the peace.

    Well Ku Klux Klan when they've come in and say I'm a man conducted themselves that way, I believe you would have the same kind of case.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well Mr. Kilbourne, I -- I -- I thought that it was tried on the basis of being a racial case because the -- the sheriff testified the reason he put them under arrest was that these people had come there for a different purpose. 
    And that was to establish racial equality in your -- and your court in this finding on 140 -- page 140 says clearly the evidence shows that these parties did not congregate when they came to the town of Clinton, to the Audubon Parish Library merely for the purpose of seeking service and that they had a specific motive and a specific intent, and that was as were shown beyond any reasonable doubt to refuse to leave the library even after they had -- had been served and after they'd been requested to leave. 
    Now doesn't that -- doesn't that make the case turn on a racial question?

    Mr. Richard Kilbourne 
    Not in my judgment, Your Honor. 
    I believe anybody who'd acted that way would -- would receive the same thing. 
    That's why I -- I maintain that the question of the color of the petitioners was irrelevant and the question of segregation and integration not only -- only testimony that I remember about the question of the integration came up and it shares the testimony when he said that one of the petitioners had told them that they came over there to integrate the library and that was what he said one of them told him. 
    And that -- wasn't all that took place on his questioning of the petitioners after -- after the arrest I believe is an abuse of them. I think one of them told them he couldn't read and so that's why I really didn't --

    Well of course, she was afraid and anyone would be and my theory was and it still is, if anyone who conducted themselves in that manner would certainly be conducting in a manner that would conceivably provoke a disturbance of the peace and at all times, I was trying to prove if they -- it would be absolutely there with the intent to which I charge to provoke a disturbance of the peace.

    Mr. Richard Kilbourne 
    As I said in my opening statement, the case would not be here today, there would not had been a case. 
    Now that's exactly what the situation would have been. 
    Now the talk -- the order -- there was some discussions here affecting about the Constitution. 
    This man mentioned the Constitution. 
    Now there's some confusion about just what he meant. 
    You see only one of them the -- Brown was the only who spoke to us and the others and the other petitioners don't said anything at all. 
    And when they asked him to leave, the librarian asked them to leave, he said what about the Constitution. 
    Now just what he meant, he never knew because none of them -- none of the petitioners ever testified but my theory was that he was trying to convey to her the -- the -- his idea that the Constitution gave him a right to -- to conduct himself in a manner that he was doing and she -- and her answer was, we have -- we have it here.

    Mr. Richard Kilbourne 
    One of them -- one of them lived in Clinton and the others – they were all strangers. 
    They came from West Louisiana of Parish. 
    I might say they all -- all of them were young men, young fellows and they were all around 18 to 19 years old except Mr. Brown and he was I think around 29. 
    He was the leader in this group and I think --
