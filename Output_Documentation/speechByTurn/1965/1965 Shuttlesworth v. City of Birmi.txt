    Mr. James M. Nabrit, III 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    The petitioner in this case, Reverend Fred L. Shuttlesworth, a Negro Minister and well known Civil Rights leader in Birmingham, Alabama was arrested by four or five police officers at 10:30 in the morning on Wednesday, April 04, 1962, for loitering and failing to obey the orders of a policeman on a corner in Downtown Birmingham, Alabama. 
    Shuttlesworth was convicted in the Recorder's Court, and again convicted after a trial de novo in the Circuit Court and was sentenced to 180 days hard labor, six months, and an additional 61 days hard labor in default of a fine in courts. 
    This Court granted certiorari to review the judgment of the Alabama Court of Appeals, which affirmed the conviction, rejecting petitioner's federal constitutional claims. 
    Now I would state the facts in some detail.

    Mr. James M. Nabrit, III 
    There were two ordinances mentioned in the complaint. 
    The limit I think for all misdemeanors under the code is six months and a $100 fine.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="127.297" stopTime="130.360">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    So we got -- this sentence is the maximum then, is it?
speaker="james_m_nabrit_iii" startTime="130.360" stopTime="407.849">
    Mr. James M. Nabrit, III 
    The maximum that you could get for one offense. 
    Now, I would state the facts in some detail, because they are I think important to an appreciation of petitioner's arguments that the Birmingham's laws were unconstitutionally vague as applied to him that there was no evidence to support the conviction. 
    Now the testimony in the record is in sharp conflict, but I will relate the police version referring only slightly at the beginning of the certain uncontradicted defense testimony about matters prior to the actual arrest incident. 
    The defense version of the facts was totally irreconcilable with the policeman's case. 
    The defense claim was that the police case was a complete fabrication, an attempt to -- the arrest was an harassment. 
    Now Shuttlesworth and his companion, Reverend James Phifer, were arrested shortly after they left the Federal District Court in Birmingham, where they were engaged in litigating a prior disorderly conduct prosecution after a remand from this Court. 
    The two ministers had been jailed for over a month, this record reveals, early in 1962 and on February 26, this Court remanded the case to the Federal District Court with an order which resulted in Shuttlesworth's eventual release. 
    Now these proceedings, this record indicates, were a widely publicized headlines story in the local papers. 
    And there is no dispute that Shuttlesworth was well known in Birmingham for Civil Rights activities and well known by the Police Department, which had arrested him on a variety of occasions in connection with Civil Rights activities, some of the arresting officers testified, they knew about this. 
    Now on April 04, 1962, after leaving the Federal Court, which is located at 5th Avenue in 19th Street in Birmingham, Shuttlesworth and Phifer, followed by four other Negro men, walking down 19th street from 5th Avenue towards 2nd Avenue, the heart of the Birmingham's Downtown shopping center area, about 10:30 in the morning into the business district, and this morning there were very few Negroes on the streets in Downtown Birmingham, because the Negroes were boycotting the Downtown stores and there is testimony that this group was conspicuous. 
    Now the group attracted to the attention of the police officer Robert Byars who was the traffic officer assigned to 3rd Avenue in 19th, but wasn't at his post, he was half a block away, standing on 19th Street by an alley. 
    Byars said he saw this group walking down the street, they weren't doing anything, weren't violating any laws, just walking South towards 2nd Avenue. 
    At this point, Byars entered a store, which sits on the corner of 2nd and 19th and runs -- the alley entrance to this store, Newberry's Department Store and followed the petitioner's path by Byars going through to the store, and he followed parallel to their path, reaching -- the petitioners and Byars reaching the corner of 2nd Avenue in 19th street. 
    When officer Byars got to the corner, he says that he stood inside looking out through the glass door, and by now the group which he said was 5 or 6 people had reached 10 or 12. 
    And he saw 10 or 12 persons all congregated on the corner, he said standing and listening and talking, that Shuttlesworth was among them and the group was just standing and talking mostly to Shuttlesworth, it was in Byars words, doing quite a bit of talking himself. 
    Policeman Byars says incidentally that he didn't know Shuttlesworth, although he acknowledged he had seen him on television, seen his photograph and read about him in the papers and he also heard about this boycott.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="407.849" stopTime="410.503">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    He didn't know him or didn't recognize him or both?
speaker="james_m_nabrit_iii" startTime="410.503" stopTime="633.578">
    Mr. James M. Nabrit, III 
    He says both, he said he didn't know – said seen him on television. 
    Byars also maintained that he didn't even know the race of this group on the corner, he didn't notice it in the trial, he didn't know what race this group was, although, several other officers testified they were all Negroes. 
    Anyway Byars states that he stood inside the door watching the group for a minute to a minute-and-a-half, and then stepped outside and told the group to move on and clear the sidewalk and not obstruct it for pedestrians. 
    He said some, but not all the group began to move, so he repeated his order and then Shuttlesworth asked him, “You mean to say, we can't stand here on the sidewalk?” 
    At this point, three more officers, two on motorcycles, arrived on the corner and a fourth was approaching on foot. 
    Officers Homer and Davis, who were on another corner of the intersection were beckoned over by Byars. 
    Rensheur came up on his motorcycle and patrolman Allred who was assigned to a corner about two blocks away arrived -- began to approach. 
    After Shuttlesworth asked this question, Byars says he didn't answer. 
    He just hesitated for what he called a short time and said that was for the third and last time he was informing them they would have to move and clear the sidewalk or else they would be arrested. 
    By now, according to the officers, Byars included, everyone except Shuttlesworth was moving away and had dispersed and at this point, Shuttlesworth asked Byars a second question, which Byars told two versions of it. 
    On page 18 of the record, Byars says, Shuttlesworth's second question was, “Do you mean to tell me, we can't stand here in the front of this store.” 
    Over on page 20, still on direct examination, Byars says that Shuttlesworth's second question was, “Do you mean to tell we can't go into the store.” 
    In any event, whatever happened at this point, Byars without answering told Shuttlesworth he was under arrest. 
    Byars says, Shuttlesworth said, “Well I will go into the store” and started into Newberry's Department Store where Byars pursued him inside the door, took him by the arm, and told him he was under arrest. 
    Now Shuttlesworth didn't resist. 
    He was a docile prisoner and gave no trouble. 
    By Byars estimate, the whole episode by the time he stepped out and first confronted the group till he arrested Shuttlesworth in the store, consumed a minute and to a minute-and-a-half, a minute to a minute-and-a-half. 
    A few minutes later, patrolman Byars was though, a few minutes later, he arrested Reverend Phifer. 
    He arrested Reverend Phifer, because Phifer persisted in talking to Shuttlesworth who was under arrest waiting to be carried away in a patrol car and Byars took it as unlawful for somebody to talk to his prisoner over his objections. 
    Phifer incidentally was tried and convicted on the same record with Shuttlesworth, but his conviction was overturned on appeal in the State Courts.

speaker="james_m_nabrit_iii" startTime="685.536" stopTime="957.850">
    Mr. James M. Nabrit, III 
    Yes Sir. 
    The officer's testimony about where this group was standing on the corner and how much of it all they blocked the pedestrians, it was confusing to say the least. 
    Byars said this group 10:30 in the morning was blocking half of the sidewalk causing the people walking east and west either have to wait for -- they causing -- the people walking east, either have to wait for people walking west to get out of their way or step into the side of the street. 
    However, on cross examination Byars slightly contradicted himself and said that the East-West crosswalk wasn't blocked at all, that they were only occupying half of the North-South crosswalk. 
    In any event, the very pertinent thing I think is that the officer who was in charge of the traffic at this intersection, officer Holman, an experienced officer of 14 years, I think on the force, had been standing on this corner directing traffic for an hour before all this started. 
    And Holman saw this group before Byars was there and didn't pay any attention, listen to his testimony at page 62, at the bottom of page 62. 
    Question - now you observe on these corners from your position here when you tried to police that corner, do you not? 
    Answer - I tried to. 
    And you seen these people over there blocking traffic before you saw officer Byars? 
    I saw him standing over there talking to them. 
    Question - did you see them before he was talking to them? 
    Answer - I saw them over there, I didn't pay any particular attention to them. 
    Question - did you get the impression they were waiting for the light to change? 
    Answer - I couldn't answer that, because I don't know what they had on their mind. 
    Question - you formed no impression when you first saw them? 
    Answer - no. 
    You took no note of them when you first saw them, is that right? 
    Answer - I just saw them standing over there. 
    Question - the only time you may note of them standing over there, was when you saw the policeman assisting you talking to them. 
    Answer - when I saw him over there talking to them, he wasn't assisting me. 
    He wasn't assisting you with your corner? 
    So, whatever obstruction or whatever impairment to pedestrian traffic had to have been slight, the officer was directing traffic on this corner didn't pay any attention to these people certainly. 
    In any event, Byars' own version I think demonstrates that this brief confrontation -- that during this brief confrontation with Shuttlesworth, a minute to a minute-and-a half, all Shuttlesworth did was ask Byars questions, as the group Byars objected to dispersed. 
    Now, about whether Byars really meant he couldn't stand in front of the store or go into the store, whichever version of Byars story you believe, and where he could stand and what he could do, that would really suit officer Byars. 
    Now the State Court as I said, credited the police -- one of the police version of the facts and there was nothing in the defense testimony of Byars -- of Shuttlesworth, Phifer and four other witnesses, nothing in their testimony that was it all helpful to the States' case. 
    Their description of the events, which I will just summarize in a sentence or two, was that it can't possibly be reconciled. 
    They denied being a part of any group of 10 or 12, they denied standing on a corner, they said they merely slowed, they were waiting for the light, when Byars came out of Newberry's and stood in front of Shuttlesworth blocking his path, telling him to move on and Shuttlesworth said, “Move where?” 
    Byars said, “Move anywhere” and Shuttlesworth said, “He was going to the store”, Byars immediately arrested him. 
    But as I said, we don't need to rely on this -- on the defense version of the evidence. 
    Byars' own version of the events, which led to Shuttlesworth's arrest, conviction, and sentence to maximum of eight months of hard labor, if you are counting the time for the fine, is I submit, incredible and outrageous enough even without reference to the petitioner's story.

    Was it that the [Inaudible]
speaker="james_m_nabrit_iii" startTime="1488.096" stopTime="1579.483">
    Mr. James M. Nabrit, III 
    Your Honor, I submit that no one in the Trial Court had the faintest notion that they were litigating any issue about vehicular traffic. 
    Byars kept telling Shuttlesworth on the street corner, you are interfering with pedestrian traffic, he kept using those words and the prosecutor in the trial kept talking about pedestrian traffic. 
    The city's brief cites four pages in the record for the preposition that -- and a factual assertion that these pedestrians who stepped into the street interfered with vehicles. 
    As they cite pages 17, 20, 28 and 39. 
    Gentlemen, there is no evidence on those four pages or anywhere else in the record that anybody, any pedestrians or anyone else interfered with vehicular traffic. 
    It was there that people stepped into the street, but no evidence that they interfered with the vehicles. 
    There is no evidence that Byars was giving a order relating to vehicles. 
    He kept talking about pedestrians. 
    So, if not a Thompson versus Louisville problem, that at the very least, petitioner Shuttlesworth finds himself in this Court for the first time faced with the factual contention that he interfered with vehicles. 
    It's like Cole versus Arkansas, if not like Thompson versus Louisville. 
    I submit that --

    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Does your argument go on [Inaudible] Shuttlesworth's conviction and that his conviction is affirmed on both counts?
speaker="james_m_nabrit_iii" startTime="1590.513" stopTime="1661.387">
    Mr. James M. Nabrit, III 
    My argument goes on the premise that I cannot know the answer to that question, and that there is no way to know. 
    That the trial judge's general verdict, not even indicating which count he was relying on, precludes us from knowing. 
    That if there is -- and as Court is held in cases like Stromberg against California and Thomas versus Collins, which is very much in point, because that's a non-jury case of contempt, unlimited penalty, that the burden is not to be placed on a petitioner to satisfy the court that he wasn't convicted on a valid charge, when he may have been convicted as far as the record reveals on an invalid charge. 
    So that if either charge is bad, the whole conviction must fall, particularly where it is within the power of the trial judge to avoid this ambiguity that's such a doubt of the constitutional dimensions not to be resolved against the defendant. 
    Now --

    Justice Tom C. Clark 
    Identical and the Phifer case which was reversed on 1231, that's the second count. 
    I just don't understand, they were all standing here on the corner, we'll assume from the finding. 
    Phifer was in the group, was he not, and Shuttlesworth was in the group. 
    They were both charged with the same offense, they were both convicted in the same judgment. 
    And then Court of Appeals they reversed Phifer, because the act referred to vehicular while it affirmed the other one, I don't understand it?
speaker="james_m_nabrit_iii" startTime="1708.332" stopTime="1716.979">
    Mr. James M. Nabrit, III

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Because everything against Phifer was reversed, was it?

    Mr. James M. Nabrit, III 
    Yes, yes.

    Mr. James M. Nabrit, III 
    Yes. 
    So, the one clue perhaps is that in sustaining these two, the Shuttlesworth conviction, the court doesn't, the Appellate Court like the Trial Court doesn't distinguish between 1231 and 1142. 
    All it says is that there was sufficient evidence -- was introduced for the court to find the defendant guilty under the complaint, without any analysis or discussion of the elements of 1231 or --
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="1757.026" stopTime="1762.272">

    And they said that even officer Byars didn't believe Phifer was guilty of that and then on Byars' own story when Phifer left and when -- although Byars at one point said he was trying to get Phifer -- trying to catch Phifer and when Phifer came back, Byars didn't arrest him when he saw him again, he just kept telling him to move on and only really arrested him when he persisted in talking to Shuttlesworth.

    Mr. James M. Nabrit, III 
    Well, everyone left except the affirmative was, everyone moved back at least and there was nobody there, but Shuttlesworth for a moment and Shuttlesworth and the four or five police officers according to Byars story. 
    And then when after -- again according to Byars, after Phifer went into the -- after Shuttlesworth went into the store, and was arrested and taken back out and stood on the corner waiting for the police wagon where he waited for some minutes, Phifer then came over and tried to talk to him, and it was while he was waiting at this point that Phifer was arrested.

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Does the court's opinion in Phifer's case [Inaudible] on this record that we have get it?
speaker="james_m_nabrit_iii" startTime="1906.932" stopTime="2034.590">
    Mr. James M. Nabrit, III 
    It is not in this record. 
    I think that the view of the Alabama Court of Appeals took of Shuttlesworth and the view it took for Phifer, is that the Court thought that Phifer moved when Byars first told him to move on. 
    And then Phifer was arrested for talking to Shuttlesworth later, whereas Shuttlesworth was arrested for his failing to obey the earlier command, but this doesn't at all explain the fact that it all changed the fact, there was no evidence that Shuttlesworth was interfering with vehicular traffic or that the officers orders were directed to vehicular traffic. 
    Now before discussing Section 1142, and the first count of the complaint, I would like to point out from the very beginning. 
    At the pre-trial, petitioner relied on both the First and Fourteenth Amendments and claimed that the arrest was a part of a campaign of harassment against him during the trial. 
    In 1962, in Birmingham, Fred Shuttlesworth was himself a symbol of the civil rights movement, just as much as Police Commissioner Eugene Bull Connor was a symbol of unyielding segregationist resistance. 
    Mr. Shuttlesworth was just walking down the street in the face of the continued police efforts to keep him in jail was a symbol of the movement. 
    And his freedom to walk on the streets and move about was indispensable to Shuttlesworth's freedom to associate with others and the freedom to be a civil rights leader in Birmingham.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2034.590" stopTime="2040.482">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Back then that particular case seems to have involved a what was it, a selective buying campaign?
speaker="james_m_nabrit_iii" startTime="2040.482" stopTime="2042.415">
    Mr. James M. Nabrit, III 
    Yes, yes.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2042.415" stopTime="2048.469">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Which I would presume or guess was a partial boycott or selective boycott.
speaker="james_m_nabrit_iii" startTime="2048.469" stopTime="2049.309">
    Mr. James M. Nabrit, III 
    I think that's right.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2049.309" stopTime="2053.208">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    And which would involve not going into stores I should think rather going into them, doesn't it?
speaker="james_m_nabrit_iii" startTime="2053.208" stopTime="2054.898">
    Mr. James M. Nabrit, III 
    Yes, yes.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2054.898" stopTime="2059.728">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    So it was the – here apparently the petitioner wanted to go into the store.
speaker="james_m_nabrit_iii" startTime="2059.728" stopTime="2069.871">
    Mr. James M. Nabrit, III 
    Well, I take it only after being confronted with Byars command.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2069.871" stopTime="2074.063">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    I suppose it hasn't got anything to do with the case, but I was just curios as to what the --
speaker="james_m_nabrit_iii" startTime="2074.063" stopTime="2414.141">
    Mr. James M. Nabrit, III 
    I think he was trying to – but by his version, he was going into the store to get away from Byars, by Shuttlesworth account. 
    So, I think there is definitely a First Amendment aspect to the matter, that just standing on the street Shuttlesworth did embody the civil rights movement in Birmingham, but there was a First Amendment situation even on the States' version of the facts, because the police version was Shuttlesworth standing in amidst of a group of 12 people, the center of the conversation talking to them and talking to him and Shuttlesworth denied this, but accepting the states' version that Shuttlesworth was standing amidst -- gathered this crowd and he was talking to them, we have a person exercising First Amendment rights in a simple form, but nevertheless in an important and constitutionally protected manner, because to communicate with a small group of people is just as much First Amendment activity as to make the speech or distribute hand bill. 
    Now, referring the Court to Section 1142 set out on page two and three of our brief, one of the complaint was framed on the second paragraph of 1142, so if we could turn directly to that, its in two sentences. 
    The first one makes it unlawful, for any person or any number of persons to so stand or loiter or walk upon any street or sidewalk in the city, as to obstruct free passage over on the longer sidewalk. 
    And then the second sentence says, it shall also be an unlawful and note the word also, to be also unlawful for any person to stand or loiter upon any street or sidewalk of the city after having been requested by any police officer to move on. 
    We have two alternative ways, on the face of it at least, two alternative ways of committing the offense. 
    The first being to stand or loiter so as to obstruct free passage and the second alternative being, to stand or loiter after having been requested to move on. 
    The complaint against Shuttlesworth was disjunctive just like the statute. 
    The complaint, page two and three of the record, the charge is exactly in the words of the statute, that Shuttlesworth did stand or loiter or walk upon a street or sidewalk within and among of group of other persons, so as to obstruct free passage, and then naming the intersection or did, or did while the said groups stand or loiter upon say a street or sidewalk after having been requested by a police officer to move on, they are both contrary to Section 1142. 
    The time of Shuttlesworth's arrest, there had been no construction or interpretation of this law, no judicial gloss put on it whatsoever. 
    Shuttlesworth took the law as it was written. 
    And as it was written, certainly the second sentence, the second alternative, the part dealing with standing or loitering after police officer has requested you to move on is unconstitutionally vague, because it puts the citizens right to be on the street, no matter what he is doing in the complete control of the policemen. 
    It contains no guidance for the citizen, the policemen, the trier of the fact, anyone and even more invidiously perhaps the law by precluding the citizen from standing long enough to question the policemen about what his order means or ask him about it, makes it impossible for the citizen to stand there even long enough to judge, whether the officer is justified in giving the order lest he be found guilty of loitering after the request to move. 
    We submit that after this last aspect, this law really failed to warn Shuttlesworth, and really standing for a moment and asking an officer whether he really meant that he couldn't stand in front of the store would constitute punishable loitering, after an order to move on. 
    I submit that 1142 is unconstitutionally vague for all of the reasons this Court is ever given in vagueness cases for invalidating laws. 
    There is the lack of fair warning, there is the lack of guidance to the administrator, the executive officer, the policemen and the trier of the fact and in addition to that, this law if any law does, is completely susceptible of arbitrary and discriminatory applications.

speaker="james_m_nabrit_iii" startTime="2419.377" stopTime="2454.215">
    Mr. James M. Nabrit, III 
    Yes, but I was addressing myself to the law as Shuttlesworth took it when he was arrested. 
    The State's argument now is, that the prosecution is somehow saved by a construction of the law, which they contend narrows it, I submit the narrowing itself illusory, but they contend narrows it, which took place two years later, two years after Shuttlesworth or two-and-a-half years after Shuttlesworth's arrest.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="2454.215" stopTime="2476.273">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    But Mr. Narbit, doesn't, I do not know, I am just looking, I do not have the Middlebrooks opinion, but the state's brief quotes an excerpt from that opinion, in which the court says that the construction requiring also the blocking of free passage, it is the construction they had given in both Phifer and Shuttlesworth.
speaker="james_m_nabrit_iii" startTime="2476.273" stopTime="2665.440">
    Mr. James M. Nabrit, III 
    Well, there are two things to that. 
    If that is correct, it was certainly not explicit in either Phifer or Shuttlesworth, certainly not explicit. 
    What they said in the Middlebrooks was that, this was the racial disadvantage of those earlier cases, but even if that be so, even if the narrowing construction came in Shuttlesworth's own case, even if we concede that, then that still does not cure the lack where this tortured interpretation of the statute, torturing of the words to make it one offense rather than two, doesn't, in Shuttlesworth own case even doesn't give him fair warning when he was -- as on the time he was arrested, Mr. Justice Brennan wrote an opinion in Bouie against City of Colombia in which he stated what I think is the principle that applies to this subs -- post facto, if you will construction of what the law meant. 
    The Court -- the majority opinion stated, that even where vague statutes are concerned, it has been pointed out that the vice in such on any enactment cannot be cured in a given case by a construction in that very case, placing valid limits on the statute, for the objection of vagueness is two-fold; inadequate guidance to the individual whose conduct is regulated and adequate guidance to the triers of fact. 
    The former objection could not be cured retrospectively by a ruling either of the Trial Court or the Appellate Court, though it might be cured for the future by an Authoritarian Judicial Class. 
    But beyond even this, really the -- this Middlebrooks doctrine that -- that twists the words of the statute to make it -- to make it now mean something different, to make it now meaning that the policeman can't just order any citizen off, the policeman can only give the order if there is a prior obstruction, is it really what it says, because the [Inaudible] with the burden of proof. 
    The Alabama Court has construed this law. 
    It says that the police make out a prima facie case that there was an obstruction by merely proving that the policeman gave the order and that the burden is on the defender to come in and show that the policeman's order was arbitrary, citing this New York case, People against [Inaudible]. 
    This led one judge of the Alabama Court of Appeals to dissent and protest that they were requiring the defendant to come into the court and disprove the state's case.

    From Federal Court, they have been there in Federal Court, for the hearing on the disorderly conduct charge, it was an Habeas Corpus and that trial didn't last very long, it must be continued or something, they stayed there a few moments and they left, they were walking down the 19th Street, three blocks from the Courthouse, when they encountered Officer Byars on this corner.

    Well, he testified as I saw it and I assume unless we want to overrule the findings of defense who testified that they were there in large numbers, so large people could not walk on the sidewalk. 
    They therefore the people who were walking on the sidewalk had to get out in the street and walk. 
    Do we not have to accept that as being a finding of the court and based on Byars' evidence like he said that already?

    On some occasions, people who were walking in an easterly direction on the North side of Second Avenue, had to go into the street to get around the people who were standing there.

   Argument of Earl McBee
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3070.953" stopTime="3071.945">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. McBee?
speaker="earl_mcbee" startTime="3071.945" stopTime="3222.452">
    Mr. Earl McBee 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    I think I would like to correct some of the implications of the evidence. 
    Here is a statement on I think Mr. Narbit referred to on cross examination relating to what the two defendants Phifer and Shuttlesworth were doing and whether or not they alone were blocking the sidewalk in such a manner as to require the pedestrians to go out into the street. 
    It is true enough at Page 21, I believe on top of Page 22 of the record, that they all – so testified. 
    However, on further cross examination on Page 27 and Page 28 of the record, he was interrogated further about the crowd and he said the crowd of which the bottom of Page 27 and the top Page 28, he said the crowd of which Mr. Shuttlesworth, Reverend Shuttlesworth and Reverend Phifer were members did block the East-West traffic lane for pedestrians and did as a point of fact require the pedestrians who were not involved in the group to move into the street in order to get by. 
    Now, it is true the testimony is that they did not block over half of that passageway, but nevertheless at that particular hour, a busy hour of the morning, when the testimony shows that from 50 to 100 people a minute were passing by. 
    The testimony clearly shows and this -- the Court of Appeals clearly had the right to determine as a matter of fact that the pedestrian traffic was so diverted as to get into the street, and it is obviously the inference to be drawn from that evidence that it did interfere in that manner with the vehicular traffic. 
    Now, we -- I think we have in our brief, the Phifer -- the relevant portions of the Phifer case.
speaker="william_o_douglas" startTime="3222.452" stopTime="3234.911">
    Justice William O. Douglas 
    What if the -- what is the crime on the Alabama statute, if every one but Shuttlesworth or everyone in the group, but one moved on and one man stayed on behind --
speaker="earl_mcbee" startTime="3234.911" stopTime="3255.227">
    Mr. Earl McBee 
    Mr. Justice Douglas, we contend in this case, that the proscription reads any person who as a part -- as a person or a member of a group, in other words some of the statutes or ordinances are phrased in a group as such, but this includes person as well.
speaker="william_o_douglas" startTime="3255.227" stopTime="3264.356">
    Justice William O. Douglas 
    Yes. 
    If there were 12 and the policeman says move on and the 11 move on and the one man remains, is he violating a --
speaker="earl_mcbee" startTime="3264.356" stopTime="3327.470">
    Mr. Earl McBee 
    That maybe a question if he remained, so and does not block, but however though I think the evidence is clear that they didn't all move. 
    Now, the testimony of the officer was, Officer Byars, and by the way he was the only arresting officer. 
    Now, there is some testimony that Officer Rensheur said, I helped in the arrest, but when he testified his -- what his assistance consisted of, he said it just consisted his being there, that is all. 
    He did not do anything else. 
    But when officer -- when Officer Byars accosted the group, and by the way, I think that I should make this statement, the record clearly shows that the blockage occurred for some four and a half minutes and that is true, that before the officer ever accosted the group, it had been going for a minute and a half, and the testimony was that -- that the officer watched the light change, in other words there was a semi full light at that intersection, he watched it change for a number of times.

    Mr. Earl McBee 
    That is Officer Byars. 
    Now, the other Officer Holman, I think the evidence indicates, was engaged in a conversation with another officer, Officer Davis, who was -- who was a meter patrolman, that is he had a three wheeler as it's called and his duty to patrol certain portions of the streets to check parking meters. 
    He had gone to that intersection according to the undisputed testimony for the purpose of conveying a message to Mr. Holman, pertaining to a personal matter and relating to a call that -- Officer Holman was to call his home. 
    And so Officer Davis and Officer Holman were on the corner, but obviously engaged in a conversation between themselves and they were summoned across the street according to some version of the testimony.

    It -- the Court of Appeals, I think very clearly indicated what the conviction was for. 
    We have as you could see as in the record on Page 138 of the record, I believe the finding of the Court of Appeals in the Shuttlesworth case is set forth and it is clear that they found the facts to be that both -- that blocking and both ordered to move were present.

    Justice Byron R. White

speaker="earl_mcbee" startTime="3490.326" stopTime="3540.624">
    Mr. Earl McBee 
    Yes sir they, in other words, when he first came up, he requested them to move. 
    The testimony I believe is that rather than inquiries I think the evidence is that Reverend Shuttlesworth made statements, such as, such as you mean, “We can't stand here on the sidewalk” and the officer then said, he repeated his statement that “You are blocking the sidewalk, obstructing pedestrian traffic, you are causing“ but he didn't say your causing the crowd going on the streets, but he said “You're impairing pedestrian traffic and I'm asking you to move again.”

    Also the reason that I asked my earlier question is due to the record on Page 28, just above folio 30, where the officer says that everybody had -- apparently said is that everybody at the time of the arrest had moved except Shuttlesworth. 
    Nobody was standing there except Shuttlesworth.

    Mr. Earl McBee 
    I believe that -- I believe what he said was, nobody was standing, everybody else was in motion except this defendant Shuttlesworth who had never moved.

    But as I read this on page 18, it says that did you observe the defendants in the group for any length of time, answer and in my best judgment for a minute to a minute-and-a-half while he stood. 
    Question: what did you do then after observing them with anything. 
    Answer: I walked out of the store and informed a group of people they would have to move on and clear the sidewalks so as to allow free passage and not to obstruct it. 
    What did you tell them, again please? 
    I told them they would have to move on and clear the sidewalk?

speaker="earl_mcbee" startTime="3694.737" stopTime="3803.620">
    Mr. Earl McBee 
    Yes sir, they made no effort whatever to explain their presence. 
    They made no effort to contend that they were there observing the boycott situation. 
    It was not referred to anywhere in the testimony except the testimony was although the questions were asked whether or not these officers knew about or had heard about any boycott activities. 
    They said, “We have heard rumors of it.” 
    They were asked if they have been given official notice of it through their superior officer, they said “No.” 
    So far as the evidence is concerned, neither the State or the City's evidence nor the defendant's evidence disclosed any connection or relationship between the boycott so called and the occasion that people were standing there. 
    As Reverend Shuttlesworth says, here is version of what happen was simply that, we walked down the street just as any other people would walk down the street. 
    We got there just before the light changed and we just about the time we ready to step out in the street and cross, the officer came up and accosted us, which of course is a direct conflict in the testimony of Mr. Byars who said that they had been standing there talking about what we don't know, they made no effort to explain what they were talking about, but just standing there talking. 
    Now, somehow or the other, the group had augmented according to Byars testimony from about six to about ten or twelve and what they were talking about nobody knows and nobody attempted to explain. 
    If they were attempting to -- evidence or to exercise any of the free speech rights, it isn't mentioned anywhere.

    Mr. McBee it maybe that not everybody moved when the officer first requested to do so but where is the evidence in that the obstruction which may have existed there was found to exist prior to the request to move. 
    Where is the evidence, they remained after the request? 
    It's only that some of them moved away and some of them didn't. 
    Now let's assume for the moment that everybody moved, except Shuttlesworth immediately upon the first request, let's just assume that and Shuttlesworth stayed all alone stayed there and said, do I really have to move or we're not obstructing anymore, here I am, I am standing here all alone, and then the policemen arrests him what he was arrested for. 
    Under the construction of the statute that wouldn't be good, some instruction and a request of full information.

    Apart from the fact that everybody didn't move?
speaker="earl_mcbee" startTime="3868.485" stopTime="3947.335">
    Mr. Earl McBee 
    But I think that we have to take into account, Mr. Justice White the form of the statement made by Officer Byars. 
    He made the first – asked, requested for them to move and told them that they were obstructing traffic. 
    He said that he informed them after the first occasion, when Shuttlesworth said “You mean to say we can't stand on the sidewalk. 
    He said, “I said nothing in return.” 
    I won't hesitate again short time after third and last time, no this was a third time. 
    Now, the second time, he says, “I waited for a short time and told them -- informed them again they would have to move and not obstruct the sidewalk and allow free passage for the pedestrians East and West” at which time the defendant asked “You mean you can't stand here on the sidewalk.” 
    And the third time, he told them, he says “I'm informing you for the third and last time that I'll have to move you -- I'll have to arrest you unless you clear the sidewalk, which you're obstructing.” 
    So, I would assume that the inference is that they were still there in sufficient numbers.

    Mr. Earl McBee 
    In Shuttlesworth case, yes it was and we have quoted in our brief, the relevant part of the Phifer case, which clearly indicates the point of clearance between the two cases. 
    On page 32 of our brief, on page 33, we have quoted at length the findings of the Court of Appeals in the Phifer case and also we have quoted on page 33 at length from the testimony which indicates that as a matter of truth in fact, the arrest actually was not predicated upon the traffic situation, but as the Court of Appeals says we are of the opinion that reading the record that clearly the arrest occurred because Phifer came back. 
    He had disappeared so Byars said and came back after having disappeared and was arrested or rather he was first warned to move on and leave the presence of Reverend Shuttlesworth. 
    But, he did not do so and was warned I think three times according to the testimony as set forth here, and the third time the arrest was made and the Court of Appeals said that -- and concluded that the arrest did not relate to moving on or failed to move on in response to the direction of an officer when obstructing traffic, and did not relate to any situation that could in anyway involve vehicular traffic and so therefore his conviction was reversed.

    Justice Byron R. White 
    The previous sentence -- the obstruction statute is that a violation?

    Both are traffic statutes, both are traffic regulations --

speaker="earl_mcbee" startTime="4150.577" stopTime="4186.033">
    Mr. Earl McBee 
    1142 is broad enough perhaps to include regular traffic, but it does not specifically say so, and I'm not aware of having so been construed but it does cover, it says streets and sidewalks. 
    As a matter of fact the ordinance itself, in its own space reads streets and sidewalks are to be kept open for free passage that's entitlement of 1142.

    Would this conviction have to be reversed?
speaker="earl_mcbee" startTime="4195.697" stopTime="4249.728">
    Mr. Earl McBee 
    It is our contention it would not sir. 
    We have covered that or tried to cover it in the last portion of our brief and our argument there is that the Stromberg and other cases that are referred to in the brief for the petitioner relate to the matter, of declaring the constitutionality of the ordinance or statute involved. 
    It is our contention that at most a reversal of 1231 conviction would -- and by the way of course I must explain here that there was only one -- one sentence and --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="4249.728" stopTime="4252.428">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    But he was convicted of both accounts.
speaker="earl_mcbee" startTime="4252.428" stopTime="4256.181">
    Mr. Earl McBee 
    Only one sentence and he was in effect I think convicted on both counts, yes.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="4256.181" stopTime="4257.506">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    And only one sentence.
speaker="earl_mcbee" startTime="4257.506" stopTime="4404.950">
    Mr. Earl McBee 
    That's correct, yes sir. 
    Now, our point here is this that actually the 1231 ordinance was not within itself tested for its constitutionality. 
    As a matter of fact in the brief, I believe that the petitioners say that that they have in effect that they -- that they realize that it has been so narrowly construed as to relate to those situations involving or relating to vehicular traffic that they had no desire to argue further about the unconstitutionality of it. 
    They said if it had not been so construed, then they would then contend it had the same infirmities as they say 1142 had. 
    But the Court of Appeals in both cases found that they did not reach the constitutionality of 1231, and petitioner's brief concedes that to be the case and closes that little quotation in that regard with a statement that it's immaterial anyway whether it is – whether it is good or bad or whether it did reach and didn't reach it because of the 1142 is the dispositive of this particular case, and so we say that the Court of Appeals did not reach the question of constitutionality of the 1231. 
    We do not mean to concede that it would have been unconstitutional had they've reached it, but they did say that it related to vehicular traffic and as such in a later case, the Shelton case, I believe some of the court felt that in vehicular traffic situations, there should be some assumption in favor of the validity of the direction of the traffic officer or the police officer and that it should not be set apart or aside or reversed unless there was some evidence presented to show that they obstruct arbitrarily.

    Mr. Earl McBee 
    I have made this statement and perhaps I didn't make it clear, but we have construed the decisions Stromberg of course and other cases which were relied upon by the petitioner in this argument to deal with the issue of the constitutionality of the several different Acts that are statutes or ordinances that might be involved and in our case we do not have anything although so far as I can see except a question of lack of evidence, if this Court should so find. 
    Now, we say first that there is no lack of evidence because it is obvious that the Court of Appeals took the position that evidence of forcing pedestrians into the street made of this situation a matter involving vehicular traffic. 
    Now, that is the fair inference that we take of the Court of Appeals' decision, and we believe that it is the fair inference that should be taken from the evidence as Byars indicates. 
    Further, we say that if it is just merely, if it is just merely a question of no evidence or lack of evidence, and that's the -- that's the heart of it as we see it, then the case is as we understand them, Federal and State of when a summon is exacted which is not broader than would be substantiated by one count, the fact that there are two counts in the case and one of them is bad does not mean that the verdict will not stand or the decision will not stand on the good count.

    Yes sir, they always do invariably applied to that situation when of course if they -- if the sentence was so great that it could not be supported on one count. 
    For example, if the sentence had been, we will say, 180 days, plus 180 days or say it had been 270 plus fine, then it would be obvious that you would have to rest your conviction upon the bad count and it would not -- that rule would not be applied. 
    But when only one -- when only one sentence is imposed and the reason for that either is that there is one bad count and one good count. 
    If you disassociate it from the question of constitutionality, and I believe that the Stromberg case, Carlson and the other cases would perhaps be cases in point if you were aiming at the constitutionality of the ordinance in question, but as we say here, apparently there is no effort -- serious effort made on the part of petitioner to argue that 1231 was unconstitutional as it was construed and applied in this case.

    Number one, if the court will observe each of the ground of demur relate to and embrace not just one of the constitutional provision of the statutes, but both statutes. 
    Now under our Alabama principle or theory or practice in relation to demurrers, each demurrer is a unit to itself, and the ground of demurrer of course being all embracing covered too much territory, it covered both 1142 and 1231 and was addressed therefore to the entire complaint, and not to each attempt.

    I think that it depends -- if I understand it correctly, it depends upon the fairness of the rule of practice and whether or not it is fairly implied and whether or not it is actually a rule that knows no exceptions, but it has been universally and uniformly applied through the years, but I think if the court, if the Alabama Court should vary from it's previous decisions and come up with a new rule, which they say will not permit us to bring this question, then this Court with doubt will look into that and say that you can't stand on some fanciful new rule to avoid the constitution question being attempted.

    Mr. Earl McBee 
    No sir, I am sorry Mr. Justice White I didn't mean to say that. 
    What I say is that the inference is clearly that the trial court found guilty on charge of complaint which have been in both counts, yes and the second court, I mean the Court of Appeal to affirm and they did not deal with the constitutionality of 1231, they did with 1142. 
    They held as we interpret their finding a fact that the evidence was broaden up and when you contrast the holding in Phifer that the evidence was broad enough to cover both counts, that is both the vehicular traffic on the theory of getting into the street plus also the traffic on the street that is the blocking of the street and the failure to move on after having been requested to do so by the police officer.

    No, I am just asking you I don't--

    Well, the only thing, the only thing--
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="5292.915" stopTime="5297.957">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    What did they do according to the evidence that Phifer didn't do?
speaker="earl_mcbee" startTime="5297.957" stopTime="5324.800">
    Mr. Earl McBee 
    Well, of course he did, he did finally move for one thing and disappeared as also Byars testified, but actually in point of fact what he was arrested for was coming back to the scene after Reverend Shuttlesworth was arrested. 
    That was the crime he actually committed according to the arrest.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="5324.800" stopTime="5326.853">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    And what was -- what crime did he commit and do?
speaker="earl_mcbee" startTime="5326.853" stopTime="5327.654">
    Mr. Earl McBee 
    Well, the court said he didn't commit any --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="5327.654" stopTime="5329.780">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Was it vehicular traffic?
speaker="earl_mcbee" startTime="5329.780" stopTime="5331.260">
    Mr. Earl McBee 
    The court said he committed none. 
    He was -- that's why.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    No, no I am talking about the trial courts and the evidence --

    Yes.
speaker="earl_mcbee" startTime="5336.802" stopTime="5350.741">
    Mr. Earl McBee 
    Well, the Trial Court I presume thought that he was still a member of the group that was blocking the traffic and was for that reason entitled to be convicted I suppose. 
    I have no way of knowing, I mean he didn't say.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="5350.741" stopTime="5353.246">

    Neither do we have anyway of knowing, do we?

    You mean, as to Phifer.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Yes.
speaker="earl_mcbee" startTime="5355.706" stopTime="5358.422">
    Mr. Earl McBee 
    No sir, but the Court of Appeals has dispensed with that question --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="5358.422" stopTime="5372.982">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Yes, but my point is this. 
    If Phifer is not guilty under this charge and this conviction, how can we convict Shuttlesworth?
speaker="earl_mcbee" startTime="5372.982" stopTime="5394.862">
    Mr. Earl McBee 
    Well, the only thing I can say is this, the Court of Appeals construed the evidence to mean that he was never arrested for that. 
    He was never arrested for that. 
    He was arrested according to that view point for coming back not for the original set of circumstances out of which Mr. Shuttlesworth was arrested, but for the fact he came back.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="5394.862" stopTime="5397.219">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    But the trial court found that he was --
speaker="earl_mcbee" startTime="5397.219" stopTime="5398.228">
    Mr. Earl McBee 
    He found guilty.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="5398.228" stopTime="5401.478">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    He was convicted of the very same offenses that Mr. Shuttlesworth [Inaudible]
speaker="earl_mcbee" startTime="5401.478" stopTime="5401.783">
    Mr. Earl McBee 
    The trial court found him guilty.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="5401.783" stopTime="5403.027">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    And he was convicted at the very same offenses that the trial court.
speaker="earl_mcbee" startTime="5403.027" stopTime="5468.315">
    Mr. Earl McBee 
    The trial court found guilty, correct yes, that's true. 
    The trial court found him guilty. 
    But as I say, the Court of Appeals didn't agree at all with that, because they said the Byars was clearly, was contrary to that view. 
    There was another word to the Court of Appeals found the facts entirely or differently in the two cases. 
    And in the Phifer case, they said that he did not do anything at the time he was arrested, except refused to move away from Shuttlesworth which was not -- which was not related to traffic and nobody contented it was, not even officer Byars. 
    In other words, the trial court may have made a mistake, but if so, that mistake was corrected by the Circuit Court, by the Court of Appeals, and is no longer as I see it in this Court.

    Justice Tom C. Clark

speaker="earl_mcbee" startTime="5515.759" stopTime="5537.626">
    Mr. Earl McBee 
    Yes sir, that's right. 
    It's clear, that he -- that if the officer had been arresting him for the original blocking and obstructing, he should have arrested him when the man first walked up and said you're under arrest for participating in this blocking and obstructing, but he didn't do it. 
    He said move away, go ahead, get away from here.
speaker="tom_c_clark" startTime="5537.626" stopTime="5542.601">
    Justice Tom C. Clark 
    Then he had been arrested for the blocking; he arrested him when he arrested Shuttlesworth.
speaker="earl_mcbee" startTime="5542.601" stopTime="5586.187">
    Mr. Earl McBee 
    Well, I think he said that Phifer had disappeared and gotten away and he didn't know how to find him while he was engaged in arresting Reverend Shuttlesworth, he did not know where Phifer was. 
    But the point is though certainly when he first walked back, when he came back to the scene, if he were being arrested for the offense that he originally was said to have been involved in, he should have been arrested immediately when he walked up that you are under arrest for participating in this blocking, but that was not the case. 
    He was not under arrest.

    Mr. Earl McBee 
    Well, I think it's just a question of his erroneously being arrested and his erroneously being convicted and the Court of Appeals cleared it up and said so, that he was wrongly arrested.

    Because it's wasn't until after certiorari was granted in this case as I understand it that one of these ordinances that is 1142 was construed to mean that the illegality of standing or loitering on a street was only relevant in connection with having previously blocked the sidewalk, block the respective sideway, that's the Meadowbrook case, isn't it?

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Right.
speaker="earl_mcbee" startTime="6119.843" stopTime="6283.158">
    Mr. Earl McBee 
    So it would be difficult to find, I mean in the actual cases on there. 
    I don't know how much time I have left, but I did want to go to a comment on the point that is raised in reference to 1142. 
    As we understand it, the Court of Appeals in this case said that 1142 applies not in freedom of the speech cases, but has its application only in, in the matter related to the blocking of the sidewalk or traffic situation in relation to sidewalks and streets. 
    And on page 17 of our brief, we do quote the holding of the Court of Appeals or the reference by the Court of Appeals to Section 1142 as amended that [Inaudible] city code which states that it is not aimed at free speech and simply it is a municipal regulation, which is confined to the controller traffic and use of streets and sidewalks. 
    The effort to bring into the picture a contention that Reverend Shuttlesworth, because of the fact that he had some notoriety as a civil rights leader in the city of Birmingham is, we think beside the point, because actually the undisputed testimony is that officer Byars who made the arrest and we're looking now at page 23 of the record near the bottom of the page, in which the question was asked, you were familiar with his face and features were you not of that is of Reverend Shuttlesworth and the answer was, I was not. 
    Reverend Shuttlesworth testified in the case and he said that he didn't recognize officer Byars, he did not know officer Byars. 
    Officer Byars said he did not know Shuttlesworth and the testimony of Shuttlesworth was that at no time, was he addressed that is, he Shuttlesworth addressed by his name. 
    So the clear import of the evidence was, and so far as I know the uncontradicted evidence was that Mr Byars who made the arrest did not know Reverend Shuttlesworth.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="6283.158" stopTime="6288.734">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Didn't Mr. Nabrit say that he also testified that he didn't know whether or not they were colored people.
speaker="earl_mcbee" startTime="6288.734" stopTime="6302.047">
    Mr. Earl McBee 
    Well, he said the entire group. 
    There were number in the group, I mean of some 10 or 12 according his testimony. 
    Now he did not say that he didn't know that Shuttlesworth and Phifer were colored people, but he did not know.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="6302.047" stopTime="6303.899">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    They are colored, aren't they?
speaker="earl_mcbee" startTime="6303.899" stopTime="6308.779">
    Mr. Earl McBee 
    Actually I think that -- oh yes, that's correct, yes that's true.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="6308.779" stopTime="6312.672">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    I thought the question was whether or not there were any white people in the group.
speaker="earl_mcbee" startTime="6312.672" stopTime="6363.052">
    Mr. Earl McBee 
    That's what he asked him and he said he didn't know. 
    He couldn't tell about that, but I believe that another officer, officer Holman I believe said that they were all colored as far as he could tell. 
    But in reference to Phifer, the same testimony, Mr Byars testified he did not know Reverend Phifer. 
    Reverend Phifer testified he didn't know Mr. Byars and he did not call Mr Byars by, I mean Reverend Phifer by his name. 
    So the evidence would clearly indicate that the fact that Reverend Shuttlesworth or Reverend Phifer, one of both were well known civil rights leaders had nothing actually to do with the arrest and with the trial of these defendants.

    Mr. Earl McBee 
    That is true, but that was merely a furtherance of what the Court felt was immaterial inquiry. 
    The evidence had already been in that there was -- the rumor to be a selective buying campaign. 
    I think one of the officers said that they had heard about it, but they were asked if they had received any instructions or official notice, they said they had not. 
    They had been given no instructions to --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="6440.622" stopTime="6468.755">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Well, I'm not talking about what the officer said, but they did raise the question to try to prove that who that object [Inaudible] they were trying to protect their civil rights and then one of the assignments of errors that the Court of Appeals passed on, was saying the Court was correct in holding that, that evidence was not enough. 
    I don't know the materiality of it and I wouldn't say so.
speaker="earl_mcbee" startTime="6468.755" stopTime="6517.122">
    Mr. Earl McBee 
    I think what they were asking Mr. Justice Black, was had there been any of publication in the radio or newspaper about the release of these men from jail. 
    I believe that's what the question involved was, there was a trial pending in the Court, is that correct? 
    That's right on my release from jail. 
    What was the circumstance of you being in there. 
    In other words, and Mr. Walker objected to going in to a side issue of what he had been in jail about and about which they have done a hearing over in the Federal Court. 
    That did not relate at all as I see it to any sort of civil rights movement or civil rights activity.

    And the court felt that was extraneous and of course the question -- the next question was, why was it necessary for you to leave 19th and go to 16th street and 5th Avenue to get a cup of coffee, that was another question which was not relevant to anything that went on there, why they left.

    Yes, and it is true also, as we understand it in the criminal cases as well, because we have the line of cases of which we think do sustain that Classon versus United States and also Pierce versus United States and of course some Court of Appeals cases U.S. versus Parollo and Cliff versus United States, that I believe is -- I think the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals I'm not sure, but at any rate those cases, we say sustain the view point that if the Court even should determine that one of the cases is not sufficiently proven by the evidence that the conviction should be sustained by the good count unless we do get into a question of the constitutionality of the counts and the Court holds that the ordinances sustained was supporting either of the counts is unconstitutional, then I think you would have to reverse it.

    Well, the only point that I can see is that historically the holding has been that either in the federal and criminal cases or several cases either one. 
    If you have a good count to which the conviction can be sustained and you did not give him more than he was and that he could have received for that one count, then if you merely find that the evidence isn't insufficient to support, then you rest your decision on the good count and sustain them.

   Rebuttal of James M. Nabrit, III
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="6925.145" stopTime="6933.558">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Nabrit.
speaker="james_m_nabrit_iii" startTime="6933.558" stopTime="7205.684">
    Mr. James M. Nabrit, III 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    May I say at the outset, the petitioner objected pretrial to the constitutionality of Section 1231 in the very same terms, he objected to the constitutionality of Section 1142 and it's all on page six of the demurrer and also exactly the same way page four and the motion to quash. 
    This last case of Shuttlesworth in this Court involved a similar sort of an attempt to prevent this Court from reaching the federal issue that would involved the wrong side of the paper. 
    Well, this esoteric procedural rule, that a pleading that is labeled separate even though, it is nevertheless called joined and therefore improper is I submit, requires a meaningless ritual like this Court talked about in Staub against Baxley where the man had to write in separate sentences, I object to the constitutionality of this law and that law. 
    Under -- but it is plain that the petitioner presented his constitutional objection to both statues and ample time for the Court to rule on them, to understand his objection very plainly. 
    Now, I don't propose to devote much more time to a mystery of what he was convicted about. 
    It seemed to me clear that the Court can't note that the prosecutor convicted him doesn't seem to know at this point, but I think both charges were constitutionally vulnerable. 
    Section 1142, it is so obviously capable of sweeping and discriminatory application that if such a law as this were upheld, no civil rights worker could ever safely venture on the streets in a community where the police were disposed to suppress civil rights activity. 
    The threat of serious penalties, here eight months in jail serves as deterrent to coerce to obey lawless police orders. 
    As for example, police orders of a type in right against Georgia that is specifically designed to enforce segregation. 
    And this one is obviously capable of application to First Amendment situation, to every kind of First Amendment situation on the streets. 
    It makes the policemen the dictator of the streets without any possibility of a effective review by the courts. 
    The very fact that under this Court's usual practice, the facts escapes strict review, demonstrates the necessity for a really strict standard of the statutory specificity with a law so easily susceptible of abuse and use to suppress free speech. 
    I would point out however, that this Court's decisions in Edwards against South Carolina and Cox against Louisiana last term make a claim that the Court has the power and duty to scrutinize the record, that the fact should be taken as they appear in the record consistent with the findings by the Alabama Court of Appeals, but not limited to that Court's characterizations of that fact. 
    Now, I believe that the Chief Justice asked Mr. McBee how wide the sidewalks are and he correctly responded that there is no evidence of the width of the sidewalks in the record and I understand he gave his own estimate. 
    It is my understanding that his estimate is right, about 12 feet as to the second avenue side, by the 19th street sidewalk is very wide about, 20 feet wide.

    Mr. James M. Nabrit, III 
    The second one, the one you were looking at. 
    I thought the question was did he get a jail term in both courts, and the answer is yes, he got a 180 days in both courts, and the $100 fine in both courts.

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    What you have as the same thing you have all over the country and that if a man is convicted by these fines, he does not pay the fine, he is sentenced to a certain amount of imprisonment. 
    Here, they can give him 6 months in prison, 180 days and they can also fine him. 
    If he doesn't pay the fine, then he has to serve the time, but he can pay the fine at any time.

    Mr. James M. Nabrit, III 
    Yes. 
    We would in conclusion respectfully submit that this harsh stature is unconstitutionally vague. 
    The statute that allows a policeman so much scope and authority, I could paraphrase the words that Mr. Justice Jackson in another context, the issue is well, the policeman is the law or whether he is under the law. 
    This statute has no limitation to place the policeman under the law.
