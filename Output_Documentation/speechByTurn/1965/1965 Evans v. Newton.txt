    Mr. Louis F. Claiborne 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    Let me begin at the end and say a word first about the appropriate remedy as we view it in this case. 
    For our part, we have some doubt whether this Court may properly require the Georgia courts to refuse to accept the resignation of the city and to enjoin those courts from appointing substitute trustees. 
    The appropriate ruling here, we think is the Baconsfield so long as it remains essentially a public park and no matter who the trustee is, no matter who the Board manages maybe cannot exclude Negroes as such consistently with the Fourteenth Amendment. 
    Now that is not a request for an advisory opinion. 
    All the pleadings in this case and the rulings of the Georgia courts are expressly premised on the assumption that private trustees, unlike the city, will be able to effectuate the test status discriminatory purpose which the city admittedly cannot do. 
    Accordingly, the appropriate disposition here it seems to us, if the Court accepts our argument on the merits, is for the Court to declare that the park, no matter by whom it ministered, cannot be operated on a racially discriminatory basis, yo vacate the judgment below, because it is based on an incorrect premise and to remand the case to the judge of course, first affording the city an opportunity to withdraw its resignation in light of the ruling that that resignation is ineffective insofar as it permits the effectuation of the trustee's racial restriction. 
    If the city should choose not to withdraw that resignation, then the remand to afford the Georgia courts an opportunity to determine as a matter of local law whether a resignation as it were without cause, a pointless resignation, is or should be accepted a new trustee's appointment.

    Mr. Claiborne and I, perhaps you told us but I -- so I didn't get it.

    Mr. Justice Stewart, we take no position on that question. 
    We do not think it's before the Court. 
    We do not think the judgment we suggest would have any effect on that question which clearly expressly too was not passed on by the judge of courts. 
    The request of the heirs that the property be reverted to them in the event the restriction could not be carried out was not ruled on below and it seems to us cannot be ruled on here.

    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Mr. Claiborne, if I correctly understand your position, you're asking for a relief beyond that that the petitioner is asking here and you're really asking for a relief which would in effect invalidate the racial restriction in the will?
speaker="louis_f_claiborne" startTime="213.527" stopTime="234.859">
    Mr. Louis F. Claiborne 
    Mr. Justice Fortas, in their pleadings below, the petitioners did ask that the racial restriction be stricken. 
    They also asked that the cy-pres doctrine be applied by striking that racial restriction and effectuating what they view is the primary purpose of testator retained the city as trustee.

    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Well perhaps --
speaker="louis_f_claiborne" startTime="235.052" stopTime="243.624">
    Mr. Louis F. Claiborne 
    Here as I understand it, the petitioners are at least alternatively arguing for the same ruling that we think is appropriate.

    Justice Abe Fortas 
    But perhaps I misunderstood, Mr. Greenberg yesterday but as I listened to him, I thought that his position was that what this Court -- he was asking this Court to invalidate the city's resignation and the appointment of private trustees. 
    Perhaps, I was wrong about it. 
    Now as I understand it, what you're asking us to do is -- goes far beyond that and to decide that the park cannot be operated on a discriminatory basis. 
    And the question that I'm asking you is whether the net affect of that is not to invalidate the racial covenant in the will which would mean perhaps I'd like to comment on this that the question of a reversion of a property to the heirs would be academic because the net effect would be that the racial covenant would be invalidated and therefore, it would perhaps -- the result would be that there would be no reason, no occasion, no basis for a reversion of the property.
speaker="louis_f_claiborne" startTime="326.799" stopTime="354.806">
    Mr. Louis F. Claiborne 
    Mr. Justice Fortas, we don't view the ruling we suggest here as having any such effect. 
    We simply say that the Court should declare that so long as the park remains essentially a public park, it cannot discriminate on the ground of race. 
    We do not say that the heirs have no right to reversion if this condition in the will is unenforceable.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="354.806" stopTime="368.417">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    But how do you make on a public park that that reverts to the heirs, that is to say aren't those -- isn't that essentially contradictory -- you'd have to --

    We assume --

speaker="louis_f_claiborne" startTime="374.428" stopTime="398.766">
    Mr. Louis F. Claiborne 
    I will do that, Mr. Justice Fortas but as we view the reversion to the heirs, it would then cease to be a property dedicated to public uses in perpetuity, would then become the private property of the heirs to do with as they chose to use for business purposes, to subdivide as housing or otherwise to use it in nonpublic way. 
    Because if --
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="398.766" stopTime="458.412">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Well what you're doing is suggesting a different form of words but essentially the same result is that -- is that wrong, that is to say that the net effect of the relief that I understood Mr. Greenberg would be asking was that the effort by the city to convert this into some sort of a privately managed park would be invalidated. 
    Then it would be up to the state court to determine whether that invalidates the request to advice in the will. 
    And then the Court would have to determine whether it reverts to the private persons and the private heirs. 
    And as I understand you now, you're saying exactly the same thing.
speaker="louis_f_claiborne" startTime="458.412" stopTime="498.367">
    Mr. Louis F. Claiborne 
    It does come to the same thing, Mr. Justice Fortas. 
    However, we have -- we simply have doubt whether the appropriate remedy is to direct the Georgia courts to refuse his resignation. 
    For all we know, Georgia law would permit the city to resign without cause and if that is so, there is no federal question involved there. 
    If on the other hand Georgia law only permits a resignation for cause and that cause is constitutionally prohibited, then perhaps the proper solution is to bar the substitution of trustees.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="498.367" stopTime="556.280">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Well I hope you'll forgive for taking so much of your time but what is the trouble with the -- that you have with the direct approach or what seems to the petitioner at any rate I assume would be the direct approach, that is to say that the -- just to this Court to consider holding that a city is attempting to evade a constitutional duty, the constitutional duty being to operate this public facility on a – on a non-segregated basis. 
    Of course, there are a lot of problems implicit in that but it seems to me that -- that was the representation that they were making to this Court as appropriate relief. 
    I take it that you have some questions as to the power of this Court to do that?
speaker="louis_f_claiborne" startTime="556.280" stopTime="598.434">
    Mr. Louis F. Claiborne 
    We agree that the effort of the city to perpetuate segregation through its resignation if -- if that should maybe properly so viewed is an ingredient in this case, a meaningful one. 
    On the other hand, if the law of Georgia be that the city can resign for no cause then it seems to us perhaps irrelevant that their clause in this case was the bad one. 
    But our primary point is that a public park, no matter by whom operated cannot stand consistently with the Fourteenth Amendment, that racial restriction in such park cannot stand consistently with the Fourteenth Amendment.

    Mr. Louis F. Claiborne

    Justice Potter Stewart

    I suppose a person can leave a piece of property and say, “I want this property be used for a playground for colored children and administered by private trustees.” 
    I suppose that would not be unconstitutional, would it?

    Even though we're not open to any adults of any race or to any children of the White race.
speaker="louis_f_claiborne" startTime="644.151" stopTime="671.599">
    Mr. Louis F. Claiborne 
    I think it is true, Mr. Justice Stewart but the more limited the class of beneficiaries in terms of age, in terms of minority, the less public the facility and therefore the less governmental the function being exercised. 
    The less effect or impact the discrimination will have on the community as a whole and the less the Fourteenth Amendment command applies to that park. 
    Here we have essentially --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="671.599" stopTime="693.612">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    It's a matter of degree, a little less or a little more. 
    I was suggesting that the Fourteenth Amendment wouldn't apply at all in a case of a private testator who left his piece -- his vacant lot to be used as a playground for colored children and administered by private trustees. 
    Now do you think that this is a matter of the Fourteenth Amendment applying somewhat but not very much?
speaker="louis_f_claiborne" startTime="693.612" stopTime="727.539">
    Mr. Louis F. Claiborne 
    No, sir. 
    I would say that whether the Fourteenth Amendment applies at all has to be determined by looking at the character of the facility, the admissions policy whether it is generally open to the public and excludes only a very limited class or rather whether it is designed to benefit of a small class and excludes the public at large. 
    That that determination comes first and decides whether the Fourteenth Amendment command is applicable.

    I don't think that necessarily follows. One ingredient is certainly the class of beneficiaries who enjoy the facility. 
    If this is the public as a whole, that is one ingredient in making the facility a public quasi governmental facilities. 
    But there are other important critical factors, and certainly, the character of the facility, the fact that this is a park and not a business. 
    The fact that it is a large park said to be located in the city is relevant.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="818.049" stopTime="821.060">

speaker="louis_f_claiborne" startTime="821.060" stopTime="844.595">
    Mr. Louis F. Claiborne 
    Well the fact that it is free of course is relevant, that it is dedicated to public use. 
    If it's a free school, it comes close to this case. 
    If it's a school that has an admissions policy which charges tuition, which necessarily has a limited category of beneficiaries, then it may fall in the private area rather than the public sector.

    Mr. Louis F. Claiborne 
    A church very plainly is not covered by our argument. 
    There are several reasons for that. 
    First, the church does have a limited class as beneficiaries. 
    It is by definition for one sect and not for the public at large. 
    Secondly, --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="864.423" stopTime="883.076">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well yes but that's -- that just means that the -- all that means is that only a few people in the community may choose to join the church but it's open. 
    It's open that if anybody wants to join it can join it and come to this church, and come to the services the fact the public is invited all the time except one class.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Overall functions which here and there are performed by government.
speaker="louis_f_claiborne" startTime="963.911" stopTime="1029.749">
    Mr. Louis F. Claiborne 
    I don't want to pretend to resolve all of those cases. 
    I would say that the hospital case is perhaps one closer to this one. 
    Hospitals do perform an important public function which is traditionally at least today performed by government, by municipalities. 
    An orphanage may fall into the same category though it has the more limited membership. 
    Another ingredient in our case is the importance of countervailing elements of privacy -- of private choice of association where the relationship between the beneficiaries has some element of -- which may properly be left to private choice. 
    Some ingredient of a long lasting intimate relationship such as perhaps an old folk's home, one can more easily understand that the Fourteenth Amendment was not meant to follow that sort of choice of association. 
    But here --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1029.749" stopTime="1051.334">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    How about a school? 
    Can a private testator leave several million dollars for the establishment of a school for the limited to the children of impoverished Italian immigrants or what -- or would that school have to be open to everybody and break his will in order to do so?

    Mr. Louis F. Claiborne 
    I think that is a close case, Mr. Justice Stewart. 
    Again the category of beneficiaries is very limited. 
    It doesn't pretend to be a facility open to the general public. 
    On the other hand, I think as this case goes so might go the Girard College case which was open at least to all orphans within the city except Negroes. 
    Within the class, at least, there was a broad invitation to the public and I do think it's crucial that this is a charitable institution that is one that charges no admission.

    Mr. Louis F. Claiborne 
    The primary dominant characteristic of this park is that it's open generally without any discrimination to all the residents for that matter to nonresidents to the City of Macon.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1115.624" stopTime="1133.659">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well I thought that the primary -- your market as a park whether it was closed to colored people and therefore was not public, it was operated on a discriminating or discriminatory basis confined to the White race.

    Mr. Louis F. Claiborne 
    I assume that in Macon, the White race predominates and that therefore, they cons -- they constitute majority of the community. 
    In any event, the park does not discriminate on any other basis. 
    The discrimination on account of race has no legitimate justification here in terms of the proprietor's interest in selecting those who will use park or in terms of any long lasting and meaningful association between the persons who use the park.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="1170.766" stopTime="1234.489">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Mr. Claiborne, I thought that your position was that this was fairly clear situation here in terms of both the governmental and the public function that the testator intended for this park to have that is to say the fact that he left it to the Mayor and Council of the City. 
    He did not leave it to private trustees. 
    Number one and two that the intended benefit went to all -- to all White people of the City of Macon so that you had those two aspects of the testator's intention and therefore, no matter how you define it for purposes of close cases, I thought it was your position that this was a clear case involving both governmental and public aspects. 
    Am I correctly stating it?

    Mr. Louis F. Claiborne 
    That's entirely true, Mr. Justice Fortas. 
    Here it is relevant that first that Georgia provided that such trust users be administered by the city, that Senator Bacon quite naturally chose the city as his trustee which is normal for a park, normally in municipal operation. 
    It is equally relevant that the City of Macon did for 50 years administer this park as a municipal park. 
    And of course, it's relevant that the city during that administration did impose a racial restriction which is now thought to be perpetuated by quasi public -- quasi private board.

speaker="louis_f_claiborne" startTime="1790.271" stopTime="1859.509">
    Mr. Louis F. Claiborne 
    Mr. Justice Brennan I read as -- as Mr. Greenberg does the dismissal of the appeal in the second case has meaning no more than it did in the first, therefore, not as being ruling on the merits and of course, the denial of certiorari of the second case cannot be read as any decision of the merits. 
    I would say that it may have been an element in the Court's decision to deny certiorari in second case that there was a Pennsylvania statute which apparently though it was subsequently was held not to require the opening out of Girard College to all races. 
    The case perhaps seemed to be close to becoming moot. 
    I would also say that a school, unlike a park, does have more elements of privacy. 
    And a school which is restricted to orphans only is not quite as public, not quite as available to the public at large as it is the large public park like Baconsfield.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="1859.509" stopTime="1869.886">

    Mr. Louis F. Claiborne 
    That becomes a traditional object of private philanthropy. 
    It is filling a need which government cannot fill at least in the case of the church. 
    And is therefore one which it does not stand in the place of a governmental function because no government could establish a school for one church only. 
    And of course again, the class of beneficiaries is much smaller and the impact of the exclusion there is very limited. 
   
   
   
   Argument of C. Baxter Jones

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Jones.
speaker="c_baxter_jones" startTime="1917.975" stopTime="2140.307">
    Mr. C. Baxter Jones 
    Your Honors, I approach this case, arguing for the respondent essentially from the premise that what we are looking for is what can fail and be found as state action in connection with the facts of this case as disclosed by the record. 
    Accordingly, it occurs to me since there is no suggestion made and certainly no suggestion which could reasonably be made that the Court has jurisdiction except in the event of an element of state involvement that the critical and important question which we are ultimately trying to decide is just where that state involvement is. 
    And that can only be determined by a critical, accurate, and rather complete examination of the facts of the case as disclosed by the record. 
    Now the most vital and in fact the only document which is involved which does have the elements of a contract is of course the will of Senator Bacon. 
    And it seems to me that the first thing I would like to approach is that which is suggested by Mr. Claiborne's opening remarks in which he places emphasis upon the fact that this was a public place equating it I suppose in some sense to governmental operations and I have assumed that that contention having full made was more less based upon inferences that might be drawn from the Marsh versus Alabama decision. 
    There is of course a vital difference there and irrespective of Marsh, it maybe that viewing a public park in the charitable sense, simply by itself and without relation doing a precedent, it maybe that this Court would reach the same conclusion here that they did in Marsh. 
    But of course, the Court is entirely aware that in the Marsh case, we were dealing with a community which I believe Mr. Justice Frankfurter in a concurring opinion, stated to be a town as might so as in the other town that is slangily expressed by me, a town is a town and that is that. 
    But in the Marsh case, the language in the majority opinion clearly discloses the broad ambit of community life which was carried on there with shops, [Inaudible] building run into the post office department were used by the United States government, the delivery of mail involving so far a -- the -- the complete orbit of community life as to constitute it a governmental operation in the same sense that a town chartered by the State would be so considered.

    Yes sir.

    Mr. C. Baxter Jones 
    No sir, I -- I really appreciate that question because at an appropriate time, I was going take some exception to remarks about -- I'll do it right now. 
    I'd like to do it right now. 
    A statement has been made; I think rather glibly and a little bit carelessly that the city has administered this park. 
    The truth of the business is that the city has never had any connection with this park of any sort or character except to hold a legal, naked title as trustee. 
    The will in the most pointed language provides for the appointment of a Board of Managers. 
    It says in words which are comprehensive and complete that the Board of Managers shall have a complete, the unrestricted, the unrestrained, control, management, maintenance of the park entirely free from any interference, I believe substantially those words being used and the will set up funds of which would produce an income to maintain its operation. 
    Now --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="2215.392" stopTime="2217.527">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    You say managers, who were the managers?
speaker="c_baxter_jones" startTime="2217.527" stopTime="2311.066">
    Mr. C. Baxter Jones 
    The Board of Managers was seven persons to be appointed under the will as a Board of Managers in the first instance by the City of Macon. 
    I said that they had never had anything to do with it except to hold the Macon title, I was going to add and accept the purely ministerial function of selecting and naming the original Board of Managers and thereafter filling vacancies on recommendation of the Board of Managers or remaining members of the Board of Managers itself. 
    That is a function which obviously the executor could have performed himself in the first instance by himself selecting the members he wanted to serve on this Board of Managers or he might have delegated that to the executor or to the private trustees who had the property for sometime before it passed interest to the city. 
    But it actually was a function delegated to the City of Macon or their successors, or their successors and trust I believe the exact language is. 
    So that it was -- it was a -- a ministerial function vested by the senator in his will in the City of Macon or the trustee who might succeed the City of Macon. 
    That -- that's what I'm trying to say is the extent to which the City of Macon has administered this trust. (Voice Overlap)

    In other words as I've read this and perhaps I'm wrong, as I read this it's not only the initial Board of Managers, but the subsequent boards were to be appointed by the Mayor and the City Council. 
    And when the will refers to their successors that is to say the successors of the Mayor and the City Council, it meant the people holding those official positions.

    If I could -- I could -- I could get on the street by the side of it, but it was completely barricaded and restricted so far as my coming in is concerned. 
    And of course that not suggesting a racial discrimination at all, but I -- I don't see that the fact that there is a street which divides portions of the park which is completely open to the public and which is not controlled -- which are not controlled in any way, shape or manner affects the question of the constitutional question which we are --

    And that -- that -- that brings me, if Your Honor please, to a point that I did want to emphasize. 
    If -- if the -- well to begin with and going back one step, in the state courts where these case originated where it was before it came here, there was never at any time emphasis placed upon the fact that this was in the nature of a public facility. 
    The emphasis was placed upon this city and the legislative influence upon that and to the extent that it's all participation, but the significance of that is that there was absolutely nothing in the record put there by either side presenting the character, the physical character of this park. 
    The actual use that was made of it such as it seems to me would be essential when this Court is now asked to say that it's a park of such magnitude and such importance and vital significance in the life of the whole community of Macon that it stems itself completely as something completely different from the ordinary public charity which is more private in which it's restricted to less people.

    I wouldn't think so, if Your Honor please, if it was merely for the use of those who were using the park, they could have been made private lands and could -- would not have been within the city's jurisdiction at all. 
    Actually, the -- one street which is a significant -- well to begin with, when the will was drawn, the park laid partly on the side of one major -- one street which is now a major, east west boulevard in the city so that the park itself was already separated by a public street and that was always a public street. 
    But then another street is – goes through the park -- a park which is used by people coming in, in any direction and going to another direction just purely to travel. 
    And that street, when it was open and its use was allowed for that purpose, did become a public street.

    Mr. C. Baxter Jones 
    Yes, may I -- may I anticipate your question or may I answer that specific question? 
    Under the will, the property is described by courses by boundary courses and distances.

    However, may I add this? 
    They made reference in their brief to an interstate highway that runs through it and they attach a map of the City of Macon which does give us a picturization of the park in some measure. 
    This interstate highway was taken by the highway department as part of the nice little expressway system. 
    It's a non-access highway. 
    It contains, according to computations which can easily be made. 
    Itself over 25 acres, it sentence -- separates and assess all between it and the banks of the river which is referred to another 25 acres which is bottom land, which has never been used for park purpose which now actually, is not available for park purposes. 
    There is also another 10 or 15 acres on the south side of Spring Street which is the commercial part of it, leaving actually 40 acres which is park land.

    Mr. C. Baxter Jones 
    I don't think so Your Honor. 
    I would be shocked to find that something had been done that were preclude it. 
    They -- the -- the heirs came in at a stage while this case was pending and actually came in in support of the charity that is it came in to lend weight of their support to the charity and to the preservation of the park as a charity within the terms of the Senator's will, but they say it alternatively that if it could not be operated for the purposes and for the benefits expressed in Senator Bacon's will then they would -- they wanted to exercise their power of reversion. 
    Well when the Court accepted the resignation of the city as trustee and appointed successor trustees, that at least for the time being satisfied any question which the -- which the heirs had raised in there and left nothing, the Court says specifically that since they've got what they asked for insofar as this Court is concerned, that question is not that for decision, so no decision has been made about it at all and that was the posture in which it left the Supreme Court of Georgia there also --

    Mr. C. Baxter Jones 
    If they have said that it might, they -- they did not. 
    In the Supreme Court of Georgia they -- plaintiffs -- the interevenors in the lower court and the petitioners in this Court asserted that the Trial court should have applied the supra section of the Georgia Court that when a charitable request is incapable of some reason of this -- is incapable for some reason of the exact execution and the exact manner provided by the testator, a court of equity will carry it into effect in such way as nearly as possible to effect his intention. 
    The first answer was that the application was not invoked in the second case and then they said there was no testimony in the record of any nature or character that the Board of Managers provided by the will -- the Board of Managers provided by the will into then situation could not operate the park pursuant to the terms and conditions of the will that was --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="4482.644" stopTime="4493.441">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well what do you think the attitude that Georgia Court's was in regard to the resignation that it was required because of the restriction in the will or that the city was just up for the resigning.
speaker="c_baxter_jones" startTime="4493.441" stopTime="4521.457">
    Mr. C. Baxter Jones 
    No. 
    The contention was made that they couldn't resign because the will made it mandatory that they remain trustees perpetually and forever, notwithstanding the references to their successes and trust. 
    The Court said that -- it wasn't necessary to decide that question. 
    The simple fact was they had resigned and that having resigned, it was the duty and function of the trial court to appoint successors to the trustees. 
    That's all they said about that.

    In view of the several questions that have been asked about the Girard litigation and also because of the fact that it was referred to by the Supreme Court of Georgia and has been felt throughout this litigation to be of significance, I would like to comment briefly about the further proceedings in particular that took place following the 1957 decision by this Court in the first Girard case. 
    Your Honors recall of course that Mr. Girard died in 1831 living the sum of $2 million in trust for a college for four male White orphans that the college was subsequently established in 1948 that the City of Philadelphia first served as trustee but subsequently, the Pennsylvania legislature created a Board of City Trust which in 1869 succeeded to that function and served thereafter continuously until the time of this litigation. 
    Also that that Board included the Mayor of Philadelphia, the president of City Council and various private citizens. 
    After this Court held in 1957, that the application of two Negro orphans who were otherwise fully qualified could not be denied solely because of race with the Board as a city agency serving as trustee. 
    It was then amended by this Court for further proceedings below not inconsistent with that opinion. 
    I would like to deviate at that point and make the observation that prior to the case reaching this Court in 1957 the part had been made very strongly both in the Orphans' Court of Philadelphia where the litigation originated and later in the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania that in the event that it was ruled that the Board of City Trust could not continue constitutionally to carry out the intention manifested in Girard will that then would become necessary that substituted trustees be appointed for that purpose, so that that contention was a -- a question which existed in the litigation almost from the very outset. 
    Following the remand by this Court, the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania then remanded the case to the orphans' court also for further proceedings not inconsistent with that opinion. 
    The Court will recall that the orphans' court after delay of some two months, removed the Board of City Trust as trustee and appointed as substituted to trustees 13 private persons, six of them incidentally had up until that time served on the Board of City Trust. 
    It dismissed the application of the two Negro orphans. 
    Both the city and the State Pennsylvania and the applicants then appealed to the Supreme Court Pennsylvania. 
    Our view of the briefs that were filed in that litigation has impressed us very much that virtually, every contention which is made in the present litigation was made in a most forceful amount in the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania. 
    Now that court ruled that Steven Girard had a constitutional right of property in the execution of his testamentary benefaction that the trust was a private one, that the orphans' court had the inherent power to remove the trustee and that there was not discrimination. 
    We attach considerable significance subsequently ruling by this Court in denying the appeal and in dismissing the appeal and denying the application for certiorari for several reasons, among the them being that the matter of substituted trustees have been an extremely important consideration from the very outset of litigation and particularly of course in the orphans' court and in the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania. 
    It's seems to us Your Honor that the conclusion by this Court that there was not such a case that would justify further review on certiorari was widely interpreted at the time and certainly it seems to us by the Supreme Court of Georgia in this case as being most significant decision. 
    Again, I would point out to this Court that almost to every contention that was made in the present case at any stage of litigation was made in the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania and in the record that came to this case in second Girard. 
    It was contended for example that Girard's primary object was trusteeship by the city rather than the establishment of a college for four male White orphans. 
    That contention was rejected in the very extensive decision by the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania. 
    We would point out that in the present case this deals with one point that was raised earlier. 
    That there is the use of language in item nine of Senator Bacon's will, following the naming of the Mayor and Council or their successors and trust. 
    There is a provision to the effect that in the event that the city could not serve as trustee that the city would be authorize to a point a trustee, presumably a private person to function in that capacity. 
    The fact that a designation of the body to appoint, the initial Board of Managers and the approval of subsequent nominees for that office was designated as the Mayor and Council and then the language or their successors powers, certainly illustrates to us that the word successors were not necessary as referring to the Mayor and Council because that was the correct corporate name of the City of Macon at that time and certainly manifested the intention or contemplation on the part of the testator that a trustee other than the City of Macon might serve in that capacity. 
    The point was also made most forcefully in that litigation that after a 126 years of exceedingly active state and city participation in the administration of the trust, the Girard College had become a public institution so that even if the board of trust should be replaced as trustee, it remained such a public institution as would cause the Fourteen Amendment to continue to be applicable and to forbid discrimination in carrying out the testimator's scheme.

    hat is not the exact procedure of course, it was followed in this instance but I cite it because it certainly evidence to contemplation on the part of the testator that the city it might not always serve as trustee and that it might become necessary that a successor trustee be appointed.

speaker="frank_c_jones" startTime="5349.693" stopTime="5394.237">
    Mr. Frank C. Jones 
    Yes Your Honor and the other language that I refer to or their successors appears in the item nine on page 19 of the record where the statement is made. 
    The members of this Board shall first be selected and appointed by the Mayor and Council of the City of Macon or by their successors in trust. 
    My point is that since the Mayor and Council of the city of Macon was the correct corporate name of the City of Macon, there was no necessity for that following language to be used to refer to their particular successors as persons. 
    And that the language evidences the contemplation on the part the testator that someone other than the Mayor and Council at any particular time might succeed as trustee.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="5394.237" stopTime="5426.242">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well wouldn't that language on the top of page 19 that conflicts with that a little, that says “It is my will that all right, title and interest in and to a said property herein before described and founded both legal and equitable including all remainders in reverse in every estate in the same of whatsoever kind so thereupon passed in and belong to the Mayor and Council of the City of Macon and to their successors forever.”
speaker="frank_c_jones" startTime="5426.242" stopTime="5598.834">
    Mr. Frank C. Jones 
    Your Honor, I don't think so. 
    I would make the observation; first of all, that that's customarily language are used in Georgia trust instruments and secondly, the language and to their successors forever is capable of either of two constructions. 
    First of all, the particular persons who might succeed as the Mayor and the members of Council or to whoever might say other than the Mayor and Council as trustee. 
    And it seems to me that then the further reference in that same item to -- or to their successors and the particular reference in item 10 to the selection by the city itself of a successor trustee makes clear that Senator Bacon definitely contemplated the possibility that someone other than the Mayor and Council might serve in that capacity. 
    Your Honor, I was making that point that in the Girard litigation, the second Girard case both in the courts of Pennsylvania and in the record in this Court, the point was made most forcefully that because of 126 years of active operation and administration by the city and state, the growth of the $2 million fund to a $100 million, the growth of the college saw that there was an enrollment of over 1000 and all of the many facets of state and -- city and state relationship including the existence of some five different Pennsylvania statutes on the subject. 
    The Girard College had become a public institution and that the mere replacement of the trustee could not change its essentially public character. 
    That contention was rejected most forcefully by the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania. 
    The point was made that merely because they had been put on in a skillful management of the trust by the Board of Trust will not change its essential character that it was created as a private charity although it had certain public characteristics of course and that it remained so and despite the fact of that statutory or framework which had come in to existence in the other matters which it mentioned. 
    Again, I would deviate at this point to make the point which we feel is most important that the degree of city and state connection with Baconsfield park has been exceedingly limited, far less significant and existed in Girard case, really being confined as we see it to first of all, the meaning of the city as the naked legal trustee and secondly to giving the right to the city initially to name the Board of Managers and subsequently to approve nominations to the Board with no further rights and when the City of Macon resigned as trustee, as we see it, there was a complete severance of any further city or state connection in the relationship with Baconsfield Park.

    Mr. Frank C. Jones 
    Your Honor that is not my understanding. 
    I cannot speak authoritatively other than what has come to me second hand, but it is my understanding that at the present time, it's still being operated as it was in 1957 and that the same policy which existed in 1957 and which caused that litigation to come to this Court is still the policy at Girard College and admission is being limited to full male white orphans. 
    Your Honor, there are a great many other arguments that were made in Girard including the contended application of Shelley versus Kraemer in other cases that in the interest of time, I won't undertake to treat them in the oral argument because we have covered those matters in our brief. 
    I would though in concluding my remarks like to make the point that we are unable to distinguish between the Girard situation and the Baconsfield situation.

    Mr. Frank C. Jones 
    Your Honor, I have read the brief that was filed in opposition to the appeal in the certiorari in second Girard and I'm aware that a number of different reasons partly jurisdictional, partly otherwise were asserted as to why the appeal should not be entertained by this Court and should be dismissed. 
    I of course have no personal knowledge of what particular reason may have impressed the Court as being the best one or be best ones and as to why the appeal would dismissed. 
    However, as far as the denial of certiorari is concerned, I do attach great significance to that and I think national significance has been attached to it. 
    I know the Supreme Court of Georgia attached significance.

    Well ordinarily, our cases have suggested that the denial of certiorari really -- if it doesn't mean precisely nothing at least it doesn't mean necessarily or it's all approval of the decision which we refuse to review, but we have here the complication that there was a dismissal except what I have suggested the significance with the denial of certiorari.

    Your Honor, quite frankly, I won't be able to answer that question because the only thing that has come to my attention is the fact that a number of different grounds for dismissal raised by the respondents in that case including the fact that there was no Pennsylvania statute, the constitutionality of which had been brought an issue in the lower Court proceedings.

    Mr. Frank C. Jones 
    The significance that I was seeking to attach to the action of this Court in the second Girard case was that both the Orphans' Court and the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania were under the mandate of this Court that their further proceeding should not be inconsistent with the first 1957 opinion of this Court and in as much as both before the first opinion of this Court in 1957 and thereafter, it had been in a most forceful way brought out that the Board of City Trust would if necessary be removed as trustee and the private trustees would be appointed for the express purpose of carrying out the restriction contained in Mr. Girard's will. 
    It seems to me that that is the reason why the denial of certiorari carried unusual significance as far as its interpretation is concerned. 
    Your Honor, I believe my time is up and I would say simply in conclusion that we believe that there is such a total lack of state involvement following the resignation of the city which was accepted as a matter of state law as we interpret the Supreme Court of Georgia decision that there is no reason why the provisions of Senator Bacon's will could not be carried out as a private charity. 
    We think that to rule otherwise would take the props completely out from under the Girard Collage situation and would affect as previous questions of this Court have suggested when posed to Mr. Claiborne not only a park and a collage but many, many other forms of private charities as well. 
   
   
   
   Argument of Jack Greenberg
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="5916.862" stopTime="5918.217">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Greenberg.
speaker="jack_greenberg" startTime="5918.217" stopTime="6017.611">
    Mr. Jack Greenberg 
    May it please the Court. 
    I would like to emphasize something which was touched upon in the various arguments following mine and that is there's an aspect of this case that is overlooked when people talk about whether a private individual can segregate on his property or even can a private trust segregate or even can a -- ones heirs be required to segregate and that is the aspect of perpetuity. 
    This charitable trust has been endowed by the State of Georgia with a quality that private property transactions normally don't possess. 
    The Congress of the United States has passed the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the nation has acquiesced in this and has endorsed it and then there has been the Civil Rights Act of 1965 and I imagine the time that will not be far from now in the State of Georgia and the City of Macon may have comparable legislation and indeed may have a comparable spirit among the people which won't require any legislation. 
    And if this were a private property transaction or these merely were a private trust in time, the dead-hand of the testator would be removed from it and people would change their minds and local and national laws perhaps could be able to affect it. 
    But we have here a situation in which when everything else has changed in the City of Macon both in law and in the hearts of the people, the dead-hand of this testator will remain in Baconsfield if the contentions of the respondents are right will forever remain a segregated park ultimately by operation of the law of charitable trust of the State of Georgia.

    But the point I've been --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="6033.642" stopTime="6044.083">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Not only this charitable trust but all the charitable trust. 
    I thought I don't know the laws of 50 states and I presume you don't either but I thought that this was a characteristic of a charitable trust.
speaker="jack_greenberg" startTime="6044.083" stopTime="6060.070">
    Mr. Jack Greenberg 
    That -- that is correct. 
    But when we get for the racial aspect of it, we would submit that the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution supersedes that and various state constitutions might superseded as well so far as a racial restriction being enforced by the state through the law of charitable trust.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="6060.070" stopTime="6072.220">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    But the Fourteenth Amendment doesn't say anything about race at all.

    Mr. Justice Stewart --

speaker="jack_greenberg" startTime="6075.480" stopTime="6110.058">
    Mr. Jack Greenberg 
    Of course that type of question arises time and time again in cases in which an objection is made to racial segregation being enforced in some sense by the state. 
    And I believe the answer to that of course is what was stated in the Slaughter House cases and elsewhere that the primary and the fundamental purpose of the Fourteenth Amendment was to strike down racial discrimination and while of course it radiates elsewhere and deals with other things different questions of reasonableness in degree and countervailing considerations are taken into effect, but when we're dealing with race and the state has its hand and its out that would be my answer to that.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="6110.058" stopTime="6125.506">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well surely if the state -- if this is the state public governmental functional what you say is correct about race. 
    I would suppose it would also be true that you couldn't have a park for Protestants only or for Jewish people only and so I'm suggesting only that the -- the --
speaker="jack_greenberg" startTime="6125.506" stopTime="6257.913">
    Mr. Jack Greenberg 
    Well I would say that's correct, but of course then we get to the religious cases and I certainly don't want to get into that problem. 
    But different considerations are then taken into account when you deal with those other kinds of problems. 
    This of course is -- is not merely a question of the charitable trust because here we were faced with the situation in which the senator had two incompatible irreconcilable desires set forth in his will. 
    On the one hand, he wanted public trusteeship and that was very clear, that was just not a fleeting thought that he had and said, gee, you know, perhaps we ought to have a public trustee. 
    He set this forth a number of times as to the realty, as to the personality and then if the city by its charter and he had this in mind, fit the city by a charter or unable to serve the city would then appoint the private trustee or some other trustee and then not merely appoint it but the city council who laid down rules and regulations under which this new trustee would function, so public control is a matter of very great concern to him. 
    And if on the one hand we have this deep interest in public control and in the other hand we have this deep concern for racial segregation, the Court was not enforcing the private will of the testator, it was making a choice between two incompatible wills and that was the action of the Court. 
    This is quite unlike Shelley against Kraemer where there was just a single univalent will of a -- of a -- of a property owner. 
    This was a case in which there were two incompatible wills and indeed the will to segregate was infected by the state action legislation that Section 69-504 that I talked about a great deal yesterday. 
    So how this can be viewed as a simple, private property matter in which a living person does something with the part of land that he owns during his lifetime without regard to the state either controlling it forever into all time or without regard to the state influencing him or selecting racial segregation as against another equally strongly expressed desire escapes to me. This is a question of state action from beginning to end.

    Yes. 
    The Court made a choice -- the Court made a choice between two incompatible desires and the desire to segregate cannot as a matter of law be considered as a personal desire merely stemming out of his own heart and mind. 
    It was infected by Section 69-504 which would have influenced any careful lawyer to set up the will in this kind of way and perhaps even encourage Bacon to make this kind of will.

    We've been unable to find any, our opponents haven't suggested any that you could set up a will either by dedication or by trust or rather a part by dedication and trust and in any event, but for the statute he could not have set -- set up this kind of will. 
    We respectfully submit that the judgment below should be reversed and I state that not merely in a formal stance, but the judgment below is the judgment that excepted the resignation of the city as a trustee if that were reversed, we would be in a situation which the Constitution would be satisfied and the intervenors would be able to freely use the Court in accordance with the Constitution.
