    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    -- et al, petitioners versus Lincoln W. Mulkey et al. 
    Mr Wirin.
speaker="a_l_wirin" startTime="10.282" stopTime="327.635">
    Mr. A. L. Wirin 
    Chief Justice, may it please Your Honors. 
    I address myself first to answer an inquiry put to Mr. Pruitt by the Chief Justice and by Justice Fortas as to whether or not the provision which we are challenging that we challenged below, Section 26 of the California Constitution, includes or encompasses persons who determine to discriminate in the sale or rental of housing because of race based upon agreement with others, particularly agreements in the nature of restrictive covenants. 
    My answer to the question of Your Honors is different from that given to you by Mr. Pruitt. 
    The text of Section 26 appears as an appendix to the brief for the petitioners as do the valid arguments which were submitted to the voters in California. 
    The first sheet or page in the appendix, right after the blue sheet from the brief for the petitioners contains the text of Section 26. 
    Your Honors will find that the brief for the petitioners and the brief for respondents may carry the similar colors but they're quite different in thrust and in import so far as the arguments presented are concerned. 
    This is called brief for petitioners and it has an appendix following a little blue sheet and the critical or significant provisions of this -- of this entire section is in the first paragraph and I merely refer to the last sentence in the first paragraph and to the phrase, “In his absolute discretion.” 
    And it seems to me that a reading of that phrase stated as broadly as I think the English language permits in his absolute discretion, would certainly include an individual who in his own absolute discretion undertakes voluntarily to arrive in the -- to arrive an agreement with others. 
    All of whom voluntarily agree to discriminate in housing because of race and thus the restrictive covenant. 
    So, it seems to me that a reading of a provision on its face, moreover Your Honors, we challenged below and the court below was of the view that Section 26 is unconstitutional on its face. 
    Therefore, it seems to me what the provision says on its face is -- it is the first consideration. 
    Additionally Your Honors, this section, Section 26 in the fourth paragraph which is the last paragraph on the same sheet, undertakes with precision to carve out certain exemptions. 
    These exemptions are with respect to the obtaining of property by eminent domain and with respect to accommodations for transients. 
    So, when the writers of this provision intended to make exemptions, they were able to and succeeded in setting forth those exemptions with precision, no exemption so far as the unlimited, unrestrained, uncontrolled by the courts, authority of the individual to exercise his absolute discretion no matter the circumstances or the considerations which entered into his -- his own discretion. 
    No such limitation appears on the face of the -- of the section. 
    Moreover Your Honors, I've stated Your Honors that the valid arguments are contained in this -- in this appendix. 
    Your Honors will find nothing in the valid -- valid arguments which suggest any such exemption for persons who determine to discriminate in their absolute discretion based upon such agreements. 
    And finally as to this narrow point, narrow or broad, in addition to the formal arguments which were submitted to the voters on -- to the voters, valid arguments and distributed by the Secretary of State which are attached as part of the appendix to the brief for the petitioners. 
    There is an extended brief by one of amici, namely the United Auto Workers Union and I -- I state simply quickly for Your Honors' guidance, if it is, that attached as appendices to that brief, it is the gray brief, motion for -- by the United Auto Workers. 
    There are arguments made to the voters perhaps informally, but nonetheless circulated by the California Real Estate Association and its subordinate organizations, distributed and circulated by that organization to the voters stating the purpose and the meaning of Section 26. 
    And nowhere in any of the arguments presented to the voters, even informally is there any suggestion that the limitation suggested by Mr. Pruitt maybe -- maybe read into this section.

    Justice Byron R. White 
    And furthermore Section 26 would seem to me that at least you can make an argument that Section 26 itself would bar the courts, would bar the courts from enforcing the remedy, again enforcing the contract against him because now it's not in his unfettered will. 
    I mean to enforce it would interfere with his right to sell as he saw fit.

    Mr. A. L. Wirin 
    I think it does though.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="495.070" stopTime="495.525">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Do you?
speaker="a_l_wirin" startTime="495.525" stopTime="545.579">
    Mr. A. L. Wirin 
    Now in this way. 
    If he changes his mind and decides not to remain a member of this -- not abide by the agreement which he made, he has a right to do that under this. 
    But if he decides to adhere to the provisions of the agreement, it seems to me because Section 26 broadsidedly prohibits any agency of the State of California which includes a judge thereon from inquiring into the nature of or the basis for the exercise of absolute discretion by the individual. 
    It seems to me that in such a circumstance, a court under this -- this provision is foreclosed from inquiring into the existence of an agreement or the nature of the agreement or whether or not the individual discriminates because of the agreement.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="545.579" stopTime="550.615">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    The courts foreclosed from either -- and foresee it or -- or the contrary?
speaker="a_l_wirin" startTime="550.615" stopTime="805.641">
    Mr. A. L. Wirin 
    Yes, yes, and of course my -- my complaint is that it is foreclosed in the contrary. 
    Now in additionally Your Honors, Mr. Pruitt stated to you to the Court yesterday that it was his view that this provision applies to what he called individual action, the exercise of discretion by the individual and does not apply to action in -- by individuals acting in concert, kind of a corollary to the problem of persons agreeing in connection to -- to have restrictive covenants. 
    Now here again Your Honors, there is nothing on the face of Section 26 since on the face of it, it provides that an individual may exercise his absolute discretion in determining whether or not to discriminate because of race. 
    There is nothing in that section which bars an individual from cooperating with others, in concert or otherwise, in effectuating racial discrimination. 
    And there is not -- there is no such exception in the -- in the Section 26 and no such exception is suggested in the valid arguments and no such exception is suggested by the California Real Estate Association to sponsor for this proposal in the arguments made which were distributed to the voters which as I have indicated are next to the brief of the Auto Workers Union. 
    Now moreover, if I may say so to Your Honors, if it is true, if Mr. Pruitt is correct in his statement to this Court, that this provision, Section 26, does not affect persons engaging in discrimination or -- as a result of acting in concert, then Your Honors are confronted with the following situation. 
    The judgment of the Supreme Court of California and Your Honor, this Court reviews judgments. 
    That judgment merely ordered reverse the judgment of the Superior Court of Orange County. 
    That judgment barred the plaintiff from having a trial on his complaint on the ground that the courts of California by Section 26 were barred from -- from permitting any relief in connection with alleged racial discrimination. 
    Now Your Honors will find in the record at page 4, the complaint which the trial court ruled, stated no cause of action and accorded no right to power, the Court to grant relief and particularly paragraph 8 of the complaint. 
    And Your Honors will find that in paragraph 8 at page 4 of the Reitman, of the multi-complaint against Reitman. 
    He alleges not only acts of discrimination by the owners and by the -- by the Reitman. 
    He alleges that the discrimination which the defendants participated in is also practiced by other real estate brokers and home and landowners and so forth and owners -- in Orange County and throughout California. 
    Now it may be this complaint does -- certainly this complaint doesn't use the word concert, but it certainly undertakes to allege the actions of others as constituting a practice. 
    That means that a practice often is engaged in -- when persons act in concert. 
    So, therefore, if Your Honors accept the view of counsel for the petitioners that Section 26 does not apply to action in concert and since the cases here merely as a result of a sustaining of a motion to dismiss as it were by the trial court, minimally, it is my argument, this Court should affirm the judgment of the Supreme Court of California or dismiss the petition as -- as a -- I guess the phrase is improvidently granted or whatever it is. 
    But now I turn to --

    Unknown Speaker 
    (Inaudible)
speaker="a_l_wirin" startTime="807.448" stopTime="926.306">
    Mr. A. L. Wirin 
    Oh, one further matter that I want to mention quickly in that connection. 
    Mr. Pruitt has gone off the record.I make no criticism on it. 
    That the apartment building involved in the Reitman case had 10 units. 
    In fact I have checked on it and he is correct, but moreover, the complaint alleges that the Reitmans owned -- well, he didn't say this exactly -- virtually says it, have owned other apartment buildings and I am informed and I say this for what it is worth in the Court that the Reitmans, the petitioners here and defendants below are a large institution owning and managing numerous apartment houses in Orange County and constitute one of the largest apartment house owners and operators in Orange County. 
    Now I say this to you Your Honors simply to say that if Your Honors were to follow my argument and affirm the judgment of the -- of the Supreme Court of California, the effect would be merely to permit the plaintiffs to proceed with proof of their complaint including paragraph 8 in the complaint and maybe they can prove what I have just said to Your Honors, I believe are the facts. 
    Now I turn however to what I think is the critical issue in this case and that is whether or not Section 26, both on its face and in terms of its legislative history is no more than a repeal of earlier provisions of state law, whether or not in adopting Section 26, California played the role of neutrality, I think the phrase this Court has used, Mr Justice White has used is the role of strict neutrality.

    Mr. A. L. Wirin 
    All right then. 
    I'm going to answer Your Honor's question now in -- in -- with some -- with some detail if I may. 
    Indeed, I was going to say now and I will state that I want to discuss the -- the phrase which you used Mr. Justice Black, namely whether or not a state is barred by the Fourteenth Amendment from remaining (Inaudible), from doing nothing, from hitting his hands off of and playing no role in the matter of racial discrimination. 
    Now my answer to Your Honor is that a state is not barred by the Fourteenth Amendment from playing that role assuming the point, if that is -- if that is strictly the role which it placed.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="998.511" stopTime="1003.622">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    How about Shelley and Kraemer?
speaker="a_l_wirin" startTime="1003.622" stopTime="1041.670">
    Mr. A. L. Wirin 
    Well in Shelley versus Kraemer, there was affirmative action. 
    There was affirmative action by the courts which was considered to be a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. 
    Of course I don't -- I don't argue with that case at all, but what I'm saying is -- I'm not discussing whether or not private action or whether they may be relieved from private action or against private action of the courts. 
    I'm merely stating that if a state does not put its thumb on the scales, that it in actual realistic fact it plays the role of strict neutrality.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1041.670" stopTime="1047.569">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Which it did in Shelley and Kraemer because it didn't -- any of the policy or one way or the other.
speaker="a_l_wirin" startTime="1047.569" stopTime="1048.217">
    Mr. A. L. Wirin 
    It --

    Which is a private contract?
speaker="a_l_wirin" startTime="1049.660" stopTime="1072.867">
    Mr. A. L. Wirin 
    Yes. 
    But if, namely, the State of California through its courts undertook to enforce that private contract, and to that extent, there was state involvement and I -- so I'm trying not to reach that question until -- until a little bit later because I want to -- if I can and I can agree with Mr. Justice Black and that others -- members of the Court --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1072.867" stopTime="1074.408">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Mr. Wirin, I was trying to help you in that --
speaker="a_l_wirin" startTime="1074.408" stopTime="1074.948">
    Mr. A. L. Wirin 
    I know you are.

    Mr. A. L. Wirin 
    I know you are. 
    But I'm trying to convince Mr. Justice Black and I -- this will be the first time that I think I'm having difficulty in doing so, but there's always a first time Your Honor. 
    And so I'm saying and I'm willing to rest with the statement that if a state is strictly neutral in fact and in reality that then discrimination by a private person, no matter his motive, no matter how venal his motive, no matter how racist or bigoted he is, it is no concern of the Fourteenth Amendment. 
    Let me say that arguendo or -- or otherwise, but it is our position that California has done more than that in this case. 
    Now I'm trying to begin to answer Mr. Justice Black's question. 
    Now quickly it is arguable and we might be willing to concede. 
    But prior to 1959, a person in California could refuse to sell property, including residential property which he operated as a business and this was no violation of the -- of anything under the Fourteenth Amendment. 
    Concededly also, the State of California entered upon the scene in connection with housing in 1959 where it is up to the law which prohibited discrimination in business establishments which included the business of rental of premises and in --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1179.894" stopTime="1183.078">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    (Inaudible) in the Fourteenth Amendment?
speaker="a_l_wirin" startTime="1183.078" stopTime="1285.965">
    Mr. A. L. Wirin 
    No, not at all, not at all. 
    This was something that the State of California could do and it did do, not under compulsion of Fourteenth Amendment and then not under compulsion of Fourteenth Amendment, the Legislature of California determined to do something more than did the 1959 Act, known as the Unruh Act and specifically protect persons from other persons so far as discrimination in housing, in residential housing is concerned and it did that in the other way. 
    All right, this is 19 -- 1963. 
    Now California through its legislature, either the legislature convening in Sacramento or the so-called super legislature, the people of California which under the California Constitution have a right to exercise the power, the equivalent of a legislature, so-called a super legislature. 
    California had a choice Your Honors. 
    There was Unruh, there was Rumford and the California Legislature might have repealed those provisions, if it had, we wouldn't be here. 
    In California, the people didn't have to wait on the legislature because there is a provision for the initiative and referendum and so dissatisfied with the action of the legislature, the people of California had some choices. 
    The people of California by referendum could have repealed Unruh and Rumford. 
    Had the people of California merely repealed Unruh and Rumford, we wouldn't be here and this isn't that case.

    Mr. A. L. Wirin 
    But Mr. Justice Brennan I -- I want to say -- I want to argue to the Court that our -- that the legislative history of this proposal which -- which is called to your attention in our briefs as well as the face of this proposal demonstrates that it is affirmative action and not merely a repeal. 
    And I also want to state Your Honors having -- I indicated to you Your Honors that the Supreme Court of California used -- was of the view that this provision encouraged discrimination. 
    In the Snyder case, the record is to the effect. 
    Mr. and Mrs. Prendergast were Caucasian and Negro. 
    The record is to the effect, it is alleged in the complaint by them. 
    There is no denial by the defendant that the effort to oust them from the premises which they had theretofore lawfully -- lawfully possessed came after the adoption of Proposition 14 of Section 26. 
    So there's something in the record from which the Supreme Court of California could have inferred that the effect of the adoption of Section 26 was to encourage even in -- even in that very case the taking of the measures which were taken by the parties in that case, but more than that and additionally, I was saying to Your Honors that had California and the voters of California and the California Real Estate Association wanted merely a repeal. 
    They could have achieved their repeal by the voters of California under the provision in the California Constitution which is Article 4 which provides for the initiative and referendum by a referendum. 
    This is how a repeal is achieved, an initiative in California is more than a referendum. 
    It is more than a repeal. 
    It is an effort affirmatively to enact some -- some new provision of law.

    Mr. A. L. Wirin 
    No, if the people put it into an initiative, only the people can change it. 
    If they put it into a referendum, either the legislature or the people can change it. 
    But let me conclude this point with this further observation. 
    Had this been an initiative which was written into a statute of California, they still would be required another initiative in order to get rid of it. 
    Why then Your Honors and I ask this in parallel to the questions, was this provision written into the Constitution of California? 
    Why was it put into Article 1 of the Constitution of California which is the Declaration of Rights of California? 
    Because it was intended by those who wanted it to elevate the right of discrimination into a constitutional right. 
    Now when a matter becomes one of constitutional right as for example when the right of freedom of speech is provided for in a constitution, it is intended and expected that it will encourage persons to exercise freedom of speech.And when a provision is enshrined in a state constitution, it is intended and in my opinion has the inevitably effect of encouraging persons to engage in the discrimination which is affirmatively sanctioned. 
    Now one final word --
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="1861.067" stopTime="1968.493">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Well by this -- excuse me Mr. Wirin, but by this action the people of California, I suppose it's arguable, have removed from the ordinary legislative process, this subject of legislation in the field of discrimination with respect to rental, lease, or sale of property. 
    And they have similarly, if I understand the argument, have removed that subject from the jurisdiction of their courts. 
    Now the question is, whether that removal of this subject from the ordinary state processes is state action within the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment. 
    It seemed -- it seemed to me that that is one of the questions here now. 
    Now, perhaps similarly I suppose that if the Federal Government passed a statute on this subject with respect to discrimination in housing and the area of this section that the effect of this constitutional provision would mean that regardless of what the legislature of California might want to do, that California could not -- the California courts could not cooperate in the enforcement of the federal statute by virtue of their jurisdiction without saying that the resolution is pro tanto and valid as in conflict with the federal law. 
    I don't know where they come out on that.
speaker="a_l_wirin" startTime="1968.493" stopTime="2010.176">
    Mr. A. L. Wirin 
    Well my response to Your Honor is this, certainly that provision in the first paragraph of this -- of this -- of Section 26 is written in the broadest of terms in the most comprehensive of language and bars the state or any of its agencies and of course part of an agency of a state from ever under any circumstances interfering with the exercise of absolute discretion brought by an individual. 
    And to that extent, I have to -- as additional string to our bow, the point which had just been discussed.

    Whether the -- whether California has acted through its legislature, through initiative of its people, through its courts, through some political subdivision, if that action violates Federal Constitution, it violates it, and if it doesn't, it doesn't. 
    I don't see what possible difference it makes, what instrumentality of the state that it is acting through.
speaker="a_l_wirin" startTime="2131.354" stopTime="2170.622">
    Mr. A. L. Wirin 
    May I just state to Your Honor why I think there may be a difference. 
    If the claim of a claimant is that private discriminatory action is encouraged by state action. 
    And hence that state action violates the Fourteenth Amendment, it seems to me it is arguable, if the state action is in the constitution, that the power of encouragement of the practice which is enshrined in the constitution, the power of encouragement is the greater if it is in the constitution rather than the statute. 
    Now that is all I'm arguing, and I -- I need to get back my argument. 
   
   
   
   Argument of Thurgood Marshall
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2170.622" stopTime="2177.612">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Very well. 
    Mr. Solicitor General.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="2177.612" stopTime="2559.711">
    Mr. Thurgood Marshall 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.We appeared today as amicus in these cases because we believe that the two of them represents serious and far-reaching questions regarding the extent to which states may by indirect means substantially contribute to invidious discrimination of a kind which if practiced directly would certainly clearly violate the Fourteenth Amendment. 
    Now, the subject matter of the state constitutional provision involved here against the discrimination in the sales and rental of housing is an addition of subsequent concern to the executive branch of our government as is indicated by present proposals for legislation on the federal level. 
    These cases concerned the validity of formal legal action taken by the State of California with respect to discrimination in housing. 
    And in our view, the action so taken goes beyond constitutional bounds.The provision of the state constitution which I would prefer to just call “Proposition 14” because that's the way it's commonly accepted and designated throughout the State of California, is we believe demonstrably an exercise of state power in support of racial discrimination as such. 
    In support of this conclusion, we have urged three lines of argument. 
    One I proposed to deal very briefly because it's already been discussed by -- a long time. 
    The rest is essentially on the principle set forth in Mr. Justice Stewart's concurring opinion in the Burton case -- the Wilmington case. 
    And although they had believed he and Mr. Justice Frankfurter and Mr. Justice Harlan believed it was not applicable to the facts of the case they still agreed with this principle. 
    And that principle, as I understand it is that a state may not solemnly enact into law an explicit official authorization of racial exclusion or racial discrimination. 
    That is true because such an enactment by its very nature puts the state on the side of racial distinctions and racial discriminations. 
    Aside to which the state simply may not, under the Fourteenth Amendment tip the scales even by a hair's breadth, that's what Burton tells me. 
    The proposition that a state must maintain the strictest neutrality with respect to private racial discrimination has of course been firmly established and is recently in Anderson against Martin. 
    And in light of its history, this history of pro -- Proposition 14 which was so fully discussed in the opinion of the Supreme Court of California, and the briefs here, there can be little doubt that it actually enshrines as it carefully secured and preferred right of California citizens, a preferred right because it was deliberately put in the section with rights of free speech, free exercise of religion, et cetera. 
    And for that reason, we come to the second line in this argument. 
    And that emphasizes that Proposition 14 is not merely a state statute. 
    It's not a statute which is subject to the ordinary interplay of political pressures within the jurisdiction of what remains the law. 
    And I say in the question as to the difference between this being a constitutional provision or a statute, the important point is it can only be removed by a vote of the people of California. 
    And the people we are arguing about here are the underprivileged people in the State of California and I don't think anybody denied that you don't get referendum by any place without hard earned cash and plenty of it. 
    The whole level of political acumen in California as in any other places makes it possible that a minority group may have some political strength in an area here or an area there. 
    But in no state that I know of do the minority groups have statewide power. 
    And that's the reason it's important to recognize that this provision was deliberately put into the constitution, it was no accident. 
    And I agree that if it just had been a repeal, we would not be here. 
    The permanence it has as a constitutional provision and the sweeping effect which it must be given its all inclusive prohibition by local governmental agencies distinguishes it from a simple statute, declaring the state's neutrality. 
    I -- I don't understand this argument that all it does is to say, “Well, everybody's free.” 
    But incorporating Proposition 14 in the constitution, California said that legislation of governmental action of any sort may not be taken to eliminate or reduce private racial discrimination in housing unless one, either two-thirds of the legislature move or the issue is put up to vote by the majority of the people. 
    Racial and other minorities and classes which are the likely victims of discrimination in housing are virtue -- by virtue of their minority status itself, placed in an obvious disadvantage.

    I don't know the California law.

    That case was cited in Mr. Justice Goldberg's concurring opinion in the Maryland case. 
    I do say that in our brief, we set forth the large number of municipalities and local units in this country that have adopted fair housing provisions. 
    And they couldn't now in California if in County Z in California, all of the people decide that open housing is good and that 20 -- the 20% of the group said, “No, we don't want it.” 
    And the 80% say, “We want it and we are in favor of adopting a resolution in our county requiring fair housing,” they can do it under this Act and that's the point I've been trying to get through Mr. Justice Black that the vote of the small unit is gone, you can't use any local pressure. 
    The governor -- I mean the -- that was a mistake. 
    The Attorney General of the state of California has filed a brief amicus in this case.

    Mr. Thurgood Marshall 
    That's right. 
    I think in support of that is the Attorney General himself to file his brief here. 
    And I think that that brief would be speaking for the entire executive side of the State of California. 
    And the -- the real difficulty here is that we all know there is considerable movement toward voluntarily working out open housing problems. 
    And the movement is much accentuated on the local level. 
    I don't know whether it's true in California or not, but I am talking about the reports that we filed in our brief. 
    All of those, I mean, we right here, we know up in Montgomery County. 
    There's a big movement there. 
    It's all over the country. 
    But here, you can't do it. 
    The other point is that even if somebody -- the people that reads this and there despite the fact that it's not directly material, the literature in all of it was set up. 
    It's in the UAW's brief and all. 
    There's some people that now whose conscience is telling them they should open their houses up. 
    They should open their apartments up. 
    They get the idea that the State says “Don't do it!” 
    It gives the -- the person whose conscience is working on him a block that says, “You don't have to do this.” 
    And it's the opposite of the neutral position that the State should take in these matters. 
    And I say the neutral position because I don't want it understood that I would object to the State taking the other position like the -- the Rumford Act or what have you.

    The local county units could move in. 
    Maybe the -- I don't know the powers of the Governor but I mean maybe some executive branch could move in. 
    There are lot of ways that this problem with racial discrimination in housing could be solved, if -- even if Unruh and Rumford were repealed.

    But I think on analysis and you tell me if I'm wrong, your basic position is that whether this 26 had been adopted by California with its particular history or by North Dakota, or by Ohio, or by Mississippi, or by any other state it would be violative of the Fourteenth Amendment.

    Mr. Thurgood Marshall 
    I think definitely yes. 
    This case was filed before 14, and it laid around when 14 came out, the defendant came in it says, 14 dismissed, it's dismissed. 
    That's what happened. 
    Oh, I'm not saying it was passed discretionary for this person but with all due respect it did. 
    It's our position that in both of these cases, the situation as it exists cannot be put within the four corners of the Fourteenth Amendment for the three reasons set out. 
    The one we urged the strongest is the overbreadth and the extent to which it was done, the encouragement point is a secondary point to our argument. 
    But on any basis, we believe that the judgment of the Supreme Court of California should be affirmed and back to the question we asked yesterday, we don't necessarily urge that beyond the exact same grounds as the Supreme Court of California but we think our three points do stand up and require the affirmance.

    Mr. Samuel O. Pruitt, Jr. 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    First in response to several questions from the Court, it seems to be clear that the risk of being presumptuous that is the duty of this Court to read this measure in a way to say that's validity not in a -- with unfriendly way in an effort to read in -- into it some provision that is not reasonably implied. 
    For example, I think there is nothing in this measure that can reasonably be read that says that the State Courts in California are prohibited by this measure from performing their Constitutional duty to enforce Federal Rights, whether they arise under a federal statute or under the Federal Constitution. 
    Nor indeed as evidenced by the exercise of jurisdiction by the State Courts in these cases, does it deprive the State Courts of the obligation to entertain claims which might involve the rule of law set forth in Section 26 to interpret that rule of law and to apply it to the effects of the case before it. 
    And I think it's quite ironic.

    Mr. Samuel O. Pruitt, Jr. 
    I might also say Mr. Justice Fortas that with respect to this method being an -- a departure from the ordinary processes of government in California or to placing this measure in the California Constitution has a significance that would be similar to an amendment to Federal Constitution, for example, just isn't so. 
    This is a normal procedure in California. 
    Our Constitution has been amended about 300 times since 1879 by initiative and other procedures. 
    I don't say it isn't necessarily good but on the other hand, it isn't necessarily bad either. 
    Now, it's quite ironic, I think that the respondents in this case supported by the United States and the Attorney General of California say, “They would be perfectly valid for the people of California to repeal the entire Unruh Act, the entire Rumford Act,” presumably to repeal all of our antidiscrimination laws which I think it's been conceded the State had no obligation to enact in the first place. 
    Here, where the people are trying to affect a very limited repeal of only one tiny portion of conduct and place it within the discretion and live it to the conscience of the individuals, that they say violates Federal Constitution.

    No, as I say the reason I didn't cite the majority opinion is because of my opinion it's not currently of the law. 
    Now with respect to whether the California court made any factual determination of encouragement, Mr. Wirin read a portion of a sentence from the opinion but he left out the phrase which I think establishes that really the California Supreme Court was making a statement of a legal conclusion. 
    There is the Statement Mr. Wirin read, “Here, the State has affirmatively acted to change its existing law from a situation where in a discrimination practice was legally restricted to one where in it is encouraged,” and this is the part that was omitted, “within the meaning of the cited decisions.”

    Would you -- I think I asked you the other day, I'm not sure yesterday, if the -- if Proposition 14 had said that Rumford and Unruh are hereby repealed and private parties are authorized to discriminate. 
    Would you -- what would you say about that?
speaker="samuel_o_pruitt_jr" startTime="4542.340" stopTime="4566.054">
    Mr. Samuel O. Pruitt, Jr. 
    I think the singling out of discrimination in any official statute might raise a serious constitutional problem, just as Your Honor thought there was a serious problem in the Georgia statute in Evans v. Newton because it singled out in Your Honor's opinion, racial discrimination as permissible conduct brought at the same time living in doubt whether you can discriminate on any other grounds but race.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="4566.054" stopTime="4573.674">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    For example, I didn't single out racial discrimination. 
    I just said that people are authorized to discriminate in the selling of their house.
speaker="samuel_o_pruitt_jr" startTime="4573.674" stopTime="4576.638">
    Mr. Samuel O. Pruitt, Jr.

    No.

    Mr. Samuel O. Pruitt, Jr. 
    Certainly.

    Why?
speaker="samuel_o_pruitt_jr" startTime="4595.253" stopTime="4597.130">
    Mr. Samuel O. Pruitt, Jr. 
    Because I think the constitutional issue here --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="4597.130" stopTime="4602.323">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Don't you think that this is an authorization to discriminate, Proposition 14?
speaker="samuel_o_pruitt_jr" startTime="4602.323" stopTime="4655.070">
    Mr. Samuel O. Pruitt, Jr. 
    It's an authorization to act without the compulsion of government. 
    Now, that's an authorization to discriminate, that maybe a way of putting it but it's not an encouragement to discriminate. 
    It's an encouragement to act on accordance with the dictates of your conscience, which is true of all areas of conduct which the government either commands, not be -- neither commands to be done nor prohibits from being done. 
    This broad middle ground where the government does nothing so to speak, neither prohibits it nor does it command it. 
    In those areas, freedom means that people are supposed to act in accordance with their consciences and it is to be hoped that they don't discriminate. 
    But it includes, that's one of curse of freedom is that some people will.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="4655.070" stopTime="4660.150">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    So authorization as such is not necessarily invalid as argued.

    Mr. Samuel O. Pruitt, Jr. 
    That -- that is correct.

    I don't -- I don't think you have to say that and I think it's perfectly legitimate, some acts where a state authorizes something to be done to say that it's made it legal.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    But we have -- we have this situation and I wonder if you've found any -- any analogies to it in other constitutions that have been sustained, well recognized of the Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth Amendments were -- were designed to prevent discrimination of the Negro. 
    Now, do you know of any other analogies where -- where the courts have sustained a statute or a constitutional provision that is designed to circumvent that right?
speaker="samuel_o_pruitt_jr" startTime="4729.895" stopTime="4735.198">
    Mr. Samuel O. Pruitt, Jr. 
    Well in the form of Your Honor's question, I don't believe there would be such a case of a statute --

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well -- well (Voice Overlap) --
speaker="samuel_o_pruitt_jr" startTime="4735.397" stopTime="4738.617">
    Mr. Samuel O. Pruitt, Jr. 
    -- that was designed to circumvent the right not to be discriminated?
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="4738.617" stopTime="4782.069">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Circumvent the purpose of the Fourteenth Amendment. 
    The purpose of the Fourteenth Amendment is to prevent discrimination against Negroes. 
    It is true that it only operates against the State not just against the individuals. 
    But do you know of any other constitutional provision or statute which is to stand by this Court or higher courts, where the purpose was -- where the statute itself said that the people, affirmatively, that the people should not be interfered with in their right of discrimination. 
    And isn't that what we have here?
speaker="samuel_o_pruitt_jr" startTime="4782.069" stopTime="4784.281">
    Mr. Samuel O. Pruitt, Jr. 
    I know -- I know of such case that holds it on this --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="4784.281" stopTime="4786.166">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    What about the Civil Right cases?
speaker="samuel_o_pruitt_jr" startTime="4786.166" stopTime="4824.816">
    Mr. Samuel O. Pruitt, Jr. 
    But then I was going to say Mr. Justice Black that the whole -- the whole line of authorities from the Civil Rights cases down to the Guest Case last term, in making the distinction between State and private actions seems to make crystal clear that a state has an absolute right consistent with the Fourteenth Amendment to say this is the kind of conduct we can prevent if we think it's necessary or desirable. 
    We don't have to do it in the Federal Constitution. 
    And if we decide not to take a position on this kind of field -- in this field, there's nothing in the Federal Constitution that says we cannot. 
    Now let's --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="4824.816" stopTime="4837.539">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    I -- I don't -- I don't disagree with you on the fact that they can -- can do nothing about it?But can they encourage -- encourage it by a provision of this kind?
speaker="samuel_o_pruitt_jr" startTime="4837.539" stopTime="4909.985">
    Mr. Samuel O. Pruitt, Jr. 
    I think the central, the core question in this case, Chief Justice please, is whether this rule of law is consistent with the Fourteenth Amendment. 
    Now in 1959, everybody says that California just had the Common Law Rule and it wasn't printed in the statute so it wasn't in the constitution. 
    There would be no Federal Constitutional question if the Court rendered judgment for the property owners in this case. 
    Now in 1967, all of sudden that same rule of law raises a serious constitutional question. 
    Now, why is that so? 
    Why should it make a difference that California has experimented in this field by adopting a statute to see whether or not it would assist in the situation, the people say we don't want the statute and they repealed it. 
    Why should that conduct of the legislative groups in California make it any different constitutional question than it would have been in 1959? 
    Or for that matter, any difference in the constitutional question should these cases come up from Illinois or Texas or Mississippi? 
    Why should there be a different rule of Constitutional Law applicable to California?
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="4909.985" stopTime="4924.330">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    I don't think there is but couldn't they -- couldn't they simply have repealed the Rumford and the Unruh Amendments here and let it go with that and then the State would be neutral?
speaker="samuel_o_pruitt_jr" startTime="4924.330" stopTime="4967.338">
    Mr. Samuel O. Pruitt, Jr. 
    As I said at the beginning, Mr. Chief Justice, it seems to me it's very ironic to suggest that a repeal of these measures, which is a much more drastic step, from the step that people took here. 
    They didn't repeal the Unruh Act. 
    It prohibits discrimination on racial or religious grounds in business establishments of every kind whatsoever. 
    My opponents here say that California can repeal that whole law, consistent with the Federal Constitution. 
    But what they can't do is the (Inaudible) of that law, this narrow area of conduct for a private property on. 
    I find that very ironic and unacceptable under the Federal Constitution.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="4967.338" stopTime="4998.247">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    I think it's a legislative process for -- for the legislature to pass and repeal laws. 
    That's what the legislature is there for. 
    But does that follow? 
    The State has the right to say that it no longer can pass a law that is in furtherance of the Fourteenth Amendment so far as discrimination is concerned.
speaker="samuel_o_pruitt_jr" startTime="4998.247" stopTime="5018.558">
    Mr. Samuel O. Pruitt, Jr. 
    Again, that's not what this measure says. 
    It says it can pass such a law when the people pass it in that part of the process of the Democratic Government in California. 
    I know nothing in the Federal Constitution that says that kind of a democratic process is prohibited.

    Justice Byron R. White 
    (Voice Overlap) -- yes, but let's just say that before Rumford and Unruh, was there a constitutional right to discriminate in California?

    No, no.

    Justice Byron R. White 
    -- Unruh and -- Unruh and Rumford did away with the right to discriminate. 
    But now, there is a Constitutional Right to discriminate in the State of California in the sense that no legislature -- no legislative act or ordinance is valid in that State, but isn't a Constitutional right, it's nothing, is it? 
    People have the constitutional right to discriminate much have the (Inaudible) the right to free to speech.

    -- Constitutional Amendments and the legislative acts, but either one is modifiable in the future only by further action of the people. 
    For the fact that this is in the California Constitution by initiative as distinguished from the California statute by initiative has no bearing on who has the right repeal it. 
    Effect in short, if the Court pleased that the court below exercised the judicial power of the United States to strike down a rule of law which the people of California adopted in the orderly manner of democracy which we practice there. 
    We asked the Court not to exercise that power to overrule the judgment of the people here. 
    The people are the only sorts for the ultimate and abiding solution of the kind of problem that's been raised by my opposition. 
    And if these arguments that they are addressing to this Court or addressed to the legislative bodies in California for the people, they are the ones that have to be convinced that their method of approach to this problem is preferable to the one adopted by the people. 
    We ask that the judgments be reversed.
