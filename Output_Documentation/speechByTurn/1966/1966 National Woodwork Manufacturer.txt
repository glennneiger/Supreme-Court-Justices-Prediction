    Mr. Dominick L. Manoli 
    May it please the Court. 
    When the Court arose yesterday afternoon I was addressing myself for the contention of the other side that Section 8 (b) (4) (A) of the Taft-Hartley Amendments barred all so-called product boycotts. 
    I suggest that the use of the slogan, product boycotts, does not help -- really help us resolve our problem. 
    When Congress enacted legislation against product boycotts it had in mind a specific evil --

speaker="dominick_l_manoli" startTime="49.311" stopTime="223.463">
    Mr. Dominick L. Manoli 
    When Congress Congress enacted legislation against product boycotts, it had a specific evil in mind namely employer refusals to handle the products of another employer who was involved in a labor dispute or who was nonunion or who was otherwise disfavored, otherwise disfavored by the union representing those particular employees. 
    And that this was a device to exert to a neutral employer pressure, pressure upon the employer disfavored by the union. 
    Now in determining whether or not refusals to handle products coming from another employer, whether that was refusals are a violation of the statutes or whether or not we must look in the light of the purpose of Congress, we must look to the objective of the employees or the union that's directing them to refuse to handle the products coming from another employer. 
    Now, let me explain my meaning with two illustrations. 
    Supposed for example that you have my -- employer A, employer A buys doors from manufacturer B. 
    The employees of employer A are union. 
    Those of employer B are nonunion. 
    The employees of A refuse to install the doors coming from B because B's doors do not bear the union label and B, his employees are nonunion. 
    That was the situation under Sand Door Case which was before this Court several years ago. 
    Now let me give a second illustration. 
    Employer A under his contract with this collective bargaining agreement with his employees is required and has traditionally given them certain work to be done on doors, the finishing of unfinished doors. 
    Now employer A decides that he is going to buy finished doors. 
    And when these finished doors come to him, his employees refused to install those doors. 
    The reason that they are refusing to install those doors is because the employer in violation of his agreement not to assign the finishing work to someone else, to preserve it for them as -- deprive them of work which they have traditionally been performing and work which under their contract they're entitled to. 
    Now essentially, that is the case before this Court involving the employer of the contract to Frouge. 
    That is not a secondary boycott situation. 
    All that the two, the two examples which I've given can be loosely called as product boycotts. 
    As product boycotts, there are differences between --

    Unknown Speaker 
    (Inaudible)
speaker="dominick_l_manoli" startTime="224.503" stopTime="227.928">
    Mr. Dominick L. Manoli 
    I'm sorry I'm having trouble with that word, product boycotts --
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="227.928" stopTime="228.328">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Product?
speaker="dominick_l_manoli" startTime="228.328" stopTime="365.362">
    Mr. Dominick L. Manoli 
    Yes. 
    Either they might giving it -- catching it or something wrong with my voice. 
    I'm speaking of the product boycotts. 
    As I said, the two illustrations which I've given to the Court, they are enti -- although in the sense they can be said to involve product boycotts. 
    Product boycotts, they are analytically different because the object of the employees who are refusing to handle the products are entirely different. 
    And the difference in their object makes for wholly different results under the statute a result which should not be blurred by simply imposing upon them the label, product boycott. 
    In the first case that I gave, in the first case I gave where the employees of the union re -- union employer A refused to handle the doors coming from a nonunion source, there the employees have no dispute whether own employer over the terms or conditions of their employment. 
    Their dispute is with the manufacturer B who is nonunion. 
    And his doors do not bear a union label. 
    When they refuse to perform services for employer A, their own employer, and install these doors, they are seeking to exert secondary pressure upon B, the disfavored employer. 
    That was I said was a situation before this Court in the Sand Door Case in which the Court held that this was a violation of the secondary boycott provisions of the stat -- of the statute. 
    Now, in the second example which I gave, which should I say is essentially the case before this Court involving in. 
    And in the Frouge incidence -- in the Frouge incident, in the second case, the employees of employer A, they're not concerned with the manufacture of the doors or the conditions under which those doors are manufactured. 
    Their concern is solely with res -- solely over the loss of their work which they have traditionally been performing for their employer which under their agreement, he's agreed to give to them. 
    Their dispute, the target of their action is their immediate employer over their own immediate work opportunities. 
    That is not a secondary boycott at all.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="365.362" stopTime="376.410">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Well, supposed in the second case you put, it also turns out that B, the manufacturer of the doors is a nonunion employer.
speaker="dominick_l_manoli" startTime="376.410" stopTime="382.685">
    Mr. Dominick L. Manoli 
    If that is the reason why the employees of A are refusing to handle his doors then it would be a secondary boycott.

    An object and you may have a mixed situation such as the one that Your Honor is suggesting, but in that case so, if one of the reasons why they are refusing to handle this product because the manufacturer of the door is nonunion, it is nonunion, then the board under those circumstances would find that there was a violation of the statute.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="428.152" stopTime="441.346">

    Well, let me get to Allen Bradley now Your Honor because I'm just at that point. 
    The other side of course has placed a great deal of reliance upon the legislative references in the 1947 debates on the Taft-Hartley Amendments -- on the legislative references for the Allen Bradley case. 
    To begin with, I think we should note that Congress as the conference report makes clear as the remarks of Senator Taft make clear viewed that case as involving a simple and a classic secondary boycott namely where the employees of one employer were refusing to install certain electrical equipment because it came from another employer where there was another union. 
    Where there was another union which represented those employees.

    That's the way they say the Conference Report viewed that case and that's the way Senator Taft view it. 
    But now let's look at the particular facts of the particular case and I believe we can distinguish it from the situation that we have here. 
    In that case, the union which represented the employees of the New York City contractors, electrical contractors, it had no dispute, there was no dispute between them -- between the union and the New York City contractors. 
    But under an agreement between the contractors and the union, the union directed the employees of the contractors not to install electrical equipment to -- which came from outside of the city of New York. 
    Now the union's purpose in doing this was to create a sheltered market for the New York City manufacturers.

    Your Honor, let me give an example, we had the sound shingle case some years ago in the Ninth Circuit. 
    There, the union represented the employers of an American manufacturer of shingles (Inaudible) American manufacturer of shingle, one who use shingles. 
    That particular person was buying shingles from a Canadian manufacturer --

    From a Canadian manufacturer and the union did not want the American employer to buy shingles from the Canadian manufacturer. 
    The reason they didn't want to buy, the reason they didn't want them (Inaudible) it is because Canadian manufacturer working standards were lower than those here and they -- of the American manufacturer and the Canadian manufacturer was nonunion. 
    Now, in that case, the union's object, the target of the union's action was the Canadian manufacturer because he was disfavored. 
    He was disfavored because he was nonunion and its working conditions were not the same as those of the union within this country. 
    In that case, the Ninth Circuit and the board that that was a violation of the statute. 
    But why was it a violation of the statute? 
    It was a violation of the statute because the union had no dispute with the American manufacturer. 
    Its dispute was directed to the Canadian, to the Canadian manufacturer. 
    Now, if there had been no dispute with the Canadian manufacturer and the dispute had been solely with the American manufacturer over the preservation of work, the fact that that would've prevented Canadian goods from coming into this state would be irrelevant to the question of whether or not this was secondary or primary.

    Mr. Dominick L. Manoli

    And as I have said -- as I've said, number one, con -- Senator Taft and the Conference Report viewed that as a simple classic secondary boycott of the employers belonging to union A refusing to handle the goods coming from another source where there was another union in the picture. 
    And the -- just let me read, I won't take the time to read the whole quotation, but just let me read what Senator Taft said in connection with 8 (b) (4), of the original amendment." 
    This provision makes it unlawful to resort to a secondary boycott to injure the business of a third person who was wholly unconcerned in the disagreement between an employer and his employees". 
    Then it goes to say, "We've heard all kinds of talk that there are good secondary boycotts and bad secondary boycotts". 
    But the emphasis is repeatedly is on secondary boycotts. 
    Then after he having said that, he says, "Take a case in which the employer is getting along perfectly with his employees. 
    They agree on wages. 
    Wages and working conditions are satisfactory on both sides. 
    Someone else says to those employers, we want you to strike against your employer because he happens to be handling some product which we do not like. 
    We do not think it is made under proper conditions". 
    Of course it goes on to say if that were encouraged, it wouldn't create all kinds of problems. 
    And finally concludes, "We condemn the view that if other workers do not like the way some employer is treating is treating his employees, they can promote strikes in any other plant which happens to be handling the product of the plant whose management that the workers do not like. 
    That's the gloss of course that is imposed upon that literal language of Section 8 (b) (4).

    Let me say that the principal point of the Senator from Florida is similar to that in the case of the New York Electrical Workers Union which said, “We will not permit any material made by any other union or by any nonunion workers to come into the New York City and be put into any building in New York City.

    -- my question?
speaker="dominick_l_manoli" startTime="1914.474" stopTime="2029.125">
    Mr. Dominick L. Manoli 
    Let me address myself to that question and I think I know what may be troubling the Court there because there seems to be some apparent inconsistency between the board saying in the case of Frouge, it was permissible legitimate primary activity but in the case of the other employer it was secondary. 
    Now let's see if I can explain that. 
    All of these contractors here were parties to the collective bargaining agreement that effect of which was to bar them from subcontracting the finishing of -- the finishing work on doors. 
    Three of these employers -- three of these contractors, I'm sorry, I moved away from that. 
    Three of these contractors here who are parties to this agreement here, they ignored their agreement and the accepted specifications from the project owners and those specifications called for finished doors. 
    The fourth contractor, Frouge, the fourth contractor, his specifications did not require him to use those doors. 
    Now with respect with to the three employers who in this regard of their own collective bargaining agreement or whatever obligations they may have owed to their employees under that agreement in disregard of that, they have taken as I say a contract which is now taking the work out of their hands, and of course their employers have been denied of certain work. 
    Now in that case, the board held that this was secondary activity because the control, the control over the dispute had passed from those contractors to the project owners. 
    That in that particular context the board then deemed the union's refusal to install the doors as being direct at least impart, that had been directed at least to impart to neutral employers namely the project owners.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="2029.125" stopTime="2037.396">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Except that the contractors in those three cases deliberately did it and did it as you've just said in violation of their contract.

    Mr. Dominick L. Manoli 
    And of course, I don't know what I should take comfort out of the fact that those -- that particular part of the -- the face of the board's case is not before this Court.

    Mr. Dominick L. Manoli 
    You -- we can't disregard it. 
    Now with respect to Frouge, I am trying to just round out the answer to your question. 
    With respect to Frouge, Frouge again he was -- had some -- an obligation to his employees under a collective bargaining agreement but his specifications did not call for prefinished doors, therefore their resolution to the dispute was what -- it -- lay with him. 
    And he is the target. 
    He is the only target of the union's action.

    Well, Mr. Manoli this has absolutely no relationship that I can see with the -- your argument. 
    That is to say the fact -- the determinative factors that you have laid out here which relate to the intent of the particular union and nothing whatever to do with this factor of who controls so far as I can see it.
speaker="dominick_l_manoli" startTime="2187.761" stopTime="2188.262">

    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Now, on page 5 of Government's brief in 111, say that the board reasoned that since the three contractors in contrast to Frouge did not have control over the work that the union sought to protect for its employees. 
    The union's objective was secondary. 
    Now your argument unless I have missed it, your argument as to the correct analysis of the statutory provisions here has nothing whatever to do with control. 
    It has to do with the intent, the purpose of the union. 
    Now that's what I like you to reconcile for me or argue abandoning the board's distinction. 
    I would not off hand, I would not find that side religious.

    Mr. Dominick L. Manoli 
    Your Honor, the element of control as we think that the board saw this is simply one of the elements that indicates who is the primary target of the union's refusal or work stoppage? 
    Now in this particular case, these employees had traditionally been performing this work. 
    They had an agreement with their employer that they were going to get this work. 
    And at the point where the dispute came to a head, the point where the dispute came to a head, Frouge alone had complete control over the resolution of that dispute. 
    And he could have resolved the dispute. 
    He could have settled it. 
    And therefore because of all of these factors, all of these factors, he is the sole and primary target of the union's action.

    Yes, there is a specific finding to that effect.

    The argument of course here is being made that the agreement here between the contractors and their employees which barred the use of these prefinished doors --

    Yes sir.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2356.713" stopTime="2362.360">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    They said that -- that's it's an 8 (e) as well against the one employer.

    Justice Byron R. White 
    Yes.
speaker="dominick_l_manoli" startTime="2364.294" stopTime="2469.725">
    Mr. Dominick L. Manoli 
    -- found was bad, was valid -- in violation of 8 (e). 
    Now the -- Section 8 (e) does not have in specific terms the primary -- secondary provision of Section 8 (b) (4). 
    And as I said yesterday, the literal language of Section 8 (e) with the construction in the proviso, whatever significance maybe and I'll try to come to that before the end of my time. 
    With that to one side, the literal language of Section 8 (e) would appear to make this particular agreement unlawful because the agreement in effect permits the signatory employer to refrain from buying finished doors from some other employer. 
    But the literal language of the statute, I again suggest is not the end of our inquiry. 
    I don't think we needed to subscribe to the proposition that the surest way to misread the statute is to read it literally. 
    But is a notorious fact that the 1959 amendments to this Act were far from models of legislative clarity. 
    And Section 8 (e) is unusually deceptive. 
    It is unusually deceptive and we can only understand it. 
    We can really only appreciate the true meaning of that language only in the like of it's ever -- of its genesis and its legislative evolution. 
    Now Section 8 (e), the language of Section 8 (e) tracks the language of Section 8 (b) (4) (a) or now presently 8 (b) (4) (b) in the current statute. 
    There was no intent on the part of the Congress to reorient the thrust of the statute with respect to boycotts or to redefine them. 
    As one commentator has set, the legislative evidence is overwhelming that Congress' primary concern was with a hot cargo clause and in the utility.

    Clauses which would bar an employer from doing business with another employer involved in a dispute or nonunion or otherwise disfavored.

    Mr. Charles B. Mahin 
    Mr. Chief Justice. 
    In the few minutes, I have left, if the Court please I'd like to stress just two points. 
    First, to the control point to which Mr. Manoli has just addressed himself and second to this primary and secondary dichotomy which the board presses when it suits a purpose and disregards when it doesn't. 
    Now first, I'd like to suggest that we must remember that in this case, this union boycott on all four jobs prevented the use of prefabricated doors and Rule 17 prevented the use of prefabricated doors in Philadelphia. 
    Now let's look at this control theory. 
    I don't know what the board means. 
    It changes its view on it but at best, a control is an evidentiary guide where you have a mixed up common-situs situation where you have obscure objectives. 
    At best that's it. 
    Now it serves no purpose where you have a clear cut objective anymore than any other presumption of evidence, where you have a clear cut evidence of objective against boycott doors which you have here. 
    Now, I --

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Who is the neut -- who was the neutral employer in this case?
speaker="charles_b_mahin" startTime="2681.365" stopTime="2754.510">
    Mr. Charles B. Mahin 
    If -- You honor, I'm glad you ask that. 
    In this case there is no neutral employer. 
    There's always a fight between the union and the local contractor about prefabric -- about using somebody else's doors. 
    There's a three-way fight. 
    There is no neutral. 
    This talk about neutral employers just doesn't fit here. 
    Now, on the control theory, let's apply it below. 
    Whatever trust control had, where did it point? 
    It pointed only to the con -- project owner on the three jobs where the doors were specified. 
    Not elsewhere. 
    That's the only place it could point, whatever thrust it had. 
    But what did the board claim? 
    That the objective was not only the owners but the manufacturers and the distributors of the door, there it saw irrespective of controller on the three jobs where violations were found. 
    There was found a boycott objective against doors and the manufacturers. 
    And so with Frouge, it was identically the same. 
    Whatever trust control had pointing at Frouge, was purely incidental because on that case the boycott objective was precisely the same. 
    It was against the prefabricated doors. 
    Now, I want to hit this next point on this primary, secondary formula. 
    If the Court please, a reading --
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="2754.510" stopTime="2767.086">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Well, the argument you've just made is, even if there were anything that a primary or secondary formula on this record, the finding is compelled that this was aimed at the doors and not at any dispute.
speaker="charles_b_mahin" startTime="2767.086" stopTime="2862.862">
    Mr. Charles B. Mahin 
    You're right Your Honor, nothing on this primary secondary business. 
    In the first place, if a reading in the board's case reveals that this formula is applied in about a third of their cases and the Court cases in the sense of a one-two-three dispute, it doesn't work out that way. 
    Now, there are many boycott situations that involve the one-two-three business. 
    But many product boycotts which Congress intended to eliminate clearly do not involve those and I cite Allen Bradley. 
    And if the Court please, my good friend, Mr. Manoli misquotes this case completely because in that case, the union was not concerned with nonunion products from elsewhere or other things. 
    It barred all products regardless of union affiliations. 
    I pointed out, it barred products from a sister -- local over in Jersey City. 
    And he didn't finish the quote from Senator Taft. 
    He said, “We will not permit any material". 
    This is -- he's talking about the Bradley Case. 
    This is page 63 in our briefs. 
    We will not permit any material made by any other union or any nonunion worker to come into New York City and to be put in to any building in New York. 
    They just can't bring it in, union or nonunion, they didn't care. 
    The principle announced by the Senator of Florida would make that stand lawful as it is lawful today. 
    Of course, we proposed to change the law in that effect. 
    And gentlemen, the impact of Allen Bradley in Congress and the impact in the cases for 20 years has been that it was an embargo type product -- boycott.

    Mr. Charles B. Mahin 
    -- this proviso, if the Court please was directed to that. 
    It's the localized situation, a mixed up thing which you have in your common-situs in other case. 
    But Congress looking at it said, and Senator Taft said, and everybody else said, this proviso does not apply to products manufactured at the job -- away from the factory to be brought in here. 
    Why? 
    Because the freedom they were giving, these restrictive contracts was lo -- limited to the localized situation. 
    And in the General Miller Work, if the Court please, there was no agreement there at all. 
    There was a debate about the agreement. 
    And there was a debate whether it had a union label clause like ours here. 
    And there was a debate about whether it banned on pre-hanged doors but the crux of the decision and the reason for the Court's decision, I presumed to suggest. 
    And the board's decision was that there was boycott on prefabricated doors and the justice's recollection that is absolutely correct. 
    Now, on -- so much for this primary secondary dispute business, if Congress had wanted to write primary secondary and secondary boycotts into the Act, it could readily have done so. 
    And in the 1959 legislature, every bill of the opponents of the Landrum-Griffin Amendments put into their bill a primary secondary dichotomy, which the board's talking about, everyone of them, the Elliott Bill and the Shelly Bill and the Roosevelt Bill. 
    And Congress expressed -- they wrote it into 8 (b) (4) (B). 
    And Congress expressly rejected that bill and then adopted instead the Landrum-Griffin Bill which does not have any such prescription.

    Yes, and he -- in that connection cited the quote that I quoted about -- ago. 
    Now, with reference to this matter of work preservation, may I suggest this; the Government's argument here that work preservation as a sole objective is academic in this case. 
    The argument that 8 (e) does not ban sole work preservation objectives -- agreements is academic here because Rule 17 by -- I feel any realistic appraisal had dual objectives. 
    It had the work preservation objective but Your Honors, the most obvious objective if one can read and see and understand what the Court and the board said is that another objective was to ban prefabricated doors from Philadelphia. 
    And that's what it did, 4000 of them. 
    And they're not going in yet. 
    Now, that being the case, this is what the Court talked about in Denver Building Trades Case, that this statute contemplates dual objectives.

    And the parallel with the proviso of 8 (b) (4) (B) is the same. 
    They permitted these agreements on the site but made it clear that the 8 (e) proviso did not validate boycotts of fabricated products made away from the site.
