    Mr. Wade H. Penny, Jr. 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    This case is before this Court on writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of the State of North Carolina. 
    That court in a decision rendered in January of this year held that the State of North Carolina acting through its solicitor and the trial court made by procedural device known under North Carolina law as a nolle prosequi with leave permanently and completely deprived by criminal defendant of his day in court. 
    At this point, I would like to emphasize that although discussion of the right to a speedy trial normally proceeds from a concern with what is an unreasonable delay. 
    Here, the State of North Carolina takes the unprecedented, we submit, view that the state may permanently and completely deprive a defendant of his day in court and in doing so repudiates the basic principle of our system of law that every man accused to crime regardless of the degree of the offense or its seriousness, regardless of his station in life is nevertheless unequivocally entitled to his day in court to establish his innocence and with the opportunity to secure his exoneration. 
    At the outset, I would like to emphasize that this petitioner's contact with the State of North Carolina is no frivolous skirmish. 
    This defendant was first indicted in February of 1964 for the grand jury of Orange County upon a bill of indictment charging him with trespass which under North Carolina law is punishable both by a sentence and fine or either one of the two. 
    Pursuant to that bill of indictment of February this defendant was brought to trial at the special criminal session in March of 1964 and after a lengthy trial the jury was unable to agree whereupon this defendant was then directed to appear in court on the following Monday. 
    However, no further proceeding was taken in March with a crowded criminal docket at that time in Orange County for one reason or another. 
    The case although it appeared once or twice on the criminal docket there was no further trial proceeding and then in the spring of 1965, counsel for the petitioner inquired of the state as to what the state's position in this case would be in the light of the passage of the 1964 Federal Civil Rights Act and even more in point this Court's decision in Hamm versus City of Rock Hill applying that act retroactively. 
    The Solicitor indicated as the record shows that he intended to take what is known as is nolle prosequi with leave. 
    In April of 1965 when this case was once again on the docket of Orange County Superior Court, this petitioner through his counsel appeared in open court and objected to that procedural point being taken by the State of North Carolina and entered in the record. 
    The court animated at that time that it agreed with the state that it might have the nolle prosequi entered. 
    Then the Solicitor having a change of heart decided that he wanted the case back on the trial calendar right at that moment in open court. 
    Now, the next session of the Orange County Superior Court then occurred in August of 1965. 
    Prior to that session of court, it was ascertained that this petitioner's case was not on the trial docket and then an effort to bring the matter to some conclusion, petitioner filed a motion in the Orange County Superior Court wherein he outlined the chronology as to the issuance of the indictment and this prior context with the court, and further urged upon the court that he have an affirmative defense to any further attempt to prosecute this case. 
    In that first of all, this prosecution arose out of a set of circumstances which constitute or which where in the course of a civil rights demonstration wherein the petitioner assault service that I placed which he contended in this motion was a place of public accommodation. 
    He referred in that motion to the Civil Rights Act, to his contention that Hamm applied -- the Hamm decision applied in his case and in more particular cited the superior court to the case rendered by this Court in 1965 Blow versus North Carolina applying the Civil Rights Act under the Hamm decision retroactively and pointed out in his motion that the facts in his case where as to the operative facts very similar to the Blow decision. 
    At no point in the record or in this record before the Court that the State of North Carolina ever seriously contend or ever contend at all for that matter that the statement in this motion where incorrect.

    Well the motion act, the motion did not immediately request the ruling on the merits of that contention. 
    What it did request was that the State of North Carolina be directed to proceed in accordance with law and to allow this defendant an opportunity to present those contentions in orderly procedure in the state court, so what we actually asked for a motion was that the judge inquiring to why the State of North Carolina was not willing to give this defendant his day in court in order to urge this point.

    Do you mean that in some formality about docketing a phase which governs relied to make motion to just doing that?

    Mr. Wade H. Penny, Jr. 
    Well, let me explain at this way Mr. Justice Brennan. 
    Normally, a trial judge would not consider any case on the docket. 
    I mean any case pending before the Court unless the Solicitor has placed it upon the docket. 
    Now, at the time that we file this motion our case was pending in the Superior Court.

    Mr. Wade H. Penny, Jr. 
    But was not on the trial docket and we have been put off about that. 
    In April, the indication by the Solicitor in open court being that he was going to proceed to trial this particular defendant, and all that we were saying at that time was we are ready to proceed. 
    We did not ask or demand of the court that they had to put this case on for that such. 
    What we did was the court under its general supervisory jurisdiction to in effect commit the state to a debt in a certain time when they would give us our day in court.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="586.520" stopTime="607.390">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Does the consequence to the motion or whatever it is now finds the proceeding here. 
    If the consequences of the ex parte action by the case, the key -- the case of its -- the trial docket for such time has insisted it's actually distort has to put it on?
speaker="wade_h_penny_jr" startTime="607.390" stopTime="674.905">
    Mr. Wade H. Penny, Jr. 
    Well, if I may I'll briefly explain that procedure in order that the Court can see the context in which we operate. 
    North Carolina allows the Solicitor upon his own initiative as to any case pending in the Court to request the Court that an entry be made either of nolle prosequi which is short in phrase as nol pros in our state or nolle prosequi with leave. 
    Now, the effect of that as the Court has clearly established on our procedure is this, number one, it is not an acquittal if merely relives the defendant from having to attend court from session to session, and secondly releases him from his bond. 
    It in no way is a termination of the action because the Court has explicitly stated that the state may either proceed upon the original bill of indictment at any time or issue a new bill of indictment. 
    Now, the distinction and there is but one distinction between nolle prosequi and nolle prosequi with leave is --

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    What's your circuit name?
speaker="wade_h_penny_jr" startTime="677.011" stopTime="678.927">
    Mr. Wade H. Penny, Jr. 
    Nolle prosequi with leave.

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    With leave?
speaker="wade_h_penny_jr" startTime="679.691" stopTime="746.962">
    Mr. Wade H. Penny, Jr. 
    Now with leave means -- well, I'll put it this way, under a nolle prosequi entry in order for the solicitor to reinstitute the proceeding he would have to first apply to the trial judge and get his consent and a trial judge would issue an order directing the clerk of court to issue a case. 
    But then at that point, they could either proceed -- under that procedure they would proceed on the same bill of indictment or if he did not want that instead of going to the court could request an issue, have a presentment sent to the grand jury. 
    Now under a nolle prosequi with leave and I might say that under our procedure that is the customary entry rather than just a limited nolle prosequi. 
    Under nolle prosequi with leave, the words with leave mean in effect that the court is giving its consent in advance that the Solicitor may reinstitute the proceeding without any further consent from the court he just would merely walk into the clerk's office given the docket number and ask to dictate his issue for that defendant.

speaker="wade_h_penny_jr" startTime="759.361" stopTime="776.222">
    Mr. Wade H. Penny, Jr. 
    Your Honor, there were some concern on the part of the petitioner that under our statutory appellate procedure that there might be a question raised. 
    However, there was no question raised either by the state in its brief nor by the Supreme Court of North Carolina.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="776.222" stopTime="781.411">

    Mr. Wade H. Penny, Jr. 
    No, Your Honor, it is not raised from the brief here. 
    So, I would assume that the statue in North Carolina which says you may appeal -- only from the final judgment is being construed here to mean that this action by the Solicitor at least as to the facts, the defendant has filed. 
    It's not final as to the Solicitor under North Carolina procedure but it is final as to this petitioner because as the Klopfer case opinion in the state court indicates there is no other procedure now available to this petitioner in North Carolina Court by which to compel the state to allow him to proceed -- to this case.

    Not on those words, Your Honor we in open court on the consideration of this motion. 
    I think its clear from the contents of the motion in fact a motion specifically states that to defend the questions whether the state can proceed under this bill of indictment and so what we were saying to the Superior Court is that the question or whether this bill of indictment is valid would require some type of hearing and fact finding at probably preliminary to the actual trial by the court to determine whether the indictment is valid or not and so in our motion we were saying that we're entitled to have our opportunity in court of -- to present that motion.

    Mr. Wade H. Penny, Jr. 
    Yes, Your Honor, appearing up on page 18 in the last paragraph on that page. 
    We point out that under the facts of this case where a trespass charge arises out of this defendant's effort to change what is a prevailing attitude in the community where in this case arose or at least was so the prevailing attitude of the time of this case that the inevitable effect of the nolle prosequi with leave now is to leave his future status under this charge completely open the question and I might say at this point that quite often the nolle prosequi with leave procedure is used precisely for that effect not necessarily in its more ordinary concern not the quail and restrict First Amendment rights but in effect you'll often have a case where perhaps the state's witness is available only greater expense to the state and this defendant has a reasonably good record and the state decides that because of this particular defendant's case and I'm not talking about the case here that it's not worth the expense to the state in that kind of case and that just thread of this prosecution for the next year to hanging over its head would probably, in other words his brush with the law even though it doesn't result in conviction is sufficient.

    Mr. Wade H. Penny, Jr. 
    Mr. Chief Justice, actually North Carolina's nolle prosequi procedure is not grounded on a statute as I understand that's a carryover from the procedural device under the same name of common law. 
    At least our courts cites no statute and we have one or two -- have one statute in particular that says that where a defendant has been indicted and has not been apprehended within two terms of court that the clerk of court may have nolle prosequi with leave entered and I think that is primarily for the purpose of administrative convenience in order to get it off the docket because the defendant may never admit it.

    The only use that has ever been suggested by the Supreme Court of North Carolina to use this procedure is in a case where the state does not feel it has sufficient evidence to proceed and secure a conviction but even that consideration if it were justifiable a moment eventually the total of time cuts that off because it's equally cogent and likely that there is no such evidence to ever be obtained and if there is none this defendant --

    Mr. Andrew A. Vanore, Jr. 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    I think the crux of the case is whether of not the defendant here can compel the state to prosecute. 
    In this respect, I think it is interesting to note that in North Carolina under the North Carolina procedure once the bill of indictment is returned as a true bill by the grand jury the Solicitor as an alternative to bringing the defendant to a trial can only do one of two things. 
    He nolle prosequi the case or he can request the Court to nolle prosequi with leave. 
    This is the only way that the indictment or that the question can be resolved and in this particular aspect during the fact that the Supreme Court did hand down the Hamm decision involving civil rights prosecution as trespasses and so forth. 
    The Solicitor obviously was of the opinion that he could not prosecute the case on the merits.

    No, as far as the -- a motion to quash as you brought up before and asking Mr. Penny about that. 
    That would be for procedural defects only and not for defects on the merits so to speak due to the fact that as this Court did in Hamm --

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well, then if he didn't want to be tried because of the lifetime and he move for dismissal on the grounds of not getting a speedy trial and the judge said, alright, that's true then the only acquittal he would have would be because he didn't give a speedy trial, he wouldn't have an adjudication on the facts, would he?

    Mr. Andrew A. Vanore, Jr. 
    Well, it would start out as an adjudication on the facts if Your Honor pleases, that would be the only way this case could be finally terminated and that would be for the Solicitor to bring the case and put it on the trial docket for trial by a jury. 
    And during the process of the trial, this is an affirmative defense that the defendant has not been afforded of right, or his right his constitutional right to a speedy trial because the state has let us say waited three years without a good reason before trying this individual. 
    As far as the State of North Carolina's position is, the defendant is entitled to a speedy trial if there is to be a trial. 
    Now, as far as the question concerning itself with the fact that this is hanging over his head indefinitely there's no doubt about that. 
    But practically speaking the state takes the position that a nolle prosequi with leave is in effect a dismissal.

    I was just like to suggest one thing if Your Honor pleases as Mr. Penny mentioned to the Court, it would seem that where a nolle prosequi with leave is requested by the Solicitor and the is no objection by the defendant that certainly would be proper as in this case where the defendant has objected quite candidly perhaps this Court should allow some redress to that.
