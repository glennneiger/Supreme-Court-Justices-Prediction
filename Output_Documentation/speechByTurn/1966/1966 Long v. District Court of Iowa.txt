    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    No. 77, Lawrence Long, petitioner v. The District Court of Iowa in for Lee County, Fort Madison Island. 
    Mr. Carlson?

    Mr. Ronald L. Carlson 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.The petitioner, Your Honor, in this case is an indigent inmate at Fort Madison Penitentiary in Iowa and I have been appointed by this Court to present his course to the Court. 
    Petitioner, Mr. Long was arrested in Iowa on April 9th of 1963. 
    On April 10th he was taken before the Justice of the Peace where his preliminary occurrence. 
    At that time, he was not represented by counsel and as the record shows in the case, a plea of “guilty” was recorded. 
    The petitioner being indigent, Your Honors, was incarcerated for some six months before he came up for trial in October of 1963. 
    At that time, no less than 11 questions were directed at the petitioner concerning admissions that he made at the preliminary hearing. 
    Some of these questions were objected to and the objections were sustained but others he was forced to answer. 
    He was convicted of larceny in Iowa and the jury there sets the amount of the thing in value which he stole in this case, it was a pump which was valued at $25. 
    He was sentenced to four months in penitentiary for a term not to exceed five years.

    Justice William O. Douglas 
    Did he ever counsel during the trial?
speaker="ronald_l_carlson" startTime="111.799" stopTime="289.970">
    Mr. Ronald L. Carlson 
    Yes, Mr. Justice Douglas, he had appointed counsel at his trial, and this was only trial. 
    Now his court-appointed counsel did, Your Honor, appeal the case but the appeal did not raise the White vs. Maryland point which we have urged to the Court that exists on his habeas corpus claims here. 
    The appeal on the case involved itself for the lack of speedy trial. 
    The Iowa Supreme Court deemed his delay regrettable in getting to trial but affirmed his conviction and thereafter, well, at Fort Madison Penitentiary, he filed the action which now brings this cause to the Court. 
    He filed a Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus, alleging certain claims including the fact that his court appointed counsel was incompetent and that he was denied his White vs. Maryland rights at the preliminary hearing. 
    The Lee County District Court, which is the county wherein Fort Madison Penitentiary is located, set the case for an evidentiary hearing and the cause came on for evidentiary trial at which time witnesses were called and evidence taken on the petitioner's habeas corpus claims. 
    The Lee County District Court dismissed the petitioner's application for habeas corpus in an order stating that the petitioner had not carried the burden or for other reasons the claims were not viable. 
    The petitioner filed a timely Notice of Appeal from his denial of habeas corpus and thereafter filed an Application for a Transcript of his evidentiary hearing for purposes of preparing a meaningful appeal on the habeas corpus denial to the Supreme Court of Iowa. 
    The Lee County District Court passed upon the Application for Transcript and it stated in an Order denying the Application for Transcript that habeas corpus being a civil proceeding in Iowa, there was no right to the transcript of the evidentiary hearing. 
    Petitioner then filed a Petition for Certiorari to the Supreme Court of Iowa -- his appeal is still pending at this time, Your Honors -- requesting that the Supreme Court of Iowa enter an order directing that he receive a transcript of his evidentiary hearing. 
    The Supreme Court of Iowa at this time summarily denied his Application for Certiorari, citing to the case of Waldon vs. District Court. 
    In the cited case, the Waldon case, credence was again given to the civil label of habeas corpus. 
    As a means, we submit of denying constitutionally protected rights. 
    Petitioner then filed a Petition for Certiorari to this Court and the matter comes on for hearing on the question of, is the petitioner entitled on an appeal from a habeas corpus denial to a transcript under equal protection of the law?

    Mr. Ronald L. Carlson 
    There are two propositions that apply here, Your Honors. 
    We take the position that under Iowa Rule 340a which we have cited the Court to that the rule does call for the filing of a transcript to present any evidentiary record to the Iowa Supreme Court on an appeal of this kind. 
    Now the attorney general takes the position here that Iowa has in several indigent cases, permitted the indigents to type up from memory of their own narrative of the facts and therefore, it is not necessary that the attorney general contends to file this transcript. 
    However, it's our position that the informal waiver on a few prior unreported cases does not constitute a standing waiver or notice to this indigent that he need not file the transcript which is called for in that rule.

    The appeal has not been heard by the Iowa Supreme Court?
speaker="ronald_l_carlson" startTime="533.268" stopTime="536.806">
    Mr. Ronald L. Carlson 
    No, Mr. Justice Harlan. 
    That appeal is still pending.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="536.806" stopTime="549.084">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    They thought that the transcript was necessary in order to enable them to deal with this White against Maryland and they have prior order as well.
speaker="ronald_l_carlson" startTime="549.084" stopTime="761.101">
    Mr. Ronald L. Carlson 
    Yes, they would although they have, as I say, denied our application for that transcript. 
    The petitioner himself tried to obtain the transcript. 
    Central to our position here, Your Honors, is the point that appeal is a matter of right in habeas corpus in Iowa. 
    The petitioner (Inaudible) was able to appeal his denial of habeas corpus and obtain full and meaningful appellant review. 
    The petitioner, Mr. Long -- the indigent and Mr. Long's position is precluded from doing that. 
    He – basically, he is in the position, we submit, of the petitioner in Lane vs. Brown or the defendants in Griffin vs. Illinois being foreclosed from meaningful appeal because of the lack of transcript. 
    And, we submit that it is clear the Griffin is made applicable for post-conviction remedies by virtue of Smith vs. Bennett, which case arose out of our jurisdiction as well as Lane vs. Brown. 
    Now the question is, is a transcript necessary to obtain meaningful review from your habeas corpus denial? 
    Well, the Iowa Supreme Court has recently passed on this connection in connection with direct appeals. 
    In the case of Weaver v. Herrick, which I have cited in my Brief, the Iowa Supreme Court was presented with the question, what is necessary for meaningful review under the Iowa rules? 
    And the Court said in Weaver vs. Herrick that to provide the indigent with any kind of meaningful appeal under the Iowa appeal rules, a full transcript is necessary. 
    That is the rule on Iowa on direct appeals. 
    Question is, why does a different rule prevail in habeas corpus? 
    The reason is, we submit, because of a continuing misconception of the habeas corpus process. 
    We point out that in Mr. Justice Clark's opinion, representing the unanimous consensus of the Court in Smith vs. Bennett, Court said that the choice of labels should not continue to persist as a means for suppressing constitutionally protected rights. 
    However, even after that decision, as we pointed out, the use of the civil label continues to persist to suppress rights which are necessary in this case to obtain meaningful appeal. 
    Now, the counsel for the respondent here has raised some possible substitutes for a transcript. 
    We submit that these are inadequate that they in no way give the indigent petitioner as meaningful appeal as the petitioner with funds, first of all, use of the original trial transcript, which may be available to the petitioner here. 
    This will not reflect claims not contained within the trial record itself. 
    Such things perhaps as prejudicial pre-trial or during trial publicity which may not be in the trial transcript and may be far from erasable from habeas corpus. 
    Such things as threats or corrosions on a defendant which will not show up in the printed pages of the record, may properly be raisable in habeas corpus and therefore, the trial transcript would not operate there.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="761.101" stopTime="763.838">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Are there issues as a kind of that?
speaker="ronald_l_carlson" startTime="763.838" stopTime="798.923">
    Mr. Ronald L. Carlson 
    The issue of that kind, no, Your Honor. 
    Those are matters that I'm simply using to illustrate the point. 
    The point that is involved here is, however, this White vs. Maryland point which does not show up in the trial transcript which is a point in this case. 
    And I must say the attorney general here has commendably, upon the review of this record, basically conceded the point that it appears that there was a White vs. Maryland violation here. 
    That will not be in the trial transcript. 
    Therefore, an evidentiary transcript –

    Mr. Ronald L. Carlson 
    No, there is not, Your Honor. 
    In fact, as I say I think counsel here has commendably, upon a review of the record, brought this to our attention.

    Justice Abe Fortas 
    (Voice overlap) stipulation, now the attorney general that when that appeal is heard, you will say that the trial court is in error. 
    You find him to be handcuffed so you are probably over.
speaker="ronald_l_carlson" startTime="1077.819" stopTime="1095.712">
    Mr. Ronald L. Carlson 
    Well, I submit to Your Honor, now. 
    I suppose the concession here goes to the point that he did not have counsel. 
    There is the additional matter for litigation as to whether or not that was used against to me adversely or prejudicially at the trial of the cause.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1095.712" stopTime="1097.983">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    And was that -- that was in the habeas hearing?
speaker="ronald_l_carlson" startTime="1097.983" stopTime="1099.538">
    Mr. Ronald L. Carlson 
    Yes, I believe it was, Your Honor.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1099.538" stopTime="1108.153">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    And was that -- the question whether it was or was not used on the trial of the court. 
    Is that also resulting as an issue, as a question of fact?
speaker="ronald_l_carlson" startTime="1108.153" stopTime="1152.902">
    Mr. Ronald L. Carlson 
    Yes -- well, no, no it was not. 
    It was not, Your Honor. 
    The trial court's order on this says, “We find the petitioner had counsel at all relevant times” and that's the end of this finding of fact as I recall on that point. 
    So that's where we are left but -- this is why I am saying, Mr. Justice Harlan, that this concession will probably not be the end of the matter. 
    There was also that additional point of White vs. Maryland to be litigated as to whether or not it was prejudicially used against the petitioner. 
    In addition to that, if that claim would be lost, there are other claims in the petitioners' habeas corpus concerning incompetency of counsel and things of that nature which we contend the transcript is necessary to show.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="1152.902" stopTime="1187.441">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Well, I don't know, Mr. Carlson, but it looks to me as that the attorney general on page 20 expressed pretty clearly reserves the conclusion of law. 
    It says that petitioner probably is entitled to relief in habeas corpus in the White against Maryland. 
    That would cover a reservation of the question as to whether the admissions made with preliminary examinations were used against him at trial.
speaker="ronald_l_carlson" startTime="1187.441" stopTime="1208.298">
    Mr. Ronald L. Carlson 
    Yes, as I see the concession here, Mr. Justice Fortas, it is clear on counsel that on the White vs. Maryland point, as you properly pointed out, with some reservation. 
    We contend also, Your Honors, that the trial transcript in habeas corpus now, trial transcript in habeas corpus –

    You don't need the transcript of the habeas hearing with respect to whether you had counsel for preliminary hearing because it's been a concession.

    So now, why do you really need the transcript in habeas hearing? 
    I agree with you that this Iowa, the State, it seems to me has conceded that if you can demonstrate a need on appeal for the transcript that you are entitled of transcript.

    Now, the experience of the States following Smith vs. Bennett and Lane vs. Brown has been moving in the direction of the position that we here advocate. 
    At least 30 States give habeas corpus appeals as a matter of right just as Iowa. 
    And of those 30, 26 gave a transcript of the habeas corpus hearing to the petitioner in the position of the petitioner whom I represent. 
    So, we think that the experience of the States is moving in the very direction of the position we raised to this court. 
    We do not say that the Court -- that the Court is not or that the States are not free to put on limiting devices on perhaps the number of writs that can be filed to otherwise police what they're -- the amount of habeas corpus applications made but what we are saying here is, that where a screening device depends upon poverty as this one does. 
    This is an improper screening device.

   Argument of Don R. Bennett
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1681.097" stopTime="1682.466">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Bennett?
speaker="don_r_bennett" startTime="1682.466" stopTime="1804.610">
    Mr. Don R. Bennett 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    First of all, I'd like to go to the point that has been commented upon by several justices so I don't lose it. 
    Did Mr. Carlson was referring to the District Court's order denying Long's petition for writ of habeas corpus insofar as that Court found that Long was represented by counsel at the preliminary hearing? 
    I believe I am free in reading this language to have made the concession on behalf of the State because I think the language of the Court's order had self indicates that counsel wasn't there. 
    And if I could take the liberty on page 30 of the record and without going into the whole hearing down in the last paragraph, about middle way through, “Court further finds that as to objection no. 2 that he was denied counsel at the time of preliminary hearing, the county attorney (Inaudible) contacted the attorney for the then defendant, Patrick Lied, and said attorney advised that he would not be present and informed the county attorney that he would waive the defendant to the grand jury”. 
    So, the Court's own finding shows that an attorney was not physically present in the courtroom; that the county attorney had called the attorney and he said, “Yes, I'll represent the man but I waive him to the grand jury”. 
    And of course, after they got into the room where the Justice of Peace was at, the Justice of Peace accepted “plea of guilty”. 
    And the Justice of Peace in the State of Iowa has no jurisdiction to accept a guilty plea in a felony case; this is why we have White vs. Maryland comparable situation.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1804.610" stopTime="1829.158">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    I don't quite understand that, this language that follows what you read to as on the bottom of page 30 of the record. 
    Where it goes along and says that “The Court finds that no rights were lost at this time” and that “he was actually represented” and the Iowa Supreme Court found on the case of State against Long, he was at all times represented by counsel. 
    It seems inconsistent.
speaker="don_r_bennett" startTime="1829.158" stopTime="1845.603">
    Mr. Don R. Bennett 
    I think, Mr. Justice Stewart that what the trial court is saying is that he was at all times represented in the sense that the Iowa Supreme Court had made the same statement in its opinion affirming the conviction on direct appeal.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1845.603" stopTime="1846.927">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    That that he had a lawyer?
speaker="don_r_bennett" startTime="1846.927" stopTime="1848.609">
    Mr. Don R. Bennett 
    Yes, physically in --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1848.609" stopTime="1852.502">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    He had a lawyer but the lawyer decided not to show up there?
speaker="don_r_bennett" startTime="1852.502" stopTime="1852.888">
    Mr. Don R. Bennett 
    Right.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1852.888" stopTime="1854.611">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    But he was represented by a lawyer.
speaker="don_r_bennett" startTime="1854.611" stopTime="1895.035">
    Mr. Don R. Bennett 
    Well, as the Court's opinion indicates, at the very moment, the man was taken there for a preliminary hearing, that was when the lawyer was contacted. 
    The county attorney got in touch with this lawyer on the telephone. 
    As a matter of fact, if this is confusing to you and I mean I can't of course that's in the record. 
    This is exactly what happened -- they brought the man in for a preliminary hearing, at which time a County attorney went out and called Patrick Lied, who was a local attorney in Oskaloosa, Iowa where this took place. 
    Mr. Lied said, “Yes, I'll represent the man but I waive him over the grand jury”. 
    So I just want --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1895.035" stopTime="1915.657">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    I suppose, this is really a holding that the defendant was represented by counsel at all crucial times or relevant times and that then at the preliminary hearing, this doesn't have to deal a kind of a time in Iowa where you need to be represented by counsel.
speaker="don_r_bennett" startTime="1915.657" stopTime="1937.116">
    Mr. Don R. Bennett 
    The attorney general for whatever that is were, has ruled subsequent to White vs. Maryland, that counsel must be appointed at a preliminary hearing at least to this extent. 
    But the counsel was not appointed. 
    And if the man, “enters a plea of guilty, and then that plea of guilty or admission of--

    By virtue of this court proceeding.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    As long as he doesn't lose anything at the preliminary hearing as long as he pleads not guilty. 
    The attorney general hasn't said that under White against Maryland, you need to have a counsel at the preliminary hearing.
speaker="don_r_bennett" startTime="1956.783" stopTime="1976.530">
    Mr. Don R. Bennett 
    Well, he has ruled that counsel ought to be appointed at preliminary hearing because of White vs. Maryland.

    What the record shows is an attempt by the county attorney, the prosecuting attorney, in cross examining Lawrence Long when he took the stand to get Lawrence Long to admit that he made some admissions before the Justice of Peace. 
    But it's neither Black nor White. 
    It's not clear as to whether White vs. Maryland has been violated in my estimation. 
    Now here's what we are here talking about this morning. 
    It's a 28-paged transcript that recorded the testimony at the habeas corpus hearing, and I'm not saying this case is moot because I ordered this transcript after certiorari was granted and it has not been made available to Lawrence Long. 
    Obviously, that's what we're here talking about. 
    Now I've got to admit, and I'm going to admit as practical matter, that it isn't too practical to have now in retrospect spent some $3,000 or $4,000 probably to attempt to justify the denial of this $25 transcript. 
    But be that as it may, this Court has said time and time again and so numerous that I don't mean to waive aside any cases since the Court is not concerned with whether the State is impractical but whether the State has denied this individual particularly Lawrence Long due process, equal protection by not making available to him a free copy, a copy without cause in this transcript.

    Justice Abe Fortas 
    But what is the rule in Iowa, this matter -- if there is one formulated so to tell us those? 
    There's an opinion to the Supreme Court of Iowa from denial of habeas corpus?
speaker="don_r_bennett" startTime="2143.487" stopTime="2144.246">
    Mr. Don R. Bennett 
    That is right.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="2144.246" stopTime="2169.437">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    There is a request here and I take it as one of the separate ancillary or collateral proceeding done by application in the District Court in Iowa and then petitioner's certiorari was filed from the denial of that application and this is to say the application for the habeas corpus transcript, is that right?
speaker="don_r_bennett" startTime="2169.437" stopTime="2252.622">
    Mr. Don R. Bennett 
    Yes, Mr. Justice Fortas. 
    Physically what happened was, after the petition for habeas corpus was denied -- there had been a hearing and it was denied -- then, Lawrence Long per se filed at that time with a proper notice of appeal with the Iowa Supreme Court. 
    So that now that gave the Iowa Court jurisdiction to review the denial of this petition. 
    Simultaneously with filing this notice, the petitioner made an application to the trial court that denied the petition. 
    He said, “I want to be a free hearing transcript” and incidentally, “I want counsel to assist me in connection with the appeal”. 
    And that's an issue which is in the petition but what this Court denied, unaccepted. 
    Alright, the trial court said, “That particularly your application is denied because there is no provision of law” and I'm required to furnish him of the pre-trial transcript. 
    Alright, so then Lawrence Long says well, “You can't do that because of this line of decisions, Griffin vs. Illinois on down true”. 
    He filed then a petition or an application for certiorari in the Iowa Supreme Court. 
    Certiorari in the Iowa Supreme Court lies to correct illegal action on behalf of the lower tribunal. 
    So he is saying that –- Lawrence Long was saying the lower tribunal acted illegally, unconstitutionally.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="2252.622" stopTime="2257.653">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    The only part of the case that we have before us is a denial of the certiorari.
speaker="don_r_bennett" startTime="2257.653" stopTime="2258.682">
    Mr. Don R. Bennett 
    That's right. 
    Now --
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="2258.682" stopTime="2264.536">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Because the Iowa Supreme Court still is considering. 
    It has before it the merits of the appeal.
speaker="don_r_bennett" startTime="2264.536" stopTime="2311.148">
    Mr. Don R. Bennett 
    Now in footnote 5 of our Brief, I pointed this out because I think conceptually it's very important that the Court knows/understands that on appeal that the appeal still is pending. 
    Now we could have moved to dismiss the appeal. 
    When Long didn't file his record, he had a certain length of time within which to file this record -- we could have moved to dismiss his appeal but obviously, we're not going to do that whenever he has made application to this Court for relief contending the denial of constitutional rights. 
    So, he still has an appeal there. 
    Now, if he is or if he is not entitled to a transcript, he still has the Iowa Supreme Court to turn to, to review the denial of this habeas corpus petitioner.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="2311.148" stopTime="2329.817">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Now is the rule or is there a rule on the Iowa Supreme Court, decisions of this Iowa Supreme Court in no event will that Court order that a transcript of habeas corpus proceeding be made available --
speaker="don_r_bennett" startTime="2329.817" stopTime="2329.885">
    Mr. Don R. Bennett 
    No, Mr. Justice --
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="2329.885" stopTime="2332.067">

speaker="don_r_bennett" startTime="2332.067" stopTime="2345.719">
    Mr. Don R. Bennett 
    No, Mr. Justice Fortas. 
    It's pretty universal that the trial courts will not give a free copy of the habeas hearing transcript. 
    On the other hand, there's nothing to keep.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="2345.719" stopTime="2349.372">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Well, how about -- any holding in the Iowa Supreme Court?
speaker="don_r_bennett" startTime="2349.372" stopTime="2351.407">
    Mr. Don R. Bennett 
    Not to my knowledge.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="2351.407" stopTime="2353.016">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Nothing one way or the other.
speaker="don_r_bennett" startTime="2353.016" stopTime="2392.973">
    Mr. Don R. Bennett 
    Well, yes. 
    In denying this petitioner, in denying this application for certiorari, the Iowa Supreme Court cited Walden vs. District Court which Mr. Carlson has referred to. 
    Now, Walden vs. District Court was concerned with the appointment of counsel for an indigent in a habeas action. 
    And Mr. Carlson rightly points out that the Iowa Court talks in terms of the civil liability but I don't think it's that clear, I mean do you recall that when this Court decided Smith vs. Bennett, it indicated that it wasn't going to be quibble with this nomenclature whether it would be so a criminal is right or --
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="2392.973" stopTime="2408.701">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    But the Iowa Supreme Court has never for example said that “We will make a case by case determination and it doesn't say that in this particular case, there's no showing that the transcript is needed?
speaker="don_r_bennett" startTime="2408.701" stopTime="2409.811">
    Mr. Don R. Bennett 
    No, it does not say that.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="2409.811" stopTime="2429.504">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    It's a broad -- we are confronted with the broad rule of law here to the effect that in no event will the Iowa Supreme Court reverse a trial court's holding that --
speaker="don_r_bennett" startTime="2429.504" stopTime="2431.478">
    Mr. Don R. Bennett 
    I do not know -- excuse me.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="2431.478" stopTime="2434.654">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    -- transcript will not be furnished on habeas corpus.
speaker="don_r_bennett" startTime="2434.654" stopTime="2468.369">
    Mr. Don R. Bennett 
    I do not know that that is entirely accurate because the petition for certiorari, petition as it was filed with the Iowa Supreme Court as well as the application to the trial court simply as a conclusary allegation that he needs the transcript. 
    There was nothing beyond it that we would have to assume but perhaps, had there been a stronger showing on behalf of the inmate that he really needed the transcript, that he couldn't get the record up to the Court in any other way, may be the Court would have granted the certiorari.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="2468.369" stopTime="2479.736">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Can you refer a standing case in which Iowa Supreme Court has ordered a transcript to be furnished in these circumstances?
speaker="don_r_bennett" startTime="2479.736" stopTime="2515.504">
    Mr. Don R. Bennett 
    Not directly in point, Your Honor. 
    I can refer you to all of the cases in Volume 256 of the Iowa Reports, dealing with habeas corpus matters. 
    I went back and checked them. 
    I put some of the orders in appendix to this Brief. 
    In every one of those cases, the petitioner proceeded per se and everyone of the Supreme Court relaxed the rule regarding the record, regarding the Briefs in some respects or the other.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2515.504" stopTime="2526.919">
    Justice Byron R. White

    Mr. Don R. Bennett 
    Well, I think to say that it is civil is irrelevant to the real issue here, now we can take --
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="2532.788" stopTime="2549.087">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    And would you go on and say that this petitioner could demonstrate satisfactorily to you that for a meaningful appeal, you needed the habeas corpus transcript that he is entitled to it?

    Mr. Don R. Bennett 
    Well, no, they're not. 
    But part of our argument here is that the appeal is still pending and the rules in the Civil Procedure which are applicable to habeas appeals are flexible enough that this man may very well be and we will get an adequate record before the Court.

    Of course then the Supreme Court says, “Well, this record is not good enough for us, we can't tell you or we cant' decide this thing. 
    There's no transcript here. 
    We can't give him the transcript because of civil proceeding, are they foreclosed by their prior decisions in saying that they will order up an adequate transcript of the habeas corpus proceeding?

speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="2686.085" stopTime="2696.783">

    (Inaudible)
speaker="don_r_bennett" startTime="2701.779" stopTime="2819.811">
    Mr. Don R. Bennett 
    No, let's go to the rules, Mr. Justice Clark. 
    Rule 340 which is the main rule and the one that's discussed on the Brief, provides that in a situation like this, shortly or promptly -- the appeal has been noted. 
    The appellant is to file a duplicate typewritten manuscript of so much of the record as is believed to be relevant to the appeal and at the same time he showed file of the trial transcript; in this case, this document. 
    It goes on to say that within the 20 days the other party can amend the record, make corrections and so forth and so on. And then after the time for amendment is up, then upon three days written notice, the proposed abstract, with whatever amendments or corrections there might be, can be submitted to trial court who heard the case. 
    And then, the language of the rule as in this, by the way, has statutory authority. 
    It's not just a rule. 
    It is that the trial court shall settle the record -- to the end of the abstract correctly shows the evidence and proceedings at the trial -- and I assume along with me just for a moment that the hearing transcript may not be filed as Rule 340 said and as I told you. 
    Well then, you have got a situation which I think was contemplated by the majority in Graper v. Washington, a situation where if this man, Lawrence Long, has the ability to remember the evidence at the hearing, he can prepare a narrative statement. 
    Now remember this man, at least we've got to assume if he has prepared applications and petitions and etcetera and etcetera. 
    Alright, I don't think he can't --
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="2819.811" stopTime="2823.439">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    He was personally there at the habeas corpus hearing, was he?
speaker="don_r_bennett" startTime="2823.439" stopTime="2827.740">
    Mr. Don R. Bennett 
    Yes, he would have to have been because a hearing was held at which he was to give his side.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="2827.740" stopTime="2830.947">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    And he was a witness there?
speaker="don_r_bennett" startTime="2830.947" stopTime="2871.594">
    Mr. Don R. Bennett 
    So assuming that the transcript may not be filed, at least, we have a situation where if he is capable, he could file a narrative statement of what he thinks the evidence shows. 
    Now, at the other side, in this case the county attorney doesn't agree that this was a way the evidence was shown. Well then, he's got the burden to comment, amend and correct. 
    Now what I think as even more important is, then when you got to get this thing before the trial court and the trial court is enjoined to settle any differences in that proposed abstract. 
    To the end of the abstract correctly shows the evidence in proceedings at the trial. 
    Now --

    We have a rule-making procedure which allows that and which is very briefly discussed in the Brief. 
    The statement of facts agreed to by both sides, a full narrative statement based perhaps on the trial judge's minutes taken before trial or on the court reporters untranscribed notes. 
    Now I have suggested that this need not be filed and that the trial court is enjoined to settle that record. 
    To the end of that show, the evidence is correct. 
    Now, the trial court has jurisdiction over and control of his court reporter and there's nothing that keep him from calling that book reporter in the –

    Mr. Don R. Bennett 
    Alright, I think this brings to the third point. 
    I just want to spend at least a couple of seconds on and that's his trial record right here. 
    Now, in Draper vs. Washington, this Court has made it quite clear, the majority of the court, that is not necessary to furnish a transcript to an indigent if the transcript is not germane to the contentions which were made. 
    Draper filed a motion setting forth his contentions and why he needed the transcript. 
    Alright, here, Lawrence Long filed a petition and he set forth certain contentions. 
    In fact, he set forth specifically filed. 
    One is the White vs. Maryland contention. 
    Alright, at that plea, a guilty was entered at the trial, this is the best source. 
    This will tell you not anything that happened at the habeas corpus hearing. 
    You look to the original trial transcript to find out whether White vs. Maryland had been --

    Mr. Don R. Bennett 
    What's raised -- you can see that from the trial court's judgment denying the petitioner for habeas corpus. 
    He sets the five areas out so we know it's been raised there. 
    But the most relevant source to (Inaudible) and secondly, he says he had incompetent counsel and that he checked the petition, he says the comments the petitioner's court-appointed attorney is challenged in the question of competence here goes only to the said attorney's conduct and action and representation of the petitioner in his criminal trial. 
    Where else would you want to -- what more relevant source would you have to see how his attorney behaved than right here in the trial transcript?

    Counsel wasn't there, went on and then these things happened at the preliminary hearing and waiver gets you all (Inaudible) problems there and anything else, does it? 
    Don't they have to be developed at the -- if the State is going to rely on the waiver, I would suppose the facts would have to be develop at the habeas hearing. 
    You are relying here as I understood you when you opened your argument, say you are.

    Well, you could take the same position, in all fairness, in the Federal habeas corpus petition as you have taken here. 
    The issue would make up the same way: you just need transcript at all in order to have a meaningful appeal. 
    And there -- and because there is a meaningful State procedure available where in to vindicate its constitutional rights. 
    You could make up the same sort of an issue there as here. 
    But let me ask you. 
    As far as this record shows, in this case that is presented here on the petitioner for certiorari, as far as we were concerned, we were reviewing a decision of the trial court of Iowa because the writ, the appeal has been denied and we were reviewing a ruling of the trial court entered after a habeas corpus hearing that this man was not entitled to a transcript in any event because this was a civil proceeding. 
    And that issue, and as far as we knew, and as far as we still know, that is the law of Iowa.

    Mr. Ronald L. Carlson 
    Thank you, Your Honor. 
    Your Honors, I will briefly addressed myself to a point that Mr. Justice Fortas and Mr. Justice White have inquired into and that is, “Has the Iowa Supreme Court ever afforded transcripts in habeas corpus?” 
    If I could respond with perhaps a brief quote, Your Honor, from the latest authority I could find on the point which is Hoskins vs. Bennett which they say -- here the petitioner also had requested a transcript of public expenses in habeas corpus. 
    The trial court said that habeas corpus is a civil proceeding and there is no provision in the Iowa law for a transcript to be evidence in such cases at public expense. 
    This is true.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3974.989" stopTime="3976.740">

    And what -- when was that?
speaker="ronald_l_carlson" startTime="3988.415" stopTime="3991.199">

    1964.

    Mr. Ronald L. Carlson 
    Yes. 
    Also, Your Honor, in the case of Walden vs. District Court which our Supreme Court ordered in this case, cites 2 gives credence to this civil labeling of habeas corpus. Mr. Justice White also asked the question, had the Iowa Court ever been faced with the potential substitutes, the bystanders bills and so forth that Mr. Bennett here has suggested in this case, we point to the case of Weaver vs. Herrick, decided by the Iowa Supreme Court in 1966 in which the question came to the Supreme Court, what is necessary for a meaningful appeal to indigents in Iowa? 
    This, in connection with direct criminal causes, first appeal, Court responded emphatically. 
    Of course, the transcript is essential for this kind of appeal. 
    The reason they don't do it in habeas corpus we submit, is because of the civil labeling.

    Yes, but what if this Court just took the -- this one as far as saying the -- what I understand with the law of Iowa to be at least the decision, the rule of law in the decision which we are reviewing said that: this is a civil proceedings, no transcript. 
    We reverse that and Iowa must have observe another rule.

    Justice Byron R. White
