    Mr. Francis X. Beytagh, Jr. 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    To continue from yesterday, I'd like for a few minutes to discuss Reynolds versus Sims. 
    Now Reynolds and its companions were of course state legislative cases and the cases before the Court presently are -- involved local governmental bodies. 
    But in our view, Reynolds was grounded on the basic principle that the citizen's vote could not be debased or deluded in effect on the basis where he resides. 
    And that they touched on a democratic government as equal representation for equal numbers of people. 
    Now in our view, those basic constitutional principles are just as applicable at the local level as they are at the state level. 
    It seems --

    Mr. Francis X. Beytagh, Jr. 
    It seems to me, Mr. Justice Harlan, that at least prima facie every time you have a situation in which a body is elected under state law by the people. 
    And the members of that body are elected from districts. 
    That those districts should be substantially full in population or that an equivalent arrangement which would accord appropriate weight to the votes be established.

speaker="francis_x_beytagh_jr" startTime="109.651" stopTime="136.919">
    Mr. Francis X. Beytagh, Jr. 
    I would think so. 
    It seems to me that you may reach a point where some concept of de minimis is involved but it seems to me that that's a judgment for the states and the local bodies to make. 
    If they decide that they want to have the body elected, presumably it's supposed to represent the constituency that's electing it.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="136.919" stopTime="183.910">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Would you evaluate the purposes of a decision one of these issues? 
    Would you evaluate the functions performed by the body? 
    And if so, what criteria would you take into account or would you apply this for all the elected bodies regardless of what they do? 
    For example, if they're purely advisory, number one. 
    Number two, suppose that they're purely administrative as distinguished from exercising legislative or quasi legislative powers. 
    And number 3, suppose a -- you exercise legislative or quasi legislative powers. 
    You're not suggesting those three are the right categories but --

    -- I am asking you whether you have described any importance to the function of the body?
speaker="francis_x_beytagh_jr" startTime="189.971" stopTime="233.526">
    Mr. Francis X. Beytagh, Jr. 
    I think the functions are important. 
    I think the difficulty has to do with setting up some workable criteria. 
    How do you decide whether a body is legislative or quasi legislative? 
    It seems to me that a rule that would subscribe only bodies exercising something like substantial or important or basic governmental powers could be evolved. 
    But the problem of trying to apply that rule in each individual case it seems to me would be a never ending one.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="233.526" stopTime="246.117">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Well I understand that but I was wondering whether you had given consideration to the functional problem and what's your observation would be difficult as it may be to apply it?
speaker="francis_x_beytagh_jr" startTime="246.117" stopTime="276.525">
    Mr. Francis X. Beytagh, Jr. 
    Well, it seems to me that if the state of a local body decides that its members are going to be elected and they're going to be elected from districts, then they've made a judgment that that body is intended to be representative of the electorate. 
    And if they feel that it's important enough to handle it that way and the people feel that it's important enough to handle it that way, then I'd be inclined to think that the Court should go along with that judgment. 
    And now --

    Mr. Francis X. Beytagh, Jr. 
    This isn't is -- I don't think it's substantial problems that might first appear because as we point out the bodies that are elected and are elected from districts are generally those bodies that perform important substantial governmental functions. 
    Then as you shade off into bodies that various kinds of special districts, particularly those who would like taxing power, they're generally not elected from districts anyhow. 
    Very few of them are.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="328.063" stopTime="330.711">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Well, the Sailors case for example --

    Mr. Francis X. Beytagh, Jr.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    The point I gather that my Brother Fortas is suggesting, my questions is this that in Reynolds against Sims, to which you're now directing your attention, it was clear that what was there involved were representative, legislative bodies. 
    But we're now embarking under the unchartered area, many -- an intimate drive different local units with various purposes. 
    And take for example a conservancy district with the precise and limited powers in a certain county let us say, where it may be of utmost importance that each unit in our county be represented on the conservative -- conservancy district in order for us to -- in order for it to be able to perform its precise function of allocating the war or the -- whatever natural resource its concerned with. 
    With -- in other words, quite a different purpose from an ordinary state legislature with broad and generalized legislative power.

    Yes, sir but --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="433.997" stopTime="442.317">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    You're suggesting that the same Reynolds against Sims rule should inflexibly apply all the way down the line regardless of purpose, is that --
speaker="francis_x_beytagh_jr" startTime="442.317" stopTime="466.629">
    Mr. Francis X. Beytagh, Jr. 
    I don't think it's so inflexible, Mr. Justice Stewart, because before it would apply, a judgment has to be made at the state or at the local level that this body will be composed to members elected or chosen in a way that would indicate that the intention is that it'd be a body that represents the people that it'd be elected. 
    And they don't have to do it that way.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    (Inaudible) question to that, let's say that the -- it's decided that the best kind of representation on this imaginary conservancy district of mine is to have one representative from each geographical unit affected by -- for the distribution of this resource, water, regardless of how many people reside in each geographical district. 
    Now, if that's the policy decision made, that's what's made. 
    But you're telling us, I gather, that that would be unconstitutional.
speaker="francis_x_beytagh_jr" startTime="501.721" stopTime="549.442">
    Mr. Francis X. Beytagh, Jr. 
    When you get to a special function district such as a conservancy or a sewerage or a drainage district, it seems to me that it isn't out of the question, if a rational basis is ordered by the state in setting the thing up to allow some deviations from a population basis. 
    But it seems to me that until you reach a position in which you have a rational basis established, and shown, and demonstrated, then as a prima facie matter that these bodies as well as the general function bodies should be covered by the equal population principles so long as they're elected from districts.

    Justice Abe Fortas 
    One of the -- it's a very important question on which I hope would have the help of the United States. 
    And you're now saying that if it's a special purpose district, as I understand you or a special purpose body elected under state law, then this Court ought to take a look at whether the method provided for selecting the members of that body has a rational basis which is a substantial modification of --
speaker="francis_x_beytagh_jr" startTime="587.761" stopTime="588.166">

    (Inaudible) before.
speaker="francis_x_beytagh_jr" startTime="588.916" stopTime="641.253">
    Mr. Francis X. Beytagh, Jr. 
    No, sir. 
    We developed in our brief in a section directed towards special districts, several pages of various distinctions that might be suggested or made. 
    We say in that part of the brief that in our view, as a prima facie matter where they're elected from districts, we feel that the principle ought to apply. 
    What I said is that if a state in a given situation of a special function district can show that it's set up in a particular way that it deviates to some extent from population because the impact of the body, when it does, relates to certain people living in one part of the area in a different way than it does to those living elsewhere, then I think that question is open. 
    And I don't think that --
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="641.253" stopTime="697.611">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Well, why wouldn't that apply to a situation let's say like Sailor? 
    Well, let's suppose that -- let's bury the facts a little bit. 
    And let's suppose that the county school board, I suppose is a very large county geographically. 
    And that some of the school districts, which are small in terms of population were in remote parts of the county. 
    And the state says that because of the difference in the problems of the school district located in the urban centers in these remote school districts, we think we ought to have one representative from each district on the county school board. 
    Now, is it your position that we should or we should not take that --
speaker="francis_x_beytagh_jr" startTime="697.611" stopTime="698.127">
    Mr. Francis X. Beytagh, Jr. 
    Well, I'd --

speaker="francis_x_beytagh_jr" startTime="699.516" stopTime="704.862">
    Mr. Francis X. Beytagh, Jr.

    Yes.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="707.618" stopTime="725.401">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    -- the state says, should we then evaluate whether there is or is not a justification just as you say we should in the case of special purpose districts?
speaker="francis_x_beytagh_jr" startTime="725.401" stopTime="782.431">
    Mr. Francis X. Beytagh, Jr. 
    Well, I would think that if the body has, as we point out in the brief, the body has taxing power overall the people. 
    And it's a little bit difficult to say that they can do this thing. 
    The kind of bodies that I'm really talking about are ones that based -- board qualifications on things like property ownership. 
    Some of these districts, it seems to me, that -- that may makes -- that they may make some sense because the impact of their action is on people that own property. 
    And their taxing power relates to people that own property and not to the elected generally. 
    But I had -- I have great difficulty with the hypothetical that you've posed because it seems to me that it's not a necessary conclusion that you represent each school district just because some of the school districts may have unique problems. 
    You may ensure that some of them that have these unique problems have some representations.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="782.431" stopTime="841.069">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Well, I don't want to press anymore on this line but I want to suggest to you that there's a difference between whether the reason is valid and whether the reason is legally relevant. 
    And you started of with an absolute proposition with respect to something like the school district which should make reasons of a state may have for deviating from a one man, one vote formula, make those reasons irrelevant. 
    And then it wouldn't matter whether the reasons are good, bad, or indifferent that a state had. 
    And if the real question now -- I'm putting to use; whether there is any such thing in your judgment, your submission to us as a constitutionally acceptable reason for a state deviation from the one man, one vote rule.

    Mr. Francis X. Beytagh, Jr.

    And that's the difficult question it seems to me of the Sailors case in the elections scheme that exists there. 
    They argue that the county board is supposed to be representative of the school districts. 
    And therefore, since there isn't any right to vote conferred by state law, their -- the Reynolds principle doesn't apply. 
    I think its --

    The danger lies in sanctioning this kind of two-step election arrangement because I don't know what would happen if a state decided to set its state legislative apportionment of this way.

    I agree with that but as a policy matter, I think it's difficult to -- even if it didn't try to draw these lines between what does the local level's legislative and what is not.

    What was (Inaudible) with that system of electing judges by districts to use, the court, with statewide jurisdiction?
speaker="francis_x_beytagh_jr" startTime="1176.763" stopTime="1199.627">
    Mr. Francis X. Beytagh, Jr. 
    We point out in our brief in a fairly stance of footnote that there has been some litigation involving this question. 
    I don't think that in a general, the parlance, judges are intended to be representative even if they are elected. 
    I think it's a difficult problem. 
    I personally would come out holding that the equal population principle does not apply.

    Well, I don't understand if you would, why you would say it does apply to bodies like the tax board as such.

    Mr. Francis X. Beytagh, Jr. 
    Because as I said, it seems to me that you have to make a judgment when you get out on the extremes --
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="1221.809" stopTime="1228.063">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Now, what is -- what's the criteria of the judgment? 
    That they do or do not have legislative power?

    So that there is the relation between --

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Well, I don't follow. 
    I don't follow, what -- what's represent -- what does representative mean if it doesn't mean having some legislative power? 
    What does it mean?
speaker="francis_x_beytagh_jr" startTime="1249.125" stopTime="1290.741">
    Mr. Francis X. Beytagh, Jr. 
    Well, it seems to me that that representative means that that the state has made a judgment that there is a -- is the kind of relationship between the voter and the powers of the body or the person. 
    Thus, that this person acts in some respects in the place of the individual, the voter, and I don't think we think that judges do that. 
    I hope we don't. 
    And that's the way the Third Circuit came out in one of these cases but -- I don't know. 
    I think those are difficult questions and they're at the extreme difference. 
   
   
   
   Argument of Paul O. Strawhecker

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Strawhecker.
speaker="paul_o_strawhecker" startTime="1297.787" stopTime="1433.256">
    Mr. Paul O. Strawhecker 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    The 300 cases, I believe the Court is fully apprised of the -- let me say unusual circumstances, unique circumstances in the Sailors case. 
    I'm sure the Court understands thoroughly the constitutional questions that we raised. 
    Now we have one peculiar passage. 
    The Solicitor General says that to the fact of the question which unfortunately is in our case, is constitutionally insignificant and we certainly agree. 
    The difficulty is that the appellants have brought it here. 
    It is one of their claims or relief that the transfer which triggered this litigation, the transfer by the Kent County Board of Education, two Kentwood public schools that I represent (Inaudible) public schools is void. 
    And the relief I ask that this Court set that transfer aside. 
    Now, that means six and a half million dollars of valuation to my school district client and the fourteen room modern schoolhouse. 
    The three judges in the District Court were unanimous that at least the body was a de facto body and that the transfer should stand. 
    Now, whatever else happened in Sailors in Number 430? 
    I urged the Court to say that they affirm the three judges of the District Court and place -- prevent the transfer to stand. 
    One last word, we urged that a constitutionally apportioned legislature is more competent to determine the method of selecting its numerous diverse board or agencies in selecting the membership of it in peculiar circumstances that may exist and change from time to time in the state than any court.
