Travis v. United States

    Levis Travis, petitioner vs. United States.

   Argument of Justice Learned Hand
speaker="justice_learned_hand" startTime="11.557" stopTime="175.057">
    Mr. Justice Learned Hand 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may I please the Court. 
    Yesterday, before the recess, the Chief Justice asked me whether or what the police of the Department of State was with regard to newsman traveling to areas on which geographic restrictions had been imposed by the Department. 
    I’ve been advised that at least since 1957 it has been the unexceptional rule that these Departments apply in all cases that bonafide newsman representing the established news media will be given authority on request to travel on these areas. 
    Prior to 1957, that was the rule as to all areas other than Communist China. 
    And as far as Communist China is concerned, travel was almost completely restricted to that particular country. 
    Returning just briefly to the question of the construction of the statute on his face, our contention, our view that Section 1185’s provision that a traveler departing the United States must do so with a valid passport includes in that rule. 
    The fact that the passport must be valid to the country for which he is going is based not merely on the fact that the Secretary has so said and has applied that rule as it were extraneously to a passport. 
    We think that the destination of a traveler is really of the very essence of what a passport has historically has been. 
    The fact is that, the historical function of the passport has this Court recognized just long ago was Ersytechqui vs. Darse in 9 Peters is, as the document addressed by the Government of the United States to the Government of far nations, advising them that the bearer is a citizen of the United States and requesting that he be granted courtesy and safe travel in that foreign country. 
    If a passport is not valid and it’s so marked as being “Not Valid” to a particular country, it is in effect no communication to that country. 
    It’s not the Secretary of the State addressing the responsible officials there.

speaker="justice_learned_hand" startTime="197.254" stopTime="210.639">
    Mr. Justice Learned Hand 
    I think the first area restriction was really imposed way back in 1915 or really 1914 with regard to -- at the outbreak of World War I when –

    Mr. Justice Learned Hand 
    Well, I would like to develop may be more so on the succeeding case really the fact that there was a criminal penalty. 
    The problem so far is the administration of the statute is involved, Mr. Justice Fortas. 
    The other side of the fact that they were in effect two criminal statutes enacted both of which cover various forms of violation of area restriction.

    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Now, we’re dealing now on statute passed in 1952, is that right?
speaker="justice_learned_hand" startTime="241.794" stopTime="251.510">
    Mr. Justice Learned Hand 
    Yes, but it is a substantial re-enactment of the statute passed first on 1918 and then in 1941, both dealing specifically with war time situation.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="251.510" stopTime="292.913">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Well, in any of that, whether it’s back in 1915 or 1952, we have a situation here where they spend some -- I should think reasonable mind would have to use certainly one of them when – can seen that there’s an area of doubt about the criminal penalty that the authorization or criminal penalty in these circumstances. 
    I think we were told that in May of this year, a bill wasn’t reduced to remedy that petitions, that ambiguity. 
    Is that the first bill that’s been introduced on the subject?
speaker="justice_learned_hand" startTime="292.913" stopTime="306.808">
    Mr. Justice Learned Hand 
    No. 
    There had been a substantial series of bills, the Travis Brief, the petitioners Brief in this case cites almost 30 which were introduced between the 85th Congress and this past Congress.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="306.808" stopTime="313.836">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Well, how would you characterize the reason why none of those has been passed?
speaker="justice_learned_hand" startTime="313.836" stopTime="476.208">
    Mr. Justice Learned Hand 
    I would say very likely the reason why is that, the Congress may be does not want to go further than existing legislation in that area. 
    And I think also realistically of there are all sorts of statutes that enter into why a bill wasn’t passed. 
    I think this Court has said on many occasions that the fact that Congress doesn’t pass the bill is no indication of a legislative intent. 
    But I do think, if it were true that the bills proposed did no more than the, we say the existing law, does then I think there would be substance to petitioner’s argument that the proposal of those bills was an indication that the Departments involved believed that that existing legislation didn’t cover this problem. 
    But the fact is, Mr. Justice Fortas, that the proposed bills do substantially more than existing law does. 
    Under existing law there were two criminal statutes involved, One is 18 USC 1544 which makes it a crime to use a passport in violation of its conditions. 
    And that was enacted in 1917; the second criminal statute involve is the statute involved here, Section 1185. 
    What those two statutes require is proof under 1544 of use of the passport which is generally not true in cases of travel to countries which we have no diplomatic relations because in the passports it’s not just used in order to enter that country. 
    And what this statute require, the present statute, 1185, is proof of an intent to go to that country at the time of departure. 
    Now, a petitioner contend that the fact that they’ve been close to 600 violations of area restrictions prior to the bringing of these prosecutions indicates that the Department of State did not believe or the Department of State in Justice did not believe that this was a criminal statute that was applicable. 
    But the fact is, this statute applies to a very few cases. 
    It applies only to cases where we can prove intent as of the time of departure. 
    Now, that’s very difficult when you’re dealing with travel, let’s say to Communist China. 
    We can’t prove that the man, who travels to Communist China, was ordinarily has that intent at the time he departs the United States and because of the problems of proof, both in this statute and in 18 USC 1544 that this amending legislation has been proposed. 
    All these, I think all the bills which are listed in Mr. Travis Brief.

    Mr. Justice Learned Hand 
    Well, so I --
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="497.062" stopTime="556.470">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    What I am asking about is, why that being so evident, so palpable at least it seems to me, the Government of the United States, States Department of -- Department of Justice have more than jointly having gone the Congress with the simple bill to try to ascertain what Congress really thinks about this. 
    I mean, what they really want to do. 
    Because as a matter and, I’ll stand, you are asking the Court really to – in fact this is not a statement – be allowed. 
    The Government, the Department of the Government because of the powerful ambiguity to say the least in the statute and when we’re dealing in the area of criminal jurisprudence.
speaker="justice_learned_hand" startTime="556.470" stopTime="699.403">
    Mr. Justice Learned Hand 
    Just to answer the first portion of your question, Mr. Chief Justice Fortas, we have gone the Congress and the statute which Mr. McTurn cited in response to Mr. Justice Harlan question was the latest proposal at the Department of State recommended. 
    Now what that statute does, which the existing laws do not, is that it simply makes it a crime to enter an area where to which travel is restricted. 
    But we think, although its true that the status in its face is not as clear as it might be, we think that passports have, for substantial period of time, been advising those that bear it and those to whom it’s issued that they are not valid for certain destinations. 
    And, the passports have in fact been referring prior to that Cuba Regulations of 1961 to this other statute, 18 USC 1544. 
    Because when dealing with countries that are far really from the United States as Communist China and some of the others to which travel was restricted, I think it could very reasonably, been supposed that it would be almost impossible to prove the intent which is required under Section 1185. 
    Now, the statutes have -- the passport statute have since 1941 borne the legend on the last page that “anyone who attempts to use the passport in violations of the conditions or restrictions contained therein, may have the protection of the United States withdrawn from him while they continues to reside abroad and they be liable for prosecution under the provisions of Section 221” entitled “22 United States Code” which is 18 USC 1544”. 
    In other words, the Department of State was never suggesting, as petitioners are arguing, that this was merely enforceable by a civil remedy. 
    In other words, that we will just be removing protections. 
    It was entirely clear that people who would be bearing passports and if they violated the conditions or restrictions, there would be a criminal statute that would apply. 
    Prior to 1961, it is true the passport did not explicitly refer to this criminal statute but it did refer to 18 USC 1544. 
   
   
   
   Rebuttal of Cheif Justice Warren

    Mr. Cheif Justice Warren 
    Mr. Learned, what do you say to the inquiry that was made by Congress of the Department of State concerning the effect of that pass of that press release that we’ve been discussing when it said in reply that “if to bear in this country X, he cannot be assured of the protection of the United States”. 
    It means that the United States does not approve for the bearers going to country X. 
    The restriction on the passport does not necessarily mean that if a bearer travels to country X, he will be violating the criminal law. 
    What do you say as to that? 
   
   
   
   Rebuttal of Justice Learned Hand

    Mr. Justice Learned Hand 
    We think that’s true, Mr. Chief Justice and that precisely the problem under the existing statute. 
    A man who is, for example, travels from the United States to Paris and does not then intend to go to an area to which travel is restricted, is not, if he then decides to go there, violating the criminal law when he goes to the area to which travel is restricted. 
    The problem with the existing two statutes Mr. Chief Justice is that there were various loopholes that a man is not necessarily violating, and either of them, if he travels to an area to which traveler is restricted. 
    He violates this statute, the one involved in this case, only if he has the intent as of the time he departs from the United States.

    I think you would cheer me up to concede that the statement is murky and it’s ambiguous. 
    As a matter of fact, Mr. Chief Justice, the committee itself felt this much as a letter which appears in the very same hearings dated, I think a month thereafter from the committee to the Department of State, specifically refers to that question and to the Department of State’s answer. 
    And if I may read it, that letter which appears on page 78 of the very same hearing says, “On page 32 of the transcript you were asked with reference to the press release of 1952 whether at that time, the phrase “NOT VALID FOR TRAVEL TO COUNTRY X” stamped on a passport which is interpreted as prohibition for travel to that place and whether the Department has authored its interpretation of that phrase between 1952 and the present time. 
    The material submitted on this question was not responsive to the question. 
    That’s what the committee believed. 
    And, the Department of State came back with the answer which, I must candidly was equally ambiguous.

    Mr. Justice Learned Hand 
    Well, we think that where as in this case, the legislative intention is to grant abroad powers to the Secretary of State in determining what is a valid passport and where the statute on its face in effect tells somebody that “you may not leave unless you have a valid passport”. 
    We think ordinary citizens just presented with that command that they may not leave without a valid passport and with the passport saying that it’s not valid for travel in light of the legislative intention behind these statutes are adequately put unnoticed. 
    I think that there have been a substantial series of cases, decisions by this Court which have said that although it’s generally true that penal statute should be strictly construed, that doesn’t mean that they are construed inconsistently with what their purpose would be. 
    Now, here we think, Congress was giving or was intending to impose restrictions in more time and in times of national emergency and delegating to the secretary the power to, within traditional limits, set those restrictions.

    Well, this Court’s decision last year in the Standard Oil case, for example, I think referred to the fact that all those penal statutes should have been strictly construed. 
    That’s not done in order to -- when the legislative intention is defeated. 
    I think even this Court decision, recent decision in a case such as United States vs. Price, where at that time the act was committed in the Price case after all there was substantial doubt among legal scholars as to whether the act committed were covered by the Civil Rights Act which was there applicable. 
    And yet, this Court construed that statute despite the doubt that existed at the time the act was committed in light of what Congress’ purpose was at the reconstruction period when the status was enacted. 
    Now, we think here, in light of the specific evils that Congress was directing its intent, attention to which is war time travel, a travel in times of national emergency, this statute should be read to put travelers unnoticed that their departures with intention to violate area restrictions, when those restrictions are written plainly into the passport, violate Congress’ command.

    Having agreed upon that standard, we incorporated the language which you referred to as opaque and which we thought at the time was quite lucid. 
    It was on that theory that the Court based that the case was tried. 
    It was on that theory that the case was affirmed on appeal. 
    And, I submit that it’s a theory upon which this case was preceded from the very beginning. 
    If I may add that simply one more thing as reference to that legend in the passport concerning Section 1544, that Section has never been invoked in the case of alleged violations of area restrictions and it was not referred to by the Department in its considered reply to Senator Full Bright in 1957, that one which you referred earlier Mr. Chief Justice, that Section so far as I know has never been considered as having any application to Geographic restriction.
