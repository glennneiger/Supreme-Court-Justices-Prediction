    Mr. Richard Yale Feder 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    This Court granted certiorari to review the conviction of 32 Negro petitioners who were convicted of trespass with a malicious and mischievous intent in violation of a Florida statute. 
    The question presented is, whether that conviction violated their constitutionally protected rights, due process, equal protection and the right to freedom of speech, petition and assembly. 
    Where the trespass alleged was their presence on an open public piece of property adjacent to a county jail and where the alleged maliciousness and mischievousness was their peacefully and orderliness in protesting, both the segregated facilities of the County jail itself and the prior arrest of their fellow Florida A &amp; M University students the day before for picketing to gain admittance to the all0white movie theaters in Tallahassee. 
    All of these happened in September of 1963, slightly less than a year before the passage of the Civil Rights Act. 
    The facts of this case, I don't think are in dispute. 
    They established clearly that 200 students at Florida A &amp; M decided to walk downtown in Tallahassee, Florida to protest the segregated facilities of their own county jail and wherein their own fellow students were kept and segregated jail cells for having attempted to gain admittance to an all-white movie theater. 
    They walked through the downtown area of Tallahassee and they arrived at the County jail grounds which is roughly – the record discloses, about seven blocks from the main downtown section of Tallahassee and from the courthouse. 
    They got to within about one and a half or two feet of the bottom step of the entrance of the jail. 
    At this point, the chief jailer testified they were orderly, they were singing “Oh, Freedom” and other freedom song and they were clapping their hands. 
    He asked them as they got to within one and a half feet and no closer to move to another area, grassy areas surrounding the jail. 
    And they moved to the area he directed them. 
    There was a diagram drawn and as I recall on the record, there was no measurement in the record and there was simply a picture drawn on the blackboard and someone forgot to ask the question of how far away this was. 
    There is nothing in this record. 
    But I gather it's the grassy lawns on the sidewalk probably within a hundred feet; but I don't know, I can't point anyway.

    I don't believe that's on the record either, Mr. Chief Justice, other than that there was two parking lots, sidewalks around, and lawn. 
    What width and distance, there is nothing in this record to establish. 
    What the record does establish, there were 200 petitioners and 40 policemen and highway patrolmen and deputy sheriffs around them. 
    And there is no mention that this blocked the sidewalk or the street. 
    So that I gather it was a fairly large area but the dimensions of which I cannot advise the court.

speaker="richard_yale_feder" startTime="282.094" stopTime="447.271">
    Mr. Richard Yale Feder 
    No, it does not, sir. 
    There was evidence in this record that not only did the presence of the petitioners and their fellow students not interfere with the jail guards but that business went on as usual on the jail, this was testified to both by the chief jailer and by Sheriff Joyce when he arrived. 
    He was not on the scene when the petitioners first arrived. 
    There was a delivery man who entered to, I believe test the vending machines on presumes of cigarettes of coffee and candy and the like. 
    He was not prevented from entering. 
    Meanwhile, back at the Circuit Courthouse, the sheriff, Sheriff Joyce was discussing with the Circuit judges a pending lawsuit - this is on the record - brought against him for contempt for his encouraging the private places of public accommodation in Tallahassee to discriminate against colleague. 
    And he immediately know that this particular protest, the presence of these students at the jail, was the protest to the arrest a day before of their fellow students who tried to get an admittance to the all-white movie theater. 
    And he rushed to the jail. 
    He testified he arrived and immediately checked the jail. 
    This was his prime question and found everything was working along smoothly and undisturbed in jail. 
    He then watched the petitioners for a while, came out and then he directed the petitioners to move to another area. 
    Again, no identification of what the area was, but an admission by the sheriff that upon his request, the petitioners and the fellow students moved to that area. 
    After watching for about 10 minutes, he testified he approached two people whom he called the “leaders”; one of them is the petitioner, petitioner Blue, one of whom was not a defendant below and he's not a petitioner here. 
    And it was these individuals “leader”, who was not a defendant, who allegedly refused to advice his fellow students to move. 
    The sheriff then waited another eight or ten minutes in accordance with his testimony. 
    And for the first time spoke to the entire group of 200 students and said, “You are trespassing. 
    If you don't move, you will be under arrest for trespass. 
    And if you resist arrest, you will be charged with the additional charge of resisting arrest.”

    It does reveal that high. 
    At this point, the sheriff then said after waiting eight of ten minutes, “Leave or be arrested”. 
    He then watched a current of time which in his words amounted to either one minute or two minutes or three minutes. 
    And I believe in one point, he even went as far as say four minutes. 
    He then saw some of the group sit down. 
    He saw some of the group right as they sit down. 
    The testimony of one the petitioners was that she had a sweater.

    The only -- no, in answer to your question, Mr. Justice Clark, the only testimony that by possibly be construed in this respect, we have clear evidence from the chief jailer that the entrances were not blocked. 
    We have the testimony that this vending machine operator would drove up on his truck to fill cigarettes and coffee and candy, walked out to the front door as if to leave and stopped. 
    Now the State likes to presume from that that he was prevented from leaving because they were blocking the driveway.

    Mr. Richard Yale Feder 
    There was testimony from one of the deputy sheriffs that he heard someone saying without identification of who was the one saying it, that they had come down to be arrested. 
    The State seems to infer from this that this means that this people came down and knowing they were breaking the law. 
    However, this does not appear on the record rather it appears on the fact that they obeyed a request to move to an area twice, willingly and quickly. 
    In fact, the chief jailer said they move as quickly as 200 people could possibly move. 
    But it was rather a desire to protest the prior arrest of their friends who had been arrested the day before for picketing in theaters and that if protesting the prior arrest would mean, they would get arrested, they were willing to be arrested. 
    There is nothing in this record to establish that this people came down to enter into the jail. 
    In fact, when they got to one and a half feet away and told to stop they moved back.

    Herein this is -- there is no such indication of this statute that every trespass upon the property of another has been a direct trespass. 
    You have the complete openness of the area and you have the too express, direct request of the sheriff and the chief jailer to go to a particular area while they were protesting under a band of both of those directions to protest in the directed to area. 
    The only purpose of this statute in this conviction was to prevent and proscribe and prohibit the peacefully expression of opinion contrary to that of the sheriff.

    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    In response to one of the question that was asked petitioner, the records thus show that there were some 11 people in jail, I believe, that time. 
    The jailer testified that there were four white women that went there for contempt and two other women that went there for contempt and then five Negro girls who were in there for contempt. 
    No, no, excuse me four of the -- four of the white women were in there for being drunk, for deed of the act charges. 
    So -- so these were separate charges. 
    So, the record shows that there were about 11 people in the jail of this town.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    How big is the jail is it, Mr. Roth?
speaker="william_d_roth" startTime="1837.570" stopTime="1899.612">
    Mr. William D. Roth 
    I've been by there many times, Your Honor, I couldn't tell you certainly how large is the jail. 
    It's simply is. 
    Well, there's a juvenile home at hand and part of that is used by the jail at sometimes. 
    Now, this particular time, if the county fairgrounds, most of the persons that had been arrested during the demonstrations had been taken out to the county fair ground to a new facility that had been out there because of the over crowded condition of the jail. 
    So, at this time, the jail was not anywhere near full capacity this time. 
    One other point that really on the record doesn't show and not having taken part in the trial below, I can't tell. 
    I don't know what happened to the other 70 people out of the 32 who were prosecuted and the 170 or 74 that weren't prosecuted. 
    The record isn't entirely clear on that. 
    Petitioner --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1899.612" stopTime="1907.723">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Could you tell us, Mr. Roth about how large the public area is around that jail?
speaker="william_d_roth" startTime="1907.723" stopTime="1973.009">
    Mr. William D. Roth 
    Yes, Your Honor. 
    There is a one-way driveway that comes out in one of the streets which is perpendicular to the jail and I believe it's a gravel driveway. 
    It's a one-way driveway. 
    I would say it is probably wide enough for two and a half cars or may be more than that. 
    There's a little -- in southern terms a (Inaudible) overhang right in front right over the stairs. 
    And Sheriff Joyce testified that this was used primarily for maintenance men and also for bringing in prisoners, even bringing in or taking prisoners out of the jail. 
    Sheriff Joyce also testified that Monday I believe with specially specific calls often times they had juveniles in there that had to be taken to the juvenile court or to the other courts in town. 
    But in an answer to another question, there is no grassy part of against jail. 
    In other words, there is the driveway and then the grassy part and then the sidewalk that I'm talking about. 
    Unfortunately, this exhibit was not put into the record.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1973.009" stopTime="1976.469">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    But how large it is the grassy part?
speaker="william_d_roth" startTime="1976.469" stopTime="2066.864">
    Mr. William D. Roth 
    Well, I couldn't give you the measurement. 
    There's a slope there and then in another level I would say 10 or 15 feet higher there is another parking lot there which I believe they used for the county health people. 
    And the grassy – it's all from here to one of the columns I suppose. 
    If that was, I would say the grassy area isn't that one. 
    Now, this is where possibly we have a little disagreement with petitioner. 
    Sheriff Joyce testified that his men encircled just the people that were on the area of the driveway and not people there were in the sidewalk or on the sidewalks or on the streets. 
    Now, it is true that two of the petitioners who testified claim that they couldn't leave as they wanted to leave. 
    So -- so the time sequence was important. 
    Now, Sheriff Joyce arrived on the scene and supposedly he was there about 10 minutes. 
    There is testimony, I believe the reason when -- because we're taking that he was spending the time seeing if the jail was secured. 
    Then Sheriff Joyce came out and noticed two student leaders and the crowd judge let this in. 
    Sheriff Joyce did recognize these student leaders, leaning up against one of the supports of the overhang that is over the entrance to the jail area, to side of the jail and one of these petitioners White or Blue, I believe Blue is one of these petitioners and then Mr. White was not.

    White and Blue?
speaker="william_d_roth" startTime="2067.802" stopTime="2107.227">
    Mr. William D. Roth 
    White and Blue, yes, sir. 
    The sheriff spoke to these people about five to ten minutes and imploring them to please leave and get off this area of the jail. 
    The students would not leave. 
    And then, there was this testimony of the deputy sheriff also that the -- some other people said that we came to be arrested.

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    That's all then the proper area of the public jail?
speaker="william_d_roth" startTime="2192.356" stopTime="2511.246">
    Mr. William D. Roth 
    Well, it's not like a quadrangle in that sense but certainly it's public – I walked to there before many times and I'm sure many other citizens have. 
    And that they're been stopped. 
    Now, what we can't hint here, the question was, that this became a trespass when these petitioners were told to leave. 
    Now, Sheriff Joyce also testified that there were three other adult women there. 
    And he asked his deputies to ask this people if they were part of the demonstration or what. 
    I think there were three older Negro women and the sheriff, the deputy sheriff asked these people and these people left. 
    There were other people left. 
    Now, Sheriff Joyce's testimony is replete, that no one was arrested except the group that was in the driveway and possibly and the people that were all in that group. 
    Now, there is conflicting testimony from the petitioners. 
    Now, there were three petitioners had testified. 
    One of the petitioners testified that she was unable to leave; that there wasn't enough time involved because the sheriff only gave them from one to four minutes to leave after talking to the two student leaders about leaving. 
    The petitioners have tried to base this case squarely on point with the Cox case or the Cox cases and the Edwards case. 
    We contend that there are many or several differences in these cases that are distinguishable. 
    First of all, in the Cox cases it was shown that there was a definite permission given to the demonstrators. 
    From the very outset of the demonstration in Cox, it was shown that the state officials were trying to hinder them. 
    Some 2,000 students congregated in the Cox case and were attempting to march up to a courthouse which also housed a jail to protest the arrest of some of their member and also to protest the conditions in that town in Louisiana. 
    Now, it was shown from the beginning of the case that the authorities of that city first of all arrested that Mr. Moore, he was the group leader. 
    The authorities then arrested the bus drivers that were to drive these students some four to five miles to where the protest was to take place. 
    Mr. Cox then took over the march and upon arriving, arriving in an area near the courthouse, was accosted by two officers. 
    Mr. Cox told these two officers his purpose. 
    He said, “The purpose of the demonstration is to protest the conditions here in this City of Louisiana. 
    We would like to have a short meeting across the street from the courthouse which housed the jail. 
    We would like to sing the pledge or the National Anthem, say the Pledge of Allegiance and have a little speech.” The police officers then said, “We don't know, you can't do that.” 
    Then one of the police officers contacted the chief of police and the chief of police met the demonstrators as they had gone another few blocks near the courthouse. 
    And that time, the chief of police said, “Alright, you can have 15 minutes or you can have 20 minutes”. 
    And after speaking for 15 to 20 minutes, then the police stepped in and broke up the demonstration with teargas and the next day arrested Mr. Cox for four violations, three of which he was convicted of the common law breach of the peace in Louisiana, obstructing a public sidewalk or thoroughfare and then picketing near the courthouse. 
    Now, and there was a direct and tacit permission from the authorities of Baton Rouge or of the City in Louisiana. 
    Now, in this case, the demonstrators started at Florida A&amp;M which I supposed is about a mile from this area. 
    There was one word said to these people a whole time. 
    Sheriff Joyce was in a conference. 
    Upon learning that the persons had approached the jailhouse, Sheriff Joyce came and spent five to ten minutes looking over the situation. 
    Sheriff Joyce was satisfied that no one had tried to break in the jail. 
    And I believe, Mr. Justice Fortas asked a question in that regard. 
    It is not the states contention that any of the petitioners tried to break in the jail or tried to go up the stairs. 
    As a matter of fact, the record shows that Deputy Sheriff Deckle, who was he jailer, met the petitioners as they came off of Godson Street into the one way gravel parking area and up to the porch or overhang of the jail. 
    And when they came within two feet of this area, Sheriff Deckle asked them to stop and the students moved back. 
    Now, petitioners contend that this was the permission given by the deputy sheriff saying, “You folks please move back so we can run this jail.” 
    That the deputy sheriff and then the sheriff later gave this people permission as was the case in the Edwards case and the Cox cases.

    Could I ask you just one question.

    And no -- no particular -- no permission, expressed permission, they just come by. 
    Would that have been a trespass under your statute?

    Mr. William D. Roth

    Yes, sir. 
    It was.

    And the public was invited that was part of the public property?
speaker="william_d_roth" startTime="2563.556" stopTime="2571.258">
    Mr. William D. Roth 
    It was public property yes, sir, in the sense that the inside of the jail is not for sale but if you have business to walk inside the jail, that's public property.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="2571.258" stopTime="2582.917">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Now the 200 high school children congregated in a park, that would not be a trespass when it is a public park.
speaker="william_d_roth" startTime="2582.917" stopTime="2585.328">
    Mr. William D. Roth 
    That's right. 
    I would think it would not be.

    Justice Abe Fortas 
    And suppose 200 children gathered on the driveway on mister. 
    I don't mean the driveway, I mean the parking area near the jail, would that have been a trespass? 
    You see what I'm getting at is what this, this is public property and the public presumably is invited for some purposes. 
    Now, what is it here that converts us into a trespass in your view of the case in that two elements of trespass under that statute aren't correct? 
    What is going on the property without permission and they have the same sort of specific intent?
speaker="william_d_roth" startTime="2633.608" stopTime="2636.642">
    Mr. William D. Roth 
    Where with the malicious and mischievous intent, yes, sir.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="2636.642" stopTime="2657.055">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    That's right. 
    Now what is it that converts the public utilization of the fact that this is a public property? 
    What is it that converts such utilization into a trespass in your opinion?
speaker="william_d_roth" startTime="2657.055" stopTime="2685.808">
    Mr. William D. Roth 
    Well, Your Honor in my opinion, the very nature of what these people said or what petitioner said when they came to this area, the very area that they only use for that entrance to the jail or for the entrance way there is to bring in prisoners, ingress and egress of prisoners and for maintenance -- maintenance men to come. 
    I would say that if I drove my car there and park it. 
    I never did. 
    Well unless if I've driven my car there and park it they could possibly remove my car.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="2685.808" stopTime="2687.221">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    So they couldn't charge you with trespass.
speaker="william_d_roth" startTime="2687.221" stopTime="2709.779">
    Mr. William D. Roth 
    No, so they couldn't charge me with trespass. 
    What I'm getting at is that when all these people had gotten this area and announced that they wanted to be arrested, at least some of the, although there is a problem in the record of which one of these petitioners if any or which one said that. 
    That this converted this into a trespass when the sheriff told them --
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="2709.779" stopTime="2726.751">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    I beg your pardon. 
    That's right for me; I must invite you to be very specific. 
    It would become a trespass when these people said that they were there for the purpose of protest.
speaker="william_d_roth" startTime="2726.751" stopTime="2753.698">
    Mr. William D. Roth 
    Your Honor, it would have been if they have said that but that is not in the record; that this was ever said. 
    This, if I may, this was a distinction also in the Cox cases and the Edwards cases which petitioners were allowing. 
    There were no placards. 
    In fact, the only testimony of the three petitioners who testified was really subjectively what is in their minds. 
    Then if they knew and they said -- and the sheriff knew this because all these people were jailed there.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="2753.698" stopTime="2795.376">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    But if you assume which you may not, but if you do assume that it wasn't for mere presence of these people at this particular place should constitute a trespass. 
    But if there was something else that converted their presence into a trespass on your statute, I'm inviting you to tell us precisely what it was that converted this presence of these people into a violation of law under your trespass statute.
speaker="william_d_roth" startTime="2795.376" stopTime="2799.940">
    Mr. William D. Roth 
    Your Honor, I would have to speculate on what we don't have in the decisions on that particular statute --
speaker="william_o_douglas" startTime="2799.940" stopTime="2810.892">
    Justice William O. Douglas 
    Oh, I thought your point was that there was that the thing that triggered the trespass was a lawful order of the sheriff that they had to disperse.
speaker="william_d_roth" startTime="2810.892" stopTime="2811.784">
    Mr. William D. Roth 
    This -- yes, this is --
speaker="william_o_douglas" startTime="2811.784" stopTime="2851.334">
    Justice William O. Douglas 
    Now, what I want to ask you is, that might depend upon the location of this group was with reference to the jail property if they were on the remote outskirts that might be said to be without the beyond the implied authority of the sheriff as custodian or that was right up near the jail and one might say that was certainly within the proper authority of the custodian. 
    But the record is silent as to where all these happen. 
    Now, is this exhibit that you say was marked for identification but not introduced, does that still extend?
speaker="william_d_roth" startTime="2851.334" stopTime="2860.986">
    Mr. William D. Roth 
    I don't know -- I didn't mean to mislead the court. 
    I don't know whether if for sure it was marked for identification. 
    It was a blackboard that was used and the record would show that the deputy juror –

    Blackboard demonstration?

    A blackboard demonstration. 
    So, I'm afraid that it wasn't used as an exhibit. 
    I believe that Mr. Simon, representing petitioners or defendants below, agreed to stipulate but I don't think it was ever introduced in the record.

    My recollection is that the statue there also said trespass. 
    And then late in the day, the Supreme Court at South Carolina interpreted trespass to include, even though there was an initial lawful entry, a refusal to leave upon request to go and we said that in that context, that was too vague, this part of criminal statute.

    Mr. Roth, as I understand it that this block or square where these people were was a public block or square on which were buildings of several departments of the county government, there was a jail and I thought you told us also that there was a probation department and I thought also you said there was a health department and some parking facilities for those who were doing business with those agencies of the government and then some general parking space around there and lawn. 
    That -- is that all about it?

    Mr. William D. Roth 
    The -- the lower parking area which was adjacent to the gravel area which petitioners were arrested on was actually -- was considered the parking lot of the jail. 
    I would say Sheriff Joyce testified that he came in and parked in the first two areas in the wide strip. 
    One way strip it goes by the one of the side of the jail. 
    Then there was a grassy strip. 
    Then there was the upper parking area and the other building that I mentioned was on the other side of that. 
    So, it wasn't contiguous in the sense that all the buildings were just lined up in the sense semi-circle (Voice Overlap).
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3184.773" stopTime="3200.951">

    Mr. William D. Roth 
    Your Honor, as the record is silent as to any other division as to the upper parking lot. 
    Now Sheriff Joyce did testify that this area of the lower parking area and the entrance way and there was under his custody. 
    But as far as stipulation on the record of lot numbers or which was which know this, the record is silent on this. 
    And the -- another distinction that was made of the petitioner attempts to make in the Cox cases or rather to show that they are similar, is the fact that there was a jail involved here. 
    There was a jail involved in the Cox case with a jail inside of the courthouse. 
    But again, we would like to point out that specific permission was given in both the Cox cases and the Edwards case which petitioner said is in direct conflict. 
    And that in this case, there was no permission given. 
    The deputy sheriff walked out of the -- down the entrance way and saw these people to see me. 
    He said, “Please move back two feet.” 
    He immediately called the sheriff. 
    The sheriff --

speaker="william_d_roth" startTime="3282.468" stopTime="3318.117">
    Mr. William D. Roth 
    Yes, it's on the record. 
    And, petitioner says that this was analogous to the situation in Cox in which the Mayor said, “You have 15 minutes” but let's break it about to that. 
    Although in Cox, the reason that the authority grabbed it up is because they considered certain aspect of Mr. Cox's colloquy there or his speech there as in citing a riot or something like that when he said, “rolled out sit in these various areas.” 
    But in the present case, there is no showing that anything will see it. 
    He just said that Sheriff Joyce surely knew why these people were here.

speaker="william_d_roth" startTime="3336.141" stopTime="3726.296">
    Mr. William D. Roth 
    From -- from the stand, I think it makes it worse for the petitioners in this case because in the Cox case, it was stated time and time again, and with majority opinion that these people, that the authorities knew what it was and given them permission to do it for a certain length of time that the statute was vague because they have the permission to step in anytime they would revoke it. 
    In this permission, it just showed that Sheriff Joyce, upon coming on the jail, suddenly confronted, its custodian of the jail was suddenly confronted with having about 200 to 300 individuals right here in the driveway area on the side of the jail and this other area that he asked these people to leave, that the people hadn't say a word with placard or what were doing or anything and the people -- some of the people said, “We came to be arrested.” 
    Upon telling the group itself to leave, some more of the group sat down and didn't leave. 
    Now, the only question in this regard about the true identity of these people and it was raised by petitioner is, that since each one of these petitioners weren't specifically and individually pointed out that they should void the whole way. 
    I have three of those aspects in my brief. 
    Sheriff Joyce did give sworn assurances that the only arrested were the people right in the group there; that no one was arrested in the upper parking lot. 
    Again, this goes to your question of various jurisdictions, Your Honor, of the various dealings which is unfortunately not on the record, that no one was arrested on the public sidewalk of the jail, that no one was arrested on the street. 
    And it was our contention that this was – that the sheriff did this as custodian and that he had the legal right to do this and if no matter which group they did it, now or later. 
    One other point that petitioners had raised is the fact of abatement, which is also true to both of our briefs. 
    Petitioners says that under the period of abatement, the passages in 1964 Civil Rights Act, under the case of Heart of Atlanta Motel and Katzenbach versus McClung that this should be applicable in this case which say that it isn't because this jail was not a place for public accommodation. 
    Now, petitioners responded that by saying, “Well, that was all part and parcel of the same thing”. 
    Now, we contend that this is just not so that if the custodian of that area, of the jail, is powerless to regulate that particular area no matter who comes there and blocking this area that it would make the running of the jail or any other facility for that matter very hard. 
    Now, the State of Florida has recognized, as a footnote and being honest to the Court, the State of Florida has recognized the difficulty of proving who was there in an area like this. 
    And in that Fort Lauderdale the prosecutor was in touch of the office not long ago. 
    And in pop in the beach when there was some trouble down there and all of the petitioners were -- where some petitioners were let go because they couldn't -- they didn't have specific identification. 
    Now, there's no report of cases where it's done. 
    And the procedure now is, is the use of moving pictures a possible and other type of pictures as was done by the newspaper people or the television people in the Cox case. 
    Well, unfortunately, we don't have this in the present case. 
    Petitioner also says that there is a lack of relevant evidence in this case. 
    We contend there's a conflict in the evidence as to what Sheriff Joyce said and as to what the three petitioners had testified said but certainly, there is no lack of relevant evidence in this case. 
    It was shown that the petitioners went to the spot. 
    It was shown that the petitioners were asked to leave. 
    It was shown that some of the petitioners or some of the people or the 250 that were there did leave. 
    It was later shown that the petitioners made no showing of why they were there or what they were protesting or anything of this nature. 
    And that the petitioners even or some of them anyway, even evidence had attempted to be arrested. 
    Now, the state would cheerfully admit that just because someone wants to be arrested, doesn't give the place the right to arrest there. 
    Now just because I walked at the place on the streets and “Hey, arrest me here, I'm protesting”. 
    Or something this, if I haven't broken any law, this is no reason. 
    But I only mentioned this to show as a part of the intent in the statute when it says with a mischievous and malicious intent and would contend that that is what this goes to. 
    The other point, which is the lack of relevant evidence, I think that it was treated the point before. 
    And also, the petitioners have said that this was the use of “a petty criminal statute” to prohibit or to hinder people in exercising their rights. 
    One of these statutes was not passed during any -- this statue has been on the books for a long time. 
    In fact, Florida has not passed, to my knowledge except for the schools which of course were unconstitutional has not passed any laws about or any additional laws in the last 10 years, making it unlawful to stand in a public building after being ordered to leave or making unlawful to go in sidewalks or anything else. 
    So certainly, by the very fact that this statute is an old statute, and I'm not contending this because it's old it's good but it hasn't been tested in that regard. 
    And certainly, this was not attempt on the part of Florida to use a petty criminal statute, just to prosecute this people. 
    Now, if of course the statute is no good, maybe we should have passed some of the statute. 
    But we contend this was under the circumstance, the only statute that could have been used under our statutory law and may be this is a failure of the legislature not to pass that statute in this regard. 
    But the State of Florida has been fairly fortunate in this area and is not deemed it necessary to pass to allow the statutes which by the way, have most been thrown anyway by this Court. 
    So, it would really have been unused just to pass it and we're proud we didn't have it.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Roth, may I ask you just one more question. 
    Your statute provides that it is unlawful to trespass upon the property of another committed with a malicious and mischievous intent. 
    Now, could you just detail in a moment what evidence there was to show a malicious and mischievous intent?
speaker="william_d_roth" startTime="3755.845" stopTime="3777.745">
    Mr. William D. Roth 
    To prove that isn't the conduct, yes, sir. 
    Well, by the -- I think that both words can be or this can be shown that -- the part of malicious and mischievous can be shown in the fact that petitioner, upon arriving in this spot, showed that they wanted to be arrested.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3777.745" stopTime="3778.995">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    I thought you said that can be --
speaker="william_d_roth" startTime="3778.995" stopTime="3780.581">
    Mr. William D. Roth 
    Well, I said -- I said that in --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3780.581" stopTime="3781.372">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    -- any difference unless you --
speaker="william_d_roth" startTime="3781.372" stopTime="3781.957">
    Mr. William D. Roth 
    Well that is in --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3781.957" stopTime="3786.765">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    -- it was specific violation that that would amount to anything?
speaker="william_d_roth" startTime="3786.765" stopTime="3875.765">
    Mr. William D. Roth 
    I said that that's specifically, I didn't think would allow someone be arrested just because I showed that this is part and partial. 
    First of all that. 
    Second of all, the collectively it was -- that was had between the sheriff and the two student leaders, asking them to leave and the student leaders just responding by sitting down on the ground, most of them. 
    And thirdly, by the sheriff then asking everyone to please leave that this was a trespass and if you don't leave, you're going to be arrested for it. 
    Now, we certainly contend that the State of Florida has a power to do this. 
    This -- this Court may say the statute is not good and you will have to pass one but certainly, we have this power. 
    The problem just may be that this is not the statute to do it but certainly, we contend that Florida has this power to do this or a county has a power to do this in the orderly paneling of the day to day facilities of the jail. 
    So we contend, Your Honor, that this combination of those three things. 
    What the sheriff said to the petitioners talking to them, the evidence contend from some other of the petitioners or from the group there saying that, “We came to be arrested”, and “Why didn't they arrest us last night” or something to that effect and then the fact that petitioners made no effort to leave but in fact, when asked to leave, sat down.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3875.765" stopTime="3890.715">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    May I ask you that there is anything in the evidence to show that anyone of these petitioners in this case were the ones who said, “We came to get arrested.”
speaker="william_d_roth" startTime="3890.715" stopTime="3896.636">
    Mr. William D. Roth 
    Your Honor, I don't think there is. 
    I don't think that Mr. White said or Mr. Blue said that.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3896.636" stopTime="3904.704">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Is there anything in the record to show that they sat down, these two or anyone from this group?
speaker="william_d_roth" startTime="3904.704" stopTime="3913.576">
    Mr. William D. Roth 
    Well, the record showed, I think that one of the men, Mr. Blue was sitting down at the time that he was talking to. 
    But as far as specifically, these 32 petitioners, no there is none.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3913.576" stopTime="3924.926">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Yes, (Inaudible). 
    Now, would you tell me this, you arrested originally a 106 or 105 whatever the number was, they were all incarcerated.

    Yes.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3925.086" stopTime="3937.553">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    They are all taken in a jail. 
    Now, by what process that they call out of 32 of these people and say, “These we will prosecute; the other 70 we will let go.”
speaker="william_d_roth" startTime="3937.553" stopTime="3944.872">
    Mr. William D. Roth 
    Your Honor, the record is silent as to that and I didn't take any part in the prosecution and I don't know --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3944.872" stopTime="3954.559">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Is there anything in the record that Mr. Roth that would show that these people did anymore than the other 70 whom they turned loose.
speaker="william_d_roth" startTime="3954.559" stopTime="3968.056">
    Mr. William D. Roth 
    No, sir. 
    The only thing in that regard is one of the deputy sheriffs said that through pictures and fingerprints, these 32 were identified. 
    This I -- it is unclear to me exactly what is that mean but that's in the record.

    That's all there is in the record, Mr. Justice Stewart. 
    And I don't have any personal knowledge to enlighten the Court. 
    I was questioning counsel's comment about the difference between Cox and Edwards and the case at bar in the absence of permission. 
    In the first place as I recall in Edwards, there was no specific permission given in the Edwards case. 
    And in the case at bar, he admits that at the time petitioners came on the property, they needed no permission.
