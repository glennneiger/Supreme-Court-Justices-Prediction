United Gas Pipe Line v. Federal Power Commission

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Number 49, United Gas Pipe Line Company, petitioner versus Federal Power Commission. 
    Mr. Schiff, you may continue your argument.
speaker="peter_h_schiff" startTime="11.827" stopTime="105.337">
    Mr. Peter H. Schiff 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    Yesterday afternoon I pointed out that from the consumer's point of view and the question of whether the abandonment is initiated by Pipe Line or a producer is essentially the same. 
    United has suggested that if the Pipe Line purchaser initiate a -- abandons facilities that approval may not be needed because Pipe Lines have a self-interest in keeping prices down. 
    This may very well be true in some situation and we do not say it isn't but certainly the history of regulation does not suggest as this Court very well knows that the public inadequately protected by the contracting practices of Pipe Lines time and time again the Commission in this Court have found that the contract entered into by Pipe Line have resulted in excess of prices. 
    In addition to this, I would suggest that the holding in the Sunray case that the Commission should be free to consider all the factors relating to an abandonment before granting a producer approval to take gas which has previously been committed out of the market.

    I don't say that that may not be a facility but as far as this case and the problems involved in this case are concerned the Commission didn't have to reach whether there were facilities beyond the pipeline, a metering station or if not facilities in some situations of this sort or whether services rendered by means of such facilities would be abandoned.

    Mr. Peter H. Schiff 
    Which they want to abandon and as this Court has also recognized in the -- for example in the case of Transcontinental Pipeline Company against the Federal Power Commission in which Transco sought permission for transporting gas for Consolidated Edison to New York. 
    In that case, although no request was made for a sale certificate, the Commission concluded that the terms under which the gas would be purchased, the gas that would be transported would be purchased because those sales conditions were not within the public convenience necessity that this would at least one of the independent grounds for denying the transportation certificate. 
    And to say that the Commission has no jurisdiction or can't exercise its jurisdiction over sales and transportation in such a way as to affect purchases just isn't the case.

speaker="peter_h_schiff" startTime="519.048" stopTime="584.405">
    Mr. Peter H. Schiff 
    That was the issue in that case in the Rutherford case was whether the producer should be allowed to abandon it sale. 
    I think it was to United as a matter of fact United did not appear, United had not been taking gas for quite awhile. 
    Rutherford had a -- before the Philips case that entered into a contract with a intrastate producer to make a sale and wanted to be relieved of its obligation to serve United saying that United didn't have any need. 
    The Commission concluded in that case that on the basis of the record there presented it did not appear that there was a need and that the public convenience and necessity would permit the abandonment. 
    Commissioner Canole (ph) in that concurring opinion suggested, made the statement that you have read and I suppose that statement is --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="584.405" stopTime="585.568">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    It expresses his views.
speaker="peter_h_schiff" startTime="585.568" stopTime="617.746">
    Mr. Peter H. Schiff 
    It expresses his views and I think they are quite wrong. 
    But it doesn't represent any long views of the Commission and wasn't even a holding of the Commission in that case. 
    In this case, the Commission once United comes in and ask for abandonment authorization might very well reach the same conclusion. 
    The issue really in our view is only whether it has to come in and ask for permission or can it make, take this action on a unilateral basis.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="617.746" stopTime="629.115">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Unilateral basis is on the other side if you're right, isn't it?

    Mr. Peter H. Schiff 
    As I think was brought out yesterday in an answer to a question the contention here is that even if United simply said, we don't want to pay as much, we want to pay less that the argument would still be the same. 
    It's not at all clear here that the facts that United by making this abandonment is really paying less. 
    The record shows that after they stated that they would not buy this gas at 15.75 cents they entered into some other purchase contracts at a higher price of about 18 cents.

    Mr. Peter H. Schiff 
    Well, I think that's -- that could conceivably the case if one has to ignore the fact that the Commission does have jurisdiction over the rate. 
    And as the Commission pointed out in this case if for example Continental had filed a rate up to 25 cents and this I mean that a much higher rate than the -- the United could quickly have requested abandonment authorization and the Commission very likely could've granted that authorization within the suspension period. 
    And I think that really the -- if you give the Pipe Line a unilateral opportunity to abandon, the bargaining -- there is no bargaining, they are the ones that can have full control --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="776.671" stopTime="798.253">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    But if you're right that abandonment means, as you answered to Mr. Justice Black that simply transferring the Pipe Line's business for these facilities to another producer, if that's abandonment, by then I suppose that's abandonment. 
    But that's, I didn't understand that that was complete agreement on breadth of that definition of abandonment.

    Mr. Peter H. Schiff

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    If for the use of these facilities, the United simply turn to another producer who would sell his gas at a lower price and thereafter fully utilize these facilities. 
    You say that would still be an abandonment as I understood your answer to Justice Black?

    Mr. Peter H. Schiff 
    Well, I said that would at least be an abandonment of -- in that hypothetical situation, there would be an abandonment of the service rendered by means of those facilities. 
    I might say that that situation is not the case here. 
    These facilities are capable, as far as I can see being used only for this particular purpose at least there's no -- at this point, they are restricted. 
    I mean there some facilities that are restricted.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="847.546" stopTime="919.977">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Did the Commission anywhere in its rules or anywhere else advised Pipe Lines that if they enter into a contract to take natural gas and they come to the Commission and get a certificate of convenience and necessity that the contract term does not mean what an ordinarily means that's really the position here, isn't it? 
    That is to say if the Commission basic position here it seems to me is that the Pipe Line makes a contract with a producer that the term limitation, the limitation of the contract as to time is subject to nullification by the Commission or to quite add more accurately that the contract continues indefinitely regardless of the terms classified therein unless the Commission otherwise permits by order, is that what this is about?
speaker="peter_h_schiff" startTime="919.977" stopTime="930.842">
    Mr. Peter H. Schiff

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well, it's even worst than Justice Fortas' question suggested, isn't it? 
    It's the duties under the contract continue indefinitely but your rights end when the contract ends. 
    In other words, your duty continues to take the gas but then on the seller after the expiration of contract of sellers sets the price in which you take it. 
    It's worst --
speaker="peter_h_schiff" startTime="950.410" stopTime="1030.000">
    Mr. Peter H. Schiff 
    Well, the seller -- this -- well, it's not -- this, I don't know that it's worst but at least it's the same situation that the -- in which the distributors, the purchasers from the pipeline find themselves in all the time, if you recall the Memphis case in which United Gas Pipe Line sold two various distributors. 
    This Court agreed where the Federal Power Commission that a Pipe Line which had a service agreement which permitted to change rates whenever the Pipe Line wanted to was a perfectly valid service agreement and so that in fact at this time like the all Pipe Line sells at least to the distributors or made under contract if you will which permit the Pipe Line unilaterally to change the rates and so that while Mr. Woods suggest that the cost can't be passed on and conceivably that may be true with respect to some of these if they have direct sale customers. 
    The normal situation is that the Pipe Line cost can be passed on, on the mere unilateral rate following of the Pipe Line Company.

    Mr. Peter H. Schiff 
    The -- well, in the Sunray case, it was held that once the Pipe Line's obligations during the contract or the neutral obligations to control by the contract after the contract is over the producer may under the terms of the Gas Act file for an increase rate.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="1117.257" stopTime="1132.447">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Well, I understand that but the question is whether the contract is over or whether what the Commission has done here is to extend the contract or to write a new contract for the five years, it's a --
speaker="peter_h_schiff" startTime="1132.447" stopTime="1367.857">
    Mr. Peter H. Schiff 
    Well, as we believe that the Commission didn't extend the contract when the contract is filed initially, as was pointed out in the Sunray case by this Court, the service is rendered as the contract but it also becomes the rate schedule which is legally enforced regardless to what happens to the contract. 
    Changes can't be made without notice to the Commission. 
    Now, the reason of the Commission didn't permit this rate to become into effect is because the level was that the level at which the Commission has allowed all the rates in this area should become into effect and while it was increase there was still a rather low price and as I pointed out yesterday they're just isn't reasonable that this price has not been challenged and nobody in the area rate case for example has suggested that any lower price should be approved. 
    In many other cases, if the rate is high the Commission might not allow the rate to go in to effect perhaps because of the Pipe Line's sales pattern. 
    That, we suggest is the question for an abandonment proceeding but it is not a question which relates to the Commission's jurisdiction. 
    Now, I would like to point out that United says that the Commission cannot compel a purchase and therefore it should not be allowed to require a continuation of a purchase. 
    The Commission cannot require a producer to initiate a sale but still it's well established that the Commission can require the continuation of the sale. 
    The point is that after a service has been initiated there are many other interests which become affected and therefore the abandonment provision attached for the reason that public protection is required. 
    I should also point out that when the Gas Act was originally passed in 1938, the abandonment provision existed as they do now. 
    They did not - the Act at that time contained very limited certificate provisions so that most sales were initiated without any certificate approval but nevertheless once the service is commenced they could not be withdrawn without Commission approval. 
    Finally, in this respect a reference is made to the fact that prior to the passage of the Gas Act a bill had been proposed to the Congress it's HR 5711 which related to or which referred specifically to pipeline purchasers and that therefore and that since no such reference appears in the Act that passed that this shows that Congress didn't want us to be able to control purchases. 
    Fact of the matter is that that bill in terms they, the Commission jurisdiction only over natural gas pipeline companies so that the only possible way that the Commission under the sort of a proposal could've treated with a sales purchase arrangement would've been from the purchase side. 
    But that's became completely unnecessary when the Natural Gas Act was passed giving the Commission jurisdiction over the sale as such and I think just that nothing in the Gas Act suggest that the Commission would not intended to have comprehensive control over the Pipe Line segment of the industry and that United provision would merely result in a gap and would not support full protection to the ultimate consumers which are the prime beneficiaries under the Natural Gas Act.

    There is some evidence to suggest drainage but this issue was not really involved in the Commission proceeding but the Commission did make the finding that in most instances there would be there might also be wastage because the facilities are being unused to make it later impossible to bring the steps from the ground at all. 
    I suggest that the problem here is a jurisdictional problem. 
    United has never avail itself to the opportunity to present all the facts and that we say is the only issue does it have to come to the Commission or can it take this action without any regulatory supervision.

   Argument of Bruce R. Merrill
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1628.072" stopTime="1638.769">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Merrill.
speaker="bruce_r_merrill" startTime="1638.769" stopTime="1895.281">
    Mr. Bruce R. Merrill 
    Mr. Chief Justice and if it please the Court. 
    The Government has dressed itself to the jurisdictional aspects of this controversy. 
    I address the Court to make sure that the economic and equitable consequences of this decision will be fully understood. 
    This case is before this Court because in many, many instances gas for years continues to produce great qualities of gas long years after the termination of the contracts governing the gas sales. 
    In many other instances, the production after a contract termination is module. 
    The question from an economic and equitable standpoint as between the private parties is what rule should govern when the producer seller and the Pipe Line who buy do not reach a new agreement to control the terms under which continuing gas deliveries will be made. 
    A call or a question is what rules will come closest to creating bargaining equality between the buyer and the seller under such circumstances. 
    We must start with too clearly existing rules of law. 
    This Court held in CATCO and Sunray, that a producer must continue to sale and deliver his gas after contract termination unless the permission on the Commission to abandon has been first obtained. 
    Now, whether we producers like that rule or not that is the law. 
    This Court also has held that whether there is no contract a seller may unilaterally file a rate increase. 
    It is submitted that it has no remedy and no relief to producer to have the right to unilaterally file a rate increase in the absence of an obligation on the part of the bar to bar. 
    The second rule does not hold the producer harmless from the consequences in the first because the amount of their rate becomes a nullity where is there is no sale and delivery. 
    Moreover, this Court is aware that oil and gas leases are subject to forfeiture upon cessation of production over given period of time quite commonly 90 days. 
    Therefore, a producer if a pipeline can choose to cut off delivery underneath of time would not only suffer drainage and would not only suffer the lost of any return on its investment that might well lose its entire investment through his forfeiture. 
    Well, there are no rule require to buyer to buy. 
    The buyer would have unconscionable bargaining advantage and substantial control of the interstate's supply as seller would be forced to take whatever rate the pipeline offered while the buyer at its selection could cause a considerable amount of gas supplied to be forever lost in intrastate market. 
    This Court should not condone a rule which will cause such an equities between the parties and such control over gas supply. 
    In the absence of a requirement on the part of a Pipe Line to continue taking gas deliveries neither the right to seek abandonment which might or might not be granted and which would be a remedy to a producer only if there's a satisfactory ultimate market nor the right deal out of a file or rate increase afford the producer in a dependable solution to its needs or even the needs of the ultimate consumer who depends upon these committee gas supplies. 
    In rulemaking Section 7 (b), the abandonment section applicable to purchasers of pipelines however does not leave the Pipe Line without an adequate meaningful remedy. 
    If it is the unilateral rate to which the Pipe Line objects, the pipeline is protected under the rate review functions of the Commission under Sections 4 and 5 of the Act and under the usual escalation clauses in the Pipe Line sales contract.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="1895.281" stopTime="1904.019">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Is there any way for -- to supersede the price provision of the contract during the contract's term in your judgment?

    Mr. Bruce R. Merrill 
    No, Your Honor.

    I think there has been a small amount of controversy about that.
speaker="bruce_r_merrill" startTime="1908.209" stopTime="1954.246">
    Mr. Bruce R. Merrill 
    I believe (Inaudible) has pretty well answered that question that if there is a contractual impediment there may be no unilateral rate increase. 
    Memphis on the other hand says that if there is no contractual impediment. 
    There may be a unilateral on its face as just as unreasonable is that the rate increase that left up to decision of the Commission. 
    Sierra says that if the rate increase is necessary to prevent confiscation maybe of the pipeline that under that circumstance there may be an increase but he say that it's matter just loosing money on an improvident contract that they will -- that abrogate the contracts.

    Mr. Bruce R. Merrill 
    Thank you, Your Honor. 
    One more moment, if the Pipe Line does not want to take the gas at any price for some peculiar reason the Pipe Line may seek abandonment which is granted but always provide a meaningful remedy to the Pipe Line. 
    With it simplest terms is either the buyer or the seller is to be bound by Section 7 (b) then the rule of fair play requires it both be bound.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="1990.099" stopTime="2020.961">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Mr. Merrill, may I ask you? 
    Mr. Merrill, you suggested that the Pipe Line Company is not without remedy because of the powers to determine the reasonableness of some of the rate under Section 4 or 5 on the unilateral filing by the producer. 
    Now let's see, how does that work if let's say unilateral filing by the producer and the rates are suspended under 4 and then ultimately there's a determination of the rates too high, does that permit they were companied by the pipeline?
speaker="bruce_r_merrill" startTime="2020.961" stopTime="2036.179">
    Mr. Bruce R. Merrill 
    Yes, Your Honor, that permits to recover by the Pipe Line if the Commission finds the rate was too high that the increase shouldn't have been permitted, we have to refund all the increase and interest of 7%.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2036.179" stopTime="2048.862">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    But I take it merely the -- if the Pipe Line goes to another source of supply that were permitted to but with another source of supply that it wouldn't have to pay the same price.
speaker="bruce_r_merrill" startTime="2048.862" stopTime="2054.998">
    Mr. Bruce R. Merrill 
    Well, Your Honor of course in initiating the purchase, the Pipe Line displayed the bargain --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2054.998" stopTime="2057.222">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    There's an area of price there.
speaker="bruce_r_merrill" startTime="2057.222" stopTime="2062.518">
    Mr. Bruce R. Merrill 
    Well, there's a guideline rate in South Louisiana area rate has not yet been established.

    Justice Byron R. White 
    What was the -- was Continental new rate that that guideline price?
speaker="bruce_r_merrill" startTime="2068.167" stopTime="2073.773">
    Mr. Bruce R. Merrill 
    Continental's new rate is that the guideline rate for all gas or for increase price, yes.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="2073.773" stopTime="2075.041">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Fifteen or some cents?

    Mr. Bruce R. Merrill 
    Fifteen and three quarter cents including tax reimbursement.

speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2083.667" stopTime="2092.739">

    Mr. Bruce R. Merrill

    Mr. Vernon W. Woods 
    Well, the point is that the Commission can review it of course. 
    But it reviews from Continental's needs. 
    Now, the question has been asked whether we could --
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="2292.902" stopTime="2304.085">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Well, that's Continental's needs, I still insist that of course I dissented on this whole area of business you may call but nevertheless I thought that introduce the new concept --
speaker="vernon_w_woods" startTime="2304.085" stopTime="2328.339">
    Mr. Vernon W. Woods 
    They review it by the producer's needs if that's the new concept but still it's not the Pipe Line's needs. 
    In other words, the 15.75 cents is what's required to permit the producer to make a fair return in his investment. 
    All the producers has a group, it doesn't have anything to do with what we make, the Pipe Line. 
    Now, the answer to this question about whether we can get yes, cheaper or not; there's been a lot of conjecture but the answer is we can and if we -- as act after Congress intended (Voice Overlap) --
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="2328.339" stopTime="2330.002">

    Mr. Vernon W. Woods 
    We can get it cheaper other than this. 
    We can get a cheaper then they can eventually raise these prices unilateral and we can bargain with Continental, we can probably get a cheap in 15.75 cents. 
    The point is that Congress intended that we buy gas on contract and we sell it on contract and if we are left to our bargaining position we can protect ourselves in the public. 
    Now, we are trying to get its Continental. 
    We're competing with these people but in markets in South Louisiana and South Texas, they can take that gas that they say to us, you've got to pay 15.75 cents and they can sell it to the City of like Charles or somebody of 14 cents but we can't necessarily prove it except we can see the end-result and where the companies got to deal with that. 
    We've got to protect ourselves and we've got to protect the public and we can a buy gas cheaper in intrastate market than we can buy in interstate market than they will sell it cheaper and it can be both cheaper and after our bargaining strength we can buy a cheaper. 
    Not, not only applies in this case, it applies to us all across South Louisiana because everyone of our gas contract is going to expire down there. 
    And if ever producer can tell us, you got to pay the maximum price the Commission will allow now and in future and we're down to business. 
    And Mr. Black and Mr. Justice Black sir, that's a controversy. 
    There's nothing that that Commission can do to protect us. 
    We sell our gas to be in, we sell 46% of our gas, the record is in -- 
    The Commission can't do anything about that, it's completely beyond jurisdiction. 
    They can't affect those rates. 
    They can't help us in any respect. 
    We sell that gas, we fix the price with the industry and if we sell a gas at 16 cents, we've got to buy it about 12 cents or 13 cents and we have got the bargaining strength that we have all through the history of this Natural Gas Act, we can buy it that way by a particular sale.

    Mr. Vernon W. Woods 
    For the very good reason sir, I think I'm conjectured as to why the producers will sell it cheaper. 
    It avoids a great deal of red tape in Government regulation. 
    There's no regulation that reduce the price intrastate. 
    He just sell it us over a contract and the day the contract expires, his gas again and he will sell a cheaper because of that fact.

    Well, I don't know but I'm saying that left up to us. 
    Left up to us, we can keep it from a down and we can protect ourselves and we can protect the public. 
    This is the public's interest we're protecting here and to conclude my argument, Mr. Justice White, Congress considered doing what you were talking about and that is making Pipe Lines common carriers and common purchasers. 
    It did so in the Senate Resolution 1919 and it's federal resolution we referred to and it refused to do so, it didn't adopt it. 
    Now, the effect to that would've have been done what you're talking about that is to make us buy and the transport but had it done so, sir? 
    Had it done so, it would given the Commission a power the Commission doesn't have and that's the power it's been talked about in common purchasers statutes before this Court and that is the regulatory commission would had the authority to look at Continental's rate with reference to our needs and with reference to the market conditions and to be able to insure that their price is long enough to us so that when we sold it that we would make a fair return in our investment and our facilities.

    Mr. Vernon W. Woods 
    Sir, the record is quite clear on that. 
    We bought some gas and we did pay some more money for it but the record is quite clear that we did it under a circumstances where we were faced with a producer coming to us and saying, it isn't -- it wasn't this area, it was in part to the east but it came to us and said, I'm going to lose my well, I got one well here, will you buy this gas?" 
    Well, now we've lived in that area for 40 years down there and we didn't want him to lose his well and we did buy his well. 
    It didn't go in this whole amount of area, it went over to New Orleans there and we bought the gas for 18 cents but it was not substitute for this gas and the record reflects that it was.

    Justice Byron R. White 
    Can I ask you one more item? 
    I gather that the Commission would still take the same position it does even if there were no physical facilities could be abandoned here at all that if all these facilities actually bring the gas right to your pipeline that belong to the seller and all you did was say, we don't want anymore that we want to buy anymore gas. 
    You had to abandon nothing, they would still say you were abandoning a service, the service being the service of buying gas. 
    Is that your position that's why you want to understand it?

    Don't they say it here or not?

    They say facilities and the service.
speaker="vernon_w_woods" startTime="2752.500" stopTime="2805.296">
    Mr. Vernon W. Woods 
    Well, they say facilities and they ought to, counsel here to appreciate talks about services, maybe the Commission did mention service somewhere sir. 
    But service once again, be it facilities or service that still doesn't give the Commission power they just otherwise have. 
    And I don't think it makes any difference Mr. Justice White where they talked about facilities or service. 
    If they don't have power to force us to purchasing -- to purchase gas then they don't have a power to do so. 
    It just simply begs the question to say well, we can force you to purchase it because we got jurisdiction of your billing or your pipeline or something of that nature. 
    The days going to come when our pipelines will be full of gas because of the perhaps the theory in production or something and they're going to -- are they going to move in and say you've got to go out and buy gas some place to Philadelphia, that's read of the question and you've got to pay the price that we tell you. 
    We don't really object to that if the bills amended to take care of us in term but we don't think it's in the public interest, we don't think Congress thought in the public interest to do so.

    Mr. Vernon W. Woods 
    Yes, sir. 
    May I explain just one moment? 
    The producer is an absent no different position from what the pipeline or any other utility had been in all the existence of utility law. 
    Once a pipeline begins to serve a customer, an account boarded customer, a distributor, he can't stop serving that distributor.

    Yes.
speaker="vernon_w_woods" startTime="2850.592" stopTime="2879.351">
    Mr. Vernon W. Woods 
    That distributor doesn't have to buy a foot of gas from us, he doesn't have to pay one cent for that gas that he doesn't contractually agree to and maybe that's the whole point of this argument. 
    And we're in the same position that distributor yes. 
    We are the bar here and the Natural Gas Act doesn't compel that distributor to buy one foot of gas from us or to pay one cent for it. 
    He doesn't contract to agree to and if the FPC increased our price, he doesn't have to buy if he doesn't contract to agree to it. 
    The FPC has said, it can't force the distributor to buy gas from us and it can.

    Mr. Vernon W. Woods 
    Well, sir I accepted under my in the deal when I sell the distributor. 
    The point is that the Act regulates the sale and it was intended to continue the sale of gas. 
    It never was intended to force the purchasing of gas. 
    So long as the purchaser owns gas, the sellers got to sell it but he's got protection sir. 
    He can file unilaterally, a rate is fair and reasonable from his point of view and we can do it when we sell the distributor. 
    We have lots of distributors refuses on the contract with these ones who initiated service but the man that we continue service. 
    Now, we're complaining that that distributor can't be force to buy from us. 
    We don't think that's an equitable regulation and we don't think it's inequitable when the Pipe Line isn't force to buy up and the seller in the form of producer. 
    Now, the Act might have been written differently. 
    We might have been made it common carrier or common purchaser and there would be a lot of remedies to us under the Act, but Congress didn't arrive that way sir. 
    Congress intended to do one thing really and that's to regulate the sale of gas in interstate commerce. 
    It did not adopt that Act that would regulate the purchase of gas. 
    It did not choose to make us common purchasers and it done so we've been entirely different act. 
    Now, this been about getting a gas to the market and about protecting the Continental and so forth in these circumstances, it may well be the common purchase allows the good thing, it ought to be adopted by Congress. 
    As a matter of fact, Louisiana, sir has a Common Purchaser Act and Continental maybe in the wrong court. 
    It could have gone to the court such as Louisiana Department of Conservation and said, I want to exercise my rights in the common purchase of law of Louisiana and I want you to force United to buy my gas that had been done so. 
    We could've told Continental. 
    We'll give you to go in to your rate under Louisiana law. 
    But the difference is that the Natural Gas Act is not a common purchase of law and that's really what's this whole thing is about and if it were written to common purchase of law and if we had the protection that the common purchase of law would give us, then we wouldn't be here complaining. 
    But we don't have that protection (Voice Overlap).

    Now, that's a problem we have to meet and so that's the reason we're up here is to stay in this, wherever they must.

    Now, of course if we've got to ask some of it, if it turns out that the date of the abandonment of facilities means that they've got the right to force us to buy gas and we'll go back to that and I know what they're going to say.
