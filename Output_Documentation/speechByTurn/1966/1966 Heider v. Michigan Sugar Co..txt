    On December 21st, 1958, two small children, David Heider, age 8 and James Heider, age 12, went upon the defendant's property. 
    At that time the defendant -- respondent, Michigan Sugar Company maintained several acres of ponds. 
    These ponds were connected up by an overflow pipe. 
    The temperature at the time was 12 degrees below zero and the -- around the overflow pipe chemicals and the action of the water create a foaming area that resemble snow. 
    This froze and the rest of the pond was solid ice except around the overflow pipe where this area built up a foamy, snowy substance that itself was frozen and but was not solid underneath. 
    These two boys and their little dog, a water spaniel, went upon the tenants property, became entrapped in this condition. 
    This dangerous, distracted condition maintained by the respondent, Sugar Company, and they were drowned. 
    An action was brought in the Circuit Court, Saginaw County to recover for their death. 
    The jury in the case of David Heider, it turned a verdict in the amount of $125,000 and the judge in the companion case, James Heider because of different measure of damages returned a judgment $41,000. 
    A case -- a motion for a new trial was filed by the respondent except for a certain reasons and grounds for appeal. 
    The motion was denied. 
    An appeal was taken to the Supreme Court of the state of Michigan. 
    With all this procedure, so far there has been no complaint but then completely outside of the record to the Supreme Court of the State of Michigan, the respondent Michigan Sugar Company in its brief on appeal brought forth to the attention of the Supreme Court an endeavor to bring forth to the attention of the Supreme Court a statute known as Public Act 201 of the Public Acts of the State of Michigan in the year 1953 claiming that this statute affected the case.

    Mr. Gregory M. Pillon 
    Oh, I can amend, I can amend. 
    The problem is that basic rate fundamentally a person is entitled to a day in court. 
    And this is a statute that should have been raised by the defense as a -- in a proper manner in a trial court so that I have an opportunity to be met with. 
    So I could -- if you look at the actual facts like David never owned traps, he couldn't physically set a trap, he'd never come within the statute. 
    And if you look at the fact that there was no eye witnesses to this case, there was -- I mean no eye witnesses to the boys being on the land at the time of their death and their drowning. 
    This present fact questions under the statute. 
    What was James doing on the land at that time? 
    But the Supreme Court by its very actions has taken this statute and apply it retroactively to whatever facts were shown or to the pleadings and have barred me without ever giving us an opportunity to have our day in court in relation to the statute.

    Mr. Gregory M. Pillon 
    That's right. 
    But as I -- my answer to you Mr. Justice Fortas is this. 
    Is that first of all, if I had been met with the statute I could've distinguished the -- at least what David was doing as compared to what James was doing out of -- there'd been constructive effort made but in addition to that you're reading what -- in interpreting the -- my declaration, three of the judges said that I state that they were trapping on a land, three of the judges say I don't state that I was trapping on the land.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="714.398" stopTime="719.938">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    You said since on -- its James who is 12 years old.

    Mr. Gregory M. Pillon 
    Right.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="724.763" stopTime="731.808">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    And a dog, the declaration didn't say how old he was, set out muskrat trapping.
speaker="gregory_m_pillon" startTime="731.808" stopTime="829.376">
    Mr. Gregory M. Pillon 
    But on the other hand to come under the statute there had to be muskrat trapping on that particular land at that particular time. 
    That'd be the first point that I'd like to make. 
    Now, it seems to me what's really happened here is that when you're prepared to have a trial in a court it's done in a -- suppose to be done in an orderly fashion. 
    I presented pleadings, issues and we set forth the basis and had a trial. 
    The defendant, the respondent, Michigan Sugar Company put in a general denial, pleaded contributory negligence to the minors and the parents that after warning was given not to use the premises and that they had lack of knowledge that minors were upon the premises. 
    We tried the case upon those issues and those -- that basis and then what happen is the defendant is permitted to raise a statute out of orderly proceedings and what does he do? 
    He get -- he binds the petitioner by his actions to his pleadings and to the record that he made in the trial court. 
    But the defendant is permitted or the respondent, Michigan Sugar Company was permitted by the action of the Michigan Supreme Court to revoke every bit of pleadings, every word that he ever uttered said before.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="829.376" stopTime="856.989">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Now this -- isn't it -- let's put this question to you to understand what you are saying, (Inaudible). 
    Having filed (Inaudible) the Michigan Supreme Court said, how is it not a matter of defense. 
    Once it appeared that these people were trap -- trapping, there was no jurisdiction in the lower court to entertain such an action based on ordinary negligence.
speaker="gregory_m_pillon" startTime="856.989" stopTime="859.838">
    Mr. Gregory M. Pillon 
    Well, three of them said that. 
    But two of them said --

    What about the other two?
speaker="gregory_m_pillon" startTime="860.964" stopTime="872.700">
    Mr. Gregory M. Pillon 
    The other said that I failed to prove facts to take me outside the statute and therefore I entered a judgment of no cause of action. 
    In other words, I never was met with the statute on the lower court.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="872.700" stopTime="889.783">
    Unknown Speaker 
    (Inaudible) is there anything that this is not a matter of defense, it's a matter of the state law, it's a matter of -- you're not having a showing a cause of action of which under either view of the two or the three judges, if you can go to the trial court, dismiss the case.

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Let's suppose, it'd be the same result?
speaker="gregory_m_pillon" startTime="946.429" stopTime="953.851">
    Mr. Gregory M. Pillon 
    I'd still be here because the Supreme Court by its very action would have been depriving me of my day in court because this is what I'm complaining about.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="953.851" stopTime="962.755">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    That's what I was thinking. 
    So it's not so much that the defendant for the first time raised this in the Supreme Court as it is that the Supreme Court relied on it all.
speaker="gregory_m_pillon" startTime="962.755" stopTime="1157.310">
    Mr. Gregory M. Pillon 
    Relied on it all and then so can bound me by a record and bound me by a pleading relieving the defendant from or the Michigan Sugar Company completely from their -- every word they ever uttered and then to my complete surprise dismiss the case. 
    I mean, if they sent it back for new trial I could understand. 
    I'd have a chance to show that David wasn't trapping and that if James was, that's a fact question because nobody saw them at the time they died. 
    And -- but now let's go on to this question of the equal protection, the -- under the -- many times I just said your passed statutes, they don't really change laws. 
    An adult trespasser in the State of Michigan before this statute was passed could recover against a landowner only for gross negligence or willful or wanton misconduct. 
    On the other hand under the common law of Michigan as developed by the (Inaudible) case in which at least 40 states in the union have adopted the theory of the protection of the minor. 
    We have in the common law of Michigan that provides that if a child because of his immature years goes upon the land of another that there can be a recovery for ordinary negligence upon a showing that the landowner has knowledge or should know that the children are there and he maintains a dangerous condition. 
    And this doctrine was enunciated even by this Court under the attractive nuisance doctrine beginning with a turntable case. 
    Now, the effect of the Supreme Court's interpretation by applying this statute to these two immature children is saying that as to a child the only effect the statute has is to a child. 
    The only effect it has is to the immature child that it discriminates against the immature child in relation to the other immature child who was upon the property. 
    In other words if in fact one boy had a slingshot to go hunting with or a fishing pole to go fishing with and he took a friend along with him and they both drowned under identical circumstances at the same place at the same time. 
    The little boy with the fishing pole cannot get a recovery as the court applied this statute except by proving gross negligence or willful or wanton misconduct. 
    But the other boy who didn't have the fishing pole with him, he can recover for ordinary negligence and this is a peculiar thing by -- in tradition interpretation --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="1157.310" stopTime="1161.863">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    I know, but even they were a pair of adults under the statute, the same result would follow?
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="1161.863" stopTime="1223.905">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    If there's a pair of adults then no adult can recover except for gross negligence or willful or wanton misconduct. 
    No adult can recover -- a trespassing adult can't recover for ordinary negligence but every child in the State of Michigan can recover, a trespassing child can recover for ordinary negligence except those few insignificant children who may hunt, fish or trap and their -- believe me, if they go out with a slingshot to get a bird or they've got a home made fishing pole which every boy has to classify them in the same category as the adult hunter, fisher or trapper is that it seems to me invidious and especially so when we have a rule protecting little children so that any other child of the same 8 year old -- any other 8 year old child can recover for ordinary negligence.

    Mr. Gregory M. Pillon 
    Yes, yes. 
    And the reason is this is that the statute had never been -- let me say a few words here about the question of the timely raising of the federal questions because somehow opposing counsel has interjected this in here saying that the federal questions weren't timely raised and the answer to that problem is this is a -- it seem to me beyond reasonable to anticipate that a Supreme Court would act in an unconstitutional manner. 
    In Dombrowski versus Pfister in 380 U.S. 479, you laid down the doctrine that -- it's generally assumed that state courts and prosecutors will act in a constitutional manner. 
    Now, the problem is that in -- it would seem futile to me to say to a court before it renders a decision, don't do it in an unconstitutional manner. 
    Until there's an actual constitutional violation I can't raise the question. 
    This statute had never been interpreted before. 
    It was completely out -- raised outside of a record and has a very serious question, even the respondent admits at his brief on page 24, that's a very serious question whether the court was even going to entertain the statute. 
    Then when the court accepts the statute completely out of procedural order then in -- applies it in an unconstitutional manner only then can I raise the federal questions and I think that the case of Saunders versus Shaw is a case that's directly in point on this issue. 
    It covers both the issues, timely raising the federal question in an action of the Supreme Court denying you a day in court --

   Argument of Harry M. Plotkin
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1596.525" stopTime="1598.458">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Plotkin.
speaker="harry_m_plotkin" startTime="1598.458" stopTime="1780.363">
    Mr. Harry M. Plotkin 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    The usher of the case here presents two problems. 
    One, did the petitioner raise the federal question that he is urging before Your Honors now at -- in the appropriate time? 
    Secondly, if he did not, is there any merit to the points that he does raise? 
    I should point out to the court that we are urging that in our brief that he did not raise the federal questions in the appropriate time. 
    I should point out that in the opposition for petition for certiorari where we should have raised this point, our point was not raised. 
    We were not counsel at that stage. 
    When we came in we thought that this was a jurisdictional problem and we do raise it at this late stage of the game. 
    We do think it's appropriate for the court to consider this time on behalf of the respondent we apologize for not raising it to you at the time when a petition for certiorari was before you. 
    The facts are very simple. 
    At the trial the case was tried on the assumption that this was the case of ordinary negligence. 
    When judgment was entered for the plaintiff and it was convened for the court, I'll refer to the parties, this plaintiff and the defendant because they then interchange our position when they'd come to the Michigan Supreme Court. 
    But when judgment was -- for the plaintiff the defendant appealed to the Michigan Supreme Court. 
    In the Michigan Supreme Court for the first time it called attention to Act 201. 
    Act 201 on the face of it deprives the court below of jurisdiction that provides that there's no cause of action shall arise when people are upon the lands of another for the purpose of hunting, fishing or trapping unless there's either compensation paid or unless the occupier of the land is guilty of gross negligence or wanton and willful misconduct. 
    In the brief before the Michigan Supreme Court the question was specifically raised and we have incorporated as an Appendix A to our brief in this Court the portion of our brief raising this point in the portion of the plaintiff's brief and required thereto. 
    We specifically raised the question, whether the Court of Appeal -- whether the Supreme Court could consider Act 201 as dispositive even though it had not been raised in the court below? 
    We raises the question, we brief to point -- we specifically pointed out that under the cases that we cited that while normally it look -- the -- an appellate court would not consider a point for the first time when raised there when it had not been raised below. 
    That it was a matter -- that the court could consider and that if it were a case like the instant one where there was a statute which removed the cause of action as one that court should consider. 
    More or less we point that moreover we pointed out that as we interpreted the statute it was not a matter of defense for the defendant to raise but was a matter of the cause of action of the plaintiff and therefore it was something that the plaintiff should have addressed himself to. 
    The defendant --
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="1780.363" stopTime="1782.517">
    Unknown Speaker 
    This is in (Inaudible)
speaker="harry_m_plotkin" startTime="1782.517" stopTime="1850.571">
    Mr. Harry M. Plotkin 
    The plaintiff then filed its reply brief. 
    We filed the first brief. 
    In his reply brief he addressed himself specifically to the points that we had raised. 
    We had set forth a number of state authorities to the point that the state as a matter of state law can't -- the state Supreme Court can't as a matter of state law consider the matter. 
    Plaintiff disagreed. 
    He cited a number of state cases to the fact of the Michigan Supreme Court could not or should not consider the matter. 
    He disputed our contention that the statute was a matter of -- for the plaintiff's responsibility, he said it was a matter for the defendants responsibility to plea. 
    The matter was at issue. 
    Neither one of us should raise any federal question up to that point which -- that as a matter of state law, Michigan can't consider it. 
    He said as a matter of state law, Michigan cannot consider it. 
    The Michigan Supreme Court then proceeded by five to three vote to rule that the statute could be considered that it was a matter that was a responsibility of the plaintiff and that on that basis the plaintiff had not made out a cause of action and that the matter should be reversed without a new trial. 
    I should point out that --

    Facts of facts, you don't -- it wasn't a question that we have surprised them by bringing up something that affected this -- there is De Facto were on opposition. 
    All of the facts were brought out. 
    He alleges in his complaint that the children were out trapping. 
    In his opening statement to the court he said the children were out trapping. 
    In his opening statement to the jury he made the same thing. 
    As a matter of fact if you'll look at page 20 -- 30 of our brief --

    Mr. Harry M. Plotkin 
    The Michigan Supreme Court in interpreting this statute said that the burden was on the plaintiff, at least five judges said so. 
    I' m not sure the three other judges disagreed. 
    I think the other three judges thought that the statute was not applicable and therefore never reached this point. 
    But five judges specifically indicated that was his burden that he failed to do it on the question as to whether he could or could not amend, he has never asked the -- even the Michigan Supreme Court believe to amend either in his original argument or in his application for rehearing. 
    He'd never ask and now what if they would have granted leave to amend the note, I don't know.

    Now, here he raises both substantive due process and procedural due process. 
    Substantive due process he says that Act 201 is unconstitutional. 
    That point was never raised before the Michigan Supreme Court until the application for rehearing. 
    He was clearly on notice when we filed our original brief that we are going to rely on Act 201. 
    We specifically called the courts attention to it and at that point when he argued to the court he never gave him any indications that Act 201 was substantively unconstitutional.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="2279.246" stopTime="2280.694">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Was that his equal protection argument?
speaker="harry_m_plotkin" startTime="2280.694" stopTime="2573.600">
    Mr. Harry M. Plotkin 
    That's his equal protection argument, yes. 
    On that he waived -- clearly he was on notice and if he had a substantive constitutional point he should've raised at that point. 
    He raised it for the first time on petition for a rehearing and we contend that that's too late. 
    He also on the petition for rehearing raised for the first time the question that the Michigan Supreme Court that somehow rather acted unconstitutionally by relying on Act 201 when it had not been raised in the trial court. 
    All contentions on that point up to that stage of the proceeding had been as a matter of state law, there's been no federal constitutional law point raised at all. 
    Both parties had addressed themselves to that contention as a matter of state law. 
    The Michigan Supreme Court disposed of it as a matter of state law and then the matter was -- first raised on an application for rehearing to the Michigan Supreme Court which disposed of it without writing an opinion. 
    Under the case that we have cited in our brief which says, it is too late to raise a constitutional law, a federal constitutional law point at the stage of petition for rehearing. 
    Now, we recognize in the cases we cite that there are two exceptions to that principle. 
    One is where the federal constitutional point is raised for the first time on petition for a rehearing and the state court does in fact in disposing that petition for rehearing consider the federal constitutional points. 
    That did not happen here. 
    The cases are very clear that where the State Supreme Court refuses to write an opinion but just disposes a petition for rehearing without an opinion that the fact that the petitioner raises at that stage is too late. 
    There's a second line of a case that we are -- where it create an exception, there are the case of Saunders v. Shaw and the Brinkerhoff case that we cite. 
    These are the cases where there are supervening circumstances that petition that could not have reasonably anticipated which result in petition or not raising the constitutional point until the petition for rehearing stage. 
    And the Brinkerhoff case illustrates that point very well. 
    It's almost a case of entrapment or almost of sandbagging to use a colloquial expression. 
    In that case, an attack had been made on the constitutionality of attacks. 
    The -- when the taxpayer lost, he took the matter of Supreme Court. 
    In the Supreme Court of the state, the Supreme Court of the State said that the taxpayer did not exhaust his administrative remedies because he had not applied to an administrative tribunal for the purpose of asking relief on this very point. 
    Now, it so happen that prior to the Brinkerhoff in the lower court, the decisions of that same Supreme Court have held that the administrative remedies were not in fact available to a taxpayer. 
    The Supreme Court of the State in Brinkerhoff overruled its earlier opinion and said, "We were wrong." 
    The administrative proceeding is in fact available to a taxpayer and you are out of court because you didn't resort to that administrative remedy. 
    Well, clearly this was a denial of due process. 
    There, a taxpayer didn't follow an administrative proceeding that was not available to him. 
    As a matter of fact in Brinkerhoff, the court itself -- this Court made clear that had there not been a prior opinion of the state courts specifically holding that the administrative remedy was not available, in other words had the question been undecided up to that point, then the taxpayer would run the risk of making up his mind of interpreting the state law as to whether the administrative remedy was or was not in fact available to him. 
    And if he guessed wrong on that, the Supreme Court of the State could throw him out for failure to exhaust administrative remedy. 
    What the -- what this Court said in Brinkerhoff was that would the -- that where the Lower Supreme Court, whether the Supreme Court of the State have previously -- explicitly held that the remedy was not available it could not and the very opinion reversing that earlier opinion come back and say, "But we were wrong before. 
    We reversed it. 
    The administrative remedy is in fact available and we're throwing you out for not addressing yourself to it." 
    It therefore appears to be very clear to us that neither at the exception is available and that this constitutional problem are therefore not properly before the court. 
    On the merits and the argument on the merits really blend very much with the procedural arguments except on sections with due process. 
    Assuming that he is entitled to raise for the first time the substantive due process question here, it is our contention that there's no merit whatsoever. 
    It seems to us that this is a very reasonable classification for the state to him -- to engage in. 
    The state can say that people who are on the lands of the other for the purpose of hunting, fishing and trapping are a different class of people and that therefore the law can be different with respect to them than it is to people who are there for purposes, say, of swimming.

speaker="harry_m_plotkin" startTime="2588.937" stopTime="2627.861">
    Mr. Harry M. Plotkin 
    Yes. 
    We have set forth in our brief a collection of statutes in some 30 states which have attempted to address themselves to this very problem. 
    There's no legislative history in Michigan which explains what the Michigan Supreme Court have in mind. 
    There are in other cases where the same statute has been enacted, legislative declarations to the effect that one of the purposes of such a statute is to encourage landowners to permit their private lands to be utilized for hunting, fishing and trapping. 
    We cite a law review article in -- it was contrary being to the effect that apparently --
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="2627.861" stopTime="2629.912">
    Justice Abe Fortas

    Mr. Harry M. Plotkin 
    Well, it may very well be and maybe if we were legislators, we would not do it this way.

    Justice Abe Fortas 
    No, I'm not asking that when I said some other curios things that assume that the legislators did it for that purpose?
speaker="harry_m_plotkin" startTime="2641.374" stopTime="2646.033">
    Mr. Harry M. Plotkin 
    Well, seven legislators have specifically said they did it for that purpose in enacting a statute similar to the --
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="2646.033" stopTime="2649.059">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Was it the same thing here with respect to this legislation?
speaker="harry_m_plotkin" startTime="2649.059" stopTime="2759.013">
    Mr. Harry M. Plotkin 
    No, there is no legislative history in Michigan itself on that point. 
    But we think where 30 states have adopted a legislation of this type and where seven of those legislators have indicated that this is the purpose. 
    We think that this is a valid legislative purpose and is not such invidious discrimination that you ought to strike it down. 
    Just as a matter of digression, it's interesting to know that the plaintiff says that this is a change to the common law of Michigan. 
    As a matter of fact Michigan until 1957 was one of the stricter of the common law states which held that the rule of trespasses was applicable even to minors as well as to adults. 
    It since has changed probably not as completely some of the other states but it has changed somewhat. 
    But it's interesting that in 1953 when this statute was enacted the common law was still in effect even for minors, that even minors under the Michigan common law were not entitled to protection when trespassing on the land of another unless except for -- as against gross negligence. 
    So there weren't even change in the common law. 
    But in any event under the cases that this Court we have cited, this Court has held that the state -- that the states in the railroad cases can enact statutes that when even they're applicable to children of five or seven preclude them from recovering for -- being injured when on the land of a railroad. 
    And those statutes have been upheld by this Court. 
    On a procedural point again we don't -- we think normally, it wasn't timely raised but that there is no real point involved. 
    Two, it would've been better procedure had we -- had the statute been called to the trial court's attention. 
    I don't say that the fault was any more ours than that of the plaintiff. 
    As lawyers I think both sets of lawyers owed it to the court to know about the statute. 
    But in any event --

    The fact remains that it -- at an appropriate stage of the proceeding it was called to the attention of the Michigan Supreme Court.

    Mr. Harry M. Plotkin 
    Well, all I can say is and I'm not a practitioner in Michigan but from reading their cases they are a strict court even though finding ordinary negligence. 
    They find as a matter of law that whether in other cases would be a clear case of ordinary negligence to -- at least one the title go to the jury. 
    They direct verdict for the defendant. 
    Michigan I think is a strong defendant state in this area of law rather than the plaintiff's state. 
    And two of the judges thought that as a matter of law there was no ordinary negligence. 
    When you read some of the other cases, the court directs verdict on ordinary negligence in this type of situation. 
    Now, it's just pure -- it's a pure conjuncture how they will come out but this is a defendant's minded court on negligence matter. 
    Thank you Your Honor.

    Mr. Gregory M. Pillon 
    I've -- just like to say this that if I've been met with the statute in the lower court, had been brought to anybody's attention the pleadings could've been amended. 
    I could've shown three things, one, that David himself owned no traps, couldn't physically even set a trap so he wouldn't -- couldn't be a -- possibly be a trapper and we could cover for ordinary negligence for David. 
    And as for James, James owned traps and he was trapping. 
    There was no eye witnesses when he died on that land at that time then it was a question whether he was trapping on that land and that should've been a jury question. 
    But in any event I could have gone ahead and even claimed as far as James is concern, gross negligence, namely that that they had such dangerous condition, they knew that many people came upon their land, a couple of (Inaudible) sign of warning. 
    They could've prevented this in showing that there was really a trap. 
    I should've -- had that opportunity, but again this illustrates that really equal protection is denied to this children because why should two children, David and James, why should David go on the land and be able because he's not trapping but going along with his brother, recover for ordinary negligence. 
    And his brother, who has a trap and is going to set a trap on that land have to prove gross negligence. 
    Why should it be two standards for two children dying at the same time at same place --

    -- Supreme Court of Michigan said that the statute applies to both of them.

    Mr. Gregory M. Pillon 
    And that's why it's invidious because applied the statute as I said under the common law of Michigan, children could recover for ordinary negligence. 
    When they applied the statute for the little child, the immature child when they say that he is the hunter, the fisher, the trapper, that's in my opinion, is an invidious discrimination. 
    Thank you kindly for your attention.
