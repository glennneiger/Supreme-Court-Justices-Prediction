Walker v. Southern Railway Company

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Number 89, Roy Walker, petitioner versus Southern Railway Company. 
    Mr. Hamrick.
speaker="j_nat_hamrick" startTime="38.368" stopTime="270.620">
    Mr. J. Nat Hamrick 
    Mr. Chief Justice, Honorable Court. 
    I'd like to review for just a moment the factual situation in this case. 
    Roy Walker was employed by the Southern Railroad sometime in 1944. 
    In -- on March 3, 1957, he was informed that he had been displaced by an employee with greater seniority. 
    He then informed the call clerk that he was sick and was going home. 
    He went home and on April the 29th, a letter was directed to him to report for duty. 
    In between these times, it was contended by Mr. Walker that he had informed the railroad of his illness. 
    This record said, “Dear sir, I understand you were displaced from the regular job at airline junction March 3, 1957 and I was yourself since? 
    This is to advise you that you stand for work in your seniority and unless you protect your seniority standing within 30 days from the date of this letter, you will have opted your seniority. 
    Yours very truly, Superintendent.” 
    That letter was dated April the 29th in Greenville, South Carolina. 
    It was signed for May the 30th by Mr. Walker's daughter. 
    He was on the hospital at the time and didn't have knowledge of it for four days. 
    He then went down on May the 29th to report for duty and discovered that his name had been stricken from the seniority list because he had not reported in 30 days. 
    This is actually the turning point of the wrongfulness of the discharged. 
    They told him he couldn't go to work that he had been fired. 
    He went to see the superintendent the next day. 
    The Superintendent of that division, Mr. Brad and in this connection, there has been some suggestion here that taken a man's seniority doesn't fire him, if this is just a grievance or some technical situation? 
    Well, the day after he reported and was told that his seniority was taken. 
    The Superintendent of the Railroad wrote him this letter, he reported this letter was written to him on the -- on the -- “Please refer to my letter dated April the 29, 1957, advising you to protect your seniority within 30 days. 
    You did not report and protect your seniority as instructed and this is stood by you that under the provisions of fireman's agreement and so forth. 
    Your name has been stricken from the firemen seniority list and you are no longer considered an employee of the Southern Railroad. 
    Please turn in all company property you have in your possession to train met -- to Terminal Train Master Curly. 
    Now, there's no question I think that Roy Walker was fired and he was fired because the railroad said he didn't protect his seniority within 30 days. 
    We tried this case in the Western District Court before Judge Craven and Judge Craven found this fact. 
    Walker reported for work on May 29, 1957, it is adjudged that this was the last day of the 30-day period within which he was required to report. 
    Southern for job his seniority as of May 28, 1957 was therefore unlawful and constituted a violation of his contract. 
    So we have a finding of fact by the trial court, we tried it before Judge Craven to the effect that Walker was wrongfully discharged. 
    Now then at this juncture, I want to call the Court's attention to one of the thing I refer to it again later. 
    Later on that year --

    Justice John M. Harlan 
    You say that on the (Inaudible)

    Mr. J. Nat Hamrick 
    Eight days before the Maddox decision. 
    Yes, sir. 
    Now then later on that summer, there was an exchange of letters between Mr. L.G. Tolleson, who is Director of Labor Relations of the Southern Railway, and Mr. R.L. McCollan, General Chairman of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen and Engineers. 
    These letters are printed in the appendix for my brief -- to my brief because by early were not included in the printed records. 
    To make the long story short, Mr. Tolleson writes to Mr. McCollan in my exhibit 3 in the appendix to the brief and after he goes through the whole discussion, he says in next to the last paragraph about the middle of paragraph. 
    This is a Railroad writing to the Union --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="320.610" stopTime="321.200">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    What's that?
speaker="j_nat_hamrick" startTime="321.200" stopTime="323.058">
    Mr. J. Nat Hamrick 
    This is the Railroad writing to the union --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="323.058" stopTime="323.469">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Oh, yes.
speaker="j_nat_hamrick" startTime="323.469" stopTime="408.432">
    Mr. J. Nat Hamrick 
    -- Director of Rail -- Director of Labor Relations writing to the Union, “Your attention is called to the fact the doctor has use a history which I believe he will agree anyone will interpret as meaning that Walker was unable to work during the period he was off. 
    In the light of the circumstances related above, will you please advise promptly what your position is?” 
    The Labor Union asked the Railroad. 
    Here is what the General Chairman of Mr. Walker's Union wrote in response to that letter. 
    It's the second letter in the appendix and then its exhibit 4. 
    “Dear Mr. Tolleson. Referring to your letter of August 23, 1957, concerning the seniority of Fireman R.E. Walker Charlotte Division North, your file. 
    This matter was discussed with you while in Washington September the 11th. 
    You requested that I write you concerning my position to the matter. 
    As I explain to you in commerce, it does not matter with the organization whether this man is returned to service or not. 
    This is the General Chairman of the Union who should be expected to protect Mr. Walker and to help him and at the end of that letter he said, “Considering the circumstances in this case and the claimant's previous record. 
    It would appear that the best action to take would be to let the matter rested it is with Fireman Walker's name removed from seniority list.”
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="408.432" stopTime="409.990">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    What's that last paragraph?
speaker="j_nat_hamrick" startTime="409.990" stopTime="410.373">
    Mr. J. Nat Hamrick 
    I beg your pardon, sir?
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="410.373" stopTime="411.405">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    It's pretty fast --
speaker="j_nat_hamrick" startTime="411.405" stopTime="412.232">
    Mr. J. Nat Hamrick 
    I beg your pardon, sir.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="412.232" stopTime="413.607">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    I didn't get it?
speaker="j_nat_hamrick" startTime="413.607" stopTime="557.637">
    Mr. J. Nat Hamrick 
    Considering the circumstances of this case and the claimant's previous record, it would appear that the best action to take would be to let the matter rest as it is with Fireman Walker's name removed from the list. 
    So we have here actually, the Union that Mr. Walker paid his dues to that he relied upon saying to the Director of Labor Relations of the Southern Railroad, I want you to leave him fired when the Director had suggested that he be rehired. 
    Now, Mr. Walker came to me to know what to do. 
    He knew that the General Chairman of the Union didn't like him and he knew that he couldn't get his job back through the Union. 
    We didn't have these letters at the time. 
    It took a lot of adverse examinations before the Southern Railroad to come up with these two letters with this exchange of letters between the Union and the Railroad. 
    And so, I brought a notion in rather for county court the wrongful discharged and ask for damages. 
    Now as a matter of fact, this is not in the record but as a matter of fact it went six years later. 
    I brought it within a three-year statute. 
    But I had so many motions to strike and so many -- and so many demurrers and so many procedure difficulties in North Carolina. 
    We can take a non-suit and bring the action again within a year. 
    And rather in the preliminary skirmishing of going through the appeals and back in appeals and back in North Carolina, I simply non-suit in my compliant and made it conform to what the Railroad said out to have. 
    And that's the reason it looks like it was six years before we brought it. 
    Mr. Walker came to me and we brought an action for wrongful discharged. 
    They removed it to the federal court and we were successful. 
    Eight days after that, this Court decided the Republic Steel against Maddox and the Railroad gave notice to the appeal to the Circuit, and I gave notice of appeal on matter of mitigation of damages. 
    I think we really come down to this in this case. 
    The federal government has a labor policy and I think the essential question is this. 
    When a discharged -- when a man is wrongfully discharged and his discharged is treated by him as fine, does that take his case outside of the purview of the federal labor policy?

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well, may I ask Mr. Hamrick?

    Yes, sir.

    Yes, sir.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="561.283" stopTime="565.324">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    If it is wrongful -- is it wrongful because it's a violation of the contract?

    Mr. J. Nat Hamrick 
    Yes, sir.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="566.001" stopTime="568.667">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    If it's wrongful at all, that's what makes it wrong?

    Mr. J. Nat Hamrick 
    That's what makes it wrong.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="569.665" stopTime="577.504">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    So that -- in that sense, matter of interpretation at least, application of the collective bargaining agreements involved in --
speaker="j_nat_hamrick" startTime="577.504" stopTime="577.593">
    Mr. J. Nat Hamrick 
    Yes, sir.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="577.593" stopTime="578.888">

    -- the discharged of it?

    Mr. J. Nat Hamrick 
    Yes, sir.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="579.316" stopTime="593.468">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    So is that thing gets the standard the question whether that's the issue. 
    Does the Railway Labor Act reserve its resolution to the Adjustment Board or may it be the subject of a lawsuit?
speaker="j_nat_hamrick" startTime="593.468" stopTime="593.578">
    Mr. J. Nat Hamrick 
    That's right.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="593.578" stopTime="594.635">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Is that what you're down to?
speaker="j_nat_hamrick" startTime="594.635" stopTime="595.645">
    Mr. J. Nat Hamrick 
    That's what we're down to.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="595.645" stopTime="596.047">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Uh-hum.
speaker="j_nat_hamrick" startTime="596.047" stopTime="710.525">
    Mr. J. Nat Hamrick 
    Now in the past, in the Moore cases and so forth, this Court had said that you may bring an action for wrongful discharged, if you want to? 
    Or you may ask for reinstatement? 
    But if you ask for reinstatement then you are under the Board and if you bring an action for wrongful discharged it does by the common law? 
    Then when we get to that point, we come here. 
    If he bring an action for wrongful discharged, is that action for wrongful discharged governed by the state law or is it governed by the federal law? 
    Now in the Lincoln Mills case, this Court there properly I think said that it was the obligation of the federal government to make a body of law concerning labor relations because you have labor acts and you regulate the labor, the railroads and the other labor act and it is obligation of the federal government to make a body of law governing labor relations when the Congress pays it acts for that. 
    And so in Lincoln Mills, you said that, that the federal government had jurisdiction regardless of diversity. 
    And we come on down from that to whole a lot of other cases which I think are perfectly properly saying that when you have a national labor policy and the courts are going to be obligated to implement it and they're going to be obligated to decide cases under it, you come to the question of whether that National Labor Policy should be governed by strictly federal law as enunciated by the federal courts or whether in certain places it should be governed by the state law. 
    Now in the past, it has been regarded in this fashion that if it's wrongful discharged, it's outside of a concept of the federal labor laws, totally outside of the concept of the federal labor laws, when the man is fired and gone, and therefore, the state law should control. 
    In this particular case, the state law was applied by the District Court to give me a recovery.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="710.525" stopTime="728.661">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    But why isn't, the question really would it -- what form it should go to rather than what law you should apply? 
    I thought the issue here was whether you had to go to the Adjustment Board or whether you have to go with it or whether you're going to the state court? 
    It could be that you might hold that he could go into the state court? 
    The state court would have to apply federal law.
speaker="j_nat_hamrick" startTime="728.661" stopTime="730.006">
    Mr. J. Nat Hamrick 
    I think that's quite true.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="730.006" stopTime="730.286">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, then --
speaker="j_nat_hamrick" startTime="730.286" stopTime="737.238">
    Mr. J. Nat Hamrick 
    I think that's quite truth. 
    The body of law, the cont -- the issues, the controlling body of law whether it's federal law or not.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="737.238" stopTime="739.159">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, but the issue is, what form it should go into --
speaker="j_nat_hamrick" startTime="739.159" stopTime="745.350">
    Mr. J. Nat Hamrick 
    Yes, sir. 
    That's right. 
    You -- it's not just the form because all of the states have different laws --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="745.350" stopTime="745.705">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Exactly.
speaker="j_nat_hamrick" startTime="745.705" stopTime="832.533">
    Mr. J. Nat Hamrick 
    -- as we for wrongful discharged, so if unless the federal government makes a federal law regarding labor policy. 
    You will have a hodgepodge of decisions in the state for that. 
    Now, the point I'm making here is this that whether you say the state law should apply which in this case gave Walker right to bring an action for wrongful discharged, or whether you say that the federal law therefore the federal courts should enunciate a labor policy in this connection and write federal law. 
    I think either way you go, a man who is wrongfully discharged should have a right to come to court whether it be a federal court under federal law or whether it be a state court under state law, or whether it be a federal court applying state law. 
    When a man is wrongfully discharged from a railroad or any other thing, he should have a right to come to court for these reasons. 
    The interest of the individual union member and the interest of the union are not merely identical. 
    Unions or organizations of people, they have sources of power. 
    They have elections. 
    Personalities get involved. 
    One man may run and benefit to change the finding and the only place he can go is to a board where the company and the union are equal. 
    And the union, don't want him and the company don't want him, he has no place to go for justice.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="832.533" stopTime="853.325">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Is that your point that the Railway of Adjustment Board is a board composed of unions and representatives and company representatives or it would be unfair to affirm to that as distinguish from the NLRB which is an administrative agency?
speaker="j_nat_hamrick" startTime="853.325" stopTime="895.480">
    Mr. J. Nat Hamrick 
    No, sir. 
    I think the difference is I don't say that you shouldn't go. 
    Mr. Justice Fortas, I don't say that you shouldn't go to the Railroad Adjustment Board for everything except wrongful discharged. 
    But I say when a man is wrongfully discharged he is severed from his union. 
    He is totally cut loose from him and they have no further interest any. 
    The people that they put on a National Railroad Adjustment Board have no further interest any. 
    The company that finally has no further interests any. 
    He is at a board which is controlled by people who no longer want him. 
    Now if I -- by accident, we cut it in this case to show that the union didn't want it, they sacrificed it. 
    They might -- we might have been sacrificed --
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="895.480" stopTime="901.554">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Well, is that the way it -- that one of the reasons why the distinguished Madison --
speaker="j_nat_hamrick" startTime="901.554" stopTime="901.727">
    Mr. J. Nat Hamrick 
    Maddox?
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="901.727" stopTime="902.697">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Maddox.
speaker="j_nat_hamrick" startTime="902.697" stopTime="946.436">
    Mr. J. Nat Hamrick 
    Yes, sir. 
    That's the distinction. 
    I think in the Maddox case that what you did actually was ask the company to perform a contract. 
    You ask the company -- Maddox asked the company to perform a contract. 
    He said, “Pay me the severance pay.” 
    It was the same thing as he would say put me back to work. 
    He asked for performance of a contract. 
    He didn't say that you have fired me wrongfully. 
    He didn't contend he was wrongfully fired. 
    The company had every right to close the mill. 
    The only obligation they had to do was pay him severance pay. 
    And therefore when they were paying him severance pay, he was actually asking for performance of the contract. 
    There's a lot difference in performance of the contract in severance pay and a suit for wrongful discharged.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="946.436" stopTime="952.180">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Does any difference between your case and the Moore against Illinois Central Railroad?
speaker="j_nat_hamrick" startTime="952.180" stopTime="953.707">
    Mr. J. Nat Hamrick 
    No, sir.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="953.707" stopTime="956.929">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    And then the only question is whether Maddox has --
speaker="j_nat_hamrick" startTime="956.929" stopTime="957.467">
    Mr. J. Nat Hamrick 
    Overruled Moore.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="957.467" stopTime="958.774">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    -- overruled Moore?
speaker="j_nat_hamrick" startTime="958.774" stopTime="1010.018">
    Mr. J. Nat Hamrick 
    Yes, sir. 
    That is -- that is only one of the questions of Mr. Justice Fortas. 
    I am urging another position here. 
    If this Court is going to say that state law no longer controls cases for wrongful discharged. 
    And that, under the Lincoln Mills case, it's the obligation of the federal courts to enunciate a policy of law about wrongful discharged, then I'm saying even if you overrule Moore to that extent that the federal courts should say, “That we are picking up,” at it is said in Lincoln Mills, “we are picking up state law. 
    We're making it federal law and this is the federal law but the federal law is.” 
    That when a man is wrongfully discharged does not ask for reinstatement. 
    He has a right to come into the courts of his country and sue the man who wrongfully discharged him.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="1010.018" stopTime="1010.898">

    Under federal law?

    Mr. J. Nat Hamrick 
    Under federal law. 
    I don't care whether it's federal law or state law. 
    But I think whether you apply the state law or whether you enunciate a body of federal law that a man should have a right to do that. 
    There are thousands of people working in America today for big companies --
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="1024.278" stopTime="1038.265">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Are you asking us to overrule? 
    Are you saying that we ought to overrule Maddox with respect to non-railway labor employees? 
    Or they ought to narrow Maddox down to which you say its precise holding?
speaker="j_nat_hamrick" startTime="1038.265" stopTime="1041.577">
    Mr. J. Nat Hamrick 
    Yes, sir.

    Justice Abe Fortas

    Not abridge.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="1042.661" stopTime="1094.328">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    -- bases as I see it for your case here and I'm getting a little lost in my own call. 
    One of them is say that this is Railway Labor, it's covered by different statutes etcetera and Maddox was NLRB, its one approach to this. 
    The other approach to this is to say, right before argument in a way that Maddox -- does control of Maddox show some a confinement of Moore, Moore against IC Railroad. 
    And that although there's no difference in fact that this is Railway Labor Act and not NLRB, and nevertheless Maddox should be confined to its precise holding?

    Eventhough the contract said he would go to the Board for matters of -- if the contract said, he would go to the Board and that is wrongful discharged. 
    Then I would question the validity of that contract as a matter of public policy because you are contracting a way of man's right to bring suit for wrongful discharged or breach of contract. 
    I would question the validity of the contract no matter the public policy if that were the case.

    I know but isn't it difficult to claim that the -- that Congress has said that the Adjustment Board -- that the parties have no alternative. 
    The Congress has said that the Adjustment Board shall consider certain matters and no one else. 
    Now, if you're -- the contract rather as Mr. Justice White suggested, you wouldn't be attacking the contract against public policy, you have to attack the statute, wouldn't you?

    Mr. J. Nat Hamrick 
    Well, let me tell you from the point of view of the union member. 
    From the point of view of Roy Walker in this case, they want to use Roy Walker to ask for reinstatement because he knew he want to go get it. 
    Now, he -- the only thing he could do is come in here and asked for suit for damages. 
    That's all he could do. 
    Now take his position in this case, he work for the Southern Railroad from 1944 until 1957. 
    He had retirement. 
    He had everything. 
    He had it all build up and just because he got on the wrong side of the union and the company, he's gone. 
    And they say, “We can't do anything about that.” 
    Now, this particular 30-day period that Judge Craven found for me. 
    I would have been in bad shape before the Adjustment Board where nobody like him on his 30-day period because the union was contended that the date of the letter contended the 30-day period. 
    I'd never made it and yet they run him off. 
    And I'm saying that that the people work in this country and work for big companies and belong to bi unions when they are thrown out of the -- of their job and they're gone and they treat their discharged as final. 
    They ought to be able to come to an impartial federal court or to an impartial state court and get a trial where their rights can be protected by the rules of evidence and under the rules of law and not relegated to an adjustment board which is essentially a balance tribunal rather than an impartial tribunal.

    Justice Byron R. White 
    Do you think Moore was an obstruction of the Railroad adjust -- Railroad Labor Act?
speaker="j_nat_hamrick" startTime="1454.639" stopTime="1455.425">
    Mr. J. Nat Hamrick 
    I think Moore essentially to --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="1455.425" stopTime="1459.737">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Was it -- was it -- is it near to -- is it a piece of statutory construction?
speaker="j_nat_hamrick" startTime="1459.737" stopTime="1573.100">
    Mr. J. Nat Hamrick 
    I -- yes, sir. 
    I think what Moore said was this, “That as far as wrongful discharged is concern; there was no intent of Congress to make the Railroad Labor Act company." 
    That's what Moore said. 
    When you got wrongful discharged, there's no intent to cover. 
    Now, when you look at the purposes of this Act as stated in the Railway Labor Act. 
    They say that pretty well. 
    The purposes of the chapter are to avoid any interruption of commerce or to the operation of any carry and it goes on to provide for the prompt and orderly settlement of all disputes could turn in rates to pay, rooms. 
    Working conditions to provide for prompt and orderly settlement of all disputes going out of grievances interpretation and application of agreements, rates are paid in working conditions. 
    I think the Railway Labor Act contemplated and I think Moore recognized that it contemplates. 
    A situation where the man was to go to continue to be an employee, a situation that involve the transportation policy, a situation where they were involve in what are you going to do today. 
    Are you coming to work at this time, is this rule going to govern you? 
    How many days do you have to report? 
    What did you send in the letter when you're sick? 
    This is what the Railway Labor Act was intended to cover and I think Moore said that the Railway Labor Act was not intended to cover wrongful discharged. 
    And therefore you can bring your action in the state court because it is not yet petition in the Congress to cover. 
    But my principal point in this case is whether you say that the Railway Labor Act should be construed under state law or the federal law, whether you say it intended to do this or not. 
    It is a matter of policy and as a matter of protection for the individual. 
    When a man working for a big company is fine and the Union don't like it either you ought to have some place to go. 
    And if you hold that he's got to go to this Adjustment Board, he is just -- he just Roy Walker's lost. 
    He's too old. 
    He can't get another job. 
    He's got no retirement. 
    He's got nothing; he's speaking about keeping that bank. 
    And a federal court said, “You wrongfully discharged him.” 
    And they say, “Well, you couldn't go to a federal court. 
    We wrongfully discharged him but you couldn't (Inaudible).”

   Argument of Jerome Ackerman

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Ackerman.
speaker="jerome_ackerman" startTime="1604.664" stopTime="1705.340">
    Mr. Jerome Ackerman 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    I'd like to touch just briefly on the facts I think that perhaps they've been taken a little bit out of context. 
    Mr. Walker's suit here is a suit that arises out of a collective bargaining agreement. 
    The only right that Walker has in this case grows out of the collective bargaining agreement. 
    He has no common law rights and doesn't claim it. 
    Walker did not pursue either the contractual procedures set up under his union contract or the administrative procedures set up under the Railway Labor Act through the Railroad Adjustment Board in attempting to vindicate what he thought was improper deprivation of a contract right arising out of the Union contract. 
    Now, much has been made of the correspondence between the representative of the Union and the Director of Labor Relations of the Southern following the terminations of Mr. Walker's seniority. 
    That -- that correspondence occurred well after the period during which Walker could have but did not attempt to pursue to their conclusion his contractual remedies.

    Mr. Jerome Ackerman 
    The contractual provisions provided for normal handling of the dispute up through the various officers who would be responsible for it. 
    The Superintendent for example in the first instance --

speaker="jerome_ackerman" startTime="1730.035" stopTime="1744.008">
    Mr. Jerome Ackerman 
    It -- the contract itself did not specifically mention the Adjustment Board. 
    But I think that it generally recognized in the industry that all contracts contemplates that if there is disagreement at the end of the contents --
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="1744.008" stopTime="1752.121">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr.

    Mr. Jerome Ackerman 
    Well, this is correct.

    Mr. Jerome Ackerman 
    That is correct, Mr. Justice Brennan and this is precisely such a case because the question of the laws of Mr. Walker's seniority turns on that language of a provision of a contract.

    Mr. Jerome Ackerman 
    I would have thought that the Moore case was perhaps not so much a matter of statutory interpretation as it was a notion that state law could have some application in this field.

    No, that -- that's quite correct. 
    The Court did not overrule Moore and Maddox unless the Court were to take the rather narrow view of the facts in this case. 
    Namely the focus on the question of whether exhaustion of contractual remedies was required quite a part from the resort of the Adjustment Board.

    Well, here --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="1943.962" stopTime="1955.173">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    -- not wrongfully. 
    This is a balance for the employee and no third party is in there to -- why should -- why should the employee have to stop with the Board like that?
speaker="jerome_ackerman" startTime="1955.173" stopTime="1969.513">
    Mr. Jerome Ackerman 
    Mr. Justice White, this whole line of argument is predicated on an assumption that there is something inherently untrustworthy about the Railroad Adjustment Board simply because it is a balance agency.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="1969.513" stopTime="1981.611">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    I know but the Government -- but the normal dispute, you have to admit arises almost all the time when the union and management has come to let things points of view.
speaker="jerome_ackerman" startTime="1981.611" stopTime="2033.153">
    Mr. Jerome Ackerman 
    This is correct. 
    But it doesn't necessarily follow that in every case in which a union and the management do not have a conflicting point of view that the union is for that reason alone somehow dealing unfairly with the employee involved. 
    It's quite possible and certainly was evidenced here that the union happen to agree with the management interpretation of the contract. 
    And this was really the gist of the exchange of correspondence that Mr. Hamrick spoke about before but he didn't point out that there was discussion by the official of the union of the specific contract provisions involved and the question of whether Walker had pursued his remedies as he was suppose to under the contract and agree that there was a basis for terminating Walker seniority. 
    Now --

    You said that the correspondence between the Union and the company was out of context.

    Mr. Jerome Ackerman 
    He was then told that because of his failure to report within the time period.

speaker="jerome_ackerman" startTime="2550.406" stopTime="2556.355">
    Mr. Jerome Ackerman 
    Well, I think not. 
    I think that Central Airlines decided that federal law applies to suits --
speaker="tom_c_clark" startTime="2556.355" stopTime="2558.929">
    Justice Tom C. Clark 
    Yes, but Moore has a state law applies.
speaker="jerome_ackerman" startTime="2558.929" stopTime="2563.452">
    Mr. Jerome Ackerman 
    Well, there -- it would seem that there's conflict between Central Airlines --
speaker="tom_c_clark" startTime="2563.452" stopTime="2580.658">
    Justice Tom C. Clark 
    I wonder if that follows on. 
    If this is a matter of statutory construction and Congress has let these things sit the way it has ever since Moore was decided and you can't distinguish this from Moore, I just wonder if there's anything more here than what was going to overrule Moore or not.
speaker="jerome_ackerman" startTime="2580.658" stopTime="2580.973">
    Mr. Jerome Ackerman 
    Well --
speaker="tom_c_clark" startTime="2580.973" stopTime="2593.396">
    Justice Tom C. Clark 
    And in that respect, if Maddox differs in policy approach, will also got involved here. 
    The old principle that you don't overrule statutory construction decision of Congress (Inaudible), they have been into do that.
speaker="jerome_ackerman" startTime="2593.396" stopTime="2606.915">
    Mr. Jerome Ackerman 
    Well -- we submit that the rational of Maddox is just as applicable to a case arising under the Railway Labor Act.
speaker="tom_c_clark" startTime="2606.915" stopTime="2629.567">
    Justice Tom C. Clark 
    This may be brought -- this may be very true and probably is. 
    But isn't there also involved that this -- Moore was a case of statutory construction. 
    Don't you have also the principle whether or not you're going to overrule decisions with symbolic statutory construction that Congress can -- and change if he wants to and this instance has not?
speaker="jerome_ackerman" startTime="2629.567" stopTime="2657.128">
    Mr. Jerome Ackerman 
    Well, again Mr. Justice Brennan, I have to say that I think that Moore turned on the question of the applicability of state law. 
    I think that the Koppal case made this even clearer because the Koppal case proceeded right down the line on the notion that state law was applicable here. 
    There was no -- no court at all of anything but state law being applicable in the Koppal case. 
    Now --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="2657.128" stopTime="2659.877">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    That's because of the discharged, wasn't it?
speaker="jerome_ackerman" startTime="2659.877" stopTime="2660.685">
    Mr. Jerome Ackerman 
    There was a discharged.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="2660.685" stopTime="2663.434">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    That it was base on the fact that it was a discharged.
speaker="jerome_ackerman" startTime="2663.434" stopTime="2708.282">
    Mr. Jerome Ackerman 
    That is correct. 
    Now in that context, when Central Airlines came along in 1963 and this Court held that federal law is applicable to suits on collective bargaining agreements made under the auspices of the Railway Labor Act, I think that that has the same effect as saying that if Moore and Koppal were decided in a context of state law and I thought that state law applied the under pinning as the Court pointed out in Maddox for those decisions was on -- was removed. 
    That being -- that being so --
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="2708.282" stopTime="2727.271">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Okay. 
    It's kind of a circular argument though, isn't it because if federal law applies then and you ought to be in the Railway Labor Board. 
    If a -- if a state law applies then it ought to be in the courts?
speaker="jerome_ackerman" startTime="2727.271" stopTime="2728.717">
    Mr. Jerome Ackerman 
    Well, but state -- under -- under some state laws --
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="2728.717" stopTime="2735.827">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    So that – so that it doesn't help you to argue state or federal law here?
speaker="jerome_ackerman" startTime="2735.827" stopTime="2750.428">
    Mr. Jerome Ackerman 
    In some situations under state law, you will be remitted to your remedy under the Railway Labor Act as in the Koppal case. 
    In the Koppal case, the -- it was perfectly clear that exhaustion of remedies was required.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="2750.428" stopTime="2763.305">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    That's right. 
    That's why the question here is they voted the Railway Labor Board or don't.
speaker="jerome_ackerman" startTime="2763.305" stopTime="2906.397">
    Mr. Jerome Ackerman 
    In Footnote 14, in its decision in Maddox, the Court expressly declined to overrule Moore and Koppal cases. 
    They pointed out that such action should await the case under the Railway Labor Act in which the distinctive features of the administrative remedies could be considered in context. 
    We submit that in analysis of the administrative remedies that are available through the procedures of the Adjustment Board are essentially the same as the procedures that are available in the routine labor arbitration context. 
    The procedures are informal. 
    The scope of review is limited to just about the same degree both by reason of this Court's decision in Gunther and in other cases and a recent amendment to the Railway Labor Act which reinforces this Court's decisions dealing with the scope of review from Adjustment Board decisions. 
    The -- the remedies that are available to an employee in proceeding before the Adjustment Board are certainly no less than remedies available in ordinary arbitration procedures. 
    Indeed, they're probably more flexible as this Court itself is aware from the facts in Gunther case. 
    That is a great deal of flexibility in terms of a point in -- of doctors and so on to examine the employee. 
    But under the procedures of the Adjustment Board reinstatement as possible, back pay awards are possible, so that the summons substance is that there is no significant difference between ordinary labor arbitrations of the type that would have been involved in Maddox had the employee there exhausted his contractual remedies and the procedures provided for under the Railway Labor Act if an employee resorts to or a Union resorts to the Adjustment Board. 
    Thank you.

    All of these?

    Mr. J. Nat Hamrick 
    Yes, sir. 
    That's Brotherhood of Railway Trainmen. 
    Now in the Central Airlines case, I think that differs from the other cases here. 
    In Central Airlines, the man went to the Board and had reinstatement order and the company refused to reinstatement him. 
    He had invoked the federal law. 
    Had reinstatement order so there was nothing the federal court could do but ordered the company to comply. 
    And I think that is a distinction in the Central Airlines case. 
    Thank you very much.
