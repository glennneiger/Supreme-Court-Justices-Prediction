    Number 209, Railroad Transfer Service, Incorporated, Petitioner, versus the City of Chicago. 
    Mr. Mathews.

    Mr. Amos M. Mathews 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    Petitioner brought this action in United States District Court for a declaratory judgment that a Chicago ordinance is invalid on its face, a reason of conflict with the Interstate Commerce Act and the Commerce Clause of the constitution. 
    The city and the other respondents who are officials of the city filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a cause of action. 
    The District Court dismissed in response to that motion and the Court of Appeals affirmed. 
    This Court granted certiorari. 
    Some of the issues in this case were presented to this Court are issues similar to those in this case, were presented to this Court in 1958 in Chicago against Atchison, Topeka, and Santa Fe Railway Company, 357 U.S.77. 
    In order to understand the issues in this instant case, it is necessary to refer very briefly to some of the facts in that earlier litigation. 
    Petitioner is engaged under a contract with the Chicago Railroads in transferring passengers between railroad stations in Chicago. 
    It frequently happens that a passenger engaged on a through journey through Chicago must transfer from his incoming to his outgoing railroad station. 
    The petitioner furnishes that service in specially designed buses. 
    The petitioner receives ultimate remuneration from the railroads that passenger pays nothing to petitioner. 
    Prior to 1955, this interstation transfer service had been performed for many years by the Parmelee Transportation Company. 
    During the time that Parmelee performed the service, the service was regulated by the City of Chicago along with taxicab service and other similar services by what is known as Chapter 28 of the Municipal Code of Chicago. 
    On June -- in June of 1955, the railroads notified Parmelee that as of October 1 of that year, they would discontinue using Parmelee service and would use petitioner instead. 
    About a month later in July of 1955, the City Council of Chicago passed an amendment to Chapter 28 that I've already mentioned, that imposed two very serious obstacles or barricades to petitioner and the railroads in their expectation of launching the new service. 
    In the first place the amendment gave what amounted due a perpetual franchise to Parmelee to perform the service. 
    Secondly, it provided that a newcomer to the field, such as petitioner, must prove to the satisfaction of the public vehicle license commissioner of the City of Chicago that public convenience and necessity required the new service. 
    This Court in the Atchison case that I've mentioned held the amendment to Chapter 28 invalid because in conflict with the Interstate Commerce Act. 
    I'd like to mention briefly here that the evidence shows in that earlier case and it is set out both in the opinion of this Court and in the opinion of the Court of Appeals which this Court affirmed, that this action of the Chicago City Council in amending Chapter 28 as I've said, was a well-planned, well-conceived scheme to keep -- to perpetuate Parmelee in the service and to keep -- and to put petitioner out of business. 
    After the decision of this case in the Atchison -- after the decision in the Atchison case by this Court in 1958, that restored the status quo regulatory wise that had prevailed as to this interstation transfer service before the 1955 Amendment. 
    In other words, in order to leave regulation or have regulation of the same type that had covered Parmelee for many years, all the City of Council had to do was simply do nothing. 
    But shortly after -- a few months after the mandate came down in the former Atchison case, the Chicago City Council started on a course of amendment of Chapter 28 again to the great detriment of petitioner and the Chicago Railroad. 
    The Council amended Chapter -- Section 28-6 of Chapter 28 by requiring that annually a person desiring a license to operate as a public passenger vehicle must file an application with the -- well, they already had to file an application but it amended those application proceedings to provide that a person filing an application must prove to the satisfaction of the Public Vehicle License Commissioner that the applicant was qualified to pursue the occupation of a cabman or a coachman. 
    Now that phrase qualified to pursue the application of a cabman or a coachman included petitioner within its scope because petitioner was defined as a coachman in the ordinance. 
    It also included taxicabs for the most part but taxicabs operators already had to prove that they -- the public convenience and necessity before conducting any operation since they were an intrastate operation, presumably that was valid, at least it's never been challenged as to the taxicabs. 
    In other words, this Amendment in 1959 to Section 28-6 the -- almost the entire force of it fell up on the petitioner. 
    This phrase qualified to pursue the occupation of a coachman was not in any sense, could not -- cannot in any sense, we submit, be considered a regulation within the legitimate police power. 
    It gave a discretion to the Public Vehicle License Commissioner to -- in his discretion, deny the application for a certificate to perform this service. 
    And so we say that -- and we cited the only case we can find on the point, the decision of the Supreme Court of Tennessee that the phrase “qualified to pursue the occupation” is a -- in substance a part of the proof that has to be made in proving public convenience and necessity. 
    So the Chicago City Council got back on the old -- in 1959, got back on the old 1955 track. 
    The Council amended another section, Section 28-31 of Chapter 28 required taxicab operators to furnish annually to the Public Vehicle License Commissioner a detailed financial statement showing profit and loss and all of the detailed information that and of a -- an intrastate operator subject to the jurisdiction of the City Council would need to submit for the purpose of rate regulation. 
    But the Council by a very clear and direct amendment to that provision required or made that provision applicable to petitioner. 
    In other words, it's something that the petitioner whose sole responsibility as to the railroads to -- it's furnishing the same kind of financial data to the Commissioner as taxicab operators. 
    Now --

    Mr. Amos M. Mathews 
    No. 
    No sir. 
    Well, the -- I'm not sure about that. 
    I'm coming to something now that I think might answer your question.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="653.004" stopTime="654.243">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Oh, very well, go ahead.
speaker="amos_m_mathews" startTime="654.243" stopTime="660.443">
    Mr. Amos M. Mathews 
    In part anyway. 
    And I'll cover that exclusively after I reached this point.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="660.443" stopTime="662.402">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Very well.
speaker="amos_m_mathews" startTime="662.402" stopTime="776.219">
    Mr. Amos M. Mathews 
    Respondents now in their brief on the merits, in this Court, concede that these two provisions, these two amendments that I've detailed cannot be applied to petitioner. 
    Now they did not make that concession in their brief opposing certiorari. 
    In our petition for certiorari, we made the same argument in respect to these two amendments that we now make in our petition -- in our brief on the merits and that I have outlined briefly in argument here. 
    So -- but for the first time in their brief on the merits, respondents say that these two provisions cannot be enforced against petitioner. 
    Now either that concession means that the amendments are not applicable in terms to petitioner or it means that they cannot lawfully be applied to petitioner. 
    Now we submit that the two amendments are just as clearly and precisely applicable to petitioner in their wording as an arrow hitting a bull's eye. 
    Therefore we say that this concession must mean that respondents are admitting that these two amendments are invalid on their face as applied to petitioner. 
    Now answering your question, Mr. Chief Justice, the -- we have spelled this out in detail in our brief but I think I can summarize it quite --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="776.219" stopTime="776.283">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well, I --

    -- expeditiously.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="777.175" stopTime="786.983">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    You don't have to summarize for me, I just -- I know that there was some phase of the facts that were interpreted differently by both sides.
speaker="amos_m_mathews" startTime="786.983" stopTime="788.032">
    Mr. Amos M. Mathews 
    That is correct. 
    But I --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="788.032" stopTime="789.762">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    But I wonder if this was the one?
speaker="amos_m_mathews" startTime="789.762" stopTime="790.482">
    Mr. Amos M. Mathews 
    This was the one, yes.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="790.482" stopTime="795.515">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    This is the one.
speaker="amos_m_mathews" startTime="795.515" stopTime="867.631">
    Mr. Amos M. Mathews 
    The section regarding financial statements by taxicab operators was made in terms to apply to taxicab operators. 
    Among the definitions in Chapter 28, are these. 
    A person is defined as an individual, a firm, or a corporation, so that before the Amendment I'm referring to the taxicab Amendment -- the taxicab financial statement provision applied to taxicab operators who either were individuals or partnerships, or corporations. 
    It applied that plainly. 
    Now the City Council in bringing Parmelee -- bringing petitioner within the scope of that Amendment, used the word and made it applicable to every corporation that is a public passenger vehicle. 
    Now, petitioner is a corporation, petitioner is a public passenger vehicle. 
    So the language could not be any clearer, we submit. 
    Now --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="867.631" stopTime="873.698">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    May I ask this? 
    Was that Amendment before or after the case was argued in the Court of Appeals?
speaker="amos_m_mathews" startTime="873.698" stopTime="880.539">
    Mr. Amos M. Mathews 
    It was -- the case went to the Court of Appeals.

    It was amend -- it was before the last argument in --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="887.814" stopTime="890.879">

    Was it raised? 
    Was the question raised in the court below?

    Mr. Amos M. Mathews 
    Yes sir.

    Yes sir.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="892.778" stopTime="895.129">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Okay, go ahead.
speaker="amos_m_mathews" startTime="895.129" stopTime="978.994">
    Mr. Amos M. Mathews 
    The Court of Appeals said that the requirement to furnish financial data or words to that effect is within the ul -- the legitimate police power of the city. 
    The Court of Appeals and the District Court too for that matter held the ordinance was valid on its face and they held that the city had taken no action of which petitioner could complain. 
    We submit that this concession amounts to an admission that in these two respects, the ordinance is invalid on its face. 
    Therefore, we submit there is a conflict between these concessions and the holding of the Court of Appeals. 
    And therefore, we further submit that in view of that, the judgment of the Court of Appeals should be vacated or reversed in order that a judgment maybe entered in the District Court in accordance with the concession now made in respondent's brief on the merits.

    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Are you saying to us that if respondents have made a concession on these two points that that disposes of your grievance?

    Mr. Amos M. Mathews 
    Not entirely, there are two other points that -- in which they have not made concessions, or does that answer your question?

    Those other two points?

    Yes.

    Mr. Amos M. Mathews 
    Yes sir. 
    I was about to go to those. 
    There are two other points. 
    The ordinance was -- the ordinance requires in effect and there is some dispute about this that a petitioner -- any operator of a public vehicle be required to employ as chauffeurs only residents of the City of Chicago. 
    Now there is some dispute about that as to whether that is before the Court. 
    But the fact is that it was in the pleadings, it was the Court -- the both the District Court and the Court of Appeals held it with before the Court and both of them decided it. 
    And the Court of Appeals expressly decided that it is a valid -- within the police power of the City of Chicago to compel the petitioner to employ as chauffeurs only residents of the City of Chicago.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1098.239" stopTime="1100.940">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Did the city argue to that effect below?
speaker="amos_m_mathews" startTime="1100.940" stopTime="1165.565">
    Mr. Amos M. Mathews 
    Yes sir. 
    Well at least -- yes sir, that's my understanding. 
    The other provision is this and it came in by an amendment. 
    The ordinance was amended after the first Atchison case to require that every public passenger vehicle operator must maintain -- if a corporation, must maintain its principal place of business in Chicago. 
    Now petitioner has engaged in Interstate Commerce. 
    And we submit that it is an invalid requirement under the Commerce Clause and under the Interstate Commerce Act as far as petitioner is concerned to say that a corporation engaged in interstate commerce in Chicago must maintain its principal place of business there.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1165.565" stopTime="1168.009">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    This petitioner's principal place of business is in Chicago?
speaker="amos_m_mathews" startTime="1168.009" stopTime="1186.540">
    Mr. Amos M. Mathews 
    Yes sir. 
    This petitioner's (Inaudible) it's only place of business is in Chicago. 
    But it is our position on that, Your Honor, that at some time in the future, we may want to move our principal place of business somewhere else without ceasing to do business in Chicago.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1186.540" stopTime="1196.575">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    I'm wondering if they -- if with respect to this issue, there is -- really is any right case with controversy now.
speaker="amos_m_mathews" startTime="1196.575" stopTime="1277.453">
    Mr. Amos M. Mathews 
    Well, I'm -- I -- with all due respect, Your Honor, we believe there is in this way. 
    We have encountered at times and we encountered it in this case in fact, it's raised in respondent's brief, in respect to Section 28-6. 
    In respect to 28-6 that was amended to include that qualification provision, despite the fact that that amendment was in Section 28-6, they say that since we didn't attack Section 28-6 in earlier litigation that Section 26 -- its 28-6 is valid on the principle of res judicata or at least the way I understand that argument. 
    Now when the time comes, if it comes, when we want to move our principal place of business, we don't want to be met with an argument that the question res judicata because we didn't raise it in this action. 
    As a matter of fact, I'd be perfectly frank if this Court should want to say that it isn't -- it wasn't -- isn't timely raised, it can't be raised now with adversary purpose just as well, because we wouldn't be met with the defense of res judicata. 
    The --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1277.453" stopTime="1285.276">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    And you don't -- then in most circumstances, you wouldn't consider it an important issue in the case where you said it wasn't raised?

    Mr. Amos M. Mathews 
    That is correct, if -- well -- it -- well --

    You want us to make clear that you raised the point?

    Mr. Amos M. Mathews 
    We'd want it, I -- yes, yes, sir. 
    We would want you to make -- the Court to make clear that we raised it but we wouldn't object if the Court said that if it wasn't ripe for consideration, yet.

    I see, yes.
speaker="amos_m_mathews" startTime="1301.696" stopTime="1304.572">

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Yes.
speaker="amos_m_mathews" startTime="1308.267" stopTime="1463.337">
    Mr. Amos M. Mathews 
    A great deal of the argument of the respondents is to the effect that the city has done nothing to hurt us. 
    But frankly, we submit and we believe that the city is trying to play the same cat and mouse game with us in this case that they tried to play in the former Atchison case. 
    In the Atchison case is the opinion of the -- the opinion of this Court reveals. 
    The city said the -- disclaimed any intention to use the phrase “public convenience and necessity” as an economic barrier to our operation. 
    They said that only compromises the reasonable incidence of the police power. 
    And this Court disposed of that by saying it's perfectly clear whatever language you apply to it that the city is still claiming some power to exclude or hamper petitioner's operations. 
    Now there's a rather curious inconsistency. 
    Well, I'll leave out the adjective and say it's an inconsistency in the opinion of the Court of Appeals in this. 
    That in a footnote in the opinion of the Court of Appeals, the Court says that respondents now admit that they have no power to stop petitioner's operations. 
    But right on the same page and not in the footnote, is this statement -- well anyway, the Court of Appeals says, finds that the ordinance confers the power on the Public and Vehicle -- Public Vehicle License Commissioner to deny an application. 
    In other words, after holding in the body of its opinion that the ordinance gives the city that power and thus as we say shows that the ordinance is invalid on its face, the Court in a footnote says that the city admits that it has no power to stop petitioner's operations. 
    The -- we think that in view of that omission -- admission by --

    Mr. Raymond F. Simon 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    At the very outset, the city would like to make it clear that it fully understands the opinion of this Court in Atchison. 
    The City of Chicago does not urge upon this Court any change or modification whatsoever in the opinion enunciated in Atchison versus Chicago, 357 U.S. 77. 
    In that case, this Court held at pages 88 and 89, the city retains considerable authority to regulate how Transfer vehicles shall be operated. 
    It could hardly be denied for example, that such vehicles must obey traffic signals, speed limits, and other general safety regulations. 
    Similarly, the city may require registration of these vehicles and exact reasonable fees for their use of the city streets. 
    All we hold here and all we construe the Court of Appeals as holding is that the city has no power to decide whether Transfer can operate a motor vehicle service between terminals for the railroads because this service is an integral part of Interstate Railroad Transportation authorized and subject to regulation under the Interstate Commerce Act. 
    It is not the city which is attempting to avoid this Court's opinion in Atchison, but rather it is Railroad Transfer which has been dissatisfied with the outcome of the litigation in Atchison which struck down only Section 28-31.1 relating to public convenience and necessity and sustained the entire remainder of the chapter, it's Transfer which has begun this litigation anew in its attempt to accomplish what it failed to accomplish when the first litigation took place.

    The City of Chicago has issued all of the licenses which Transfer his applied for. 
    What Transfer was required to present was simply a one page application, a one page financial statement, a list of its equipment, its corporate charters, certificate to do business in Illinois, its insurance policy, and its fees, and nothing more. 
    And the City of Chicago issued all of the licenses which Transfer applied for and the Court of Appeals could find no controversy.

    Your Honor was that relates to as in the initial complaint, the city asserted that the amount in controversy was not sufficient to give jurisdiction that the amount of fees that had accumulated was not equal to the jurisdictional amount. 
    And then Transfer amended and said that they seek jurisdiction based upon the Interstate Commerce Clause --

    Justice Byron R. White 
    Yes.

    Mr. Raymond F. Simon 
    -- the Commerce Act. 
    And it was on that basis that the courts said they do have jurisdiction. 
    But the sequence of events which led from the District Court through the Court of Appeals and to this Court illuminate with harsh clarity the insincerity of the arguments which Transfer advances in the present litigation in the District Court. 
    Both the complaint and the opinion of the Court indicated that Transfer was concerned about the payment of fees. 
    The District Court said and I quote from the record at page 133, “If I am to find the principal source of plaintiff's claim of grievance, it is that plaintiff has required to pay an annual license or tax to the City of Chicago for the privilege of operating its terminal vehicles whereas public utilities and other companies carrying out a similar business are not subject to the same requirement”. 
    The District Court found the classification was reasonable and dismissed the complaint. 
    Then in the Court of Appeals, Transfer tried a new attack. 
    And the Court of Appeals had complained that our ordinance was invalid because it did not provide for some administrative hearing before there might be consideration given to revocation of licenses. 
    And it argued that certain safety regulations were invalid because they required that a vehicle should be of a uniform color for example. 
    And they argued again that the requirement -- that the principal place of business of coachmen be in the city and that their chauffeurs be residents of the city. 
    All these arguments were advanced as to the invalidity of the Municipal Code of Chicago.

    What is your position? 
    As I understand it, 28 -- under 28-6 petitioner takes position that they did file an application under duress and it was granted.

    And I think -- I'm sure I'd be very grateful to you if you just tell me plainly whether the city fixed the position that this phrase that I read is or is not applicable here.

    This is the list of qualifications.

speaker="raymond_f_simon" startTime="2410.861" stopTime="2492.768">
    Mr. Raymond F. Simon 
    Well, what the section says is that the Public Vehicle Commissioner shall determine if the documents that must be filed are properly executed and determine if the applicant is qualified. 
    And the lists of qualifications are those that are set out in the first sentence. 
    He must determine whether his character and reputation is that of a law abiding citizen. 
    He must determine that he has the financial ability to render safe and comfortable service. 
    He must determine that he is able to maintain and replace the equipment for such service and pay judgments that arise in the conduct of his business. 
    These are the lists of qualifications. 
    If he meets these qualifications, he does not get a contract to work for the railroads. 
    He gets his licenses. 
    And this is one of the essential fallacies of Transfer's argument is that there is a basic distinction between the city's attempt to regulate whether a particular terminal vehicle service can operate which is clearly unconstitutional

    Mr. Raymond F. Simon 
    The City of Chicago has these categories of licensees, cabman which includes taxicab operators and every vehicle operators and sightseeing buses and terminal vehicles. 
    Now what the city did at the time it was amending this law was to separate cabman from all others because we have well over 5000 taxicabs in Chicago and that's the bulk of our regulation. 
    Then we took the word coachman and defined it to include busman, delivery vehicles, and terminal vehicles. 
    We no longer have a definition for the word busman. 
    That was completely dropped out of the ordinance. 
    It's not covered by coachman. 
    The word coachman was inserted here simply to make it clear that this is the universal inclusive of public passenger vehicles. 
    It includes cabman. 
    It includes coachman. 
    It's another way of saying it includes taxicabs, delivery vehicles, sightseeing buses, and terminal vehicles. 
    And that is all that this section was amended to change. 
    It's a very bland amendment. 
    But what counsel has attempted to do is to make equivalent to public convenience and necessity, the use of the simple words pursue the occupation of a coachman.

    That's pursuing the occupation of a coachman.

    It never leaves our city. 
    It operates its business completely upon the city streets.

    Do I understand you to make the statement here about the City of Chicago that there's nothing in this ordinance which it thinks or believe to give it the right to attach consequences which would prevent this company from operating on the streets of Chicago?

    Mr. Raymond F. Simon 
    Yes, Mr. Justice, that's true. 
    We do not believe that we can prevent Transfer from operating. 
    What we do believe we have a right to do, if they refused to take out licenses, if they just take the position that they're an interstate carrier, we'll have absolutely no regulation from Chicago, we'll file a lawsuit and we'll ask the Court to order them to meet the qualifications of our ordinance, to submit their vehicles for testing and to show that they are law abiding citizens with financial ability to maintain safe and comfortable service and to maintain and replace their equipment.

    Mr. Raymond F. Simon 
    Mr. Chief Justice, we contend that this is not an issue in this litigation because the allegation and the complaint of Transfer states that they're a Delaware corporation with their principal place of business in the City of Chicago. 
    And we maintain that it is because their business involves transporting passengers from one railway station in Chicago to another railway station in Chicago that accounts for their residents and their principal place of business being in the city and that in a requirement of our ordinance.

    Mr. Raymond F. Simon 
    Yes, Your Honor, we believe it is in the sense that it was litigated in the Bulks (ph) case in the Illinois Supreme Court and in the sense that the Court of Appeals refers to it in this litigation in which they articulate the expression of accessible responsibility. 
    And by that expression they mean that if the residents reside within the city, they're within the reach of those investigative and police officials who have as their business supervising the conduct of taxicab and railway transfer vehicles in the city. 
    Their residents will be within the reach of those officials who have business with them.

    Mr. Raymond F. Simon 
    No, Your Honor, we do not. 
    We consider this charge to be equal to the cost to the city to offset the administration of the licensing provision. 
    In other words, the amount of money which is paid to the city is equal to what it costs the city to have clerks to process the paper and to have men to test their vehicles.

    Mr. Amos M. Mathews 
    I want to refer very briefly to the concession that I mentioned in my argument and I want to read them or the part of them. 
    On page 16 of respondent's brief on the merits, “The city specifically denied that Transfer must prove annually that it is qualified”.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="3677.583" stopTime="3679.081">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Denies what?
speaker="amos_m_mathews" startTime="3679.081" stopTime="3808.442">
    Mr. Amos M. Mathews 
    The City specifically denied that Transfer must prove annually that it is qualified. 
    Well, now what we say, as I said before the -- in as much as the Court of Appeals held that valid, that to affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals would be to affirm a legal situation that the city now concedes -- cannot be applied to petitioner. 
    Then in respect to the financial statement Section 28-31, I quote, “Section 28-31 was designed to apply only to taxicab operators for use in determining rates. 
    It does not apply to petitioner”. 
    The trouble of it is, the Court has held that it applies to petitioner. 
    The Courts upheld this requirement of filing financial statements, I mean the Court of Appeals. 
    So you have a direct conflict here between the opinion of the Court of Appeals and these concessions. 
    That is why we say on these two points, there must be a vacation or a reversal to line up the judges so that the District Court may enter a judgment in accordance with these concessions which we submit are correct statement of the law, that they can't make us prove annually that we are qualified and they can't make us furnish these financial statements. 
    Now, one thing I overlooked doing in my opening argument was to call attention to the fact which probably is unnecessary that the Chicago Terminal Railroads with the permission of the Court have filed a brief as a friend of the Court urging reversal of this cause and advising the Court that they have precisely the same interest in this case as petitioner had because petitioner is in effect the alter ego of the railroads under 202 (c) that Mr. Justice Douglas mentioned and in the holding of this Court in the Atchison case. 
    In the Atchison case, the railroads may perform the service by themselves or by their authorized agent.

    In your brief?
speaker="raymond_f_simon" startTime="3839.255" stopTime="3933.680">
    Mr. Raymond F. Simon 
    In our brief. 
    It says, “The city”, and it's in italics, “The city specifically denies that Transfer must “prove annually that it is qualified”. 
    We mean -- we deny their interpretation that they prove that they're qualified to contract with the railroads to perform their interstation business. 
    We do maintain they must annually prove they're qualified by showing that they're law abiding, that they have sufficient financial ability to carry on safe and comfortable service. 
    In other words, the qualifications that are in the first sentence of Section 28-6 do apply the assertion that we are interested in determining whether or not an interstate business is qualified to work for the railroads, we categorically denied. 
    What we're saying in the section that as Transfer interprets that language, we denied that they ever annually or ever must prove they're qualified. 
    As the language is clearly set out in Section 28-6 which relates to financial ability not Section 30.1 which Mr. Mathews alludes to, as the Section is set out in 28-6, we do assert that it's applicable to Transfer and we use the italics to call attention to the fact it was their interpretation. 
    Reading the Section completely disassociated with the first sentence that we denied.

    -- Section 28-6 uses the word financial responsibility. 
    That Section is applicable to Transfer. 
    Section 30.1 which requires the furnishing of financial data relates to cab companies and is intended to apply to fixing of rates and does not apply to Transfer. 
    So we're not making a concession that 28-6 does not apply when we say that they do not have to furnish the detailed financial records that are covered by 30.1.

    In my opinion their licenses would be issued if they had insurance. 
    The requirement of showing financial ability was satisfied by showing of a simple six-line financial statement. 
    I don't think the city would insist upon any specific dollar balance. 
    I think we ask for the statement simply to see what it says, to see if they have hundreds of tort judgments outstanding against them for running over passengers and pedestrians in the city. 
    Then we called to the attention of the railroads the kind of contracting party they're operating with. 
    Then we might file a lawsuit and attempt to enjoin them from operating.

    It was not designed primarily for them.
