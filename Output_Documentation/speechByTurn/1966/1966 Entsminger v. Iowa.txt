Entsminger v. Iowa

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Harvey Lyle Entsminger, petitioner versus Iowa. 
    Mr. Belin, you may proceed with your argument.
speaker="david_w_belin" startTime="19.570" stopTime="189.867">
    Mr. David W. Belin 
    Honorable Chief Justice and Associate Justices, may it please the Court. 
    The basic issue in this case is what constitutes effective assistance of counsel. 
    The case is on appeal from the Supreme Court of Iowa, and involves the issues of due process and equal protection of the laws and effective assistance of counsel. 
    The petitioner Harvey Entsminger was arrested without warrant on June the 12th, 1964 on a traffic violation. 
    At the time of his arrest the Des Moines Police Apartment were looking for Mr. Entsminger on an alleged bad check charge and he was taken to the police station and arrested and asked to leave his personal effects with the jailer for safekeeping as was customary at the Des Moines police station. 
    Included in these personal effects which were placed in a locker in a safe were two handwritten personal letters written by the petitioner. 
    Two-and-a-half weeks after his arrest, Lieutenant Dawson of the Identification Bureau of the Des Moines police department asked the petitioner to submit a sample of his handwriting and the petitioner refused. 
    Lieutenant Dawson had been present at the arrest two-and-a-half weeks earlier. 
    He remembered that there were two letters that have been placed in the safe and although of these were not instrumentalities of any crime or evidence of any crime, he removed these letters from the safe. 
    Now there's a dispute in the record as to whether or not this was voluntary or not voluntary. 
    In any event, several months later, in October with court-appointed counsel, the indigent Harvey Enstminger was tried for the bad check charge. 
    These letters were used as an important part of the chain of evidence. 
    Mr. Entsminger was convicted. 
    He was sentenced to a term not to exceed 10 years and he is now incarcerated in the Fort Madison Penitentiary in Iowa. 
    Mr. Enstminger asked the court to appoint a new lawyer to represent him to file a motion for a new trial and to file an appeal to the Iowa Supreme Court and in the State of Iowa appeal as a matter of right, a new counsel was appointed, a man by the name of Henry Warnley. 
    He filed a motion for a new trial, and the motion was overruled and the sentence imposed. 
    Then Mr. Warnley had 60 days to file on behalf of the petitioner a notice of appeal, and within this 60-day period, a notice was filed. 
    And that gave Mr. Warnley 90 days to file what we call a printed record on appeal. 
    Unfortunately, at the end of February, the 90-day period expired, there was no record on appeal filed.

    Mr. David W. Belin 
    Yes, you're absolutely right, Justice Fortas.

    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Was that --
speaker="david_w_belin" startTime="296.973" stopTime="403.332">
    Mr. David W. Belin 
    That the Attorney -- the Attorney General as a matter of fact in this particular case, the appointed counsel Mr. Warnley finally did serve, after the expiration of this 90-day period, Mr. Warnley did served a notice on the Attorney General specifying his intent to file a record and a brief and although the Iowa Supreme Court had ordered that the case be submitted on a clerk's transcript which is not a transcript of the record at all, that the Iowa Supreme Court set aside that order without prejudice to the Attorney General's office to file a motion to dismiss and I think it's indicative of the Attorney General's office that they did not elect to stand on the technicality of a motion to dismiss, but rather wanted to have the appeal heard in substance. 
    And in this particular case, they are not arguing about sending it down to the Iowa Supreme Court although I think there might be some disagreement between us as to whether or not on the one hand, we argue, at least I argue, that the clerk's transcript system itself is either per se unconstitutional because it permits this very thing happening that happened here, and by the way, I personally have taken a survey of the clerk's transcript cases over the past 15 years in Iowa and out of several hundred cases, there has never been a reversal, at least to the best of my knowledge. 
    And so, I argue that either the clerk's transcript system itself is per se unconstitutional or in the alternative it cannot be used under Douglas, and as reaffirmed this recently as your decision on Mundy, the Missouri case that it cannot be used without some protection of the right for indigent defendants. 
    And so I say there would be not basic issue before we reached the final issue of whether or not we have --

    I would -- I would be interested in knowing whether or not the clerk's transcript system that you call it, is something that is used regularly by lawyers who have examined the record and have decided on their own that there is nothing really to appeal here. 
    Or whether or not -- or whether from the contrary in this case counsel simply neglected the work. 
    I think if a paid counsel sometimes, the paid counsel â€“ we have had cases here or at least request to take cases in which the counsel simply has neglected to take the necessary steps within the required time. 
    And then the -- the defendant who doesn't get his appeal asks for habeas corpus or something else to let -- to make the state give him -- giving him an appeal and know it was -- it's neglected his counsel, his own hired counsel.

    What is -- what is it in this case? 
    Is this the way that the Iowa lawyer, appointed lawyer used to -- to -- to let the court know we don't think if there's any merit in the case or do they just not do the work or what?

    Mr. David W. Belin 
    Your Honor, I think it happens in both instances. 
    In this particular case for instance, the -- I think the thing that perhaps instigated the late filing of this notice of intent to file the record was a letter from the petitioner to the court appointed attorney and the court appointed attorney wrote back that your case was appealed and as soon as I receive the record, this letter was a letter written on March 9.

    -- they've got to do something when they received the record the transcript in December already. 
    Then later in October of the year, he writes to the petitioner because the petitioner has meanwhile a petition for certiorari to the Iowa Supreme Court which was overruled as being untimely.

    I think the only issue really is whether or not you're going to leave it in the hands of one lawyer to make the determination of whether or not there is merit and I think that we would -- at least I would submit that I think the lawyer is going to make a better calculated decision if he's actually on a retainer as opposed to a situation where you might look on this as a burden upon this time because he's accepting the duty.

    Mr. David W. Belin 
    That's correct, and as a matter of fact, the tragedy here was that there actually was a full transcript of the trial court record available at the time it went up on the clerk, â€“ at the time the Iowa Supreme Court ordered it to submit on the clerk's transcript. 
    But the clerk's transcript does not require imprinted abstract of record at all and so we have the error in Douglas compounded because in Douglas, at least there was a record on appeal. 
    In this case, there is no record on appeal and that's why I really argue in essence that the system itself is per se unconstitutional.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="814.484" stopTime="818.180">

    Mr. David W. Belin 
    Yes sir. 
    Yes, Your Honor. 
    In other words, if -- the reason that I argue that this -- that the clerk's transcript system is really per se unconstitutional is that I don't think you ought to have an appeal in form that's totally void of substance. 
    That's totally void of a record on appeal apart from totally void of a brief and argument. 
    And even if it's a conscious decision on the part of counsel whether he be retained or appointed counsel, I don't think we want to have a judiciary system where we have this sub rows of form of appeal. 
    I'd like to save the rest of this time for any rebuttal although I think there's going to be too much to rebut because I think both the Attorney General's office and at least I feel that in this particular instance that the petitioner's constitutional rights were violated, there is a question of what to do with the clerk's transcript system itself. 
   
   
   
   Argument of Don R. Bennett

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Very well. 
    Mr. Bennett.
speaker="don_r_bennett" startTime="870.719" stopTime="1019.902">
    Mr. Don R. Bennett 
    Mr. Chief Justice, members of the Court. 
    I'm going to be very brief this morning because as Mr. Justice Fortas has already pointed out, we more or less conceded the case insofar as a remand being necessary. 
    I would give you just a little background. 
    I think you would be interested in the background as to why the Attorney General would be willing to come into Court -- into this Court and confess error on the case. 
    And in fact I would have supposed I wouldn't even be here today but for the fact that the petitioner has raised the question of the underlying merits. 
    I went from the Department of Justice here in town to work for Van Nuys, Lawrence Scalise who is no longer Attorney General of Iowa. 
    And he had brought me in to handle criminal -- criminal appeals and I recall that the first conference we had was about editorials that were being written regarding the clerk's transcript system. 
    The writer of these editorials is a resident of Des Moines and writes for the Des Moines registrant tribunal and he had been suggesting that the clerk's transcript appeal system was used by some attorneys to -- some attorneys to give the appearance of their appointed or the client for which they were appointed actually getting appeal and the client not getting such an appeal and there was some evidence to this effect. 
    But anyway, the Attorney General asked me if I would do some research into it and try to come up with some conclusions and some recommendations. 
    As things worked out, I never had the time to do that research because of the pressing number of appeals and never got into the problem until this Court granted certiorari in the Enstminger case and it's obvious that in the instant case, the petitioner did desire an appeal as was expressed in the record and as you will find in our brief, and I don't think we can say we will relinquish the desire to have plenary review the merits of the proceedings culminating any his conviction and he didn't receive it. 
    I concede to you in all candor that clerk's transcript does not present an adequate record upon which an individual can obtain meaningful review.

    Iowa uses both systems. 
    A copy of the arraignment, a copy of the -- the arraignment or plea, probably a copy of the verdict, the sentence, most often but not always, the charge to the jury and in this particular case, the clerk's transcript also contained a copy of the motion for a new trial raising the various constitutional issues.

    So there might be cases as Justice Douglas suggests where the questions is one of law and not at all as to insufficiency of the evidence or rulings on admission of evidence or anything but simply the sufficiency of the indictment or the instructions to the jury as to what the content of the particular offense was or -- where a clerk's transcript would be adequate?

    Mr. Don R. Bennett 
    Well, that's correct Your Honor except -- I appreciate that whenever clerk's transcript is used for a review there is no argument. 
    It's not an adversary proceeding at all. 
    It's simply is the court reviewing the clerk's transcript.

    Right.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well, I don't quite follow that because you think that there might be cases where a perfectly -- a perfectly careful lawyer might have one good solid point on appeal which could be fully disclosed and exposed by a clerk's transcript and therefore he wouldn't bother asking for anything else and then he'd go and argue his case and probably win it if let's say there were instructions and violation of Griffin against California. 
    Now what would be --

    Mr. Don R. Bennett

speaker="don_r_bennett" startTime="1405.092" stopTime="1451.014">
    Mr. Don R. Bennett 
    In the case of the indigent, and in keeping with this Court's decisions starting with Griffin versus Illinois, right on down to the one that the Court decided, I understand a week or a few days ago, you could spell out the constitutional violation where the Indigent is concerned by State stating that he has not received adequate and full plenary review to which he is entitled and the reason he hasn't received it is because he wasn't able to fire an attorney. 
    Had he been able to hire an attorney, he could have kept some control over his attorney. 
    Mr. Enstminger could have -- in checking up now you say you're going to get the brief and where is the brief? 
    Now in the case of the retained attorney, I suppose you could -- I could only say ineffective assistance of counsel, perhaps you could use the Sixth Amendment.

    Mr. Don R. Bennett 
    This question has bothered me and one that I haven't really come to resolve myself, but I do believe that under this record we would have to concede that this indigent was not or did not obtain whole and effective appellate review to which he was entitled and that within this Court's decisions, he wouldn't be entitled to relief for that reason.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="1486.949" stopTime="1492.940">

    What was that?
speaker="don_r_bennett" startTime="1588.900" stopTime="1627.615">
    Mr. Don R. Bennett 
    The Court was advised by what the petitioner denominated, a petition for writ of certiorari, advised some eleven or 12 days before they ultimately affirmed the conviction on a clerk's transcript, advised in this pleading that he was not happy with -- with the way that counsel was proceeding with this appeal. 
    And so in this case, we have a record which goes a little beyond counsel's inaction. 
    We have a record showing that the Iowa Court was advised that the fact that the petitioner was complaining about the way the appeal went, nonetheless, it was affirmed on the clerk's transcript a few days later.

    Mr. Don R. Bennett 
    No, Your Honor, but to the extent that the clerk's transcript system allows the counsel appointed to represent indigents to do nothing and to the extent that the ultimate per curium opinion leads those indigents into believe that they've got -- leads the indigents in to believing that they've got a full appeal, then there is something wrong with the system.

    Mr. Don R. Bennett 
    No, I'm not -- I'm not ready to say that as a blanket statement for all cases. 
    Every lawyer that -- who handles any criminal appeals at all in Iowa knows that the clerk's transcript is quite often used as a delaying tactic, a time to let the man put his orders in affair or put his affairs and order. 
    It's also occasionally used where an attorney has reviewed the record, felt that any appeal would be frivolous, goes to his client and advises his client at this sits down and talks about it. 
    The client agrees with the counsel and so he let's go on the clerk's transcript. 
    So there are situations in which the clerk's transcript is certainly being utilized without there being any -- any suggestion of the constitutional taint to its use.

    Mr. Don R. Bennett 
    That's correct. 
    We have suggested to the Iowa Court and some proposed rule changes which they have told us they will consider and which are incorporated in the appendix of our brief that they ought to do way with the clerk's transcript appeal, that what they should do is to dismiss the appeal with prejudice if the record or the briefs are not filed on time or with any -- or with any enlargement of time.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="1759.187" stopTime="1796.259">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Your point here as I understand it is that in this particular case, the court-appointed counsel for the petitioner, that the counsel didn't do his job that the petitioner called that fact to the court's attention that the court ignored that and went ahead and decided this case on the basis of the clerk's transcript and that this amounts to a denial of the right of appeal. 
    Am I right in this statement?
speaker="don_r_bennett" startTime="1796.259" stopTime="1861.311">
    Mr. Don R. Bennett 
    That's substantially it. 
    I -- I would, Mr. Justice Fortas, I would like in all fairness to the Court, to the Iowa Court to say that -- that they did not ignore that notice. 
    This is a situation I -- I realize this is not important where this record is concerned but as a practical matter, I want to tell you about the situation where they simply got more work and they can keep up with and as one hand doing what the other doesn't know. 
    So this petition for writ of certiorari not being proper and informed was summarily denied without even being aware that Harvey Lyle Enstminger was also some place else. 
    But of course we're stuck with the record as it shows. 
    Now, to proceed this a step further, we've asked the Iowa Court in connection with these proposed rule changes that they spell out, what we -- what we think or what this Court might hold to be the obligation of counsel, to spell it out in black and white and tell the attorneys of the State of Iowa what is expected of them whenever they are appointed to represent an indigent and I think that's necessary because in my limited experience I have seen some abuse and this is not been the only case.

    Well, Mr. Belin thinks they are.

    Apparently, the merits were pressed in Douglas versus California as I recall I believe Mr. Justice Clark and Mr. Justice Harlan's dissenting opinion and one of the footnotes indicates that they were pressing the merits on this Court in Douglas versus California and the Court didn't decide them. 
    But I would say this, you've got a copy of the trial transcript up here and you don't have to read it too carefully to find out there is some real difficult question on whether a man consented to these -- to the use of these papers or whether within Schmerber versus California, he hasn't waived any -- waived any argument on the merits of search and seizure and self-incrimination argument because of his failure to raise timely objections.

   Rebuttal of David W. Belin

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Belin.
speaker="david_w_belin" startTime="2506.869" stopTime="2541.405">
    Mr. David W. Belin 
    I'd like to make two comments if I may, first with regard to the merits of the case. 
    I think it's the duty of all appointed counsel to raise every possible issue for submission to this Court. 
    And to the extent that I feel that there are substantial errors in the merits, I've done this, number one for the inherent issues themselves and number two, to show the failures of the clerk's transcript system which wouldn't disclose any of these errors whether its appointed counsel or whether it's retained counsel or anything else and I think the inherent defect of the clerk's transcript system --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2541.405" stopTime="2548.449">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    It also bears -- it also bears on whether or not the counsel made any -- actually decided [Inaudible]
speaker="david_w_belin" startTime="2548.449" stopTime="2591.084">
    Mr. David W. Belin 
    Yes, that's the very point Your Honor. 
    The -- the fact that with these issues, there was no substantive appeal even assuming that the counsel would have been a retained counsel. 
    I think, it creates the issues of equal protection and also the question about effective assistance of counsel. 
    And that's why I've urged that the system itself of a clerk's transcript appeal where there was no record on appeal in the true sense of the word and of course the fact that there's never been a reversal, I think is indicative of the kind of practical operation this system has that there is not been a reversal of a clerk's transcript appeal at least in the 15 years that I know of.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2591.084" stopTime="2611.670">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Mr. Belin, what if there are two cases before the Iowa Supreme Court exactly like this one where the exactly the same thing happened and one of the case the counsel was appointed and in the other case, the counsel was retained? Exactly the same thing [Inaudible] in this case, do you think it will have the identical results?
speaker="david_w_belin" startTime="2611.670" stopTime="2629.286">
    Mr. David W. Belin 
    Your Honor, my personal belief is it there should be because I don't think that there has been in the one appeal that the defendant has as a matter of right. 
    If there is negligence on retained counsel, or negligence on appointed counsel, I don't think that you can say that this constitutes an appeal. 
    And as a matter of fact --

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Maybe it's one that has to be filed in order to get the appeal?

    Mr. David W. Belin 
    That's correct Your Honor. 
    And as a matter of fact, it could have been -- it could have happened here. 
    But at least, if that would have happened, you wouldn't not have had a formal opinion of the Supreme Court affirming the conviction and I think the fatal defect of the clerk's transcript system is that instead of dismissing it which I think they could do if they were to dismiss it what they do is that they affirm they wouldn't appeal the man has as a matter of right under -- under the period -- the one paragraph, one paragraph per curium opinion says based on the record, we have before us, we find no error. 
    In other words, that's the way the opinion was in this case. 
    And my position is that the clerk's transcript system doesn't permit a record. 
    This as Justice Stewart says that theoretically, it's possible to have an error shown so far as instructions are concerned, but in practice, it just doesn't work that way.

    Mr. David W. Belin 
    Yes sir. 
    By the way in the record, I might say there is a typographical error in the record that shows in the record itself, I think in one portion of the opinion was on October 10th, actually it's on October 19th -- and I think in our brief and in the brief of the Attorney General that shows October 19th.
