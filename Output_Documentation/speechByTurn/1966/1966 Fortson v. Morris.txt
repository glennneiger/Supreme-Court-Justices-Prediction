    Mr. Harold N. Hill, Jr. 
    May it please the Court. 
    This case comes here from Georgia and is an appeal from a decision of a three-judge court of the Northern District of Georgia. 
    I'm sure I speak for counsel for all of the parties in the case expressing our appreciation for the Court's rearranging its calendar and permitting us to be here today. 
    The Democratic primary was held in Georgia on September 14th of 1966. 
    There were five candidates in that primary. 
    Former Governor Ellis Arnall run first, Lester G.Maddox was second. 
    The -- a runoff was held on December the -- or September the 28th between Lester Maddox and Ellis Arnall. 
    Mr. Maddox received 54% of the vote in that runoff and Mr. Arnall 46%. 
    Howard Callaway became the nominee of the Republican Party by getting a nomination petition signed by 5% of the registered voters which would be about 90,000 signatures. 
    The general election was held on November 8th, the news election service on official returns show that Mr. Maddox received in that election, 448,044 votes. 
    Mr. Callaway, 449,894 votes with a difference between them of 1,850 votes. 
    Mr. Arnall and a write-in campaign which was sponsored for him but not by him received some 57,000 votes or 6%, so that neither candidate of the top two candidates had a majority. 
    The Georgia Constitution provides that when neither candidate in the Governor's race receives a majority of the vote the Georgia General Assembly shall meet in joint session and elect from the two candidates having received the highest number of votes a Governor. 
    On Wednesday November 9th, the day after the general election, the Morris suit was filed. 
    It originally sought to enjoin the election of the Governor until the General Assembly could be reapportioned which was to take place not later than 1969.

    I assume you would say that no voter swore to vote for the -- one of the high men. 
    If the legislature elected rather the people elected, so he would say that they took an oath to support the nominee of the party not to vote directly but that it did not apply to the election, special election that was to be held if they did not get a majority vote.

    The two particular provisions of the oath which is the declaration of candidacy appear as a part of the plaintiff's request for admissions following page 139 of the transcript of the record. 
    The particular part of the oath which might be applicable says that, “I'm a Democrat and I pledge myself to abide by the rules and regulations of the State Democratic Executive Committee and to abide by the results of said primary election on September 14, 1966”, which was the primary.

    We want the legislators and though the man bests the requirements of the office best to select. 
    Now, it is our position that this is in a sense a different method of electing a Governor much as it would be as if the legislature was still empowered to elect the Governor from -- in the first instance without having a popular vote that Gray versus Sanders applies to. 
    When you have an election, you must count all the vote -- votes equally.

    But it's our feeling that under the plurality system, there is a disfranchisement under Gray versus Sanders of all of those voters who vote against the plurality winner.

    Mr. Harold N. Hill, Jr. 
    Yes sir. 
    And we would say further that even to this point is a part of the argument that the election by the General Assembly is not a continuation of the popular vote election. 
    Now, we would say further that even if election by the General Assembly were to be considered as a continuation of the popular vote election it would not be violative of the Federal Constitution. 
    Now, the second suit was filed on the second day after the election seeking to enjoin the Governor -- election of the Governor by the General Assembly to require a runoff between Misters Callaway, and Maddox. 
    The three-judge court heard arguments and rendered its opinion. 
    The notice of appeal was filed the next day, application for stay the following Monday and that brings us here. 
    Under Georgia Codes -- under the Georgia Constitution and the Georgia Code in Sections which are not here in issue, the official returns of the Governor's race are to remain sealed until the day after the General Assembly organizes on January 9, 1967 under the Code Section 40-01, which unfortunately with is not cited in the briefs. 
    The General Assembly is the sole judge of the election and the qualifications of the Governor. 
    Under another provision of the Georgia Constitution that same -- that part of this provision but the part that has not been declared invalid, the General Assembly opens and publishes the returns under another Code Section. 
    The General Assembly determines all questions relating to the returns of the election for Governor. 
    Thus, the official results of the election are not known and will not be known until the General Assembly exercises its rights and powers under the Georgia Constitution and Laws which are not -- have not been challenged and have not been declared invalid. 
    Now, without in any way undertaking to any fringe upon the prerogative of the General Assembly to open and canvass those returns we have stipulated to this Court in the interest of expedition that the general assembly will find when they open the returns that no man 
    has received a majority of the votes cast.

    The Constitution of Georgia fortunately provides that the Governor elected in 1962, Carl Sanders shall hold office for four years and until his successor is chosen and qualifies so that we do have a Governor and he will, as indicated, he will continue to hold office. 
    If he should resign the newly elected Lieutenant Governor could take his place. 
    In it's a 142-year history this will be the first election of a Governor by the Georgia General Assembly. 
    An attempt to exercise that power was made by -- in 1947 but was held invalid by the Georgia Supreme Court. 
    There the Georgia Supreme Court held the provision was not applicable where one candidate had a clear majority but died after the election and before taking office. 
    The Court held that it was proper for the incumbent Governor to hold on until the General Assembly published the returns of the Lieutenant Governor's race and for the newly elected Lieutenant Governor thereupon became the acting Governor upon the resignation of the Former Governor Ellis Arnall at that time. 
    The Court in that case, Georgia Court held that the General Assembly could not elect from the two next highest candidates where the man who had have the majority had done.

speaker="harold_n_hill_jr" startTime="1675.987" stopTime="1746.043">
    Mr. Harold N. Hill, Jr. 
    I'm not sure Your Honor. 
    In order to be able to answer that question, the provision of -- that the General Assembly elect a Governor was in the Constitution of 1798 and was changed in 1924. 
    What the provision may have been prior to 1798 --I apologized to the Court, I am unable to say. 
    But we are not really talking about a Constitution of 1824, Georgia has one of the most recent Constitutions in the country. 
    The Constitution of 1945, it was proposed by a constitutional commission composed of 23 appointed members. 
    Governor Ellis Arnall, three lawyers and the three laymen appointed by the Governor, the Speaker of the House who at that time was selected by the Governor and elected by the House, and five members of the House. 
    Governor Arnall was unanimously elected chairman of that constitutional commission. 
    He discussed and presided at the meeting at which Article V, Section 1, paragraph 4 of the Georgia Constitution was approved.

    Mr. Harold N. Hill, Jr. 
    1861, 1865, 68, and 77 was readopted and again in the Constitution of 1945. 
    The Constitution of 45 was approved by the voters at a special constitution, an election held on August 7th of 1945. 
    Now, it's been said that the American Constitution is the most wonderful work ever struck off at a given time by the brain and purpose of man because Georgia copied a part of that constitution. 
    We are here today. 
    If these were a copyright infringement case, Georgia would lose.But this is a constitutional question and we said that one reason that Georgia should win is because she copied a part of the Twelfth Amendment. 
    Appellees have said that this provides an ingenious way to frustrate the will of the people and that it's the last vestige of the county unit system. 
    We say that there are things in the Federal Constitution which the states can copy without being unconstitutional and that this is one of them. 
    It could be said that the veto power of the Governor is an ingenious way of frustrating the willof the people. 
    But State Constitutions provide for veto powers in Governors and so does the Federal Constitution and just because the states happened to copy that feature of the Federal Constitution does not make it unconstitutional for the states to do. 
    The District Court's order was based on what it called the rationale of this Court's decision in Gray versus Sanders. 
    District Court's decision was not base upon alleged malapportionment. 
    That is the Court below said that even if a perfectly -- said that even a perfectly apportioned legislature could not elect the Governor. 
    The appellees have attempted in their briefs to reargue alleged malapportionment. 
    The Georgia General Assembly is not perfectly apportioned.

    Mr. Harold N. Hill, Jr. 
    Yes, Your Honor. 
    Now, so that we believe that malapportionment either -- ought to be -- beside the situation and we'll deal with Gray versus Sanders which was of course the county unit in the system of nomination in the Democratic Party primary which was invalidated under one person, one vote principle. 
    The Court there enumerated many of the things it was not dealing with in Gray including the convention system of nominating for the candidates. 
    The county unit system was a method of waiting votes and the Court said the present case is only a voting case. 
    The Court did not, I do not believe invalidate the election of Georgia's State Auditor by the legislature in the Gray decision in order that -- I believe invalidate the election of the -- by the Maine legislature of its Secretary of State and Attorney General for the election by other state legislatures. 
    The Nineteenth Amendment says that Senators shall be elected by the people but it does not say that the Governor or state officials shall be elected by the people. 
    Gray, as I understand it said, that when you have an election of a state official by the people. 
    You must count each vote equally. 
    But Gray did not say that a state must always elect every state official by statewide election. 
    We do not believe that Gray invalidated any election methods or systems where there's no waiting of the votes of the people. 
    In Fortson versus Dorsey involving the validity of multimember Senatorial Districts, this Court declined to apply Gray in an election system matter because there the question was whether it was to have multimember districts or subdivided districts being a method of election rather than a vote counting case. 
    The Court also in Reynolds versus Sims, a reapportionment case said that Gray was not dispositive in cases involving legislative systems. 
    In Gray, the Court said that once the class of voters is chosen, their qualification specified, we see no constitutional way by which equality of voting power maybe evaded. 
    The voters of Georgia before thisproblem arose chose to close as of the November 8th general election. 
    The class of voters entitled to vote for the office of Governor. 
    They chose to terminate their own qualifications to vote under the limits -- the circumstances existing here. 
    As was said in Gray, states can within limits specify the qualifications of voters in both state and federal elections. 
    The Constitution indeed makes voter qualifications rest on state law even in federal elections. 
    The election of a Governor by the General Assembly of Georgia under the limited circumstances prescribed by the Georgia Constitution is not a continuation of the popular vote process but is a separate method of election when the voters have not given any candidate a majority. 
    The state has specified the qualifications of the persons eligible to vote.They are the legislators. 
    Even if this is a continuation of the popular vote process we submit that Gray versus Sanders does not prohibit it.

    That is the -- one of the issues certainly. 
    After an election and the counting of the votes, the losers' votes count for nothing even under Gray. 
    Only the winners' votes count. 
    It happened this year in Georgia that there was no winner. 
    The State Constitution provides a different method for selecting a Governor when there is no winner. 
    The extension of Gray into matters of this type could lead to a requirement that legislation must be adopted by referendum. 
    If the voting equality principle of Gray is applied to a State legislature then the guarantee of a Republican form of Government is to a certain extent. 
    Certainly, we can -- Gray versus Sanders was based on the Equal Protection Clause and there is we submit no unequal protection in the subject provision of Georgia's Constitution. 
    It applies equally to all.

    But we intent to show the Court I think if -- that it's conclusion is inevitable under Gray versus Sanders. 
    And that the only path that may be followed under that rule, the rule of that case, is to move forward to the electorate. 
    Now, we do have a distinction with the Court appellee's justice. 
    Their contention will be to take one path to the electorate. 
    Ours will be to take another. 
    On the statement regarding the --

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Yes.
speaker="charles_morgan_jr" startTime="2436.618" stopTime="2495.421">
    Mr. Charles Morgan, Jr. 
    -- case, we did enter Court on three counts on a complaint. 
    The first count did allege malapportionment. 
    The second count alleged Gray v. Sanders grounds stating that malapportionment was a part of the county unit system rule. 
    And the third ground was straight out county unit question or geographical unit. 
    I think we turned it there. 
    Our case and appellee's justice case agreed on that point and that if the point upon which the Court below decide of this matter. 
    Now, we contend that the malapportionment of the General Assembly of the State of Georgia, matters in the sense that it almost locks in this instance the will of a minority, the right of a minority to elect the Governor of the State of Georgia. 
    We don't contend that that's the principle thrust of course the Gray v. Sanders case but we think that's a part of it. 
    Now, the court below asked this --
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="2495.421" stopTime="2497.177">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    I don't understand what the word is?
speaker="charles_morgan_jr" startTime="2497.177" stopTime="2497.959">
    Mr. Charles Morgan, Jr. 
    Yes.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="2497.959" stopTime="2510.318">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Are you suggesting in light of our affirmance with the three-judge order that this legislature taking office in January, is it constitutionally malapportionment?
speaker="charles_morgan_jr" startTime="2510.318" stopTime="2562.338">
    Mr. Charles Morgan, Jr. 
    Yes. 
    The question was asked by the court below this way Mr. Justice Brennan. 
    The court below forwarded to us the following question in the following word. 
    They said, “Assuming the allegations in the claim that all -- are all taken us true.” 
    Does the complaint alleged facts which entitle the complaint as to relief in the light of the prior decision of the Court in Toombs versus Fortson affirmed by this Court. 
    And whether this case should not be dismissed on the pleadings or for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. 
    We discussed with the Court there the question of the affirmance and the effect of the order of affirmance by this Court. 
    And we came to the conclusion that under the earlier case where the three-judge court in the Toombs v. Fortson matter had enjoined the State Constitutional provision or rather the state -- the new State Constitution proposed in 1964 and it enjoined the electorate -- rather that from being submitted to the elect --
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="2562.338" stopTime="2565.626">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Because that had been fashioned by the -- a malapportioned legislature?
speaker="charles_morgan_jr" startTime="2565.626" stopTime="2567.067">
    Mr. Charles Morgan, Jr. 
    By a malapportioned legislature.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="2567.067" stopTime="2567.655">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Yes.
speaker="charles_morgan_jr" startTime="2567.655" stopTime="2617.556">
    Mr. Charles Morgan, Jr. 
    And the Court's reasoning in that case was that it would take a two-thirds vote by a properly apportioned legislature to amend that -- to propose an amendment to that new Constitution. 
    Now that case was the appealed here of course, as it came to this Court and then it was sent back to that Court for reconsideration in light of further developments as to whether this should be the ongoing injunction. 
    Now in this case, the power of the Governor is of course much different from ordinary legislative matters just as the State Constitutional provisions were there and the Governor for instance in this instance would be selected to serve until 1971. 
    Now in the lower court, we got the position of -- here we -- he would have a malapportioned Governor whatever that means but we have a Governor elected by a malapportioned legislature who served two years beyond the new legislature that's probably apportioned would take office.

    Well, I just have trouble, you concede -- extricating how you can characterize this new legislature as malapportioned when for the purposes of this election at least in this constitute as a legislative body.

    Mr. Charles Morgan, Jr. 
    Yes, sir. 
    Now, not reaching that question but just you -- that question becoming an aggravating point on the Gray versus Sanders, I think the rule of Gray versus Sanders clearly envelops this case here. 
    Gray involved the county units systems, the nominating procedure before we ever got to the final step of election before we got to the November 8 general election. 
    If there is a distinction and I think there is. 
    The general election is the final step and the most important step in the state electoral process. 
    Once the voter leaves the polling place and the curtains come down, it's over as far as he's concern. 
    He's made his final choice and this -- to consider in this circumstance in essence that a geographically apportioned body even if properly apportioned could select the Governor. 
    And then we've got the instinctive and immediate problems that arise of -- that arose in the county unit system in Gray v. Sanders. 
    And what are those problems? 
    The first one is that if a legislature voted either way he would automatically deprive those constituents who did not agree with his vote of any right to have their ballots counted in the selection of Governor. 
    If that person in the General Assembly absent of himself, of course that'd be no representation for the voters from his district. 
    He could vote for a candidate who did not received the majority of votes in his district as well as the candidate who did not receive of majority of votes in the state. 
    He could elect the man who ran number two and completely, it deprives the voter of that direct voice in the selection of a statewide officer after the class of those selectee. 
    That officer has already been determined, that class of the voters of Georgia.

    Mr. Charles Morgan, Jr. 
    If there's a special -- I think the problem in Georgia -- this is as a practical matter. 
    I think the problem in Georgia with the respect to the write-in movement in the -- this is the first time this has happen just like this is the first time is going to state -- General Assembly. 
    And the problem in Georgia as I understand it was the people felt like they were dealt with unfairly in the electoral process and they move forward from that position to have a write-in campaign. 
    In a special election in Georgia under the Georgia statutes, the nominees of the major parties would appear on the ballot without new primaries. 
    Others could qualify to run for Governor of Georgia from that you would have a runoff and I don't think that there would be any questions as to the un -- what some voters considered unfairness earlier in the electoral process.

    Well to take it that way, how would the state to get to -- I'm asking myself questions as I go, how would the state get to that sort of a system? 
    It would get to that sort of system by its State Constitution. 
    State Constitution will be voted upon by the people. 
    I should think that this would be the declaration of the right to vote by the people themselves and under Lucas versus Colorado it might be forbidden -- might be forbidden under the Lucas-Colorado case. 
    Now, we know that federal analogies are inapposite. 
    We know that through Gray v.Sanders and Reynolds versus Sims. 
    We come to this Court asking this Court for more than merely a ruling on what the lower court did below and we ask it for guidance. 
    Now, we understand that fully that this Court does not render advisory opinions but it does render opinions. 
    And we think that it's in the interest of all Georgia voters and in the interest of federal judiciary and the state judicial system also that where constitutional questions as such as this come up. 
    That whatever the opinion the Court renders is -- that at least indicate some sort of rules for people as to what they cannot do at least. 
    In light of that we want to refer to the federal analogy of the State Constitutional provisions that Mr. Hill referred to in his opening argument. 
    There is a great deal of certainty in American Government.

    I've said judicial knowledge or common knowledge that there was not a majority obtained regardless of who was the high candidate. 
    Now, and regarding a case of controversy question of course I can assure the Court there is a controversy going on in Georgia and that the stakes are rather high. 
    The problem I want to discuss with the Court now if we might is the certainty that existed in the Georgia Constitution before the District Court ruling. 
    Assuming that this Court affirmed that has a great deal to do with the remedy to be affected by a Court or by the state -- General Assembly itself or by a state court either by this Court or the District Court below. 
    Whoever decides how the Governor of Georgia is to be elected?

    In your own time then.
speaker="charles_morgan_jr" startTime="3982.516" stopTime="4161.205">
    Mr. Charles Morgan, Jr. 
    Alright. 
    With respect to the entire electoral process that went on in Georgia, it's very difficult of course in any case of this type to make a record as to what voters intend in any election contest case. 
    It's always difficult to say that a certain number of voters would have voted another way or did vote another way because that sort of proceeding is always open to perjury as to what people say their intentions were and what they were going to do? 
    We've tried to take the case of Davis versus Schnell and to utilize some of the techniques there used to show the intention of the legislature and the electorate regarding this general election. 
    Now it's our contention generally that the election was held under the provisions of the Georgia Constitution. 
    And the Attorney General of Georgia issued an Attorney General's opinion were not the supporters of Mr. Callaway and not the supporters of Mr. Maddox but the supporters as to the Write-in Movement went to the Secretary of State and said, “Look, we think that we can have a runoff from this election and that's what we want.” 
    And at that point, the Attorney General of Georgia issued an official opinion saying that the runoff statute did not jive with the Constitution of Georgia and they couldn't have a runoff election. 
    Now from that point on, there'd became a great misleading of the electorate of Georgia and that misleading was not a venal misleading. 
    It wasn't done by the candidates deliberately or the press deliberately, by the Attorney General Georgia deliberately, it's just the State Constitution conflicted with the state's statute his interpretation. 
    He said, “State Constitution would prevail and this election would go to the state legislature.” Now, what would be the effect of that? 
    Well, I think its common knowledge that in politics you often have the argument or question with respect to the lesser of two evils. 
    This candidate is the less of -- lesser in two evils in every state and in every national election.I'm sure that argument is made. 
    But in thiselection it went further than that. 
    It was commonly argued in the State of Georgia that in the event that you vote for a write-in candidate whether with Mr. Arnall or anybody else, you thereby contribute to the election of Mr. Maddox because when you do that, if there's no majority, it will go the General Assembly and there Mr. Maddox will get a second chance based upon the oath that was already taken in the Democratic predominance in the General Assembly. 
    Now, this had an effect on that election which was such as to render the November 8th proceeding invalid and void and to constitute a total failure of election because -- due to the misleading that election could not be a proper election for nominating the two candidates who either the legislature could select or the people of Georgia could vote on at a later time. 
    Now --

    Justice Potter Stewart

    Mr. Charles Morgan, Jr. 
    No, sir. 
    There would not be any misleading under those circumstances. 
    And this portion of the argument goes only to the -- based on the assumptions that this Court affirmed the District Court below. 
    Now, the influence on that voter --

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    That was -- they decided to do it.
speaker="charles_morgan_jr" startTime="4261.756" stopTime="4399.049">
    Mr. Charles Morgan, Jr. 
    Well, sir they didn't. 
    And I think Reynolds versus Sims is the best answer to the political thicket question I've ever seen because if there's ever been a place where I felt like we'd have trouble with that decision that was the place and though -- and there are a lot of television commentaries and speeches and everything else but by (Inaudible) they went along. 
    And after they passed a couple of laws, the District Court below in the -- what then became Sims versus Baggett ruled and we got a properly apportioned state legislature. 
    Now, and I think that the same thing happens here. 
    I think this Court just to conjure up the problems that may confront it and I hate to do that but I - to the gander -- candor, I think I have to. 
    To conjure up the problems of affirming the District Court, these are the kinds of problems the Court may face. 
    First of all, what is the right to cast a write-in the ballot? 
    Now, most of the cases that I have read with respect to this right arose at the time the Australian ballot was being adopted in this country or seemed to have risen about that time. 
    And this right to cast a write-in ballot is the right of a voter to reject the nominees trust upon him by the major parties or by any other nominating process. 
    Now, repeatedly throughout the history of this country, we've had recurrent efforts to bar minority groups in the ballot. 
    Now, we have laws all across the country that provides certain requirements for a group to come to the floor to get on the ballot via percent of the vote in the last election, 10% whatever it may be. 
    Now, the right to vote is the most personal right a man has. 
    I know in Harper versus Virginia State Board of Election this Court stated that it didn't reach the question of the relationship between the right to vote and the right of free expression and then went ahead to decide the case. 
    Well in this instance, we obviously have voters in Georgia and I'm not just contending there's been a misleading of just the people who voted for the write-in thicket or just the ons who voted for the Callaway thicket or just the ones who go to the Maddox thicket. 
    I think it's been misleading of all the voters in Georgia. 
    But in Georgia, we had some voters who just said, “No. 
    One time in our lives we're not going to say the lesser of two evils. 
    We're going to vote who we want to vote for and we're going to do it by very cumbersome procedure and we're going to express ourselves.” 
    And that's what they did.

    I'm in complete agreement that's a pretty strong thing. 
    Now, we do have a majority of the American states of course which have a plurality system and you can see and conjure ahead a conflict between the minority right to reject and the majority right to elect. 
    As I -- in answer to Mr. Justice White awhile ago, I don't think that this problem would come up because of the -- you know because of a circumstances below. 
    I don't think we'd have another write-in movement if we have a special election. 
    I think we do have a great problem. 
    If a Court of the United States or really any other governmental agency should arrange a procedure by some sort of ex post facto process of nominating who the people can vote for and declining to allow them to have a right to reject those nominees and vote. 
    Alright, I know the status' content in its brief, the voters in this -- in Georgia were not misled.

    If Mr. Arnall pulled a heavy vote and the election were thrown into the legislature, Mr. Maddox would be Governor.

    Well, they may have but I think of that perticularly is that they all usually go to the same side. 
    I want to conclude now by saying this we do have an important case before the Court and all of us recognized that. 
    This is the case in which we've all worked rather hard during the last few weeks. 
    It's a case which this Court has moved to here rapidly. 
    It's a case in which the Attorney General of Georgia wants a decision immediately. 
    And it's a cases in which co-appellees want a decision immediately and it's a case in which we want a decision. 
    When a decision can be reached taking into consideration the constitutional rights of all the parties involved. 
    There is a need for haste in the case but not for undo haste. 
    I think that this Court recognizes that there are complete -- competing and conflicting interest here. 
    They're really vital to 4 million people and perhaps to people in other states even though almost all of them have plurality provisions for the election of Governor. 
    So consequently I would urged the Court that there's no possibility of a breakdown on the Government of Georgia. 
    Now, there's no anarchy there. 
    There's nobody proposing that we don't -- that the Government's falling. 
    I want to express our appreciation for the rapidity which the Court has heard the case and also for the courtesy which we have received from counsel on all side in this matter. 
    I know that this Court in Reynolds versus Sims stated that and I thought well said stated, “We are cautioned about the dangers of entering into political thickets and mathematical quagmires.” 
    Our answer is this, “But a dial of constitutionally protected rights, the man's judicial protection, our oath and our office require no less of us.”

   Argument of Emmet J. Bondurant, II
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="4803.656" stopTime="4816.049">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Bondurant.
speaker="emmet_j_bondurant_ii" startTime="4816.049" stopTime="4907.731">
    Mr. Emmet J. Bondurant, II 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    Initially, before proceeding to the merits and I feel we must meet the problem raised by Mr. Justice Brennan, whether we have in this Court a case of controversy on reasonably concrete facts on which this Court can act. 
    Mr. Morgan has touched on this question. 
    The District Court took judicial notice of a common public fact in Georgia that no candidate received the majority of the votes properly casts in the November 8th general election. 
    At the time it was meeting, this was a commonly known fact. 
    Further, although the state makes this argument that the returns are sealed and cannot be unsealed until the general assembly meets by law 34-1506 (a) of the election code certified copies, identical to those which are sealed are retained in the office of the ordinary as public records open to public inspection by anyone in the State of Georgia. 
    Since that time because of the expedition in which this case is handled ourselves representing justice et al and the state have joined in a stipulation which has been presented to clerk's office in which we have obtained on the basis of telegram request from this ordinaries what these returns showed based on the statutory records and they have notified us and from all the counties, a 148 counties of the 159. 
    We do not have with -- just because of the practically of the situation, the repetitive approach --
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="4907.731" stopTime="4909.667">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    How many do you have Mr. Bondurant?
speaker="emmet_j_bondurant_ii" startTime="4909.667" stopTime="4921.305">
    Mr. Emmet J. Bondurant, II 
    148 of the 159 counties have notified us. 
    The remaining 11 counties, the -- all public information indicates casts combined fewer votes then would take it to make a majority.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="4921.305" stopTime="4924.816">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    And this -- and the notification is to what effect?
speaker="emmet_j_bondurant_ii" startTime="4924.816" stopTime="4949.287">
    Mr. Emmet J. Bondurant, II 
    The notification is that no candidate has received the majority. 
    And the total vote cast under the remaining 11 counties from which we have not heard by telegram would not be sufficient to give any candidate the majority even if totally added to his total. 
    So there can be no question. 
    This situation will be called into play that this is a real genuine case of controversy between adverse interests. 
    This --
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="4949.287" stopTime="4956.399">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Well, what was it that the Attorney General mentioned earlier about to being some discrepancies in figures?
speaker="emmet_j_bondurant_ii" startTime="4956.399" stopTime="4997.501">
    Mr. Emmet J. Bondurant, II 
    The news election service as I understand it Justice Brennan computed returns through noon on Friday following the election on Tuesday and at the time when we were in the District Court this was the most current information which we then have. 
    Many counties have paper ballots and tallied very slowly. 
    The discrepancies undoubtedly are result of final tabulations being completed after that time, particularly write-in ballots which in Fulton County, Atlanta there were more than 15,000, 16,000, 20,000 which took a great period of time to tabulate. 
    The same thing is true with other metropolitan counties. 
    These have been added to the total since then and they do change the totals.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="4997.501" stopTime="5003.712">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    But what you now have represent the final figures from these 158 counties together?
speaker="emmet_j_bondurant_ii" startTime="5003.712" stopTime="5042.842">
    Mr. Emmet J. Bondurant, II 
    As we understand it with the exception of 11 counties, these are according to the ordinaries, communicated by wired to us or by letter that which is shown by the certified copies which they maintained by law in their respective offices open to public inspection. 
    The originals of which or duplicate copies of which have been sealed and forwarded to the Secretary of State under the provisions to which the state refers. 
    So there is no question of acting in a hypothetical confusing or possibly changeable situation when those sealed returns opening -- opened. 
    We know what our situation is. 
    Everyone knows what it is. 
    This case is --

    (Inaudible)
speaker="emmet_j_bondurant_ii" startTime="5047.746" stopTime="5068.139">
    Mr. Emmet J. Bondurant, II 
    The absentee ballots were necessarily excluded from the news selection service tabulation and were counted more slowly and therefore later, when their service terminated on noon on Friday after the election on Tuesday. 
    As we understand it, these absentee ballots are included in the certified returns, the information of which has been communicated.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="5068.139" stopTime="5068.992">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    They are included?
speaker="emmet_j_bondurant_ii" startTime="5068.992" stopTime="5300.548">
    Mr. Emmet J. Bondurant, II 
    Yes, Your Honor. 
    The certified returns would include everything necessarily because they could not be sealed and forwarded until all votes were included. 
    This case is as we suggest not a representation case. 
    This is not Reynolds and Sims. 
    This is not Wesberry against Sanders. 
    This is not even Toombs against Fortson. 
    This is the right of the people of Georgia, the citizens and all of our 159 counties to elect her Governor in a popular statewide election on a one man, one vote basis. 
    We do not have here the question as to whether had Georgia chose and initially in 1966 to put this election in some other agency, whatever that agency might be whether that the constitutionally be done. 
    We have the question of whether Georgia having – by its Constitution said that there shall be a primary election of which every citizens of the state may participate. 
    A general election in which every citizen of the state qualified otherwise may participate and nearly a million did participate, may elect the Governor. 
    Changed only by the situation created by Georgia's desire to have a majority vote for her Governor which places the final selection power in the general assembly when no majority is achieved in the general election. 
    This is the sole purpose that the General Assembly is involved in any degree.It is a popular election in every sense of the word. 
    It is in every other state except in the unlikely event of a tie vote, a popular election. 
    It is the people's right to elect their Governor. 
    It has been in every state since before 1868 when the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted. 
    No state by 1868 did as Georgia initially and elected the Governor in the legislature or any other office. 
    It was a vote of the people and it is the vote of the people in Georgia. 
    And everyone in Georgia considers it such. 
    The General Assembly gets involved only because no candidate received the majority. 
    Solely in the name of majority vote to achieve the strength of popular support which majority expresses much better than plurality that the General Assembly become implicated in this process. 
    And yet, it's clear the General Assembly will not represent the strength of the majority support. 
    Not merely so effectively as a runoff. 
    The ironical and paradoxical thing about this case is that the Georgia legislative process at the time when the legislature was far more malapportioned than we are today. 
    In 1964, adopted the new election code which in expressed language says, “There shall be a runoff in every elected state public office where no candidate receives the majority.” 
    And in that context at the same session adopted a new State Constitution, they proposed a Constitution which would have repealed, superseded and done away with this 1824 provision and would have provided in expressed terms without a doubt, without debate, that this 1966 election would have been resolved by the vote of the people of Georgia in a runoff election between the two highest candidates. 
    There is no possibility as Mr. Justice White has suggested that we might have to go on and on because our election code itself says, “That a runoff shall be between the candidates receiving the highest number of votes in a general election. 
    We do not suggest that write-in votes can be excluded by either this Court or the District Court by order where the state has not done so. 
    We suggest instead that the General Assembly of Georgia has already done so in the expressed language in which it used in the election code that the runoff will be between the two candidates receiving the highest number of votes. 
    This is after all implicit in the nature of a runoff itself. 
    But the language was used -- General Assembly has used is consistently with the exclusion of write-in votes. 
    This --

speaker="emmet_j_bondurant_ii" startTime="5346.496" stopTime="5450.371">
    Mr. Emmet J. Bondurant, II 
    Yet in many other things which were not constructional have been reincorporated. 
    The last adoption of the Constitution was in a manner which the Georgia Supreme Court later recognized but was powerless to remedy was a matter not permitted by our State Constitution. 
    It was proposed as a single amendment which that Court said was not authorized. 
    The whole package had to be separately accepted or rejected. 
    And the Court said that we're looking at it before it had been ratified, it would have been something valid but could not afterwards. 
    So the idea of the ratification is that you might have had in the Colorado case where a single amendment was approved by a majority of the voters in every county of the state was not shown in Georgia. 
    The whole package, the good and the bad was approved in 1945 more than 20 years ago. 
    It is our view that this is a voting rights case. 
    That the people of the Georgia do have a right conferred by the Georgia Constitution to elect their Governor. 
    That the argument that this is a two step process or that some other process might apply is mere sophistry. 
    The here and now, the practicalities of the situation is that 950,000 people have voted in the general election. 
    Nearly 900,000 people have voted twice in primary elections leading up to this. 
    And if those people have the right to elect their Governor and that the instrumentality of election by the General Assembly solely in the name of majority rule is a device which deprives these voters just as truly as did the old unit system of nomination of the right to a full and equal voice, having been selected as the common denominator for selection in that final election process. 
    This is far more pernicious than that.

    It would divide as in -- indicates there's something wrong.

    Mr. Emmet J. Bondurant, II 
    I think it would be difficult to predict exactly what's its purpose was in 1824 Justice Black. 
    The problem now is that the General Assembly grossly unrepresentative may elect in a manner not consistent with the prior choices in the same election expressed by the people between the candidates put before the General Assembly.

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Do you think those are unrepresented?

speaker="emmet_j_bondurant_ii" startTime="5500.626" stopTime="5563.622">
    Mr. Emmet J. Bondurant, II 
    Yes, Your Honor, we are. 
    We take it on two basis.First is on the initial basis of the county unit system itself as you will recall the county unit system. 
    And the county unit votes were distributed in gubernatorial primary elections based on representation in the Georgia General Assembly which was apportioned on the old 321 system. 
    You had two unit votes for each sits you had in the House. 
    If Georgia hears merely by a legislative of election substituted, animate legislators from inanimate objects. 
    In the unit system you at least had the protection that the candidates were voting for a specific candidate much as they do in electoral college not for a legislator who performs many other functions with no knowledge of him ever being called on to do this. 
    In 142 years, we have never had this problem. 
    So far as we are aware no other state has ever had this problem. 
    But they do not vote for legislators with the view towards that one of them will -- they will select one of the two candidates in a gubernatorial race.

    Mr. Emmet J. Bondurant, II 
    The overwhelming majority of states do Your Honor. 
    We do not find it necessary in this case to reach the constitutionality of that problem which may have considerations other than those expressed in our own Constitution under the circumstances present in this case. 
    That tie vote may well be justified by considerations that are just not pertinent here, the only reason. 
    This goes to the General Assembly is not because the electorate is deadlock on a tie vote with no clear expression of a -- even a plurality will of the type which would be sufficient in 47 of our 50 states. 
    The reason is in the name of majority vote. 
    This doesn't show majority vote. 
    It does not assure a majority support. 
    The legislator has prescribed a far less restrictive alternative in the election code which is permissible in this Court in a number of opinions has recognized that even if the legislative purpose is legitimate and substantial as admittedly here, the desire to have the Governor elected by majority vote is. 
    It may not pursue this in a manner that is unduly restrictive of the rights of the plaintiffs in this case or the other citizens of Georgia to elect their Governor in a popular election.(Voice Overlap) --

    Mr. Emmet J. Bondurant, II 
    Your Honor, we feel again that this is a question which may not be reached in this litigation because whether or not the Constitution of the United States confers a right on every citizen of Georgia in the first instance to elect its Governor had Georgia chosen a prime minister system or some other system. 
    The situation in Georgia is that Georgia says that the people shall elect their Governor. 
    They participate in the primary election. 
    They participate in the general election. 
    The Georgia Constitution, the very first section of Bill of Rights which was put in only in 1877 more than 40 years after this provision became a part of the Constitution says that all state offices are the trustees of the people. 
    Our Constitution has undergone a change of democratizing in itself. 
    First and foremost and always in Georgia, the Governor is elected and is understood to be elected by the people. 
    This is merely a very minor situation --

    Mr. Emmet J. Bondurant, II 
    It was considerably after 1824. 
    It was in 1868 at which time all states elected their Governor in a popular election. 
    There was no state which still provided the legislative election as Georgia had in 1798 until 1824. 
    And that fact, the historical argument that was made that in 1868 the legislatures of the state were not only one man, one vote basis was easily rejected by this Court. 
    It would seem to me its no greater step to say that the Fourteenth Amendment reads in to State Government given the power to the Chief Executive the uniformed practice of all of the states in 1868.

    Mr. Emmet J. Bondurant, II 
    I would say that it takes at most two shots. 
    It's not essential if it takes two shots. 
    It never has for more than 142 years and until 1942, we have gubernatorial elections every two years. 
    It has not been of significance before Georgia because we never had a two-party system. 
    We've never had a contest in the general election that made any real difference. 
    And in primaries, in this primary in this year, we had a failure to achieve a majority for a Democratic nominee and what did we do? 
    We held a runoff. 
    Now, we didn't go to the General Assembly and we didn't go to some other electoral college body or Party Executive Committee or any other group. 
    We said that we'll have a runoff between the two candidates receiving the highest number of votes and we had that runoff. 
    There were five candidates. 
    There were no particular write-in efforts, if there were, the votes were not counted. 
    And we selected from those two the candidate whom would carry the Democratic standard and for the general election. 
    It seems clear that this is -- it makes no point to argue what other systems Georgia might have. 
    This is a people's election. 
    Justice Matthews in the county unit case, one of the defenses indeed argued in the unit case was, “No one has a right to equal protection in the primary elections because Georgia permits you to nominate by conviction. 
    And nobody in a party convention has a right to an equal vote or equal representation depending on where they live.” 
    So, since Georgia could have chosen that method initially it did not have to permit nomination by a primary. 
    It was perfectly alright to do this in the Democratic primary election. 
    After all, if you didn't like it, you could still have a conviction. 
    But this Court rejected that and said, “What other methods Georgia might have chosen it also had the primary.” 
    And once its chose to put this on the basis, the people in the primary, it is a people selection. 
    One man, one vote in any system of waiting those votes --

    And the only reason it purports to depart from the people as the basic unit of selection is in the name of majority rules. 
    The faith of the people to cast a majority of their ballots, it would be ironic if the people are to be deprived to their right to choose entirely, if by mere faith of a majority of it to cast their ballots for a single candidate. 
    The essence of majority rule is that the people, a sufficient number of the people cast those votes together. 
    And its ironic if the split among the people is to deprive the people of any hand in the process whatsoever. 
    Convert them over into the mere nominating procedure and have a legislative body in which they are not equally represented far further to make the final selection where in the Cobb County for instance, a suburb of Atlanta that grossly underrepresented by more than 40% in both the House and the Senate. 
    There are seven Senators, it was a heavy vote for one candidate in that county. 
    These seven Senators and Representatives cannot vote equally with those of other counties which are overrepresented by more than 40%.They are losing the effectiveness of those votes.

    Mr. Emmet J. Bondurant, II 
    This Court need only say that it seems to us as it did in the county unit case that Georgia has placed this election on the basis of the people. 
    That the people are sovereign in Georgia that it is their choice and having made it a choice of the people election that state cannot thereafter use any device whether the name of majority rule or any other device which would wait those votes unequally between voters living in different areas of the states. 
    This Court need not reach the question whether had Georgia initially done what no other state for more than a 100 years has tried to do, wanted to put this in an election -- in the legislature itself. 
    This Court need not reach it and I'm sure that Georgia citizens would not be deterrent if they chose to try to adopt that system. 
    It's incredible in view of our historical practice in any state would try to do this here in the 20th Century. 
    The trend has been since 1790 away from legislative election and towards popular election. 
    And if one man, one vote means anything in statewide elections it should mean that in the final selection of the Chief Executive of Georgia. 
    The questions of remedy which have been raised here, we find to be quite easy. 
    They are those which were prescribed by the General Assembly in 1964 in their expressed language, they are applicable. 
    They reflect consistently with the position which we have taken, the state policy of Georgia favoring election, final election by the people of Georgia. 
    This was almost a part of the organic law of the State of Georgia by virtue of the 1964 proposed constitution. 
    It is not upon of it in 1966 because of circumstances beyond the control of the General Assembly and the electorate.But the remedy is clear. 
    It's consistent with this policy and it would afford that all the Georgia citizens as the General Assembly to whom the state is now trying to force this decision. 
    That of which the General Assembly has already said is the direction it should take, a one man, one vote runoff election between the candidatesreceiving the highest vote in the general election. 
    It would be just unconscionable in view of this Court's decisions providing equal votes and legislatures providing an equal right to select the Congressman to provide an equal vote in primary elections. 
    You could now say that the final selection in the -- on any basis other than an equal vote. 
    The citizens of Georgia deserve the right to make these decisions for themselves where they all have an equal opportunity to have a voice in the final selection to deny them this write-in in the name of an 1824 constitutional provision providing for the sole purpose of majority.

speaker="emmet_j_bondurant_ii" startTime="6943.418" stopTime="7008.712">
    Mr. Emmet J. Bondurant, II 
    I would recognize that it was in the Constitution of 1868 which at the time of our readmission would have at least presumptively been reviewed by the Congress. 
    But I would suggest that this Court in Wesberry against Sanders answered the question as to whether any sort of congressional sanction of continued malapportionment of congressional districts or any other system could justify this Court's refusal to act where it found a violation of the equal protection of the law. 
    And I would suggest also that the very practicality of the situation of this provision never having been called into play. 
    We'd never focus anybody's attention in the State of Georgia on this provision or -- and otherwise, it probably would have been changed long before now or challenged long before now. 
    So, I would suggest that is certainly no ratification. 
    But on the other hand the fact that in 1868, every state elected its Governor and recognized the right of the people to participate in a far greater degree should be read as having some implications on this decision made by this Court in (Inaudible).

    Justice Byron R. White 
    Why?
speaker="emmet_j_bondurant_ii" startTime="7034.326" stopTime="7085.589">
    Mr. Emmet J. Bondurant, II 
    -- it was an extraordinary May-June session in the days of the malapportionment in the House before this Court's decision in Reynolds against Sims. 
    The General Assembly drafted a new Constitution which provided expressly for runoff elections in the fair beginning in 1966. 
    So it could be ratified in 1964 in the election code tracking the same language, having the same provisions in the same purposes said in broad language, “All public offices of the state should be elected by a majority vote and there shall be a runoff between the two candidates receiving the highest number of votes in the event no candidate receives a majority.” 
    The legislature was not trying to ignore the 1824 provision. 
    It was trying to correct it in a manner which we feel as far more consistent with the compliance --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="7085.589" stopTime="7098.860">
    Justice Byron R. White

    Mr. Emmet J. Bondurant, II 
    Having plenary power to propose amendments to the Constitution, I would suggest that the General Assembly chose to use that means rather the means which we have been forced to resort to in this litigation to delete the 1824 provision.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="7113.611" stopTime="7118.693">

    Mr. Emmet J. Bondurant, II 
    That is correct.

    Mr. Emmet J. Bondurant, II 
    The issue came here and this Court declined to advance hearing before the November 8, 1964 general election. 
    And following the November 8 general election, the plaintiffs in that case moved to dismiss the appeal as moot because there was no longer a need for an ongoing injunction and this Court remanded to the District Court not with disapproval I would suggest but for reconsideration as to the need of that continuing injunction. 
    The plaintiffs no longer ask for the injunction. 
    The District Court didn't find it necessary. 
    And it was accordingly vacated and unless and until we -- there has been no attempt to resubmit the same Constitution so the problem has not arisen.

    Mr. Emmet J. Bondurant, II 
    Ironically, that it happens to be the result that the General Assembly far more malapportioned than today has recognized more fully than perhaps others that the people should make this choice. 
    And they had -- did everything possible to enable the people to do so.

    Mr. Emmet J. Bondurant, II 
    If this provision is not eliminated Mr. Justice White, the legislature would not have the power to do so since an amendment could only be submitted at a two-year general election under state law. 
    So, unless this Court acts as did the District Court the legislative processes as in Georgia are helpless to remedy this situation. 
    If it should go to the General Assembly, the General Assembly will meet in effect as a committee of the whole or its own electoral college solely for the purpose of electing the Governor. 
    There would be no debate under the rules of the House, majority of each House is necessarily constitute a forum but as soon as that forum exists in the House as thus constituted they forthwith proceed to elect. 
    There would be no review after reapportionment. 
    This would carry until 1968.

speaker="emmet_j_bondurant_ii" startTime="7314.365" stopTime="7411.294">
    Mr. Emmet J. Bondurant, II 
    Frankly, I know of no explanation other than that seems to have been common in similar provisions of other State Constitutions which most of which provided for tie vote situations which never arose. 
    I think this was probably just arose -- copying from another provision. 
    The rules of the House provide for division of the House if the voice vote should be indeterminate. 
    But this isn't just simply not like the normal legislative process. 
    This is stopping the consequences of which cannot be remedied after we achieve fair apportionment. 
    I would suggest then in response to questions previously raised that although the General Assembly maybe -- have been approved both by the District Court and by this Court on a temporary basis for ordinary legislation. 
    The District Court was very emphatic in its language that the present plan of Senate apportionment in Georgia and this is the Court speaking in 1966 and the proposed plan of House reapportionments separately and collectively fall short of the mandate of Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. 
    The court below said that a 15% standard which they said within the circumstances of Georgia no departure beyond that could be justified. 
    More than half of our Districts in the House exceed 15%. 
    More than a third exceed 20%. 
    We have extremes of more than 40%, an extreme of more than 2 to 2.6 to 1 in the House. 
    So we're not talking about a minor situation in an election. 
    This is far more critical than in an ordinary legislative processes. 
    That's a one man, one vote here.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="7411.294" stopTime="7420.384">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    (Inaudible) that plan were the purposes of election of the 1966 collegium?
speaker="emmet_j_bondurant_ii" startTime="7420.384" stopTime="7509.191">
    Mr. Emmet J. Bondurant, II 
    I would say that the significance to that fact is that this Court under the circumstances which it then foresaw in recognizing its retained powers as the court of equity and that of the District Court. 
    In the event of changed circumstances to amend its order in any way if found necessary or appropriate but it was alright to approve on an interim basis for which we could then proceed which was ordinary legislation for two years, constitutional apportionment being achieved in 1968. 
    This will not be achieved if the General Assembly is now allowed to elect the Governor who will hold office until 1971. 
    Court of equity would have no power in modifying this decree if the circumstance is changed. 
    If a new Constitution were to be proposed, this Court has not disapproved that. 
    And if that occurred, we would expect someone to move in the District Court to ensure the right of people of the future to have an equal voice in these major decisions and that is one of these decisions before the Court today. 
    In conclusion, we express our appreciation for the opportunity of having this matter aired fully before this Court expeditiously. 
    The rights which we assert are first and foremost federally constituted rights. 
    The right of the people of a state to elect their Governor which we feel will be deprived unless the District Court's decision is affirmed.

    Mr. Harold N. Hill, Jr. 
    Yes. 
    The constitutional provision referred to by Mr. Justice Fortas that existed in Georgia prior to 1798 reminded me of the one that existed in Maine up until 1962 which was that if no candidate received a plurality of all the votes returned that the House of Representatives would choose two from the top four and send it to the Senate. 
    And the Senate would choose one of those two men to become the Governor and if the Senate tied and the President of the Senate would select the Governor that's one man, one vote.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="7589.585" stopTime="7594.449">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Well what if he can't make up his mind?
speaker="harold_n_hill_jr" startTime="7594.449" stopTime="7753.026">
    Mr. Harold N. Hill, Jr. 
    The situation with respect to tie votes I submit is not as remote or far off from this case as the appellees would like in May in 1962 out of over -- almost 300,000 votes casts the difference between the Republican and Democratic nominee for the office of Governor was only 483 votes. 
    In Rhode Island for the offices of Governor in 1962, the difference was only 398 votes. 
    In Minnesota, in 1962, the difference was only 91 votes. 
    In Texas in a senatorial election in 1948, the difference was only 87 votes and Georgia's experience has been that if a problem can arise it will arise. 
    The appellees -- Morris complained now of an alleged Republican crossover in the Democratic primary. 
    Now Georgia has open primaries, the Republicans could not vote in the runoff Democratic primary. 
    Any such question as that should have been raised not after the general election but after the primary but they used that now as the basis to seeking to avoid the November 8 general election to get a special election. 
    They say that the public was misled or there were news articles in the newspapers predicting the filing of these suits. 
    There were lawyers stating in the newspapers that the General Assembly could not elect the Governor. 
    The voters were not misled. 
    They just voted knowing that this case would be one day in this Court. 
    Where there is to be a special election followed by a runoff some voters are inclined to cast protest votes in the original election on the assumption that they will have another opportunity to make their votes count. 
    If a special elections were to be held in Georgia, prior experience to this year already indicates that no candidate would receive a majority and a runoff from that special election would be required. 
    And then we come to the problem of write-in a runoff which is what the appellees Morris -- they want a runoff but no write-ins.

    The Georgia general assembly must spend the money. 
    It will spend in the next appropriate shortly and budget a $1,600,000,000.00. 
    Now, this is -- that's more money than the Governor's worth maybe. 
    But they can spend that money eventhough they are -- haven't met the time table. 
    They have been approved on their apportionment as it exists now.

    Mr. Harold N. Hill, Jr. 
    We would think that a new Constitution could have been proposed. 
    We argued that it could have been proposed and I want to address myself to that because the court below has said that these cases bring into focus. 
    The question of gearing Georgia's Constitution to update its Federal Constitutional concepts and counsel for appellee justice has referred to this as being an antiquated Constitution from 1945. 
    He has indicated that had the 1964 Constitution been voted on then the voters would have had a runoff. 
    I would point out that it was my very good friend Mr. Bondurant counsel for justice, who prevented in that law suit Georgia from voting on the 64 Constitution. 
    And so Georgia has been in the intolerable position of not being able to vote on a new Constitution and having its own -- existing Constitution classified as adequate and updated.

    What is the difference in theory between this system that you're defending in the county unit system? 
    Suppose that the Constitution in Georgia provided in any event that the voters did not cast the majority of the votes for statewide office for a particular candidate? 
    Then the winner will be selected on the basis of a county unit vote tabulated in the form of county units, is it your contention that that would be valid? 
    Or then it would be under the Federal Constitution invalid?

    Mr. Harold N. Hill, Jr. 
    My immediate reaction to that would that it would invalid on the Gray versus Sanders because it is a waiting of the vote at some point arising out of the same election.

    Mr. Harold N. Hill, Jr.

    Well, in the question post it would be that the voter's vote and if there's no majority then you take those same votes and wait them on some sort of county unit basis and get the Governor out of that election.

    I suppose you counted alright, let's take that then. 
    Let's take a variant of it. 
    Let's suppose you counted the votes of the Georgia legislature, waited on the county basis which would be possible as practical matter. 
    Then were to say voters don't cast the majority votes for any particular candidate that then goes to the legislature. 
    The legislators vote as between the top two candidates. 
    The vote of the legislators is counted on a county unit system and waited in the accordance with the old Georgia system.

    We must have continuity in executive leadership that it's more important for us to have a Governor than to vote on him everytime.” 
    And in unusual circumstances where the Governor and Lieutenant Governor die or something of that type that we'd rather have a man exercise the responsibilities of the office of the Chief Executive even though he's the Speaker of the House was -- who was not elected by popular vote.

    So that when you view the legislature is acting in that capacity perhaps their answer to me is correct and you do run into the Gray against Sanders problem.

    Mr. Harold N. Hill, Jr. 
    Well, look at the situation, may it please the Court, we are in now. 
    A runoff is being asked for by the appellees' justice, a runoff not counting the write-in votes. 
    Now, if Gray versus Sanders applies to every election it must apply to runoff elections.And if Gray versus Sanders does not apply to every election as they suggested it does not, how can they argue that it applies to an election by the Georgia General Assembly? 
    If Gray does not require that counting of right in votes in a runoff election there is inequality in voting in that election. 
    A discounting of voting and the reason for its inapplicability in a runoff election is that a runoff is a separate stage of an election to which Gray is not applicable. 
    Now, if Gray does not apply to the separate runoff stage of the election, how can it be argued that Gray applies to the separate General Assembly stage of the election? 
    If we assume for a moment that Gray permits the discounting of runoff votes and as -- an election, we still have a problem with whether the Georgia Constitution permits the discounting of write-in votes in a runoff election. 
    On the other hand it could be contended that in its basic concept Gray prohibits the plurality system of election. 
    On the ground that where public officials are elected by a simple plurality vote. 
    Vote cast against the plurality winner which constitute a majority are unconstitutionally diluted. 
    So that if Gray be extended into this area and goes both ways it would undo the majority system of election and might at the same time undo the plurality system of election and we submit that its application is to the election --
