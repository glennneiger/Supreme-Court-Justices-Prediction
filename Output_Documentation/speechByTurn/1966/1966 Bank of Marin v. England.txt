    Mr. Edgar B. Washburn 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may the Court please. 
    The sole issue that is presented in this case is whether a bank which honors the checks of a depositor is to be held responsible to a trustee in bankruptcy or the depositor if the bank honored the checks after the depositor has filed a voluntary petition in bankruptcy and where the bank had no notice of the bankruptcy. 
    The facts of this matter are --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="57.206" stopTime="58.551">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    No notice and no knowledge.
speaker="edgar_b_washburn" startTime="58.551" stopTime="235.813">
    Mr. Edgar B. Washburn 
    No notice and no knowledge. 
    The facts are virtually undisputed. 
    Between August 27th and September 17th 1963, Marin Seafoods drew and delivered five checks on its commercial count with the Bank of Marin. 
    These checks were delivered to Eureka Fisheries. 
    On September 26th, 1963, Marin Seafoods filed a voluntary petition of bankruptcy in the District Court. 
    Four days later, John M. England was appointed receiver and on October 20th, 1963, he became the trustee. 
    On October 2nd, 1963, the checks which had previously been drawn and delivered were presented by Eureka Fisheries to the bank for payment. 
    As of this date, the bank had no notice and no knowledge for the bankruptcy. 
    There were sufficient funds on deposit. 
    The bank therefore honored the checks. 
    Subsequently, the trustee applied to the referee in bankruptcy for a turnover order. 
    The referee held that the bank and the payee of those checks were jointly responsible to the trustee for the amount of the checks. 
    Subsequently the payee paid the judgment and has now sought contribution against the bank. 
    After that occurred the bank petition for review in the District Court ultimately appealed to the Court of Appeals. 
    In the Court of Appeals, it was held that the lack of notice afforded no protection to the bank because of the wording of Section 70a and 70d of the Bankruptcy Act. 
    As the contention of the petitioner, Bank of Marin that the application of these two Sections of the Bankruptcy Act by the Court of the Appeals violates due process in two regards. 
    Firstly, it's requiring the bank who had previously satisfied its obligation to its depositor to satisfy this obligation without notice a second time. 
    As a part of that same contention is the second question is that the bank is being compelled to pay the same debt twice. 
    When the checks were originally presented for payment the bank was discharging its legal obligation to its depositor by honoring the checks. 
    If the bank is to be compelled to satisfy this obligation again to the trustee, we contend that the bank is in fact being compelled -- pay twice.

    Is your argument -- is only the (Inaudible)?
speaker="edgar_b_washburn" startTime="238.496" stopTime="319.251">
    Mr. Edgar B. Washburn 
    No Your Honor. 
    The -- in addition to our constitutional argument, we feel that the Bankruptcy Act can there -- very reasonably be construed to protect the bank and that this Court need not rule on the constitution argument. 
    We feel firstly that Section 70d(5), the last sentence in that particular Section which provides that nothing in this Title shall impair negotiability, or currency or negotiable instruments. 
    We feel that that particular provision forged the bank protection under the facts of this case. 
    There is very little that we could find that informed us as what Congress specifically intended when they enacted particular provision. 
    I think that reason dictates that Congress must have had in mind a drawee bank when their particular savings cost was enacted. 
    The drawee bank is the party that is most frequently going to be involved in the negotiation of checks or in the cashing of checks or negotiable instruments when bankruptcy is involved. 
    Secondly --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="319.251" stopTime="332.066">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Now, what you say strikes me as correct, as a matter of fact in -- that's the reason I'm surprised that there has not been a lot more case law development of this question, do you have any suggestions to why not?
speaker="edgar_b_washburn" startTime="332.066" stopTime="400.910">
    Mr. Edgar B. Washburn 
    I think as a practical manner Your Honor, what happened was that prior to 1959, there was a time period between the moment of the filing of a voluntary petition of bankruptcy in between -- in the ultimate adjudication. 
    Other provision to Section 70d would afford protection to a bank during that particular time period. 
    In 1959, the Act was amended so that adjudication became automatic upon the filing of a voluntary petition. 
    This was to affect more as a procedural change to relieve the District Court judges of the burden of having to pass on every single voluntary petition. 
    But it did have the effect of making adjudication automatic. 
    With that time period gone, there -- no longer was any time between bankruptcy and adjudication during which the banks could acquire notice and in the past as a practical manner, banks did get notice. 
    The trustee would phone them up. 
    They'd receive a letter and in fact they probably would have gotten notice in this situation such as this where ultimately the bank did get notice in the form of a letter from the trustee. 
    So I think that explains the reasons for the lack of litigation --
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="400.910" stopTime="404.286">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    It's only been seven years at that time like it hasn't existed?
speaker="edgar_b_washburn" startTime="404.286" stopTime="478.209">
    Mr. Edgar B. Washburn 
    Yes, and as pointed out by the amicus curie in this particular case, since this decision in the Ninth Circuit that the Bank of America has had six similar incidents and the Bank of Marin, I know is, has had one. 
    So that we feel that there is significant burden that's being placed on the banks by reasoning of this particular ruling. 
    Referring back again to the negotiability proviso of Section 70d(5), I think it is clear that the drawee bank was intended to be protected.If the drawee bank is not protected, there is virtually no one who is going to be. 
    The payee of a check generally will be either a preferred creditor or it will be a fraudulent transfer if the transfer occurs so close to bankruptcy that the checks are going to be presented afterwards. 
    Certainly, possibly other subsequent holders from the payee might be able to for protection. 
    But the two people that are most intimately involved are going to be most frequently involved would be the payee and the bank. 
    The payee as I mentioned probably won't be protected. 
    The bank by the decision of the Court of Appeals cannot be protected.

    Justice Abe Fortas 
    The payee did not join in this action?

    Mr. Edgar B. Washburn 
    I have no knowledge one way or the other. 
    I do know that the payee has informed us, they fully intend to pursue their contribution action against the bank.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="498.034" stopTime="509.820">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Well if we should decide this case in favor of the bank, would our holding necessarily also apply to the payee?
speaker="edgar_b_washburn" startTime="509.820" stopTime="536.691">
    Mr. Edgar B. Washburn 
    Possibly, I think as a matter of fact in this particular incident -- incidence, the payee here was a trade creditor and the delivery of the check to the payee was a preference. 
    And although this was not the basis for the referee's decision, I think that the payee would have to return the funds to the trustee in any event. 
    So I think that the decision of the court for protecting the bank would not necessarily mean that the payee would be left off --
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="536.691" stopTime="546.991">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Well, suppose take a case where the payee -- the payment to the payee would not have been practiced. 
    I supposed such a case is (Inaudible).
speaker="edgar_b_washburn" startTime="546.991" stopTime="553.335">
    Mr. Edgar B. Washburn 
    I would say in that instance Your Honor the payee also would receive protection.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="553.335" stopTime="569.119">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    That is to say, if he should hold here that the bank is protected on account of this payment if they did not have notice or knowledge and that would apply also to the payee?
speaker="edgar_b_washburn" startTime="569.119" stopTime="605.836">
    Mr. Edgar B. Washburn 
    I would say so Your Honor although there is -- I think, there is one distinction, banks are in the peculiar situation of dealing with deposits, dealing with vast numbers of checks everyday. 
    So that the burden that is placed upon a bank to keep itself advised is to whether or not a depositor, any given depositor has gone into bankruptcy is virtually impossible whereas an individual payee who is receiving a check from one person could conceivably in a great deal easier than the bank find out whether this particular person was the subject of bankruptcy.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="605.836" stopTime="614.982">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    That would really go to the likelihood -- the question whether the payee would have knowledge or not but it would not affect a legal principle involved.
speaker="edgar_b_washburn" startTime="614.982" stopTime="758.812">
    Mr. Edgar B. Washburn 
    I don't believe so Your Honor. 
    In addition to the negotiability proviso that I have just mentioned, I also appeal that the Bankruptcy Act is susceptible to affording protection to the bank on the basis of equity. 
    The Court of Appeals held that the numerous decisions of this Court and other lower courts that were handed prior to 1938 have no application here because Section 70d undertakes to set forth all of the transactions that are to be protected after the filing of a petition of bankruptcy. 
    The Court of Appeals also noted in another portion of their opinion that Section 70d in fact has no application to a voluntary bankruptcy because Section 70d applies only in the interval after the filing of a voluntary petition and before adjudication or before a receiver takes possession. 
    In the situation of a voluntary petition, there is no such interval so that is virtually impossible whether there ever be any instance when Section 70d can apply. 
    We agree with that particular interpretation of Section 70d except insofar as it relates to the negotiability proviso of Section 70d(5). 
    That proviso I think on its phase is not so limited in that it says that nothing in this Title shall impair instruments or currency. 
    And by this Title, it's referring to Title 11 of the U.S. Code which is the Bankruptcy Act in its entirety. 
    So we feel that 70(d) in that particular regard is not limited. 
    However as to the other provisions of Section 70d, it is our position that they have virtually no application in a sit -- in a voluntary bankruptcy. 
    There is therefore no specific provision in the Bankruptcy Act dealing with what transactions are to receive protection after the filing of a voluntary petition. 
    This stands --
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="758.812" stopTime="773.205">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Excuse me, it somewhat -- if in this case the payment to the payee would be a preference, would that defense may available to the bank in this contribution action?

speaker="edgar_b_washburn" startTime="789.496" stopTime="808.076">
    Mr. Edgar B. Washburn 
    Basically on the basis of California law which provides that when two parties are held jointly responsible to a third and one pays more than his half or his share, the one paying may seek contribution for the case of two parties, the other half from the --
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="808.076" stopTime="815.132">

    Yes, but that is -- centers a validity of the trustee's determination of the bank and the payee were liable.

speaker="edgar_b_washburn" startTime="818.085" stopTime="830.394">
    Mr. Edgar B. Washburn 
    That's correct. 
    However, if we are seeking to have that particular judgment reversed because of the fact, we don't feel that the bank should be responsible to the trustee in the first instance.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="830.394" stopTime="838.765">

    The record does not reflect when all of these various transactions took place. 
    In any event we do feel that the inconsistencies in Section 70d in effect remove any specific provision in the Bankruptcy Act in the case of a voluntary petition with respect to what transactions are going to receive protection. 
    This places the Act in essentially the same postures that was prior to 1938 when Section 70d was originally enacted. 
    As of that date, there were numerous cases which protected innocent third parties dealing with the bankrupt's property after the filing of a petition. 
    There were also a substantial number of cases which protected banks. 
    And we would urge the court that these cases can be considered and that the doctrine, the equitable doctrines that were put forth in this cases are our basis for interpreting the Act in the position favorable to the bank. 
    The specific cases dealing with banks protected the bank basically because it was virtually impossible for the bank to acquire a notice of the bankruptcy. 
    It was purely an equitable argument that -- it was stated that it would -- to put the burden on the bank of having to ascertain whether every depositor had or had not filed a petition of bankruptcy prior to honoring a check was impossible and unreasonable. 
    And therefore protection was afforded.

    I believe so Your Honor.

    Well, I wouldn't -- I wasn't assuming that you're going to moot your case and leave a stand. 
    But I was just wondering what interest the trustee in bankruptcy can have against the bank if the trustee is already been paid in full fault by the payee?

    Why in the real lawsuit needs to be tried, the other one between the bank and the payee?

speaker="edgar_b_washburn" startTime="1309.073" stopTime="1320.954">
    Mr. Edgar B. Washburn

    Mr. Edgar B. Washburn 
    But then the same question may arrive in a suit against the bank and the payee whether the trustee can be foreclosed against holding the bank responsible. 
    In other words, the bank's main contention is that you'd never be held responsible to the trustee in the first instance. 
    Now I doubt whether in a suit against the payee only whether the bank could alter the judgment holding it responsible or could affect the trustee's rights against the bank.

    Yes we have. 
    There is a monetary interest in the trustee in that respect.

   Argument of Thomas B. Donovan
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1658.111" stopTime="1660.649">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Donovan.
speaker="thomas_b_donovan" startTime="1660.649" stopTime="1806.945">
    Mr. Thomas B. Donovan 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    I'd like to begin by responding to the questions that were asked. 
    I think that first one that I should respond to is the question of contribution under California law. 
    I would take issue with the position taken by the petitioner in his reply brief in which he cites a number of cases which set forth the existence of a right to contribution in favor of a joint obligor under a judgment who has satisfied the judgment against other obligors on the judgment who have not paid any share of the judgment to the cases or the cases universally set forth the proposition is that the person seeking contribution is entitled to recover from the nonpaying obligor his proportionate share. 
    They don't say one half or a fractional share equal to the number of parties involved in the case. 
    They say his proportionate share. 
    And two the case cited by the petitioner, Davis against Heimbach involved a case where execution was issued without any showing whatsoever on the part of the paying judgment obligor seeking contribution. 
    It simply applied to the court for a writ of execution and it was granted. 
    That was reversed on the ground that there has to be a showing. 
    There has to be a notice and opportunity for a hearing before contribution can be issued against the nonpaying joint obligor on a judgment. 
    A second case illustrates this equally well, this was Starz (ph) against Fletcher where after a hearing the court issued a execution in favor of the party seeking contribution against the nonpaying party. 
    But the order contained no finding, no basis for a judicial conclusion that a contribution was required. 
    And again the appellate court found that you have to make some positive showing as to what the proportionate share of the nonpaying joint obligor on the judgment is.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1806.945" stopTime="1812.794">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    May I ask what is your interest in the outcome of the suit?
speaker="thomas_b_donovan" startTime="1812.794" stopTime="1857.572">
    Mr. Thomas B. Donovan 
    Well, I am here Your Honor for two reasons, one as an officer of this Court and as an officer of the bankruptcy court. 
    We began these proceedings by filing an application for turnover order against the Bank of Marin and against the Eureka Fisheries. 
    When we discovered the facts to be as they were the money of the bankrupt estate had been paid out after bankruptcy we examined the situation and found these two potential parties responsible. 
    In our view we filed an application and it resulted in the judgment that is now being reviewed and we feel an obligation to continue through to the end even though we've already received a full payment from Eureka Fisheries to see this case through to the end.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1857.572" stopTime="1863.567">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    In other words, you want some guidelines on how you shall act in the future?
speaker="thomas_b_donovan" startTime="1863.567" stopTime="1867.154">
    Mr. Thomas B. Donovan 
    Yes, that's the second half of it Mr. Chief Justice. 
    This case is --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1867.154" stopTime="1870.875">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    And that is advisory verdict revised with the judgment?
speaker="thomas_b_donovan" startTime="1870.875" stopTime="1902.507">
    Mr. Thomas B. Donovan 
    I do not believe sir, Your Honor for this reason I agree 100% with the court that there is nothing that we can gain by your decision in this case. 
    There is no case or controversy as far as the trustee is concerned except insofar we are responsible for cause in a hearing before this Court. 
    I agree with the petitioner however that this is the only place he can seek review. 
    He has --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1902.507" stopTime="1904.995">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well, now you're pleading for the petitioner?
speaker="thomas_b_donovan" startTime="1904.995" stopTime="1949.717">
    Mr. Thomas B. Donovan 
    No, I'm simply accepting his position as far as this -- your question goes. 
    If this Court does not rule on this question, the judgment holding the petitioner jointly liable to the trustee becomes final and that judgment cannot be reviewed in any other court. 
    Now if that happened, the Eureka -- now speaking hypothetically, Eureka Fisheries would file either an action or an application -- a notice or motion for the writ -- for the issuance of a writ of execution by a virtue of the California law of contribution. 
    In that proceeding --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1949.717" stopTime="1953.910">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    And that distresses as a trustee in bankruptcy?

    Mr. Thomas B. Donovan 
    No, that doesn't bother me a bit. 
    That that is -- that's why I say it's immaterial as far as we're concern. 
    What does concern me though is this, if this Court -- it would not concern me if this Court failed to rule. 
    But if this Court did rule, it would concern me very much if we didn't do the utmost to protect trustee's position in this in this case. 
    Because I believe the issue involved here is of fundamental importance in the administration of bankruptcy.

    We could have sued the officer of the Marin Seafoods who actually went out and collected this receivables, took them down, deposit it and -- and deposited them in the Bank of Marin after bankruptcy and then we could have gone after him because this was a fraud on the estate.

    The bank's cause of action against the payee Mr. Justice White is for -- as we point out in our brief, it's paid out money under a mistake of fact. 
    The payee as a result has been unjustly enriched because this -- at the time the money was paid out by the bank these were assets not of the bankrupt or not of the bank or not of the payee but these were assets of a bankrupt estate.

    Mr. Thomas B. Donovan 
    No, this is precisely why I believe that the Section 70d(5) provides that nothing in this Act shall impair the negotiability of currency or negotiable instrument. 
    Now the payee in the situation that you've described, is let's say a holder of a negotiable instrument. 
    He has no notice of any defense and he is holder in due course and here there is an intervening act, bankruptcy. 
    The question is, What are his rights? 
    Are they determined under bankruptcy law? 
    Are they determined under the law of negotiable instruments? 
    And we've got an -- a conflict here. 
    There are two very complex systems of law at work, one, bankruptcy, the other, the law of negotiable instrument. 
    The law in this case I believe although I have with my --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2286.811" stopTime="2288.976">

    Did they pay the holder in due course?
speaker="thomas_b_donovan" startTime="2288.976" stopTime="2319.993">
    Mr. Thomas B. Donovan 
    The payee would be a holder in due course and he would have -- he may be -- also the recipient of a preference, he may not be, that we do not know but if he is, he's going to have to pay back under the bankruptcy law even though under negotiable instrument law he's a holder in due course if he is not the recipient of a preference. 
    Let's assume he is not the recipient of a preference then he prevails because the transfer was not a preference under the bankruptcy law.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2319.993" stopTime="2323.202">

    And the bank must to pay two.
speaker="thomas_b_donovan" startTime="2323.202" stopTime="2385.389">
    Mr. Thomas B. Donovan 
    The bank has to pay for this reason Your Honor because at the time of bankruptcy these assets if we may speculate about what happened here and I think we have to. 
    These assets were not in the bank. 
    They were not in the hands of the payee. 
    They were not in the hands of the bankrupt. 
    They were in the hands of parties unknown who owed money to the bankrupt. 
    After bankruptcy the bankrupt went out to his creditors fraudulently told them, "I am here on behalf of Marin Seafoods." 
    He failed to disclose to them that Marin Seafoods was now a bankrupt. 
    He said, "You owe me $2300. 
    Pay me." 
    They paid. 
    He took the proceeds and he deposited them after bankruptcy in the Bank of Marin. 
    So these funds came into the bank after bankruptcy. 
    And is the statute is quite clear that no transfer after the date of bankruptcy shall be valid against the trustee.

    On Oct -- September 30th, 1963, John England was appointed as receiver and at that time examined the record in the bankruptcy court and he determined that there was a bank account in the Bank of Marin and he sent a notice dated October 2nd to the Bank of Marin.

    Mr. Thomas B. Donovan 
    Perhaps the answer -- I can answer your question but it will take a little while and perhaps I should I do so. 
    Prior to 1938, Section 70a of the Bankruptcy Act provided that as of the date of adjudication, the trustee shall be vested with title to the bankrupt assets. 
    Now this rule, this statutory rule that has been on the books for many years resulted in two difficulties both of which the court attempted to deal with. 
    Number one, there was this difficulty, bankruptcy normally means that as of the date of a filing of a bankruptcy petition, the bankrupt is dead as far as its assets go. 
    He has -- he is able to begin a new life free from his obligation, the proceeded bankrupt in large part. 
    He has a fixed cutoff date for this. 
    Now in return, his creditor's rights are fixed as of the date he files his petition and if he has assets of whatever kind but are not exempt then those creditors have rights which are determined under the Bankruptcy Act to a ratable distribution of all the bankrupt's pre-bankruptcy assets. 
    This gets into the law of preference and the law of fraudulent conveyances and it gets into the laws of exemptions but notwithstanding that the bankrupt is free as of that date from certain of his obligations, his creditor's rights are established as of that date to a certain of his asset. 
    Now this privilege date is a fund -- as fundamental to bankruptcy law as the date of debtors to probate while you just have to have a --

    (Voice Overlap) I'm just saying that in the normal bankruptcy, doesn't it -- that the -- when there's any aspects revealed, what happens about loading, you know that paper notice to the first meeting of creditors, you know that.

    No and that is exactly why the notice requirement is so difficult because if the bank was free to do as it thought proper with this assets regardless of bankruptcy --

    Yes, in a case where there is not a receiver, I supposed the notice would come from a trustee for the trustee is charged with collecting the assets to bankrupt and as soon as he deployed it, his jobs to go and make sure that the assets are preserved. 
    That's where he gets the notice?

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    It seems to me that this -- the same would happen numerous time throughout the country every year. 
    There must be some practice in the banking world and then under the bankruptcy laws throughout the country, what has been the experience in this situation?
speaker="thomas_b_donovan" startTime="3045.066" stopTime="3054.821">
    Mr. Thomas B. Donovan 
    Well, again Mr. Chief Justice, my personal experience in this area is so limited that I hesitate to tell you because I'm so uncertain of my own background.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3054.821" stopTime="3055.203">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Yes.
speaker="thomas_b_donovan" startTime="3055.203" stopTime="3086.488">
    Mr. Thomas B. Donovan 
    But -- I would say that the normal human reaction when one learns that one has asset or one is a fiduciary and one board has assets is to reduce those assets to possession and control. 
    And that simply what the receiver is doing here. 
    He is not filing a notice because it's necessary to establish his right. 
    He is doing so as a practical matter to eliminate the confusion that's going to result when he does try to reduce these assets to possession.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3086.488" stopTime="3108.231">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    But what I would like to ask you is this, assume that you are successful in this lawsuit, how would the bank protect itself against these kinds of laws where its acting in good faith, has no knowledge of any kind and is honoring the checks of his deposit, how would it protect itself?
speaker="thomas_b_donovan" startTime="3108.231" stopTime="3147.891">
    Mr. Thomas B. Donovan 
    It's a very difficult question. 
    Congress has considered this question and its solution has been Section 70d and if it -- came up with a different solution. 
    If it said the bank is entitled to pay until it receives notice of bankruptcy, then you've protected banks but on the other hand you've left all the creditors unprotected. 
    You've left the receiver unprotected. 
    Until he can actually find out who has the assets and communicate word notice of the bankruptcy from himself to the person in possession.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3147.891" stopTime="3176.911">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    I wouldn't think that would follow. 
    I think the most you could say would be that the trustee in bankruptcy would have a better chance to get the money from the bank that he would for the -- from the payee. 
    But the payee certainly could be held liable if he receive money that he shouldn't have received under the bankruptcy laws but this way the bank has to pay twice.
speaker="thomas_b_donovan" startTime="3176.911" stopTime="3211.683">
    Mr. Thomas B. Donovan 
    But the bank does not pay the same obligation twice. 
    That's why this is not a (Inaudible) case a Harris case or a Western -- the Pennsylvania Western Union case because the bank -- the first time it paid was paying under a mistake of fact. 
    In fact, it had no right to pay pursuant to the drawer's order. 
    It had only the right to pay to the trustee.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3211.683" stopTime="3218.360">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    So you -- so your answer to Chief Justice is that -- well the -- what protects the bank if the bank can get the money from the payee?
speaker="thomas_b_donovan" startTime="3218.360" stopTime="3225.253">
    Mr. Thomas B. Donovan 
    Well, this is the cost of banking, yes. 
    The bank also has a remedy against third parties.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3225.253" stopTime="3230.865">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Oh, I think if you -- I think the bank could have a tough time to get that money back from the payee and take this for the payee, as this is the preference.
speaker="thomas_b_donovan" startTime="3230.865" stopTime="3358.580">
    Mr. Thomas B. Donovan 
    But the -- it may have Your Honor, but Congress -- number one, we're dealing with the statutory rule here and the legislative history demonstrate very clearly that Congress was concerned with the rights of these two groups of people, innocent third parties dealing after bankruptcy and I'm the first to admit that they are innocent acting in good faith. 
    But it's also concerned with the rights of the creditors of the bankrupt who after all who -- rights to collect that money is being discharge in many cases. 
    And it's protecting their right to a ratable share of the bankrupt's assets. 
    Now, when Congress wrote this role, petitioner suggested that you have to imply notice to give -- to protect the bank in this situation and he suggest it perhaps constitutionally you have to imply notice. 
    Well, I would suggest that if you imply notice to Section 70d, you render the Section completely meaningless because the whole crux of the Section is that good parties dealing after bankruptcy with the assets of bankrupt estate are protected only until adjudication or until a receiver takes possession and here we have adjudication before the transfer. 
    If notice could be implied why then did Congress write in Section 70d (3) which says that in any case when a party has actual notice, its shall always be deemed not to be acting in good faith. 
    Congress knew -- thought about this good faith part, it thought about the lack of notice and it decided notwithstanding that that the policy in favor of preserving intact assets of bankrupt estates at a date which could be manageably administered without a great deal of litigation and discussion and factual examination of when one party receive notice and when another party receive note. 
    It decided that you have to have a firm cut update except in the limited circumstances where there is a transfer after bankruptcy but before adjudication.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3358.580" stopTime="3373.898">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    I suppose if a -- I suppose if you lose this case, anybody inside the bankrupt company with some assets, and with a bank account, could write a check on that bank account to a print.
speaker="thomas_b_donovan" startTime="3373.898" stopTime="3375.406">
    Mr. Thomas B. Donovan 
    It would contribute --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3375.406" stopTime="3386.616">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    And the print could get it in (Inaudible) and if the bank isn't liable, nobody is?
speaker="thomas_b_donovan" startTime="3386.616" stopTime="3428.042">
    Mr. Thomas B. Donovan 
    If we lose this case Your Honor, we would be -- the trustee generally would be subject to a new area of fraud that now is precluded. 
    This was -- we got in here to the Massey decision which we cite in our brief, a decision of this Court in 1904 which does not deal with an issue before this Court. 
    But after that decision was rendered, James McLaughlin who wrote the Chandler Act in the same article in the Chicago Law Review which I have referred to in my brief, some, they criticized that decision because of this very factor that it contributes to fraud. 
    It leaves open an area --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3428.042" stopTime="3430.598">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    I don't see it will stop the fraud.
speaker="thomas_b_donovan" startTime="3430.598" stopTime="3430.836">
    Mr. Thomas B. Donovan 
    Because its --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3430.836" stopTime="3437.755">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    It won't stop the fraud but it -- all it means is that the -- instead of the bankruptcy estate taking the loss, the bank will take it. 
    And so --
speaker="thomas_b_donovan" startTime="3437.755" stopTime="3473.134">
    Mr. Thomas B. Donovan 
    No, it means instead of having a firm cutoff date, instead of having an established date to which the trustee and courts can refer. 
    You have a flexible date that depends partly on the facts given to the receiver of the trustee by third parties partly on his ability to communicate if in this interim period there is an opportunity for disposition of the assets does not exist if you have a firm rule that no transfers after bankruptcy are valid.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Mr. Donovan in this case all these checks were drawn on the bank and delivered to the payee prior to the date of bankruptcy, weren't they?

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    I think there is or could validly be any distinction between this kind of a case and the case where checks were fraudulently drawn and delivered after bankruptcy because after bankruptcy the bankrupt himself wouldn't have or any of its officers, if corporation wouldn't have any power to draw checks, only the trustee would have, isn't that right?

    Mr. Thomas B. Donovan

    Mr. Thomas B. Donovan 
    But as far as we know the checks were worthless at that time and the only thing that made them worth the paper they are written on was the fact that after bankruptcy the bankrupt collected accounts receivable and deposited the proceeds in his bank account.

    Yes Your Honor except also in this respect, to get into the question of fraudulent conveyances and here we're not concern with the good faith or lack of good faith or the fraudulent intent of the party against liability is asserted but we're simple concerned with the fact that here where assets of a bankrupt estate which were transferred after bankruptcy and under Section 70, the language is crystal clear that no transfer after the date of bankruptcy shall be valid against the trustee.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3589.157" stopTime="3596.441">
    Justice Byron R. White
