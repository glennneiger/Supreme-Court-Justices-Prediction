    Mr. Charles R. Maloney 
    Yes. 
    This is a death case. 
    This is a death case involving a longshoreman employed by Lykes Brothers Steamship Company Inc. Lykes Brothers is a steamship operator that acted as a stevedore, acted as a ship owner and acted as a ship operator, the primary purpose instead of a ship operator and a ship owner. 
    Stevedoring is only secondary ancillary to their operation of the ships. 
    They have approximately 45 ships that they operate. 
    Luther Jackson was a longshoreman; he was employed to board one of the vessels owned and operated by Lykes. 
    He was employed direct by Lykes. 
    In the course of this employment, he was caused to inhale fumes from insecticide which ultimately cause or contributed to his death. 
    No proceedings were had in this case before the U.S. Deputy Commissioner. 
    There's no award here, there is no compensation payments, there is no voluntary or involuntary payments of compensation under the Deputy Commissioner proceedings. 
    There have been no proceedings before the Deputy Commissioner. 
    The first proceeding was in the Civil District Court for the State of Louisiana, the Civil District Court for the Parish of Orleans. 
    This is a state court. 
    This is a state court forum. 
    Suit was filed in a state court forum on the four basic counts. 
    Number one, under the Jones Act; number two, under the General Maritime Law has supplemented by our survivorship and wrongful death statute 2315; and number three, on the Louisiana tort; number four, in Louisiana workmen's compensation.

    Is there any question in this case that if there had not been a death involved that you would have had a maritime cause of action for negligence?

    Mr. Charles R. Maloney 
    No sir.

    Mr. Charles R. Maloney 
    No sir. 
    In Robinson versus Lykes there was no death and this judgment of Jackson versus Lykes is based on Robinson versus Lykes. 
    In Robinson versus Lykes, Rufus Robinson was a live longshoreman, but they denied the right of action and the cause of action in General Maritime Law under Rufus Robinson versus Lykes on the basis of the fact that 905, Section 905 of the Longshoremen Harbor Workers Act excluded such right. 
    And they were to based it on (Voice Overlap) --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="212.683" stopTime="219.957">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, that -- that they said that against that particular employer, the Longshoremen's Act was exclusive. 
    That was the basis for that?

    Mr. Charles R. Maloney 
    If he had been a member of the crew, they said he would have had a Jones Act but we contend that there was a question of fact in the salute to judge --

    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, what if -- if the owner of the vessel here had not been the stevedore, let's assume it is an ordinary owner, it wasn't a stevedore also. 
    And then a longshoreman is injured on the vessel, he had a maritime cause of action for negligence?
speaker="charles_r_maloney" startTime="256.402" stopTime="272.748">
    Mr. Charles R. Maloney 
    If it would have been a non-Lykes employee, I would imagine that the state court would have granted him a right in cause of action on the General Maritime Law. 
    Since we file so few of these suits over in state court, I really can't tell you -- tell you exactly what it would be if it were put to issue.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="272.748" stopTime="277.774">

    Justice Byron R. White 
    I understand that.
speaker="charles_r_maloney" startTime="303.130" stopTime="323.164">
    Mr. Charles R. Maloney 
    -- in this case this comes within the scope of Yaka versus Reed or Reed versus Yaka, so we have a problem with reference to negligence. 
    And we don't know exactly whether or not we can have a cause of action if the mate or the master, or one of the regular bosons or ABs or members of the crew had caused or created an unsafe condition.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="323.164" stopTime="323.531">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Yes.
speaker="charles_r_maloney" startTime="323.531" stopTime="673.827">
    Mr. Charles R. Maloney 
    We don't know where we stand on that. 
    We assume that the courts will make a dichotomy between the negligence of a regular member of the crew and give us a cause of action. 
    They generally throw us out on the basis that a fellow longshoreman has created the unseaworthy condition or that he has caused the negligent act that injured him. 
    But I think that what we have right here is that we've been denied before we even presented any facts. 
    We've been denied on a summary judgment. 
    We've been thrown out right at the very beginning stating that we have no right of action, no cause of action for a claim under the Jones Act, for a claim under General Maritime Law. 
    I'm not going to bring up Louisiana Tort Law because that's not the basis for this appeal or I won't bring up Louisiana Workmen's Comp, that's not basis of this appeal. 
    I would just confine myself to the Jones Act and to General Maritime Law. 
    Before -- Judge Carey in the Civil District Court, it was urged that whether or not Luther Jackson was a member of the crew, is a question of fact. 
    It's a question of fact for the jury to decide, that he had no authority to make that decision which based on the various cases that you don't take the mere name that this is a Longshoremen Act, he is a longshoreman than he's automatically as matter of law within the scope of the Longshoreman Act just like a railroad employee, if he was a brakeman, he isn't automatically within the scope of FELA. 
    He may come under the Longshoremen Act if he's over navigable waters and he may be a member of the crew if he has aboard a vessel. 
    I contented before Judge Carey that it was a question of fact for the jury to decide. 
    And he felt that was a matter of absolute law that he couldn't be a member of the crew, that he had to be a longshoreman within the scope of the Longshoremen's Harbor Workers' Act. 
    My second argument to Judge Carey was that conceding -- that you assumed he's a member -- that he cannot be a member of the crew. 
    Then, I have a General Maritime Law claim for my client. 
    And he has a claim based on the warrant of seaworthi -- seaworthiness pursuant to Reed versus Yaka. 
    His position was that Section 905 of the Longshoremen Harbor Worker Act precluded any claim whatsoever against Lykes Brothers on the General Maritime Law. 
    His position was that this was the same problem that he had handled in Ellis versus Travelers and in Stepter versus T. Smith. 
    If you go back to the Robinson case, you'll find that there is a quote of at least one of those cases in the Robinson versus Lykes case. 
    And he based his decision on the Robinson versus Lykes decision that the only remedy that the weather had was pursuant to Longshoremen Harbor Workers' Act. 
    My position to the judge was, that he was making in the determination under the Longshoremen and Harbor Workers' Act that this particular employee was an employee within the meaning of the Act and that he was making the determination as a matter of law. 
    He couldn't be a seaman. 
    He was making the determination as a matter of law that he had to be a longshoreman and even though he was making this determination, he was excluding the ruling or the holding at least to the spirit of Reed versus Yaka. 
    Well, I lost in the lower court. 
    So we went up to Court of Appeals. 
    All these same points were urged and that under the Jones Act, it was a question of fact for the jury to determine that it would not be as a matter of law he was a longshoreman. 
    It had -- it was a question of fact that had to be determined by the Deputy Commissioner, since the Deputy Commissioner had made no determination it was moot. 
    And in this case before the Court of Appeals, their opinion was there are all questions which included the Louisiana Tort and Louisiana Workmen's Comp. 
    All the questions resolved themselves to one point, 33 U.S.C. 905 the Exclusive Remedy Clause. 
    And their position was that the Exclusive Remedy Clause of the Longshoremen Harbor Workers' Act excluded this man from being a member of the crew, excluded this man from having any rights under General Maritime Law or his widow and precluded any claim under Louisiana Tort or Workmen's Comp. 
    An appeal was taken to the Louisiana Supreme Court and a writ was applied for. 
    The writ was denied, two justices dissented. 
    The two justices were Saunders and Samuel. 
    And they were the same ones who dissented in Robinson versus Lykes and for basically the same reason that they dissented in Robertson versus Lykes. 
    And now I'm before this Court urging the same thing, I'm urging that Mrs. Jackson has a right to bring this case before the jury, for the jury to determine whether or not her husband was a member of the crew. 
    I'm not asking you to agree that she -- that her husband was a member the crew, I'm just asking for the right to bring this to the jury to let them make the determination.

    Justice Byron R. White 
    Your -- let's assume that you were right, assume you're right on the fact that the Harbor Workers' Act does not bar you from seeking some kind of a relief, some kind of other relief, do you rely on both the Jones Act and General Maritime Law?

    Mr. Charles R. Maloney

    Mr. Charles R. Maloney 
    Our state -- that statute is a very broad death statute. 
    I quoted it in my brief. 
    And it would be my position that this death statute gives more than General Maritime Law would give because we have a civil law here, and we have other statute besides 2315. 
    We have 667, we have 617, we have 2322, 2317. 
    We have a number of state statutes. 
    All of these statutes or survive under 2315.

    Mr. Charles R. Maloney 
    My position would be that the state law is only a vehicle -- is only a vehicle to give him a right on the gen -- give the widow a right under General Maritime Law.

    Justice Byron R. White

speaker="charles_r_maloney" startTime="817.846" stopTime="834.319">
    Mr. Charles R. Maloney 
    Well, I don't say overruling, because I also feel that the 2315 statute of State of Louisiana is broad enough to include General Maritime Law. 
    This comes from a French Napoleonic Code.

    He really never considered this here a problem of Tungus.

    Ellis and Stepter were a conflict between state compensation and federal compensation. 
    And that went back to the Richard's decision. 
    In the Richard's decision, they would allow you to go into federal court. 
    And seek that workman's compensation in the federal court $70.00 a week.

   Argument of Benjamin W. Yancey
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1291.636" stopTime="1299.369">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Very well said. 
    Mr. Yancey.
speaker="benjamin_w_yancey" startTime="1299.369" stopTime="1405.480">
    Mr. Benjamin W. Yancey 
    Mr. Chief Justice, if the Court please. 
    The real nub of this case is the exclusive feature of the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act. 
    This is the first case before this Court where there has been an effort to fix personal liability for damages for negligence on the employer in a longshoreman's case. 
    Now, the original petition that is the complaint below is specifically predicated upon negligence. 
    It alleges that Lykes failed to do certain specific things which brought about the death of the decedent. 
    The first allegation in the petition was that the decedent was a longshoreman engaged in the cargo operations of the vessel. 
    Having alleged that the decedent was a longshoreman engaged in the operation of the vessel and then having specified the negligence, the first claim is made under the Jones Act. 
    Then it claims under the General Maritime Law then it claims under the Louisiana death statute. 
    All cumulatively nothing alternatively and then serves a copy of the petition on the United State Deputy Compensation Commissioner to preserve the rights under the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act. 
    And finally, claims under the Louisiana Workmen's Compensation Act. 
    Now to this, we filed exceptions.

    Early complaint did also overt that the decedent was a member of the crew?

    Mr. Benjamin W. Yancey 
    Yes sir I included, I meant to include that when said it claimed under the Jones Act. 
    Because in order to claim under the Jones Act, he had to allege that he was a member of the crew.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="1417.992" stopTime="1421.675">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Well, then you say did make the necessarily allegation?
speaker="benjamin_w_yancey" startTime="1421.675" stopTime="1510.559">
    Mr. Benjamin W. Yancey 
    Right. 
    Now, to this cumulative package of claims, we filed exceptions. 
    First, that the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act was the exclusive remedy for the widow of this longshoreman. 
    Second, as to the Jones Act that the Jones Act itself as the Court well knows vests the cause of action in the personal representative of the decedent and under Louisiana law and under federal law, the widow has no standing in Court to pursue any right under the Jones Act. 
    The person in whom the Jones Act vests the cause of action is a duly qualified administratrix or executrix of the decedent's estate. 
    That vital lack in this petition, this original petition was called to the attention of our friend illuminate and then never has been any attempt to correct that. 
    Although under Louisiana practice, any defect of that time brought to the Court's attention can be the subject to proofing of amendment. 
    There's never been any offer of proof and then never any offer of amendment. 
    So that when my friend stands in the highest court in this land urging the Jones Act he has no right to stand in this Court.

    Now --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1614.880" stopTime="1618.908">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    But his right against his employer would the -- it's been exclusively under the Harbor Workers of Longshoremen's Act?
speaker="benjamin_w_yancey" startTime="1618.908" stopTime="1971.051">
    Mr. Benjamin W. Yancey 
    Precisely, that is the (Voice Overlap) exact point of the case. 
    Now, I don't want to launch into any extended history but as Your Honors know, this whole thing flows from the Jensen case where in 1917 a longshoreman employed as in this case by the ship owner, they attempted to avail himself if he was killed incidentally, his widow attempting to avail herself of the New York Compensation Act. 
    And in Jensen, this Court held that the uniformity of the maritime law required rather prevented the application of individual Compensation Acts of the various states. 
    After two efforts by Congress to relegate the questions of the states, this Court in the Grand Smith case strongly headed to Congress to the thing they do for longshoreman was to pass a Longshoremen's Act. 
    Congress did not act immediately but in 1926, this Court held in the Haverty case that a longshoreman was a seaman as against his employer and was entitled to the rights under the Jones Act. 
    Congress then and there in 1927 passed the Longshoremen's Act to correct the decision of the Haverty case and to give longshoreman the very character of employee which we have here. 
    Give the longshoreman a carefully thought out compensation plan that has been held constitutional. 
    And it's been the subject of some litigation in this Court. 
    The Longshoremen's Act covers two situations. 
    It carefully preserves the injured employee's rights against their bodies. 
    And as against the employer, it makes the provisions of the Act exclusive. 
    Exclusive of all other liability whether in admirality or at law. 
    Now, in Sieracki, this Court held that the longshoreman injured by unseaworthiness of a third party's vessel had the same warranty of seaworthiness as a seaman had and could recover damages. 
    Then Ryan comes along and Ryan recovers from the steamship owner a typical third party situation. 
    And the ship owner impleads the stevedore employer because the stevedore's negligence had brought about the unseaworthy condition which had cast the ship owner in damages. 
    The majority of the Court held in Ryan that there was an implied warranty of workmanlike performance running between the stevedore employer on the one hand and the ship owner on the other. 
    It was a strong defense and the principal thing which concerned the dissenters was that this implied indemnity which the Court found running between the stevedore employer and the ship owner warranty of workmanlike performance was a violation of Section 5. 
    Then comes Yaka, in fact that's why we're here, Yaka. 
    Yaka was a suite by a longshoreman against a vessel in rem, vessel not owned by his employer but bareboat chartered to his employer under a bareboat charter which contained and expressed indemnity of the charterer and of the ship owner by the charterer for anything arising in the operation of the ship. 
    It had been emphasized in the dissent in Ryan that if there had been an expressed indemnity in Ryan, the dissenters would have gone along with the majority with what the dissenters objected to, was this implying of a warrant. 
    Now, in the District Court in Yaka, there was a decree in rem against the shipment and there was a decree over against the bareboat charterer's stevedore employer under the express indemnity. 
    When that case got to the Third Circuit the arguments went allover the place. 
    When the case came to this Court although the indemnity, the real basis on which the case was decided, the indemnity was mentioned, it was more or less lost cite of and the case was decided in this Court on more general grounds. 
    But there is absolutely nothing in Yaka and I want to say this as strongly and as sincerely as I can. 
    There is absolutely nothing in the facts of Yaka which justify this longshoreman's widow suing her decedent employer direct in the face of that exclusive provisions of the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act.

    No sir.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2034.750" stopTime="2035.528">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    What case is that?
speaker="benjamin_w_yancey" startTime="2035.528" stopTime="2375.770">
    Mr. Benjamin W. Yancey 
    That is a case of a Babin, B-A-B-I-N versus Lykes the citation of which I do not have but I can get for you if you want in the Court of Appeals for the Parish of Orleans -- the Court of Appeals for the Parish of Orleans. 
    This position of that point in this Court is that the Louisiana courts have not in fact passed upon that question and under Tungus, it is their province to pass upon it and in this particular litigation they didn't reach it because they felt that the exclusive provisions of the Section 5 bother from going any further. 
    Now, I want to say in a few words that if the position of my friend is maintained in this Court that Section 5 of the Longshoreman's Act doesn't mean what it says and that a longshoreman is free to sue his ship owner, operator, stevedore employer for damages. 
    And of course the constitutionality of the Act is immediately cast into doubt. 
    The basis on which the Longshoremen's Act, all Compensation Acts have been held to be constitutional is the quid pro quo. 
    The employer gives up defenses. 
    The employer is liable without fault for stated amounts. 
    The employee gives up the right to sue but he in return back, he gets a fix amount. 
    In other words as the courts have said many, many times it was a quid pro quo. 
    And with no intention to be anything but deadly serious, what my friend is suggesting here is that Congress having given him the quid. 
    Now, this case should -- this Court should give him the quo, and leave the employer with absolutely nothing under this Act. 
    And aside from the unconstitutionality of this position, I'm impressed by the fact that the position makes absolutely meaningless. 
    The third party provisions contained in Section 33 of the Act, Congress envisioned -- envisaged the right to sue a third party and preserving that provided that if the employer pursues that right against the third party, the employer must account to the employee for anything over the recovery after reasonable attorney's fees. 
    If the employee pursues the rights against the third party then if he settles without the employer's permission, in other words, protecting the employer's right in the suit against the third party then, the right to further compensation is lost. 
    Now, of course this position makes hash of those provisions. 
    We can't sue ourselves. 
    The position really is that we are liable without fault under the Longshoremen's Act. 
    We are liable without fault for unseaworthiness. 
    We are liable with fault for negligence and incidentally I reiterate this suite is based on negligence and we are liable under the Jones Act. 
    Of course, if the Court please, that the -- well, my real point is that the Longshoreman and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act is as between employer and employee exclusive and incidentally but a congressional intent. 
    Before I sit down, there've been one or two remarks in decisions by this Court about congressional intent. 
    In 1959, I mentioned that it in the brief, after this Court had decided Sieracki, after this Court had decided Ryan, the provisions of Section 33 for the third party practice were amended and liberalized and in the Senate report with the whole background to Sieracki and Ryan before it, in the Senate report, the reporters reiterate the exclusive feature of the Longshoremen's Act as between employer and employee. 
    One final word, there's an effort to split our personality into ship owner, stevedore employer that if the Court please in my humble judgment won't wash. 
    When the Longshoremen's Act was passed in 1927, it was known, as Jensen explained, it was known that many ship owners did their own stevedoring, so that the Longshoremen's Act was passed in 1927 with this situation in focus. 
    Thank you, sir.

    In Louisiana pleadings, Article 1115 of our code -- excuse me 1151 and 1153 of our code of procedure allows you to amend pleadings prior to answer or after answer by leave of court and any amendment goes back to the date of the original filling and likewise if our pleadings are defective with reference to qualifications of a personal representative, the proper court was the same court we were in to qualify her as an administratrix, if that had to be, if that's what they would have required, we could've qualified the rest. 
    She's the sole surviving wife that there is no other wife, she's a lawful marriage. 
    There are no descendent children. 
    There are no mothers or fathers involved. 
    She is the only one who was involved. 
    She could have qualified under any test as the personal representative. 
    Any method or manner that they wanted us to fix it up, we could have fix it, amended the pleadings and go back to the date of the original filling. 
    The case that was cited by Mr. Yancey in his brief, go to a trial, jury trials, judgments. 
    There's been no jury trial, there has been no judgment. 
    If this is reverted back to the District Court I can still amend my pleadings. 
    If my pleadings had effect --

    Well, is this correct that -- I gather the point that the -- that Mr. Yancey makes is that under Jones Act you have not -- they're properly pleaded a Jones Act claim because that will be pleaded in the death case only by a personal representative that Louisiana practices as I understood requires an allegation that indeed she is by virtue of appointment by such and such a court a personal representative and that although you knew this all along you'd never made an effort to qualify it.

    Mr. Charles R. Maloney 
    No. 
    No sir. 
    We don't -- we have very few Jones Act cases in Louisiana courts. 
    The Louisiana courts are not familiar with Jones Act cases, and we have no body of law built up with reference to what it is a personal representative. 
    There maybe some vague references to them in some of the cases. 
    We don't have any great body but we do have a liberal pleading as far as amendments that you can have amend your pleadings and go back. 
    And we have a case specifically that was even reviewed by this Court. 
    So --

    Lanis versus Illinois Central Railroad Company. 
    This goes back in 1960, 140 Louisiana 1, 72 Southern 788. 
    It was a reviewed by this Court, 38 Supreme Court, 334, 246 U.S. 652. 
    In this particular case the widow sued under a state statute. 
    This is a F-E-L-A case and they allowed her, she stood in her own name and he allowed her to go back and amend her pleadings and come in as an administratrix. 
    They allowed that in federal court, they allowed that in state court.

    The Longshoremen's case?
speaker="charles_r_maloney" startTime="2606.908" stopTime="2735.006">
    Mr. Charles R. Maloney 
    -- on 905. 
    Every -- in 905 throughout everything that's it. 
    Or every question that was presented to him was thrown out at the exclusion cause on 905. 
    And that was the reason for everything, and that's why we're up here. 
    I'd like to say one -- I don't want go into the history of these. 
    But the Haverty case brought about the 1927 Amendment for the Longshoremen and Harbor Workers' Act. 
    But it wasn't to correct false in the Haverty case. 
    It was to correct lapse in the Haverty case. 
    The Haverty case would only apply to longshoremen who were employed direct as Luther Jackson was. 
    The great mass of longshoremen, at that time, was employed by independent contractors. 
    Therefore, the Jones Act was not available for them. 
    The Jones Act was no remedy for the great mass of a longshoreman at the time of Haverty. 
    It was satisfaction to the longshoreman in Haverty to be able to come to make a claim but not -- for all the other ones. 
    So the 1927 Act for longshoreman corrected this and gave remedies to enlarge not to restrict. 
    Mr. Yancey would argue that the idea of the Longshoreman and Harbor Workers' Act was to restrict, that I disagree. 
    The Babin case, he mentioned, was not a case of unseaworthiness. 
    The attorneys for both sides, plaintiff and defendant agreed that there was no unseaworthiness. 
    I don't agree with their interpretation, but the attorneys by agreement and the court, all parties agreed there was no unseaworthiness involved. 
    So they tried it on negligence. 
    Therefore it wouldn't stand for the proposition we have before us here. 
    Judge Putnam is an ex-state court judge. 
    He is now a federal court judge his opinion should be read. 
    And there's also the article that he refers to by (Inaudible) should be read in it. 
    That's all I have to say, Your Honor.
