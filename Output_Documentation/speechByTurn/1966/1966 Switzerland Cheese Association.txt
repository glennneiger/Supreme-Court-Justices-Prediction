Switzerland Cheese Association, Inc. v. E. Horne's Market, Inc.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Number 42, Switzerland Cheese Association, Incorporated et al., petitioners versus E. Horne's Market, Incorporated. 
    Mr. Toren.
speaker="david_toren" startTime="31.976" stopTime="364.336">
    Mr. David Toren 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    The issue before the Court is a jurisdictional one that has long vexed the Court of Appeals and has caused to deter the event. 
    It reaches the Court on certiorari to the First Circuit and involves interpretation of that section of the judicial code which states and I quote, “the Courts of Appeal shall have jurisdiction of appeal from interlocutory orders of the District Court refusing injunction.” 
    The question here is whether this language authorizes an appeal from an interlocutory order which refused a permanent injunction prayed for in a motion for summary judgment. 
    The language of the statute is plain, simple and unconditional in authorizing appeals from refusals of injunction for all purposes. 
    We therefore urge the Court to answer the Court in the affirmative. 
    We do not prevent the issue as an abstract proposition but rather in the context of a cause in regard to which the refusal of the injunction has a far reaching and drastic effect on the business and rights of these petitioners. 
    Petitioners are the exclusive representatives of the cheese producing community of Switzerland which for many centuries has produced quality cheese which is famous for its excellence throughout the western world including the United States. 
    This cheese is generally and universally known outside Switzerland as Imported Swiss Cheese and has been marketed under this name by these petitioners for many decades in the United States. 
    The respondent, a Boston cheese trader, sells as Imported Swiss Cheese an inferior, imitative, less expensive Swiss-type cheese product originating from Finland or Austria without informing the public that the cheese in fact comes from these countries. 
    This conduct is infringement of our rights. 
    It dilutes our trade name. 
    It confuses the public. 
    It lessens the goodwill which has been built up for the trade name and the cheese and of course it causes financial loss to these petitioners. 
    Accordingly, by way of summary judgment procedure, we move for a permanent injunction enjoining this respondent from using our trade name on non-Switzerland cheese, unless and that is important, the respondent at the same time indicates the country of origin of the cheese. 
    In other words, we are not asking for permanent injunction for all purposes. 
    What we want is that this respondent when he sells Imported Swiss Cheese, he should indicate where the cheese comes from. 
    The motion was denied without opinion by the District Court for the District of Massachusetts. 
    We then appeal to the First Circuit pursuant to Section 1292 which as stated before authorizes appeals from interlocutory orders refusing injunction. 
    When we answered the calendar call, last fall, the chief judge of the First Circuit, dismissed the appeal for want of jurisdiction and refused to hear oral argument. 
    This Court then granted certiorari. 
    In dismissing the appeal, the Court of Appeals of the First Circuit made the following statement which is if I may say the key sentence of the opinion. 
    I quote, “Because of a general policy against piecemeal appeals, statutes permitting interlocutory appeals ought to be construed with some strict rules. 
    On this basis, whatever may be the exact letter the spirit of Section 1292 is against plaintiff's position.

    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Well, in reality, does this case involve anything more than the question as to whether this Court is going to review and perhaps overrule a decision of the United States District Court on a motion for summary judgment that the case is not right for summary disposition that there is a genuine issue, a fact which the Court wants to try out. 
    Is there anything more before us than that?
speaker="david_toren" startTime="396.144" stopTime="418.036">
    Mr. David Toren 
    May it please, Your Honor. 
    The question which has been presented on certiorari is limited exactly to the proposition Your Honor just outlined. 
    Now, my learned friend here in his brief has urged the Court to dispose of the subject matter pursuant of the matter and should limit itself to the question --
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="418.036" stopTime="488.048">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Well, I am not asking you that. 
    Let's forget about that aspect of it but I have difficulty to state quite frankly saying where this does involve a question under the statute governing interlocutory appeals in general. 
    It seems to me that this involves the quite familiar question, questions quite familiar to lawyers, a lot of lawyers anyway as to whether an order denying a motion for summary judgment is appealable. 
    Well, presumably the United States District Court felt rightly or wrongly that there was a genuine issue of fact that was not satisfied to decide this case on the basis of the affidavits that had been submitted and the thought that the case should go to trial and that there should be a decision after a presentation of evidence. 
    Am I right in understanding that that is the situation?
speaker="david_toren" startTime="488.048" stopTime="490.452">
    Mr. David Toren 
    Your Honor, I'm afraid I have to disagree.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="490.452" stopTime="492.591">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Why?
speaker="david_toren" startTime="492.591" stopTime="528.974">
    Mr. David Toren 
    The question involved here as far as we are concerned is a question of law to which in our original motion for summary judgment we raised a legal proposition. 
    We said that an international convention for the protection of industrial property which is implemented in the Lanham Act, the trademark statute which prohibits unfair competition and deceptive misuse of famous trade name. 
    Now, that was the basis of our motion.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="528.974" stopTime="530.413">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    But that means -- that assumes --
speaker="david_toren" startTime="530.413" stopTime="532.091">
    Mr. David Toren 
    That's not a question of fact.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="532.091" stopTime="543.374">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Well, it's not question -- I don't mean to call it a question of law because that assumes that in this particular case, there is a deceptive use of a trademark.
speaker="david_toren" startTime="543.374" stopTime="543.906">
    Mr. David Toren 
    Right.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="543.906" stopTime="582.880">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Now, it's quite -- the Court -- the District Court wrote no opinion made no findings than after most of the summary judgments as I understand the law whether it's quite possible that the District Court thought that that was not satisfied on the basis of the affidavits that the respondents use of its mark, otherwise deceptive, and that they wouldn't have a full trial and just because you propose an issue of law in the District Court it does not follow, does it, that the District Court had to decide that issue of law?
speaker="david_toren" startTime="582.880" stopTime="586.254">
    Mr. David Toren 
    The District Court conceded that it was a matter of law.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="586.254" stopTime="590.615">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Rather that -- it wrote no opinion and made no findings.
speaker="david_toren" startTime="590.615" stopTime="590.862">
    Mr. David Toren 
    Sorry?
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="590.862" stopTime="604.682">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    It wrote no opinion and made no findings. 
    All it did was to deny a motion for summary judgment, isn't that right which means in ordinary course that you'd have to go trial and make your proof, isn't that right?
speaker="david_toren" startTime="604.682" stopTime="605.455">
    Mr. David Toren 
    Correct.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="605.455" stopTime="618.099">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Now, do you know of any other -- of any case on the books other than the decision of Judge Frank I think is and the Second Circuit?
speaker="david_toren" startTime="618.099" stopTime="639.661">
    Mr. David Toren 
    Oh, yes, the leading case is Federal Glass Company v. Loshin which has been dealt with at great length in our brief that the Circuit Judge Learned Hand. 
    We said that there's much more decided in a motion for summary judgment than simply pushing the case back to trial because he said, it says a question of law involved --
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="639.661" stopTime="639.808">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Well, we're not trying --
speaker="david_toren" startTime="639.808" stopTime="649.956">
    Mr. David Toren 
    And the judge said, it denies it and then he had said as a matter of law you are not entitled to your remedy to your injunction and that's exactly is the present case. 
    We say --
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="649.956" stopTime="665.820">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Was there a ruling to the effect that assume that the issue of this trademark is deceptive by the respondent and you are not entitled to relief?
speaker="david_toren" startTime="665.820" stopTime="671.898">
    Mr. David Toren 
    I think there was a ruling that I am not entitled to relief as a matter of law. 
    And let's say --
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="671.898" stopTime="681.571">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Well, you're not entitled to relief, that's clear, isn't it? 
    You're not entitled to relief as a matter of law. 
    The courts don't decide abstract questions of law.
speaker="david_toren" startTime="681.571" stopTime="685.837">
    Mr. David Toren 
    Well, we say it isn't abstract because we have a statute and the treaty.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="685.837" stopTime="695.665">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    But the Court don't have to agree with you. 
    The District Court could have said that is not satisfied that this is a deceptive use of a trademark and that it wants the case to go to trial.
speaker="david_toren" startTime="695.665" stopTime="696.816">
    Mr. David Toren 
    Right but it didn't --
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="696.816" stopTime="709.800">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    But you didn't move after -- did you or did you not after the denial of the motion for summary judgment. 
    Did -- was any final judgment entered or did you seek final judgment?
speaker="david_toren" startTime="709.800" stopTime="713.327">
    Mr. David Toren 
    No, Your Honor but we construed this as a final judgment.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="713.327" stopTime="714.011">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Sir?
speaker="david_toren" startTime="714.011" stopTime="721.964">
    Mr. David Toren 
    We construed this order which denied the permanent injunction as a final judgment and if I may explain to you I --
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="721.964" stopTime="726.154">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    As far as I am concerned, there's a very real question on that.
speaker="david_toren" startTime="726.154" stopTime="790.097">
    Mr. David Toren 
    Now, Your Honor, my question -- why we go to the trouble of petitioning for a writ instead of going back to the District Court in trying the case. 
    Well, the answer is very simple, Your Honor. 
    The trade in general is honest respects our trade name and they have no quarrel with the trade as a whole. 
    However, there are few retailers like the present respondent who try to take advantage of our trade name which has a tremendous goodwill by selling inferior, less expensive cheese product under our trade name without telling the public where the cheese comes from. 
    Now, we feel if we have a -- from the federal court a permanent injunction as a matter of law, as distinguished from an injunction which has resulted from a trial, we have a better weapon to defend ourselves against all these retailers otherwise we will have to try that case maybe 10 times.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="790.097" stopTime="796.879">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    That it seems to me that what you're seeking is something that may be unknown to our system of law.
speaker="david_toren" startTime="796.879" stopTime="797.341">
    Mr. David Toren 
    No, Your Honor.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="797.341" stopTime="846.872">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    That is to say I don't see how a court can give you an injunction except in terms of a fact of -- facts of particular cases and it seems to me that what the District Court did here was may have been to say that I am not satisfied as to the facts of this particular case and you got to go to the trial. 
    Now, you're telling us now if I correctly understood your last statement that what you wanted was a general declaration of the law and without respect to the respondent's foreign practices here that you can use against the A&amp;P and Safeway and anybody else regardless of the differences on the nuances and what they call a cheese with holes in it and I know of nothing like that in our law.
speaker="david_toren" startTime="846.872" stopTime="873.864">
    Mr. David Toren 
    Your Honor, as far as I am concerned the language of the statute is so plain and clear it permits for one interpretation only. 
    The statute says the courts of appeals shall have jurisdiction of appeal from interlocutory orders refusing injunction. 
    There's no distinction between a preliminary injunction or a permanent injunction. 
    It says simple language. 
    And in fact there are about 15 cases --
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="873.864" stopTime="885.721">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Well, put the matter in another way, the Court of Appeals if I understand your position did not reach any of the questions of Justice Fortas has suggested to you. 
    It simply said you had no right to be up there.
speaker="david_toren" startTime="885.721" stopTime="886.388">
    Mr. David Toren 
    That's right. 
    No oral argument --
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="886.388" stopTime="899.915">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    An appeal. 
    And if you got up there, why then these questions as to what the District Court did or whether you are entitled to injunction as a matter of law would be right for decision by the Court of Appeals. 
    They didn't reach any of that.
speaker="david_toren" startTime="899.915" stopTime="942.827">
    Mr. David Toren 
    They didn't reach it. 
    The chief judge wouldn't be onset, the calendar calls it dismissed for want of jurisdiction and in his opinion the chief judge said he disagreed with the Federal Glass Case which is a Second Circuit and he disagreed the case as Mr. Justice Fortas mentioned that is United States versus New York and New Haven Railroad where Circuit Judge Friendly and Judge Frank said what Mr. Justice Fortas said. 
    Now, the issue was never reached in the Court of Appeals of the First Circuit and we feel that we're entitled to go there because the statute is clear.

    Justice Byron R. White

    Mr. David Toren 
    No, that is wrong, it's an incorrect statement.

    Justice Byron R. White 
    Yes, but the District Court judge also said the only question before me is whether or not there is any genuine dispute as to any material fact, that's on page 44 and stated again on page 47. 
    If there's a genuine dispute of any material fact I cannot overrule the objection of another party. 
    That's what District Court said and this is what the Court of Appeals said and if there is no issue of fact left in this case, I don't know how you can say this is anything to be tried out.

    Mr. David Toren 
    If I may develop my argument on that point, we concede that interlocutory appeals are not looked upon this favor. 
    We have no quarrel with that but we feel that the reasoning of the court below is fallacious and unsound for three reasons. 
    One, it ignores the purpose of the statute. 
    Two, it ignores the plain wording and meaning of the statute, and three it is against the very purpose of summary judgment. 
    Now, in respect of the purpose of the statute, the purpose of Section 1292 is to create an exception to the rule of finality that has been previously recognized by this Court, Mr. Justice Fortas and I refer you to Baltimore Contractors versus Bodinger which was decided in 1954 and the Court expressly stated that this section, Section 1292 is an expressed exception to the rule of finality. 
    Now, the legislative history does not shed any light on the reasons why Congress modified the rules of finality in respect to interlocutory appeal. 
    But this Court in devoting our case which I referred state it and I quote, “the changes seem plainly to spring from a developing need to permit litigants to effectually challenge interlocutory orders of serious, perhaps irreparable consequence.”

    I understand that that's what he said and he said it's not appealable but you came up from the District Court and for reasons of your own, you did not obtain the entry of a final order on the merits of your case. 
    You came up from a denial of a motion for summary judgment.

    A motion for summary judgment may be denied without passing on the merits of the case if the judge concludes that there are genuine issues of fact, isn't that right? 
    And for all that we know and hope you'll correct me if I am wrong about this as I understand this case, for all that we know and the district judge have planned to pass on your motion for summary judgment, decline to grant a motion for summary judgment because the district judge thought that there were genuine issues of fact.

    Now, for most circumstances, a Court of Appeals would pass on the question of whether there were or were not genuine issues of fact. 
    That's the first question that it has to decide. 
    Courts of Appeals don't usually supersede the District Court in passing on the merits of a matter before the District Court has passed on it in circumstances where the District Court has properly declined to pass on the merits because there are remaining issues of fact.

    In fact, --
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="1708.024" stopTime="1716.124">
    Justice Abe Fortas

    And in my system of jurisprudence, Courts of Appeals as I understand it ordinarily defer to District Courts and expect the District Court to pass on issues before they are passed on by the Court of Appeals and so far as I know the only issue that the District Court did pass on was whether there were or not genuine issues of fact.

    The Court, “Apparently, he takes the position that it is not conclusive.”

    As a matter of law, and on page apart from the fourth saying it's a matter of law, then on page 43, I draw your attention to the third -- fourth paragraph and the Court said, well the question before me is whether or not there is any genuine dispute as to any material of fact.

    As far as I am concerned, we have a statute which permit appeals some refusals of injunction whatever the reason. 
    Mr. Chief Justice my time is up but --

    You may answer the question, Mr. Toren.
speaker="david_toren" startTime="2022.144" stopTime="2105.218">
    Mr. David Toren 
    Thank you. 
    I haven't been able to present my argument if I may so. 
    So as far as we are concerned, it doesn't make any difference whether it was a question of fact or a question of law. 
    The statute is abundantly clear, its plain meaning, its plain language is the Court of Appeals shall have jurisdiction from appeal from interlocutory orders refusing injunction. 
    Here we have an order which refused an injunction well then therefore within the statute. 
    Now, Mr. Justice Fortas, the court below admitted that we are within the exact letter of the statute but the Court says that the spirit of the statute is against us. 
    Now, what does it mean? 
    That means, if you read the statute literally, our appeal has to be allowed. 
    But literal reading is taboo because of the general policy against interlocutory appeals. 
    That means the Fifth Circuit spurns the meaning of the language, the plain meaning in favor of a doctrine for which this statute is the exception. 
    I submit that this is the most unpersuasive reason to ignore the plain meaning of the statute. 
    Thank you, Your Honor. 
   
   
   
   Argument of Harold E. Cole
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2105.218" stopTime="2107.977">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Cole.
speaker="harold_e_cole" startTime="2107.977" stopTime="2289.736">
    Mr. Harold E. Cole 
    Mr. Chief Justice and this Honorable Court. 
    On this manner of the statute and whether or not this is an interlocutory appeal I maintain it's not interlocutory it's not interlocutory at all because if the motion for summary judgment is allowed that is the case. 
    I am going to read from the hearing in the District Court. 
    The clerk called a case and the Court says, “Does the plaintiff waive damages in this case?” 
    Mr. Toren answered, “Yes, Your Honor.” 
    The Court, “Does the plaintiff waive attorney's fees.” 
    Mr. Toren answers, “Yes, Your Honor.” 
    The Court says, “You waive for it?” 
    Mr. Toren says, “Yes, Your Honor.” 
    But now, if the permanent injunction is granted by the Court of Appeals that's the end of the case, there's nothing more to it. 
    I don't see any point in calling this an interlocutory appeal agreeing that if it were a motion for a preliminary injunction then and was denied then he could appeal under the statute but he's asking for a permanent injunction to complete the case in the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit and if their decision is favored, that ends the case. 
    In connection with this statute, this court has had something to say about it in the City of Morgan Town, West Virginia versus Royal Insurance Company, 376 U.S. 254 60 Supreme Court 1067. 
    The Court said, page 258 but piecemeal appeals have never been encouraged. 
    The growth of the law of procedure in the United States during the last half century has been steadily in the direction of simplicity and direction in the administration of justice and the appeal of order denied. 
    In that case I should state that Mr. Justice Black and Mr. Justice Rutledge did dissent. 
    But, however, it dealt with this statute although the matter was the denial of a jury trial in the District Court. 
    Nevertheless, it reached this Court and the Court refused to expand the statute. 
    Now, what the plaintiff petitioner is asking here is that this Court expand the statute and include motions for permanent injunction that are denied even though damages and attorneys fees are waived. 
    That's what --

    A particular disruption on the jurisdictional statute (Inaudible).
speaker="harold_e_cole" startTime="2313.214" stopTime="2517.619">
    Mr. Harold E. Cole 
    Yes but the statute deals with interlocutory appeals. 
    Now, the word interlocutory has a clear meaning. 
    It certainly doesn't mean an appeal where if it's decided the whole case is it that this isn't a case that will go back for damages ought to determine attorneys fees if the Circuit Court of Appeals decides the case where in it, where it is completed, that is that if they decide in favor of the plaintiff we never get a trial. 
    Now, I want to argue a little on why Congress never amended the statute to provide for appeals when a motion for permanent injunction is denied. 
    If -- well, we'll take the facts in this case and how abusive a process can be in court. 
    This defendant respondent is a small retail meat dealer having two employees and he has a small meat stall in Faneuil Hall Market at Boston. 
    He did not receive any notice in writing to stop using this little sign Imported Swiss Cheese. 
    He happens to sell about 15 to 20 pounds of cheese that's imported either from Finland or Austria. 
    He had to charge more for Imported Swiss Cheese so he merely put on top of the cheese with a little sign Imported Swiss Cheese which is a fact, it's true, it is imported. 
    It came, I believe this cheese came from Austria but Swiss cheese is the well-known term that he was using honestly in the dictionary it's defined as Swiss cheese, a firm pale yellow or white cheese containing many holes, made usually from cow's milk, half skimmed. 
    That's from the American College dictionary. 
    Now, United States Department of Agriculture puts out a book on cheeses and in it, it defines Swiss cheese and it says Swiss, Emmentaler cheese which is a large, hard crust, curd cheese with an elastic body and a mild nut-like Swedish flavor. 
    It's best known because of the holes or eyes that developed in the curd as the cheese ripens. 
    The eyes are often one half to one inch in diameter and so on. 
    And then it goes on to say Swiss cheese is made in many other countries beside Switzerland, including France, Denmark, Germany, Bulgaria, Italy, Austria, Finland, Russia, Argentina, and the United States. 
    And then it goes on to say that most of the Swiss cheese is made in Wisconsin but some other countries also make Swiss cheese.

    He goes into court because he wasn't given written orders. 
    Then there's an appeal, alright, if the Court, the circuit court denies the appeal, back it goes to the District Court then up to the Court of Appeals again all over one little word. 
    He said the cheese was imported. 
    It is imported.

    What you emphasize is what Court of Appeals (Inaudible).
speaker="harold_e_cole" startTime="2575.776" stopTime="2685.800">
    Mr. Harold E. Cole 
    Yes, but the point is -- here is the way we started. 
    In November 1963 the complaint was filed. 
    A year and more later, when the case was nearly ready for trial, this motion for summary judgment was filed. 
    Now, that keeps the case from being tried. 
    So we hear the motion for summary judgment. 
    It's denied. 
    Now, he gets another year before trial. 
    He goes up to the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit and we used up approximately another year getting up there in briefs and so forth. 
    Now, I don't think Congress wants you to expand the statute to include a motion for summary judgment because of the unfairness and the hardship of a little defendant. 
    Now, they are bringing this case up or trying to bring it up to the Court of Appeals again and have them decide that the words Imported Swiss Cheese mean (Inaudible) that is the Switzerland Swiss Cheese. 
    It's a strange thing but while this case was going on an advertisement came out in the New York Times and the Ladies' Home Journal in which they said in their ad, “Imported Swiss cheese isn't good enough for you. 
    Insist on genuine Switzerland Swiss Cheese.” 
    They don't believe that they had any right in Imported Swiss Cheese but they can go on and on with a case like this. 
    Right up one court to another then back to the other court then up to the other court and we can have a trial after something like three years now. 
    We can't even get a trial.

    What I am pointing out is that same time the lawyers were doing that, this advertisement came out in the New York Times and the Ladies' Home Journal saying that Imported Swiss Cheese isn't good enough for you.

    The sole argument in this case in there briefs is that is a question presented --

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Well, if the courts -- the courts below decided get on the facts that they allege, they didn't have enough, they didn't have jurisdiction regarding the thing that's no good.

    Mr. Harold E. Cole 
    Well maybe I don't understand, the Court only decided that they couldn't hear an appeal from a denial of motion for summary judgment, that's all they decided.

    Mr. Harold E. Cole 
    Well, yes. 
    They said it was a question of fact. 
    But it seems the affidavits were contradictory and so they wouldn't decide that Imported Swiss Cheese means plain as is, they wouldn't decide that. 
    They said the affidavits are contradictory. 
    So there was the end of that part and I think Judge Julian made it clear several times because he did talk an awful lot as you see in the record about it that it was a question of fact and he was stuck. 
    He says I can't issue a -- I can't grant you motion for summary judgment and he refused so he -- Judge Julian is very implying to grant the motion. 
    If you read in the record here the number of things he said on the subject.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    We'll recess now Mr. -- 
    Continue your argument.
speaker="harold_e_cole" startTime="2945.257" stopTime="3274.331">
    Mr. Harold E. Cole 
    Thank you. 
    I meant earlier in my argument to explain why I asked that the Court dismissed the case on the merits because there is authority and I refer to Patterson v. Alabama 294 U.S. 600 page 607. 
    We have frequently held that in the exercise of our appellate jurisdiction, we have power not only to correct error in the judgment under review but to make such disposition of the case as justice requires and the Court has on different occasions dismiss the case. 
    Well, of course we're anxious in that. 
    I would argue would be dismissed because all we're using is the word “imported” and we don't want to go on from court to court fighting for our rights. 
    In fact I better say this that this was a small sign and when the suit started the attorney for the defendant who isn't here told his client to take down the sign. 
    The sign hasn't been up since then but what they want is an injunction and we aren't willing to have the injunction issue because you make use of an injunction naturally legally by advertising it so forth so that's where our difference. 
    We don't consider calling Imported Swiss Cheese, any great event while you're only selling only 15 to 20 pounds a week and actually we aren't doing it. 
    Now, I depended also on a case not in my brief but Your Honors will recall on that Sears, Roebuck v. Stiffel 376 U.S. 225. 
    In that case, this Court made it clear that nothing was to be taken out of the public domain and given to anyone party. 
    In that case, it happen to be a lamp that wasn't patented and they had gotten an injunction enjoining the defendant Sears Roebuck from using the lamp even though it was patented and this Court made it clear if there were no statutory protection for that lamp either by a design patent or regular patent or a copyright that anyone who's free to make it, in the same holds here as to the word imported. 
    Anyone is free to use the word imported if it's truthful. 
    Now, the Code of Federal Regulation Title 21 Chapter 1 defines in Section 2 Swiss cheese. 
    I don't need to read the definition but in order for the import division, the treasury department to permit the entry of cheese they defined Swiss cheese and of course Swiss cheese it's coming from all these different countries. 
    Another thing I should mention the defendant respondent never uses Switzerland, he never called this cheese Switzerland. 
    He never called his cheese genuine. 
    All he calls it is imported. 
    Another thing during the hearing in fact the motion for summary judgment contain no proof or advertisement whatsoever that the plaintiff, petitioner here ever used the words imported Swiss cheese alone to describe its product. 
    They presented no advertisement showing that. 
    All the advertisements described the product as Switzerland Swiss cheese. 
    Now, coming to the decision because while the Second Circuit Court of Appeals did permit an appeal from a denial of summary judgment I think the case of Morgenstern v. Schering 181 F.2d 160 from the Third Circuit is better reasoned. 
    On page 162 the Court said the denial of summary judgment in the court below has no comparable significance. 
    The Court has not reached much less decided the merits of plaintiff's claim for injunction. 
    The motion for summary judgment is not an application for a preliminary injunction. 
    Nothing has occurred in or as a result of the denial of the motion which precludes plaintiff from seeking a temporary injunction. 
    Now, in the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit where they did allow the appeal I think you will see the fallacy especially in Judge Frank's opinion where he said regarding the case of contrary conclusion by sheer ritualism would waste time for plaintiff the next minute after the denial of the summary judgment motion could present the same papers and changed except for a new label motion for a preliminary injunction. 
    In other words, what --

    That's Judge Hand?

    Well, you don't have that in --
speaker="harold_e_cole" startTime="3315.562" stopTime="3364.720">
    Mr. Harold E. Cole 
    It's in the Federal Glass Company versus Loshin 217 F.2d 936 Ca.2. 
    But in the Second Circuit now, some of the judges who have been constrained to follow Judge Hand's and Judge Frank's decision said solely they do it with regret that they don't think it was good law but they of course feel they are bound to follow. 
    On the other hand, we have the Third Circuit now and the First Circuit deciding the case otherwise. 
    Now, that completes my argument.
