    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Your argument.
speaker="jack_greenberg" startTime="2.602" stopTime="304.321">
    Mr. Jack Greenberg 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court. 
    In the ten minutes remaining to me, I would like to respond to some of the questions asked yesterday by Mr. Justice Fortas and Mr. Justice Harlan principally where they go to the very core of the case. 
    And they relate to the Mine Workers issue. 
    To its significance to this case and to the position, we are asking the Court to take with regard to the issue. 
    Mr. Justice Harlan asked whether it was not the threshold issue and it is in the sense that the Court faces the problem of whether it can reach the validity of the injunction on review of the judgment of content. 
    But it is not the issue in the sense that the Court must reach the constitutional question of whether a state can invoke the Mine Workers issue as a bar to entertaining First Amendment defenses. 
    The Court can reach the Mine Workers issue but it doesn't have to as it did not for example in Thomas versus Collins in which under state law, the state courts could have and did pass upon the validity of the injunction in the action for contempt. 
    And that, Mr. Justice Fortas, is the difference between our position and the Government's. 
    The Government argues Mine Workers exclusively and we come here sensitive to a concern that the Court may think it inappropriate to decide a constitutional question of such great importance if that question is not inescapable. 
    And therefore, the major thrust of our argument is to demonstrate that that maybe done while the Court can reverse without reaching Mine Workers we submit however it cannot affirm without reaching it. 
    And I should like to mention several grounds on which the Court may reverse without reaching the Mine Workers issue. 
    Now the Alabama State Supreme Court gave what purported to be an adequate state ground for affirmance. 
    But we submit that heretofore; state law did not embody Mine Workers. 
    The Alabama State Courts gave its reason for refusal to review the judgment of contempt as two things. 
    One, the court below was a court of equity. 
    And two, they would service upon the parties. 
    However in no case heretofore has Alabama law embodied this as the sole grounds in reviewing a judgment of contempt. 
    For example, in Fields against City of Fairfield, as I tried to point out yesterday, there was at issue almost precisely the issues that are here in this case. 
    There was the question of the validity of a permit ordinance which was alleged to give discretion far too broad and vague to administrators. 
    There was the validity of the injunction embodying that ordinance. 
    The petitioners in that case went to the State Supreme Court, and the State Supreme Court examined the injunction on a number of grounds. 
    Disjunctively, it looked that jurisdiction and whether the order was void. 
    In determining whether the order was void, the State Supreme Court examined the permit ordinance and examined the injunction. 
    And then it said that they -- the permit ordinance and the injunction are valid and it proceeded to affirm. 
    This Court then reversed it on other grounds. 
    In our case, they did not examine whether the order was void in the same sense that they did examine whether it was void in the Fields case. 
    And we submit that Alabama law having heretofore quite clearly embodied that type of review, we were entitled to that kind of view in the State Supreme Court and consequently, there was not an adequate state ground for refusal to review. 
    Now the Fields case is not a mutation or a sport in Alabama Law. 
    Alabama courts have consistently gone beyond the two narrow grounds that they've given in our case. 
    In a case involving indeed another party to this case, Commissioner Connor, In re Connor which is cited in our brief of the Alabama courts looked at whether or not the injunctive order was too vague. 
    And they stated that that would be an adequate ground for reviewing the validity of the injunction in a contempt action. 
    And in a very early Alabama case also set forth and discussed at some length in our brief the Alabama -- Merrill -- Board of Review versus Merrill, the Alabama courts looked at whether or not the court of equity had jurisdiction in the sense that they were proper substantive allegations in the complaint of fraud, corruption, and bad faith dealing with the Board of Review -- Board of Revenue. 
    And it said there was no jurisdiction in a review of the contempt action. 
    There was no jurisdiction issue, the injunction and consequently have reversed. 
    Now this, we submit, is something that the Alabama courts could have done here under settled Alabama law. 
    And therefore this ground is available to this Court because as this Court has done in Thomas versus Collins, and Da -- Donovan versus Dallas, and other cases in which it has reviewed the validity of the injunction and the contempt action if that ground was available in state law that should have been available to us here.

    That's right. 
    And significantly, they cited no Alabama case.

speaker="jack_greenberg" startTime="322.726" stopTime="344.234">
    Mr. Jack Greenberg 
    Well but the question of whether or not, the federal question is properly here, I think it's a question properly for this Court as in -- let us say in NAACP versus Alabama. 
    One might have said that the state could have changed its law as of that point but these Courts had petitioners who were entitled to rely upon the preexisting law in raising the federal question. 
    And indeed we did in the trial court and the trial court did pass upon the validity of the injunction.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="344.234" stopTime="354.380">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Because they were entitled to raise it in the -- in this Court to raise the federal question but here the State Supreme Court has already said that this is the rule of Alabama.
speaker="jack_greenberg" startTime="354.380" stopTime="404.085">
    Mr. Jack Greenberg 
    Well, but we would submit -- I believe Mr. Justice White that in numerous cases in this Court that when a procedural rule is changed for the first time as a bar to raising a federal question this Court does not consider it a bar to review of that question here. 
    There was the -- the petitioners had good reasons to believe that they could've raised that question and presented that issue in the Alabama courts and indeed the trial court to some extent gave it -- its holding was perhaps an alternative ground. 
    They did pass upon the validity of injunction. 
    They cited Cox against New Hampshire saying, this ordinance is okay. 
    See Cox against New Hampshire. 
    And the Alabama State Supreme Court did nothing and say we've got a court of equity and we serve the parties and that's the end of it. 
    Now we submit that we are not therefore barred from bringing this question here via that route. 
    Now we would like to suggest another --
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="404.085" stopTime="437.489">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Don't you have to say a little more Mr. Greenberg, perhaps some more? 
    You have to say that the petitioners here cannot be held accountable for the violation of an injunction on the basis of Mine Workers if their action viewed in light of the law prior to the law in this case was justified -- arguably justified because of Alabama law.
speaker="jack_greenberg" startTime="437.489" stopTime="460.759">
    Mr. Jack Greenberg 
    Yes, Mr. Justice Fortas, I think that we have said that.One of our problems is that there's so many things to say in this case. 
    It's impossible to say them all at once. 
    But clearly, we would submit that it does not take very much argument in this Court to establish that we did have here an unconstitutional ordinance. 
    And it was embodied in an injunction which was perhaps more unconstitutional than the ordinance if that were possible. 
    And peti --
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="460.759" stopTime="463.863">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Unconstitutional -- I mean unconstitutional on its face or --
speaker="jack_greenberg" startTime="463.863" stopTime="473.138">
    Mr. Jack Greenberg 
    Unconstitutional on its face. 
    Unquestionably, ordinances which are embody some of this very same standard, general welfare and so forth have been held unconstitution, stab the backs in many other case.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="473.138" stopTime="485.228">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    (Inaudible) excluded on another ground that (Inaudible) that the ordinance was -- if valid on the face or at least not on -- constitutional on its face but discriminatory (Inaudible).
speaker="jack_greenberg" startTime="485.228" stopTime="584.566">
    Mr. Jack Greenberg 
    That's true. 
    And that brings us to another ground while we submit the Court need not reach the Mine Workers question in this case. 
    Though if the Court were to reach the Mine Workers question, we would submit that the Court ought to there -- go directly to the merits. 
    But we're aware of many decisions of this Court in which this is something that the Court does -- not likely and we're trying to in argument offer to the Court certain considerations why it doesn't have to go. 
    If it did, we would say the Court ought to reverse. 
    And we were precluded from making a record which would demonstrate just what remitting us to Bull Connor would mean. 
    And we would say that before the Court should make a decision on a question like that of rather far reaching constitutional importance to what extent can a first -- can First Amendment rights be frustrated by the issuance of an injunction. 
    We would say that the Court ought to understand the full implications of doing something like that. 
    Constitutional decisions frequently avoid a non -- if the record is not complete, their case -- it say then, if the case comes up in a demurrer and so forth and we here would have wanted too and try to make a complete record showing just what an injunction meant which embodies an ordinance which says, “Go work it out with Bull Connor", and we will prevent it from doing that. 
    And we would submit that as an additional ground why the Court -- on which the Court may decide this case without reaching Mine Workers. 
    The Court would have a full record before it. 
    But if it does reach Mine Workers, we would submit that it ought to go to the merits and reverse. 
    I have a minute left, I would like to, if the Court please, reserve it for rebuttal. 
   
   
   
   Argument of Louis F. Claiborne
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="584.566" stopTime="598.906">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    You may. 
    Mr. Claiborne.
speaker="louis_f_claiborne" startTime="598.906" stopTime="665.731">
    Mr. Louis F. Claiborne 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    Our argument begins with the premise that the Court will reach the Mine Workers issue here. 
    In saying that I don't mean to disparage in any way the argument which has been made that there is a threshold question whether Alabama courts had tried to this case, applied the Mine Workers' doctrine and therefore whether they may bar the petitioners from arguing the validity of the injunction here because for the first time, they did invoke that doctrine. 
    There is it seems to us a strong argument to that effect. 
    We have not reached that point. 
    We have noted it in our brief. 
    We leave that argument to the petitioners and we argue only the question most interesting to the United States that most far reaching which is the application of the Mine Workers' rule in this sort of context on the assumption that it is a question likely to be reached by the Court.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="665.731" stopTime="667.396">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    It is a question like what?
speaker="louis_f_claiborne" startTime="667.396" stopTime="670.258">
    Mr. Louis F. Claiborne 
    Likely to be reached by the Court as we view it.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="670.258" stopTime="672.844">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Okay.
speaker="louis_f_claiborne" startTime="672.844" stopTime="1000.931">
    Mr. Louis F. Claiborne 
    Now without meaning in the least to quarrel with but a question, the Mine Workers doctrine properly applied in circumstances which clearly called for its application. 
    We do think it's important to point out at the outset what a remarkable extraordinary rule it is in some respects. 
    It does allow the imposition of criminal penalties for the violation of a Court order which by definition is contrary to law or contrary to constitution. 
    Now that's a principle rather unique in our law. 
    It does not apply to the commands of the legislature or of the commands of the executive officers. 
    A policeman tells someone to remain or to move on and that order is improper or unconstitutional. 
    This Court has repeatedly held that there can be no penalty for violating it. 
    Likewise, there can be no penalty through violating a void statutory law nor can there be any penalty for violating the order of a legislative committee when it directs a witness to answer and he has a constitutional privilege to refuse to do so. 
    Now in saying all that, we're not as they say trying to disparage the rule, we're trying to find the reason which is special to court decrees which justifies to somewhat harsh absolute principle that the Mine Workers doctrine embodies. 
    Now why should there be such a special rule applicable only to court orders? 
    It seems to us that there can only be two reasons. 
    The first is that judicial orders oriented in a particular case directed against the particular defendant they can find as to time and place and in this respect, they're different from general laws or general executive regulations. 
    For the same reason, they're less likely to be vulnerable to such defenses as inapplicability are overbreadth. 
    Demanding obedience to court orders is less likely to cause widespread injury than blind obedience to more generalized laws. 
    But even that rational doesn't carry us all the way because there is the same specificity in a policeman's specific directive to a suspect to stop. 
    And there is the same specificity in the order of a legislative committee to witness to answer a particular question. 
    So there must be another reason why court orders are especially immune. 
    It seems to us that that reason is that in our system, courts are the final authority with respect to litigable issues to concrete controversy. 
    The considered judgments of Courts must be respected since they are the final authority unless we're to altogether abandon the rule of law. 
    And because of the way the judicial process works, because Courts need time to decide cases, there are temporary stay orders to preserve the case, to preserve the status quo must also be respected. 
    Now, applying those rationales to this case, it seems to us that in important respects, they don't fit. 
    This is not a case like the Shipp case for instance in which this Court had issued a stay order pending an appeal here in a capital conviction from a state court. 
    This Court, in order to give itself time to decide whether it had jurisdiction of the appeal, stay the execution of the defendant who had been convicted and not withstanding that order, the prisoner was lynched allegedly as it was ultimately found with the connivance of his custodian, the local sheriff. 
    That action wholly mooted the case and prevented the judicial process from working. 
    Here it seems to us we have rather the reverse of that situation. 
    The issuance of the injunction, if it must be obeyed, mooted the legal controversy. 
    Because for all practical purposes, this parade, this march or these marches, could not be postponed indefinitely. 
    Their timing was important in the context of Birmingham in 1963. 
    It could not -- this protest could not serve its purpose several months or several years later when this injunction was ultimately vacated on appeal perhaps even in this Court.

    Mr. Claiborne, I followed your argument, I wanted to see to what ultimately it is directed.

    Correct.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    We agree on that.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    No, not necessarily of course, often a state ground is inadequate even though it's -- even though it -- it's maybe partly constitutional.
speaker="louis_f_claiborne" startTime="1109.605" stopTime="1185.733">
    Mr. Louis F. Claiborne 
    Well, we wouldn't argue here that this was a mere procedural rule that had no rational and no basis of -- so as to prevent the usual defense. 
    I think we do rest on the rationale of the Green case as I understand it, In re Green in this Court in which as I read the opinion, the Court held that the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits the state from denying the defense of invalidity with respect to an injunction issued by a Court in an area which was preempted by federal legislation. 
    Here, we would say in one part of our argument that in -- something of the same sense the area was preempted by the First Amendment. 
    And that the Court, state court here, in issuing the sort of broad, overbroad injunction citing First Amendment rights was acting unconstitutionally beyond its jurisdiction in an area preempted by the constitution, by the First Amendment.

    I would say that when the consequences of such a rule are so serious as they are here that is to bar the expected ability to defend on the ground of the invalidity of the injunction. 
    If we assume that Alabama had for the most part in the past, allowed in a contempt proceeding, in a criminal contempt proceeding, the defendant to defend on the ground that the injunction was improper that expectation cannot be defeated by the invention of a new rule which has such a drastic effect.

    I do begin on the premise however that there is some question about that and that the Court may have to reach the Mine Workers doctrine that that is the question which concerns most directly the United States. 
    It's reason for participating in this case. 
    And therefore, I'm limiting my argument to it without really taking any position as to whether the Court must reach it.

    Well, I think something does depend, Mr. Justice Stewart, on the specificity of the constitutional protection on the clarity with which one can say in advance that the Court is acting beyond its power. 
    And when we're dealing in the area of the Ninth or the Tenth Amendment that becomes far more difficult and debatable and therefore the -- perhaps the duty to obey should be the greater. 
    I think the Mine Workers case itself, the case Mr. Justice Franklin's opinion indicates that if this were a case plainly governed by the Norris-LaGuardia Act, then of course, disobedience could not be punished. 
    When the area is so clearly withdrawn, I think that was the rational of the Green case that the National Labor Relations Act had very plainly withdrawn from the state court's old power in this area. 
    And that can never be true in the area of the Ninth and Tenth Amendment.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    That's certainly not right, isn't it? 
    Is it -- it could many times be very clearly true in the area of the Ninth and Tenth Amendment? 
    What if the federal court had enjoined the person from getting a divorce under the state laws?

    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Oh, really. 
    All you're talking about though is not whether the injunction can be disobeyed with impunity but whether the person who disobeys the injunction has the right to have his claim that the injunction was void examined by the Court, isn't that right?
speaker="louis_f_claiborne" startTime="1589.657" stopTime="1589.886">
    Mr. Louis F. Claiborne 
    Exactly, so --
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="1589.886" stopTime="1610.023">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    In other words there are two questions, two hurdles that he as to get over. 
    One is the United Mine Workers case, but the United Mine Workers case is nothing more than -- if he gets over that that's nothing more than a ticket to get in the Court and to -- and try to establish that the injunction is void, is that right?
speaker="louis_f_claiborne" startTime="1610.023" stopTime="1633.284">
    Mr. Louis F. Claiborne 
    That is so Mr. Justice Fortas. 
    However, it maybe that in order to get over the hurdle, one must prove that the injunction is plainly invalid and in Mr. Justice Stewart's case, I took that to be the case and therefore answer the question as it is. 
    But certainly, analytically, one first decides whether the defense is available and then tries out the -- whether the defense is --
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="1633.284" stopTime="1697.540">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Well, for example, a good (Voice Overlap) -- suppose what had happened here was this that the application was made for the injunction. 
    And the petitioners here had gone to the trial court and said, “Now, we want to be heard on the question of the validity under the federal constitution of this ordinance.” 
    And the trial judge said, “I think that's right. 
    I think you ought to have an opportunity and we'll schedule a full hearing on that for next week if you can bring in all your witnesses, we'll hear oral argument and otherwise -- but meanwhile, I don't think you should demonstrate and I'm issuing a restraining order, TRO and come back here next week, we'll have a full hearing.” 
    Would you still be making -- the Government still be making the argument to this? 
    And then he defend, the trial judge concluded after the full hearing in and everything else that no, he doesn't find any merit in the constitutional arguments, and he sustains the validity of order.

    Mr. Louis F. Claiborne 
    I recognized that, Mr. Justice Brennan.

speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2047.433" stopTime="2067.688">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    The difficulty here is that the ordinance provides that a permit on application maybe issued by the Commission and there was never any application to the Commission or a permit in this case so you don't know how broad or narrow it was in practice. 
    It never applied to the Commission although they were told to by the language of the ordinance and they were told to specifically by telegram.
speaker="louis_f_claiborne" startTime="2067.688" stopTime="2104.842">
    Mr. Louis F. Claiborne 
    Well, it so -- as I was about to suggest to Mr. Justice White, the -- it seems to us that the other defect and the more, perhaps the clearer defect in both the ordinance and the injunction which does nothing more than repeat the ordinance with no narrowing whatever is precisely the permit or aspect of it. 
    It allows the city, its Commission to withhold the permit on a series of grounds which amount to absolute unconfined discretion in the city to grant or withhold the permit.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2104.842" stopTime="2110.166">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    But the Commission has never withheld a permit from these people because they never applied to the Commission.
speaker="louis_f_claiborne" startTime="2110.166" stopTime="2146.483">
    Mr. Louis F. Claiborne 
    But the rule in this Court, Mr. Justice Stewart as I understand it ever since Thornhill and Alabama and then repeated only two times ago in Cox and Louisiana, is that even one who might have fully asking obtained such a permit has standing to challenge this censorship procedure of the municipality. 
    That whether that applies to parades, or to meetings, or to speech, the Court has applied it in all of those instances. 
    In Cox of course it was exactly the sort of demonstration and --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2146.483" stopTime="2160.957">

    Mr. Louis F. Claiborne 
    This Court has recognized that in -- with special safeguards, there maybe some licensing, some censorship in the movie area, but has been very cautious it seems to me to confine that exception both narrowly to that area and to insist in subsequent cases that there'd be as many safeguards as possible and that there not be any greater prior restraint without hearing than is necessary. 
    Here we're dealing with the ex parte order and not a considered adjudication after adversary hearing. 
    And at the same time, we're not dealing with a state order entered to preserve the status quo because this order leaves nothing open on the merits.

speaker="louis_f_claiborne" startTime="2829.837" stopTime="2894.536">
    Mr. Louis F. Claiborne 
    Well, the kind of parade described in the application Mr. Justice White is just nothing very precise. 
    It ranged from sit-ins to kneel-ins to parades of 50 people, to parades of several hundred people. 
    And indeed the Alabama Court of Appeal found that a parade of 50 people confined at the sidewalk did not require a permit, whereas the parade, a larger one might. 
    Now, and here, these petitioners are charged with engaging in two parades, the one on Good Friday is the one that the Alabama Court of Appeal held didn't require a permit at all. 
    The one on Easter Sunday being a larger one, probably did require such a permit. 
    But the background of this case does not enlighten the scope of the injunction very much, I would say. 
   
   
   
   Argument of Earl McBee
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2894.536" stopTime="2897.434">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. McBee.
speaker="earl_mcbee" startTime="2897.434" stopTime="3143.337">
    Mr. Earl McBee 
    Mr. Chief Justice, members of the Court, may it please the Court. 
    The first suggestion I would like to make is that the doctrine of Alabama that is the principles decided by the Supreme Court of Alabama relating to the Mine Workers doctrine relates back to the very date that this Court decided that case. 
    In that particular -- at that particular time there was then pending in the Alabama courts the case of Hecker, Greenwood versus Hecker, Hecker versus Greenwood, and there was also pending in that at that time the Hotel Restaurant Employees Association versus Greenwood. 
    In that case, the Hecker had -- and others had been convicted of several contempt. 
    The Supreme Court of Alabama held that since the picketing and the actual strike was no manners for a lawful purpose and was legally conducted, that it did involve First Amendment freedoms of assembly and speech. 
    And that therefore, the Court, the lower court was erroneous in reading the injunction. 
    They dissolved the injunction. 
    They then, using the United Mine Workers case as the background, determined that the several contempt convictions were required to fall. 
    But however, the closing paragraph of the opinion was that in view of the United Mine Workers case, the right of the Greenwoods or the state to proceed in criminal contempt was not in anyway impaired by that decision. 
    We have read since the -- a matter of the City of Fairfield case has been brought up, we have read that case again. 
    And we do not find that that case in anyway militates against the doctrine that we have said in our briefs as applied by it. 
    As a matter of fact, we are more convinced and we would invite the Court to read the case, nor that we might be certain that our construction is not biased but as we read that case, the Court in that case said that they were not going to consider the question of the unconstitutionality of the ordinance in the Fields case. 
    And that by the way was a pure speech question involving the holding of a meeting. 
    The requirement of the ordinance was that the -- before a meeting could be held in the City of Fairfield, permit from the mayor must be procured. 
    Fields was holding a meeting, was planned to hold a meeting, he did not procure a permit.A temporary injunction was issued on that ground. 
    The Court said that they would not go into the question of the ordinance or the validity of the ordinance either on space or otherwise because they couldn't reach it. 
    And they took the NAACP case and referred to it. 
    They cited the Mine Workers case. 
    They cite Howat versus Kansas. 
    And they concluded that as a general rule they said unconstitutional statute is that -- is an absolute nullity. 
    It may not be the basis of an illegal right or legal proceedings. 
    But however though, when an injunction has been issued and without taking the normal means of attacking that injunction by a motion to dissolve a discharge, the defendant may not in criminal contempt in -- in a con -- appeal or certiorari from criminal contempt raise the question of its unconstitutionality and collateral proceedings on appeal, from a judgment of conviction in the contempt case or on that case read as habeas corpus or for certiorari.

    It's interesting to note that in citing the cases that they relied upon, in support of that doctrine, they cited the case United Mine Workers. 
    They cited Howat versus Kansas. 
    They cited the People versus Boshar (ph), an old Supreme Court New York Case in which the case -- the Court there said that they would not consider the unconstitutionality of an ordinance or Act, the basis of an injunction as invalidating the ordinance of the injunction or making that erroneous or making void of these. 
    It would be erroneous upon of course, a proper appeal from a motion made to dissolve or from carrying on the merits of the injunction case.

    -- the Mine Workers case and they did cite, and rely upon Boshar (ph) and the other cases which say that the unconstitutionality of the Act or ordinance is not -- does not render the injunction void.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    That's the thought of your argument.
speaker="earl_mcbee" startTime="3291.172" stopTime="3508.530">
    Mr. Earl McBee 
    That's the (Voice Overlap) of our case, yes, that's right. 
    Now getting over to the question of the Mine Workers doctrine and its limitations or of any event, the first suggestion has been made that In re Green, militates against that case. 
    Now as I read In re Green, the fault or the vice of that case was that this lawyer was convicted of criminal contempt that is constructive contempt, without being afford a hearing. 
    He tried to defend his case but was deprived of that privilege. 
    As I understand the opinion which was written reasonably by Mr. Justice Douglas, comment was made about the Mine Workers case but the question though, the primitive question was that there was no hearing. 
    And I believe that Mr. Justice Douglas said that, that that illustrated the device of the whole thing. 
    That is the preemption doctrine because you couldn't tell whether it's in the preemption doctrine involved or not. 
    In as much as they never did reached that question. 
    They never did give a chance for the Court to determine that question. 
    Now, Mr. Justice Harlan I believe in the -- in a concurring opinion in that case, did say that he did not feel that that case will take against the Mine Workers doctrine and there I believed conclude that the Mine Workers doctrine holds that even if the federal courts were barred by the acts of Congress from issuing the injunction in that case, that nevertheless, it is the duty of the defendants to abide and perform the injunction at least while it was in effect. 
    And until it was dissolved or discharged or some other method used to dislodge it and it should be obeyed. 
    And that failure to do so would constitute criminal contempt. 
    That we say is -- we feel is the holding of that case clearly. 
    Now, there has been much said about the vagueness of the injunction. 
    Actually, the injunction does say very specifically that the action above designated I've read to in the appellate complaint or the Acts that are related to and are enjoined and specifically referred to. 
    Among those Acts related to in connection with mass picketing and mass street parades, mass processions or like demonstrations without a permit we have again foresee of the bill of complaint a situation very similar to those that which developed on April 8, 12, and April the 14th, that is to say the Good Friday and the Easter parades. 
    We say that those particular demonstrations, the forerunner of those particular demonstrations were set forth in the bill of complaint. 
    Now if there'd be any question about what type of injunction is issued and what it means and what it is required to do, we say that under the authorities, the requirement is that the Court or the Courts in construction refer back to the original bill of complaint and read the injunction in the light of the original complaint.

    Well, on one side of the street, there were -- well, the evidence is over 50 because over 50 were arrested. 
    But also they did not arrest all because they couldn't get to all of them. 
    They were on two sides of the street.

    Now that group, it's true, did march. 
    But on the other side of the street, the evidence is and Mr. Painter (ph), while the witness -- a witness for the city testified that on the other side of the street, the group outside of the church were also siphoned into and they engaged in a march along with the other marchers. 
    In other words, this technique of having the crowd and the marches intermingle apparently had been followed in other cases in the (Inaudible) Movement and another situations.

    At page 207 of the record, is where the particular matter was discussed. 
    Now, down there, the middle of the page I believe, this group was led by Reverend Martin Luther King Jr., Reverend Ralph Abernathy, and Reverend Shuttlesworth as I recall. 
    There were several people falling in formation. 
    There are several people who were falling in this formation. 
    As the group marched away from the church in the direction of downtown, a group of persons who had assembled along the sidewalk and the street followed this procession, this group of people who consist of several hundred. 
    This group on the march is actually the whole procession was going as a group. 
    As the group came out the church, then the whole groups of people who had assembled along the sidewalk fell along behind them. 
    And I think you could describe it as one procession.

    Is there any evidence here as to what statements were made by the leaders as to claim that they had a right to march as they were marching that the constitution of the United States gave them that right to march whether the city permitted it or not?

    Mr. Earl McBee

    Mr. Earl McBee 
    Not prior to the marches, no sir. 
    They made no such contention, at least that I'm aware of, that appears in the record anyway. 
    That was this march that that developed into a rather violent and belligerent mob. 
    And as a matter of fact, the same thing is true of the march of April the 12th, and the same thing is true of the prior march which is described in the bill of complaint. 
    The crowd became unruly. 
    It became violent. 
    Some people were injured. 
    One person at least was injured. 
    A police officer was narrowly missed by a large brick. 
    Some -- damage to some city property occurred and that a three-wheeler was damaged, the radio and I believe the windshield and some other things possibly. 
    And there were some -- a number of people arrested for resisting arrest. 
    There were a number arrested for assault and battery in connection to the throwing of rocks, and so on. 
    These crowds were solicited I think I should add.

    Mr. Earl McBee 
    Mr. Chief Justice, it was impossible to tell because the whole thing degenerated into a mob. 
    Those who were in the parade and everybody else generate into a mob, you couldn't tell. 
    No way to tell. 
    But we do say this that the defendants in this case that is the petitioners in this case apparently took responsibility because during the course of the afternoon, according to the testimony of the witness, Painter (ph), the respondent Wyatt Tee Walker, told him that he could control that --

    Told whom?

    It is respondent Wyatt Tee Walker.

    Told who?
speaker="earl_mcbee" startTime="4293.671" stopTime="4342.610">
    Mr. Earl McBee 
    Told a witness Painter (ph, who was the witness for the city that it was entirely possible for him and he could as a matter of fact guarantee that no one would get out of control. 
    That he could control this crowd of people without any problem at all. 
    He would guarantee. 
    The officer raised the question that -- engaged him getting that many people together involved in a demonstration would pose some problems of possible balance and possible danger to people or to property. 
    And at that time, Mr. Reverend Walker stated that he could control the crowd. 
    And then he said if anybody got hurt, it would be due to the officers and nobody else.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="4342.610" stopTime="4343.450">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Due to what?

    Mr. Earl McBee 
    Due to the officers doing it and not these people. 
    He could control them. 
    Now the evidence is that they did con -- they did assemble outside. 
    And I believe the witness, Hays (ph) who as a witness for the peti -- that is the respondents and who was one -- who is one of the respondents. 
    As a matter of fact, one of the petitioners here testified that he went down to the church for the purpose of demonstrating. 
    And also -- a Mr. Shorz (ph) in examining some of the witness testified that or rather examined the witnesses ref -- with reference to a parade or a procession. 
    Now the ordinance involved -- now, the question has been raised whether or not the owners involved -- involves anything other than streets, parades or street -- use of the sidewalks. 
    But in -- a matter of fact, the ordinance does involve mass street parades, processions, or like demonstrations without a permit, nor was -- it does involve parades and processions and things of that kind which conducted mass and which of course, whether the type of situation that was --

    (Inaudible). 
    I might say it was a nasty thing that those exhibits will go to Court by the respondents but we introduced them in evidence though. 
    Now we simply say, may it please the Court that we don't -- we have more than a First Amendment freedom case. 
    We say in the first place that it would be a travesty to have a situation where a group of people who start out for the purpose, obvious purpose, of getting put in jail during the various meetings that were held from time to time by this group on the evenings of the 11th, and the 12th, and the 13th, they were constantly recruiting people to go to jail. 
    Even in one instance on Friday night I believe, Reverend Walker, Wyatt Tee Walker recruited a dozen or so Negros willing to die for me. 
    All of the witnesses --

    Mr. Earl McBee 
    That was the testimony of Mr. Walter Johnson who is a representative of the United Press or the AAP, I'm not sure, from Mobile. 
    That testimony is on page -- is repeated several times, is on page 203. 
    During the discussions that occurred on the -- at these meetings, among other things, the leaders were upset because they said that Mr. Al Hibbler, who is a blind Negro singer, was discriminated against because he was not arrested. 
    And they didn't like it, they say it. 
    In fact, the Reverend Martin Luther King and the Reverend Abernathy had planed to have a march or make their move as they called it, on Thursday. 
    Mr. Hibbler had gone on Wednesday and they were going on Thursday. 
    But since Mr. Hibbler had not been arrested, they won't give him another chance to be arrested, so they sent him out again on Thursday. 
    And they then, postponed their move as they said until Friday at which time they did make their move and the result was that they get arrested. 
    During the course of these meetings, Reverend Walker made the statement that he had something that he wanted of the school population. 
    He said grades one through graduate school. 
    Among other things, he said that the students, the student population could get a better education in five days in city jail than they could get in five months in the segregated schools. 
    There was all the way through these proceedings, a very obvious effort to get people arrested. 
    There was no effort made at all to obtain a permit from the city commission. 
    And as a matter of fact, we argue with the court below and we think the argument should be repeated here that they didn't make any request because obviously they didn't intend -- they didn't want to get a permit. 
    They wanted to get arrested. 
    That was the whole procedure. 
    And they intended to get arrested in order to accomplish whatever purposes they felt were desirable for their ends and their goals to be arrested.

    Mr. Earl McBee 
    It is our contention that that and the Court so ruled that that was an entirely a collateral issue. 
    He said that, “If you will come in here, when you move to dissolve the injunction and you will show those facts, then I can do something about it. 
    But you elected though to violate the injunction. 
    And as a result of that election, you've closed my hands to this matter." 
    "This time, I can do it”, he said at the proper time. 
    “But I can't do since you elected to violate the injunction defiantly as you did without have -- asking me to do something about it,” and so that that would be a collateral attack, directly collateral attack.

    Mr. Earl McBee 
    What they contended was, I don't believe they contended it had been discriminate or -- discriminatorily applied so much as what they contended was that there had been no practice in the past to obtain a permit through the city commission. 
    I believe that was the burden of their argument. 
    They wanted to -- they said to prove that that had not been the practice. 
    But however though, the ordinance specifically said and as early as April the 5th, Commissioner Connor himself notified the Reverend Shuttlesworth that the proper way by telegram, the proper way to proceed if they want to proceed would be to apply to the city commission. 
    And the Court said that he would be glad to hear any evidence of anything that happened after the injunction occurred and the matter that were before the Court was involved but he would not and did not feel that he would like to go into collateral issues at this particular time. 
    Now from the very beginning all the way through the case, and on for the record --

   Argument of J. M. Breckenridge

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Breckenridge.
speaker="j_m_breckenridge" startTime="5315.560" stopTime="5426.302">
    Mr. J. M. Breckenridge 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    First thing I would like to mention into coming on is the bona fide of the so-called full Birmingham demonstration from 1963 which have been mentioned I don't know just exactly what connection they have unless they imply that the principle was lofty that it justifies a violation of a direct court injunction or decree. 
    But I would assume that any municipality like Birmingham demonstrations of this nature would be aimed at the hope of convincing the local government to change some law or some procedure. 
    Now let's see what these defendants did. 
    They mounted by outsiders the defendant's majority were outsider. 
    They come in to the city of Birmingham at a time when the people of the City of Birmingham had voted to change its form of government. 
    Now, who has the deciding vote in that election? 
    The majority of the voters who voted for the new form of government were Negros. 
    And they voted overwhelming for the new form of government. 
    They have had had an election. 
    Commissioner Connor had run against Mayor Boutwell, and Mayor Boutwell had won the election. 
    And they started these demonstrations in April, first of April 1963. 
    And under the law, the new form of government went into -- they took office on April 15th. 
    Now who --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="5426.302" stopTime="5427.571">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    What was the election date?
speaker="j_m_breckenridge" startTime="5427.571" stopTime="5578.207">
    Mr. J. M. Breckenridge 
    The Election Day was several months before that because they had to have a change in qualifying the candidates. 
    I think probably eight -- seven to eight months along the (Inaudible). 
    I don't have the exact date. 
    But they had changed the form of government, candidates had qualified. 
    They've elected a council of nine and they had elected a mayor. 
    And they were take place, take office on April 15th. 
    They started these demonstrations when the old government was in there. 
    I don't know what they expected them to do or what they -- would have been reasonable to expect. 
    I don't know what the purpose was. 
    But they started at a time; it would seem to me reasonable to have waited, to not have started it. 
    But they started it. 
    Now they had -- one of the witnesses testified that somewhat over 40 meetings. 
    We have never contended that we have in any way interfered with freedom of speech. 
    This injunction ordered the city, one of the witnesses in this case testifies that he'd been over 20 meetings and there'd been many more that mounting this campaign. 
    There had been usurpation of the streets prior to this that matters in this injunction. 
    If you read the affidavits on the complaint you have seen that there was possible disorders in the streets of Birmingham which might occur and with the change in government and the possible disorders, and the fight that the Court has authority to issue an injunction to hold a status quo and determine the validity of this ordinance are to modify the injunction or to give the right or to require the city governing body to let them parade. 
    They chose not to follow that injunction. 
    They chose to disobey it. 
    Not because we're vague and uncertain, of course, they didn't know what they were enjoined but to select certain things. 
    They were definite in that. 
    Instead of these, we will disobey. 
    We will march. 
    We will -- we want everybody to come in and help us march. 
    That's the effect of it, and they did do it. 
    And the injunction citation was obtained. 
    All they had to do under Alabama law was file a motion to dissolve the injunction and to modify it. 
    They could have had a hearing in a few days. 
    And the time, there was nothing urgent about these demonstrations about the timing because the timing, it should have been waited until a new government took place. 
    Now what happened on April --

    Mr. J. M. Breckenridge 
    Well, that is correct. 
    And of course they applied -- they didn't apply to the governing body for a permit. 
    They don't know whether they would have gotten it or not. 
    I do know that they have been since a new form of government has taken over, I know of no denial of a permit for any parade --

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    But this is the old government still in office.
speaker="j_m_breckenridge" startTime="5618.249" stopTime="5635.719">
    Mr. J. M. Breckenridge 
    This was the old government. 
    Now, the new government came in -- on April 15th and the old government refused to vacate. 
    So the time of the trial of this case we had two municipal governments in city hall and the evidence indicates that it had only one isolated incidence for it -- incidence --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="5635.719" stopTime="5640.287">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    But what had (Voice Overlap) -- what had become of the motion for this rule (Inaudible)?
speaker="j_m_breckenridge" startTime="5640.287" stopTime="5749.371">
    Mr. J. M. Breckenridge 
    The motion of -- dissolution I believe Mr. McBee mentioned that this came first and that they have not moved to set it down because this was appeal to the Supreme Court of Alabama and permits for parades have all been -- have been granted by the new form of government whenever they were asked for. 
    And since the decision of Alabama Court of Appeals we have elected in view of that decision not to prosecute anybody for parading under these ordinance without a permit, awaiting on the Supreme Court of Alabama to determine. 
    Now, what I was saying about the situation, the one instance in situation that shows the confusion, not the confusion but the situation in the city hall and Mr. Shorz (ph) question to Mr. Connor -- when Mr. Connor he says, “You are commissioner Mr. Connor.” 
    Answer; “Uh-huh." 
    Former Commissioner -- Mr. Shorz (ph) says, "Former commission of the City of Birmingham?" 
    “Yes”, as Mr. Connor's answer. 
    Then he says, “Did you say former commissioner? 
    I am commissioner.” 
    So you can see that we had a time in Birmingham when this had to be handled delicately and properly. 
    Now, we think that the record shows that it was, that there was no First Amendment involved in this case. 
    They had all the meetings they wanted to. 
    They had all the hearings. 
    They could have gotten permits. 
    They did get permits after the new government came in. 
    This same group got permits to parade and got them. 
    Now we submit that there's no First Amendment freedom in this case. 
    And I say this --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="5749.371" stopTime="5752.273">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Yes, that was your opponent's claim?
speaker="j_m_breckenridge" startTime="5752.273" stopTime="5862.968">
    Mr. J. M. Breckenridge 
    Well, I say we submit that there is no First Amendment case issue in this case. 
    They claim there is as I understand them. 
    Our opponents claim there is a First Amendment by saying to -- to modify United Mine Workers, to accept First Amendment. 
    It matter so that in this -- so they evidently assume that this case involved the First Amendment. 
    The First Amendment has never given the people the right to usurp the streets. 
    Freedom of speech as Mr. Douglas, Mr. Justice Douglas said in Thomas versus Collins, no one may be required to attain a license in order to speak, and we certainly agree with it. 
    But once he uses the economic power which he has in all the means, this was the (Inaudible) case. 
    And these -- and their jobs to influence their action, he is doing more than exercising the freedom of speech protected by the constitution. 
    Now we said take that same argument, same reasoning, and say that once they get in the streets, and use the streets so as to inconvenience of other people and to divert their use, they're using more than pure speech. 
    And that this case involves the use of the streets. 
    It has in it before this Court for the first time, a clear cut statement of the theory that we do not obey a law which we believe unjust which horrors right to the fundamental thought of the governing of a society. 
    It has that in there, a statement and it has it put into practice in refusing to obey an injunction.

    -- the new city code, we have changed that and in adopting a new city code in which we have completely taken out a many ordinances that were claimed objectionable.

speaker="earl_warren" startTime="5997.366" stopTime="6017.897">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well that's subsequent to that but do the records of your city show that as a practice, permits were granted by the vote of the City Commissioners or was it done ex parte through the clerk and the police officers.
speaker="j_m_breckenridge" startTime="6017.897" stopTime="6094.472">
    Mr. J. M. Breckenridge 
    Mr. Chief Justice, I'm going to have to say that I have not personally examined those records. 
    I will say that I believe they will show that they were granted on approval of at least two commissioners by the city clerk rather than formal action in the city commission meeting. 
    Now that would be my thought. 
    I have not reviewed the records but that -- I do think that that would be the results.Of course, I still say that that is not relevant to this case. 
    That if -- that they could have come to the jury and say look here Your Honor, we don't -- or not to have to go to the city commission to get these permits. 
    That's invalid in law if it is and I don't think it is. 
    But it's invalidly -- it has been invalidly applied. 
    And we would like for Your Honor to let us have the parades. 
    When our Judge Johnson did that, he said, “You take this parade from Selma to Montgomery. 
    And there've been in a number of cases in which -- even in Birmingham, the city has been enjoined in enforcing certain ordinances, in certain respects, and under the old co -- city code. 
    And so I say it is absolutely immaterial in this case whether it was or was not of practice because --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="6094.472" stopTime="6111.692">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    You mean that the city that granted permits through the clerk without any reference to the city council -- conference by the council at all over a long period of time. 
    And when these people came in they said, “We don't' have authority to do that.

    You've got to go to the city council and have them determine it at some future date?”
speaker="j_m_breckenridge" startTime="6117.982" stopTime="6228.179">
    Mr. J. M. Breckenridge 
    Mr. Chief Justice, I'd say you're correct if it was a prosecution -- violating of an order. 
    But it goes through the how -- by prosecution for contempt, for violating a court order. 
    A court order commands greater respect and must on our system of government command greater respect in an order. 
    Now in an ordinance, you can't test it except probably by being arrested. 
    But in the court order, the way as they are charted by the law for the purpose of protecting society as a whole sec -- if this order is wrong, come in and tell the judge. 
    And that's what these cases say through -- all through the country, that you modif -- come to the judge and get it modified and get it resolved out. 
    I'll give you one illustration, I got an order enjoining the -- me, eight or nine years back from playing night baseball in the certain park. 
    The case was applied only to one corner of the park. 
    We had a big lighted baseball down in another part of the park. 
    But we -- I -- we didn't play baseball in violation of that order. 
    I marched into the Court, filed a motion for modification, and of course, got it because it was an oversight. 
    But would it have been the same thing if we say it was an invalid order. 
    I would not -- you just cannot on our system of law disobey court order. 
    I think this Court knows that more than anyone of -- any of us, but in administering municipal affairs, that is a matter so important that I -- I personally don't think it's a big argument. 
    And I just want to say one thing --

    Mr. Breckenridge, may I ask you a question about Fields against City of Fairfield?

    Mr. J. M. Breckenridge 
    Yes sir.

    Justice Abe Fortas 
    In that case, the Court quoted from an earlier Alabama decision, ex parte National Association for Advancement of Colored People, 265 Alabama. 
    And then a part forward in the Fields case, it says this. 
    It is only where the Court lack jurisdiction of the proceeding. 
    Or where on the face of it, the order disobeyed was void. 
    Or where procedural requirements with respect to citation for a contempt and the like were not observed. 
    Or where the fact that contempt is not sustained that the order or judgment will be quashed. 
    That was a contempt case like this. 
    But reading that, it says that where on the face of it the order disobeyed was void.

    Yes, he did set it for the 22nd but on the 22nd was the day that both the contempt and the motion to dissolve came up. 
    He did set a time for hearing. 
    They both came up the same day. 
    We said, “Ours was filed first. 
    We thought it ought to be heard first. 
    It was prior". 
    The Courts said, "Well, I'm going to hear the contempt first". 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may I just have one minute?

    Mr. Jack Greenberg 
    Yes. 
    Mr. Justice Fortas asked about Fields versus City of Fairfield and I would like to say the language he quoted is on page 52 of our brief. 
    But in addition to that language, the Supreme Court of Alabama did pass upon the merits of the injunction and did pass upon the merits of the ordinance and treated with the Mine Workers question as going to jurisdiction in the disjunctive. 
    And therefore we claim that the merits of the injunction and the ordinance were there. 
    Justice Black asked, whether or not, Mr. Claiborne and I assume the same question applied to us would agree that the municipality can regulate the streets and perhaps under some circumstances prohibit use of the streets. 
    And certainly we would concede that that is the case. 
    No one denies that but, we think the law is clear that it must be done under precise standards, and it must be done on the basis of equality. 
    The quality is to all and I think that is our position in the case. 
    There has been some mention, Mr. Justice Black of the facts of the demonstrations. 
    That however was never an issue below. 
    The only thing was in issue was, was there a permit? 
    And in fact, the police testified that the marchers and the onlookers were separate. 
    The police had cleared out the area. 
    There was no vehicular traffic in the area. 
    There were no White people in the area. 
    Any disorder that occurred with the three or four arrest were not in the marchers, there were other people. 
    The police testified that they could have obtained assistance if they needed it from a sheriff's office or the state police but they did not need it and did not seek to get it. 
    Thank you.

    May I ask you just one question? 
    Was there any effort made -- I'm not sure if it's in the record, by the defendants or any other to get a permit either from a subordinate or from an inferior or superior officer?
speaker="jack_greenberg" startTime="6664.409" stopTime="6690.103">
    Mr. Jack Greenberg 
    Yes, there was Mr. Justice Black. 
    On a number of occasions, on April 3rd and on April 5th prior to this date, efforts to obtain permits were met by consistent rebuffs including Bull Connor saying when it -- when someone came into him, one of the commissioners, Mr. Breckenridge stated that two commissioners could grant a permit. 
    They went to one of the two. 
    Certainly that was proper and said, “How do I go about getting a permit to a parade in Birmingham?” 
    And he said, “Get out of here.

    Mrs. Lola Hendricks who was a representative of defendant Shuttlesworth and of the Alabama Christian Movement for Human Rights did that.
