    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Number 180, Norman See, Appellant, versus City of Seattle. 
    Mr. Dorsen.
speaker="norman_dorsen" startTime="11.435" stopTime="81.942">
    Mr. Norman Dorsen 
    May it please the Court. 
    This is a companion case to Number 92, Camara which was heard before the luncheon recess. 
    This is the fire inspection case. 
    It arises under the Fire Code of Seattle Washington. 
    The same basic question is presented under somewhat different ordinance whether the Constitution protects citizens against unwarranted searches. 
    And unwarranted search is stated in two senses, one without a search warrant and two without any reasonable cause to enter. 
    The statute in issue is on page 5 of the record and I'd like to read it to the Court. 
    8.01.050 inspection of buildings and premises: It shall be the duty of the Fire Chief to inspect, and he may enter all buildings and premises except the interiors of dwellings as often as may be necessary for the purpose of ascertaining and causing to be corrected any conditions liable to cause fire or any violations to the provisions of this Title and of any other ordinance concerning fire hazards. 
    There are a couple of other ordinances and they're also in the record at the end of the Fire Code. 
    The appellant --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="81.942" stopTime="83.738">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    It says anything except dwellings?
speaker="norman_dorsen" startTime="83.738" stopTime="85.050">
    Mr. Norman Dorsen 
    Except dwel -- dwellings Mr. Chief Justice.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="85.050" stopTime="86.957">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well --
speaker="norman_dorsen" startTime="86.957" stopTime="295.171">
    Mr. Norman Dorsen 
    Appellant, Mr. See was convicted under 8.01.140 which appears at page 11 of the record. 
    It says, “Anyone violating or failing to comply with any provision of this Title or a lawful order of the Fire Chief shall upon conviction thereof be punishable by a fine not to exceed $300 or imprisonment in the City Jail for a period not to exceed 90 days, or by both such fine and imprisonment, and each day of violation shall con -- constitute a separate offense. 
    In the light of the case you heard this morning and the light of Frank v. Maryland and Eaton v. Price, it is apparent that this ordinance is in a sense the ultimate weapon of municipalities because unlike the ordinance in Frank v. Maryland, this ordinance does not have any of the finely tailored provisions. 
    It does not have a provision providing that the inspector must have reasonable cause to find the nuisance. 
    It doesn't even provide that the inspection take place at reasonable times and each of the four other ordinances before this Court have such a provision. 
    The Eaton ordinance, the Frank ordinance, the Camara ordinance and the ordinance in Hadley v. City of Malden of Massachusetts which was filed in January and it's on the miscellaneous docket. 
    Not only that, that this ordinance says nothing about credentials. 
    In other words, this is an ordinance which is completely open-ended as far as the power of inspection is concerned. 
    Now, the facts in this case are stipulated, they were stipulated from the start and they appear on pages 1 and 2 of the record. 
    Mr. See, the appellant, is the owner of a private warehouse in the City of Seattle. 
    The Fire Department, to its authorized representative demanded the defendant that an inspection be allowed as to the premises. 
    The Fire Department did not procure a search warrant and it made no claim that the Fire Department had any reasonable cause to believe a violation of the ordinance existed at the time of the demand. 
    The appellant refused to admit the inspection. 
    Eventually a warrant was issued for his arrest. 
    He was convicted in the Municipal Court, fined a $100 and a suspended fine. 
    He posted his bond, he appealed to the Superior Court of Washington which affirmed, and he then appealed to the Supreme Court of Washington which affirmed in an opinion which is cont -- which begins on page 17 of the record. 
    The constitutional issues before the Court were raised seasonably below and were passed on by the Supreme Court of Washington. 
    The basic position of the appellant in this is case is that Frank v. Maryland should be overruled, that a warrant should be required. 
    Alternatively, if Frank v. Maryland is not overruled, it is urged that the Court reverse this conviction, it reversed the decision below anyway because of the breadth of the ordinance and because of the failure to include the requirements of probable cause, a requirement which was contained in the ordinance of Baltimore, Maryland and Frank in the Frank case now which was stressed by both Justices Frankfurter and Whittaker in their two opinions with the majority. 
    As far as overruling Frank v. Maryland, the basic position is that there must be some protection to the citizens against the man knocking on the door. 
    There must be some responsible way of determining the validity of the request for entry.

    Justice Abe Fortas 
    That's solely because of the factor of ownership though.
speaker="norman_dorsen" startTime="338.616" stopTime="358.330">
    Mr. Norman Dorsen 
    That's correct. 
    We're dealing here with private property and as Mr. Justice Stewart pointed out in the earlier case, the Fourth Amendment has been consistently applied to protect a commercial premises as well as dwelling. 
    And our position is that even in that case, the man who owns the premises is entitled to have the authority seek a warrant. 
    I would like to read --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="358.330" stopTime="368.155">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Suppose this was a -- open business for people who'd come and go, would you still say they have no right to go in and inspect it?
speaker="norman_dorsen" startTime="368.155" stopTime="397.628">
    Mr. Norman Dorsen 
    I think a distinction would have to be made between this case and that. 
    And I think even in that case Mr. Chief Justice that part of the premises which were open to the public could be entered upon by inspector. 
    That any part of the premises that was not open to the public, for example the prescription room of a pharmacy or the workshop of the private office of the owner of a department store for example that was open to the public, I would say the same rule would apply as the one we are urging in this case.

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Suppose they had the books that they were -- in the part of the building that's open to the public, do they have the right to seize those books without a search warrant?
speaker="norman_dorsen" startTime="405.687" stopTime="414.426">
    Mr. Norman Dorsen 
    No, I don't think so. 
    The books are private property and they're owned specifically by the owner and I think a warrant would be required for books as I think the Court has held and do alleged --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="414.426" stopTime="415.884">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Books with the effects under the Fourth Amendment?
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="415.884" stopTime="417.162">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    That's correct.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="417.162" stopTime="418.108">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Wouldn't it?
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="418.108" stopTime="445.865">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Yes, Mr. Justice. 
    In our reply brief, we say, summarizing the position we urged upon this Court that there must be some judicial barrier to the exercise of unchecked discretions by administrative official, this is on page 3, who are seeking to gain admission to private premises. 
    There must be some rational means of assuring a private citizen that his property is being opened as part of a rational inquiry of authorized representatives of local government.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="445.865" stopTime="458.254">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Well, suppose this were an open field and you have an inspection statute, does the -- does the Fourth Amendment apply that?
speaker="norman_dorsen" startTime="458.254" stopTime="460.738">
    Mr. Norman Dorsen 
    To an -- to an open pasture field?
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="460.738" stopTime="463.593">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Yes. 
    Pasture not even a cow?
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="463.593" stopTime="464.509">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    As the Hester case maybe?
speaker="norman_dorsen" startTime="464.509" stopTime="521.283">
    Mr. Norman Dorsen 
    Well, you -- you do -- push me further than I thought I was going to have to go. 
    I would say that -- if the -- the pasture were fenced off, it was kept as a private preserve that it should not be entered upon without seeking some intervention by a magistrate. 
    I'd like to say at this point very squarely in view of the discussion in the Camara case that the appellant and the position we're taking here is not attempting to subvert legitimate inspections of any character. 
    The question in this case is how to accommodate the public interest in the inspection and the interest of the private citizen in his privacy. 
    And this of course is fully consistent with the words of the Fourth Amendment which talk about unreasonable searches and seizures. 
    The key is that the unwilling door need not be opened without a showing to an independent judge that a valid administrative need exists.

    Mr. Norman Dorsen 
    That's right Mr. Justice.

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    -- you said. 
    But suppose that had a provision comparable to that in the San Francisco that there's an annual inspection according to some routine plan of inspecting all of the buildings of -- kinds of buildings in this?
speaker="norman_dorsen" startTime="559.994" stopTime="579.655">
    Mr. Norman Dorsen 
    I would say that -- that that would be sufficient. 
    I would say that that was sufficient. 
    In the dissent in Eaton it was pointed out that a regular rou -- routinized spot check or a check of all the houses in a particular neighborhood. 
    It presents to a magistrate would serve to -- to provide the factual predicate for the issuance of the warrant.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="579.655" stopTime="601.049">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, Mr. Dorsen, what if you have this particular statute but you have an administrative arrangement, a set of regulations issued by the health people saying where every year we do -- we do -- and it turns out that this inspection in this case was a routine annual inspection according to the plan.
speaker="norman_dorsen" startTime="601.049" stopTime="617.071">
    Mr. Norman Dorsen 
    Well, I think that if the inspector showed up without a warrant the individual would be entitled to say to the inspector “Go to the magistrate and present these facts to the magistrate.” 
    And if for example under the facts you suggest Mr. Justice White the regulation say at one year --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="617.071" stopTime="618.590">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    And you would say he could get this warrant?
speaker="norman_dorsen" startTime="618.590" stopTime="642.313">
    Mr. Norman Dorsen 
    He would. 
    But supposing to take a -- a case that is I think cognate to the one you suggest supposing for seven years they never inspected anyone else in that neighborhood but only this man, I think the magistrate would be entitled to ask some questions. 
    Even though under a -- the factual statement you made of -- of a regularized one year annual inspection, I would think that would be perfectly valid.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="642.313" stopTime="650.127">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, I take it -- I take it, if there was a warrant before him that the warrants could issue on the complaints on specific cases?
speaker="norman_dorsen" startTime="650.127" stopTime="672.945">
    Mr. Norman Dorsen 
    That's correct. 
    If there was a reasonable suspicion for example, the dissent in Frank v. Maryland which also dealt with this problem suggested that experience may show that there was -- there's a need for periodic inspection of certain types of dwelling and specifically said that the mere passage of time may show that the inspection is -- is valid under the Fourth Amendment. 
    In that case, the warrant was issued.

    Mr. Norman Dorsen 
    Yes, in certain situations. 
    I think that it depends of course on the path -- on the length of time that had passed and what Mr. Justice Douglas did not stipulate precise --

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr.

    Certainly is.
speaker="norman_dorsen" startTime="740.713" stopTime="744.303">
    Mr. Norman Dorsen

    Something -- something other than probable cause, is that it?
speaker="norman_dorsen" startTime="747.172" stopTime="764.482">
    Mr. Norman Dorsen 
    A different type of probable cause. 
    It's a different type of probable cause, for example, in -- in the facts you have to show to search a house from the facts you have to show the search an automobile, from the facts that you have to show to search a house in the daytime, and the facts that you have to show the house -- to search a house in the evening. 
    And that doesn't cheapen the Fourth Amendment.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="764.482" stopTime="775.245">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well, it's seems to me that if you can just show, we haven't inspected this place for a year.

    Mr. Norman Dorsen 
    I would not say so.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well, now with -- it was just a spot check, a periodic random spot check be a reasonable plan. 
    That's certainly a very accepted way of operating in -- in areas like checking (Voice Overlap) --
speaker="norman_dorsen" startTime="800.874" stopTime="802.843">
    Mr. Norman Dorsen

speaker="norman_dorsen" startTime="805.470" stopTime="808.157">

    And be easily --
speaker="norman_dorsen" startTime="808.796" stopTime="909.732">
    Mr. Norman Dorsen 
    That is a sound way of ensuring against fire hazards which is what the ultimate purpose of the inspections system is, it would seem to me that that would be a reasonable way go about it and not “unreasonable” under the words of the Fourth Amendment. 
    And I might say, in connection with your question Mr. Justice Stewart that the Supreme Court of Washington and in this case in connection with the dwelling part of the statute. 
    There's a specific provision dealing with dwellings, .040 which says on page five of the record. 
    I think this is very pertinent to your question. 
    The statute says, the ordinance says, “The Fire Chief shall may enter, investigate and inspect any dwelling -- any dwelling when he has reasonable cause to believe a violation of the provisions of this Title exists.” 
    On page 19 of the record, the Supreme Court of Washington interpreted that provision of the ordinance and said, “In noting the distinction between dwellings and commercial premises it will be noted that . 
    050 specifically accepts the interiors of dwellings and consequently,” this is in the middle of the page on the record 19, “and consequently the same may not be inspected against the owner's will without a warrant.” 
    What the Supreme Court of Washington say and nevertheless word on what the ordinance of Seattle means is that you can't have warrant, and presumably they had some realistic or understandable standards in mind when they impose this requirement. 
    And now of course, this is -- it is not our case specifically by points up I think -- the -- the question you -- you asked which is of course a critical one namely what exactly is going to be shown to the magistrate. 
    And that is --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="909.732" stopTime="917.569">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    If the Fourth Amendment requires nothing more than a -- an automatic rubberstamp on a piece of paper, we're not talking about it very much in this case, are we?

    Mr. Norman Dorsen 
    Well, I -- I certainly agree with that but I don't think, I'm suggesting -- I don't mean to suggest that that's all of this, a rubberstamp.

    Mr. Norman Dorsen 
    That is -- is our position Mr. Justice.

    Mr. Norman Dorsen 
    That is correct. 
    Now, the -- a point that was emphasized by the appellees of the Camara nearly serves to -- to illustrate, it seems, to me the desirability of requiring the warrant. 
    There are hundreds and hundreds of inspection programs that are potentially available to infringe the privacy and infringe individual property. 
    And it seems to me that the person who has to open the door, who has to let the man in is in the position of complete weakness and -- and without the kind of protection that it seems to me the Constitution requires.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1066.132" stopTime="1086.724">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well, it seems to me if the problem would be really if -- if somebody comes to your door under the warrant you have very little choice about whether or not you would let him in. 
    And if he comes there simply as an inspector under a statute you perhaps have more choice. 
    You can -- about finding out whether he really is an inspector or if he's an impostor.

    Well, the importance --

    Then you can say, “I'm sorry, I'm not going to let you in until you show me that you are a member of the Fire Department.”

    Mr. Norman Dorsen 
    Well, of course that again is a serious problem. 
    I would answer that Mr. Justice Stewart by saying that the law should provide a way for the individual, for the citizen, the property owner, to get that determination before his acting at his peril. 
    Before his acting at his peril under the criminal law, that was stressed in -- in the dissent in the Eaton case and I think it's -- it's --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1111.040" stopTime="1135.955">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Not if I say, if somebody comes to your house with a warrant which you say can be -- as I understand you can be issued by a magistrate at simply upon the showing of the Fire Department that we're making a random irrational spot check of various building in the city, and this is one of the buildings and then the warrant issued and you show up at that building and that person hasn't got any choice but let you in.

    Mr. Norman Dorsen 
    Well, this -- that -- that point is of course raises it seems to me the second central issue here and that is, that no matter how one feels on the question we're now discussing, the ordinance in this case points of as shortly as any that I have seen the kind of unlimited at large authority that some municipalities are prepared to attempt to invest their inspectors with. 
    Here is the case where you do not have a requirement of reasonable cause. 
    There is no requirement that you show me your credentials. 
    There is no requirement that'd be in the day time. 
    Now, this of course as we said in the earlier case that it seems to me that -- that the decision below could be reversed from that ground alone.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1184.936" stopTime="1195.776">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well, my -- my question was this, that if you're right that all that's required is a warrant then you come with a warrant and the person has a duty as you say to let this man in if he has a warrant --
speaker="norman_dorsen" startTime="1195.776" stopTime="1195.962">

    Well, there --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1195.962" stopTime="1206.674">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    -- whereas under the existing statute without a warrant, it would seem to me, he has no such duty. 
    He can say, “I don't know whether or not you're a member the Fire Department besides that I'm having dinner, come back at some other time.”
speaker="norman_dorsen" startTime="1206.674" stopTime="1244.740">
    Mr. Norman Dorsen 
    I don't think if I understand this word means correctly. 
    If I understand the wording of the Camara case correctly that that is so Mr. Justice Stewart. 
    I do feel you do have a duty to let the man in. 
    The impostor problem is not going to be solved either way. 
    Either way, the man can come and say he's an inspector. 
    Either way he can come although with more difficulty it seems to me to try to forge a warrant. 
    That is not the easy -- easiest thing to do. 
    But in both cases -- in both cases under this ordinance and the ordinance in the Camara case you have to let the man in and you're acting at your peril. 
    I would prefer to leave the remaining time for rebuttal if may Mr. -- 
   
   
   
   Argument of A. L. Newbould
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1244.740" stopTime="1251.332">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Very well. 
    Mr. Newbould.
speaker="a_l_newbould" startTime="1251.332" stopTime="1476.199">
    Mr. A. L. Newbould 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    As has been stated by the appellant, the ordinance before the Court today is the Seattle Fire Code. 
    Generally speaking this ordinance regulates the handling of combustible materials and liquids. 
    The construction and maintenance of certain buildings, the equipment that must be put into plants and warehouses and apartment houses, and what we refer to as highlight for occupancies, all in connection with fire prevention activities. 
    The ordinance as a whole is directed towards flammable and explosive materials and liquids. 
    The method of obtaining compliance with this ordinance is one that's been in existence in the cities since about 1884 in one form or another. 
    Today, it involves a fire inspection program. 
    Virtually every member of the Seattle Fire Department, it is involved in this inspection program and it goes on during the non-winter months of the year. 
    The object of the ordinance is remedial and not punitive. 
    We are not attempting here to -- or our object here is not to put people in jail or to put fines on our citizens but to attempt to cure a defect, or error of omission if you please before the fire actually occurs. 
    The ultimate goal then is one of cooperative compliance not penalty. 
    When we look at Mr. See's warehouse, the Fire Department didn't come to his warehouse and ask for an inspection. 
    Demand is one way to put it, request is another way. 
    There was no immediate entry into the warehouse, it's been some three years now and the Fire Department is still not in the warehouse. 
    What are we talking about in sense of -- of the interest of these men in this warehouse. 
    A warehouse is a possessory of right of property interest. 
    We're not talking about intimate personal relationships; we're talking solely about property rights. 
    We don't have the problem here of the young lady at the door who is afraid of who is going to come in. 
    We look at the Fourth Amendment, we look to see whether or not the Seattle Ordinance has interfered with Mr. See's security and his person, his house, his paper, or his personal effect. 
    We find out that if there is an interference it's one with a “property right” such as it maybe. 
    Now, historically in this country, inspections have been accepted as non-Fourth Amendment process. 
    Principally, the Fourth Amendment has been directed at criminal prosecutions and the accumulation of evidence for those prosecutions. 
    While in some of the cases, particularly Frank, abuses this type of inspection process are being predicted. 
    The facts are that these abuses have not arisen. 
    Mr. See here does not claim that the Fire Department was harassing him, that they broke down his door, that he came at a non-reasonable time, that they were other than harassing then repeated that they were picking on him for some particular violations. 
    In fact, they did not know whether or not Mr. See had violated the ordinance. 
    We're getting here to the point that the fire inspector, at the time these firemen did not know whether or not Mr. See had a fire hazard within his building. 
    He does not know the contents.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="1476.199" stopTime="1483.917">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Under your argument, it's reasonable to give them a right to inspect?

    Mr. A. L. Newbould 
    We take the attitude that the -- and the Supreme Court analyzed it this way. 
    While the word reasonableness is not in the ordinance, this is an implied requirement by law that the ordinance, the inspection provisions of the ordinance be administered reasonably. 
    I would say that there is no right to force entry into Mr. See's warehouse.

    Mr. A. L. Newbould 
    In the interpretation of the ordinance. 
    If there were a particular conviction there would be a requirement that the inspection have been a reasonable inspection. 
    That you can't imply into the ordinance that it authorizes unreasonable inspections. 
    This is our alternative and my point is that any enforcement and the practical enforcement of this ordinance there will be a requirement that each area of the inspection process be reasonable and to the extent that it becomes then unreasonable, it becomes outside the legislative authority.

speaker="a_l_newbould" startTime="1599.416" stopTime="1607.686">
    Mr. A. L. Newbould 
    In the final analysis, no. 
    The inspection process is not a Fourth Amendment prohibited procedure. 
    Because it --

    It is not a procedure prohibited or proscribe by the Fourth Amendment. 
    So long as we're dealing with safety inspections of buildings and we do not touch the person, we do not interfere with the intimate relationships of his home, we do not interfere with his papers or his effects.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="1627.991" stopTime="1630.526">

speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2540.634" stopTime="2542.426">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    But what's the practice?
speaker="a_l_newbould" startTime="2542.426" stopTime="2651.853">
    Mr. A. L. Newbould 
    We have never been into the problem. 
    We don't go into residences. 
    We don't go into residences under the Fire Code even in apartment buildings. 
    The question so far as I know has never been raised in connection with an urban renewal housing inspection program, so that the legal issue to be passed on by the Court just has never been there. 
    As I say this is dicta in the case because we were not here dealing with a residence. 
    Let me make a distinction or -- or draw a distinction between the normal search warrant process and the suggestion that the appellant makes here that we obtained some other kind of warrant. 
    Now, the minute we move into the search warrant process, the first thing we have is a criminal proceeding. 
    When we -- there's -- there's a lot of difference between an inspector going to a house owner and saying, “May I inspect?” 
    And the inspector or same official with a warrant saying, “It's time now to get in”. 
    This is hard to put in words but a -- from personal experience there is nothing more officious than someone with the Court process. 
    We're talking about the feelings of the individuals within the house or within the business. 
    It's a more severe process to enter with judicial process than it is to ask permission to enter. 
    And that's actually what happens here. 
    Mr. See said no when the firemen asked him permission to enter. 
    And he continued to say no. 
    And he come later in a formal demand and a formal refusal by a letter. 
    Now, this is much different and what happened if -- our lieutenant from a leather company showed up at Mr. See's warehouse with his warrant.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2651.853" stopTime="2686.968">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well, the fact that they were entitled to demand the warrant would mean that every household you would have to present a warrant to every businessman or every household within it then we would go to them and say you want to inspect. 
    Then I suppose 99 out of a 100 people which says they always have that “Go ahead and inspect.” But if a person did demand one, well then you could have the -- the search warrant and -- and that he wouldn't have any right to say and if that was any more severe than otherwise, would he?
speaker="a_l_newbould" startTime="2686.968" stopTime="2844.949">
    Mr. A. L. Newbould 
    If -- in my opinion it would be more severe, Your Honor. 
    In the San Francisco case, the property owner put the inspector off three times for whatever reason. 
    I asked a question by way of answering how may times does the inspector with a warrant is going to be put off? 
    Not at all, and now this doesn't matter whether we come with -- in with our warrant first or we come in with our warrant second. 
    Now, the -- the warrant process itself, when I go to obtain a search warrant, I go ex parte. 
    I take my justification up. 
    I give the justification to the administrative officer and whatever the reasons are under oath, if the judge will have to agree they accept the facts as determination of one of the probable cause from the facts. 
    There may well be some reason why the inspector shouldn't come in today or this month. 
    And it may well rate -- relate to Fourth, First, or Fifth Amendment freedoms. 
    But in any event, those considerations are not before the Court in the ex parte search warrant proceedings. 
    The next question here on our -- in our search warrant, well how about our question of probable cause? 
    In a sense, I was delighted with the first case because it's either no inspections on a routine basis or an inspection only on the same showing with a probable cause according to the appellant and a probable legal cause. 
    Appellant here is a bit more reasonable in saying, “Well a spot check or a -- a routine inspection program.” 
    My suggestion here is that the routine inspection program can be put into a mimeographed warrant, a mimeographed justification and I can leave blank in that mimeograph the number of the house and possibly the name of the person although I don't see why I need it, because this isn't a personal process and a blank for signatures. 
    Now, what's the -- the City of Seattle adopts an annual fire inspection program that becomes the justification. 
    And I cannot see how that justification becomes any better or any less better or this routine inspection becomes better or worse, or the protection for the propety owner becomes more or less when this mimeographed form is submitted to a magistrate to sign in accordance with the annual inspection program, I -- I don't think it's a real --

    Let's look at --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2857.965" stopTime="2923.113">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well, that would at least show, I presume, the -- the fact that the search was a -- was authorized and I suppose that if -- would you designate the -- the warrant would designate the extent of the search. 
    I suppose that if the city had a -- have a -- an ordinance based upon the experience of the city to the effect that certain things were fire hazards and they were very common in the city and they were investigated in. 
    I suppose when a -- if a man demanded a warrant, search warrant and the Court issued a search warrant, then one issued was a warrant for a general search of the -- of a house, it issued a warrant for the purpose of inspecting it in order to determine whether or not certain fire hazards existed there. 
    And that would be the end of it and he wouldn't be able to go in and look in drawers or doors and -- and things of that kind in his -- in his search, would he?
speaker="a_l_newbould" startTime="2923.113" stopTime="2938.724">
    Mr. A. L. Newbould 
    This is the precise extent of his authority now. 
    And the question is, will he abuse his authority under the ordinance or will he abuse his authority under this so-called search warrant? 
    My answer is that if he's going to abuse it in the first place, he's going to it abuse it in the second.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2938.724" stopTime="2948.184">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren

    He's -- and they're going to your home for the purpose of determining whether there are the electrical fixtures are -- are properly installed or whether there are any fire hazards.” 
    And if he starts looking at some place else, you're going to have to say to them, “Well that --that isn't included in this warrant. 
    You're looking for that.” 
    But if a fellow just comes in and said, “Here I'm -- I'm here to inspect your home.” 
    He walks in and has quite blank to -- to look for what he wants and the owner doesn't know, it isn't limited by -- by any authority that's given to him that the owner knows anything about, how can he protect his rights?
speaker="a_l_newbould" startTime="3033.070" stopTime="3066.582">
    Mr. A. L. Newbould 
    The best answer I can make to that is that the homeowner who will insist on a warrant will be the same own -- homeowner, who under our present systems, ask the inspector what's the extent of your authority. 
    And if they have any doubt as to it, they send him away to come back another day. 
    This is the ultimate protection and I submit it's a protection that's not fair with the warrant process. 
    And it's one that the judicial officer, the magistrate cannot import into the inspection process. 
    We lose more than we gain by an inspection warrant.

    Mr. Norman Dorsen 
    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 
    I would like merely to say that I think the suggested solution to the problem that appellant urges is a fair and appropriate accommodation of the important interest of the private citizens' rights for security of his private property on the one hand and the undoubted and legitimate interest of -- of urban society, and of course eve -- even suburban society to inspect and that the purpose of urging the solution that I have upon the Court is in large part because it's just as easy, just as easy for the inspector to go and get a search warrant than arrest warrant. 
    And the fellow says, “You can't come in” why put him at his -- at his peril and into wrong peril with the criminal law, send the man to the inspector to a disinterested magistrates, have him present a colorable and valid administrative reason for the entry and then the legitimate interest of the municipality can be accommodated.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Mr. Dorsen, I suppose your argument would lead to our requirement that a meter reader would have a search warrant to come in and read the water meter. 
    If he were a public official of the city -- city water system.
speaker="norman_dorsen" startTime="3148.354" stopTime="3150.553">
    Mr. Norman Dorsen 
    Yes.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3150.553" stopTime="3157.001">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    And the -- the search warrant, in order to get a search warrant how -- would you have to allege as simply that you haven't read the meter in a month?
speaker="norman_dorsen" startTime="3157.001" stopTime="3158.317">
    Mr. Norman Dorsen 
    That's right. 
    If he -- he's --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3158.317" stopTime="3161.031">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    What possibly is then is the purpose of the warrant?
speaker="norman_dorsen" startTime="3161.031" stopTime="3208.674">
    Mr. Norman Dorsen 
    Well, I can answer that fast very easily by saying that some people who are searching, some people who are inspecting, may be doing it arbitrarily, may be doing it as part of harassment. 
    Secondly, the distinction between the ordinance in this case, the ordinance in -- in the See v. Seattle as compared with the ordinances we have had in the other cases before this Cour -- Court illustrates the extent to which municipalities are prepared to go and not providing notice. 
    The reason -- the answer to your question, it seems me, that one way to solve that problem is to give a man notice or make an appointment. 
    The English statute that was -- was cited in the -- in dissenting opinions in both Eaton and Price and Frank said that the man should call up and make an appointment.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3208.674" stopTime="3209.615">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well, that has nothing to do with probable cause.
speaker="norman_dorsen" startTime="3209.615" stopTime="3210.523">
    Mr. Norman Dorsen 
    Right.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3210.523" stopTime="3212.300">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    That has to do with the householders' convenience. 
    And as --
speaker="norman_dorsen" startTime="3212.300" stopTime="3212.543">
    Mr. Norman Dorsen 
    Well, that's true.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3212.543" stopTime="3222.717">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    -- suggested to you that the -- the present statute from the point of view of householders' convenience gives much preference to a warrant because a man armed with a warrant can come in despite the householders' inconvenience.
speaker="norman_dorsen" startTime="3222.717" stopTime="3235.503">
    Mr. Norman Dorsen 
    That's correct. 
    As they -- I was just going to say that the very English, the English statute that was cited provides that you have to make an appointment, but if the man still refuses then you have to go the independent judicial magistrate.

    Mr. Norman Dorsen

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Mr. Dorsen, suppose the inspector had known the magistrate, sworn that there was a local ordinance or statute which permitted him to make periodic inspections in the interest of safety, would you think that would be sufficient ground to issue a search warrant?
speaker="norman_dorsen" startTime="3314.445" stopTime="3325.812">
    Mr. Norman Dorsen 
    I think he -- the way I -- I would answer that question, Mr. Justice Black, is you would have to say something one step more. 
    We have also to say that this particular inspection is pursuant to that plan.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="3325.812" stopTime="3327.417">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    I suppose you said that.
speaker="norman_dorsen" startTime="3327.417" stopTime="3333.798">
    Mr. Norman Dorsen 
    I think the -- the last thing that he might have to say is what the plan was?

    What the what?

    What -- what the plan of inspection was?

speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="3348.645" stopTime="3352.120">

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Another way of what I'm asking is that, do you think that in order to get a search warrant, it is sufficient to rely upon the judgment of the legislative body that periodic to the inspection one each year or two each year are necessary, and that in order to comply with that part, that that's our law, the inspector must now be allowed to inspect in this house.

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Now, assuming that to be the case, why would an ordinance which permitted the search -- search without a warrant but on the probable cause that -- creation of the periodic right to search, to inspect why would an ordinance be invalid?

    Which did the same thing that would be done in case of the issuance of the search warrant.

    Mr. Norman Dorsen 
    Well, I don't think I would -- I would draw a distinction between that but I do think that the inspector would have -- I think that the key element is the fact that the person who wants to gain entry must go to the magistrate and swear that he is conducting the inspection pursuant to this plan and that he -- and that he give in -- in the warrant the -- the essential facts and I -- I, how far you'd -- you'd go for specificity, how far you'd require him to show that for example this plan was a plan relating to a specific neighborhood and defining the neighborhood and defining --

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    But it's just limited to the city. 
    You've got a right to make the search in order to discover fire hazards under an ordinance and you'll search, and you'll enter into the house. 
    And that that's what he wants to get in there for?
speaker="norman_dorsen" startTime="3495.018" stopTime="3496.852">
    Mr. Norman Dorsen 
    I would permit the search in that case.

    But well if that's the case. 
    Why is an ordinance invalid which provides for certainty in inspection upon the basis that periodical searches are necessary?
speaker="norman_dorsen" startTime="3512.601" stopTime="3527.660">
    Mr. Norman Dorsen 
    I would say it is not invalid but I -- but the citizen is still entitled to the protection he gets by having the inspector go to the magistrate and affirm that the inspections taking place is part of that plan.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="3527.660" stopTime="3537.547">
    Justice Hugo L. Black

speaker="norman_dorsen" startTime="3537.547" stopTime="3566.133">
    Mr. Norman Dorsen 
    Well, it's impossible that the inspection was not taking place pursuant to that plan and the fact that he is prepared to swear to it and affirm that this is part of the plan for fire inspection of this community or -- or a neighborhood, is a protection of the citizen, that the -- that the individual is being kept, that the -- that the inspector is being kept from the inside of the premises without -- with what -- on the facts you've presented Mr. Justice Black, seems to me a reasonable administrative plan for assuring that fires will not take place.

    Justice John M. Harlan 
    I suppose on the same argument, you are urging the Fire Chief saying that this time, he's making the periodic inspections and he shows that he's authorized to do so and that he's entitled do on A, B, C, D, E, would that suggest it?

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Dorsen, wouldn't it be one additional protection to the householder if he has a warrant? 
    A warrant would -- would indicate to what extent the -- the officer had a right to be in that house? 
    I suppose the search warrant you'd say that he -- he was authorized to enter the house for the purpose of inspecting the premises to see if these safety factors was there or if he just comes in on his own and he wants to -- to inspect the -- the house and he goes rummaging around in other -- other things, the -- the householder would have no -- no way to stop him or to say, “You can't go any farther than that, you haven't got the authority to do it.” 
    But if the warrant said that he could -- he could then challenge the man's right to do something that he wasn't entitled to under his inspection.

    Mr. Dorsen, may I ask you one other question. 
    Suppose one should believe that the regular routine annual practice of inspecting a fire hazard is within the power of the state, that's enough to justify an entry into the house. 
    How could he then say that the ordinance was invalid?
speaker="norman_dorsen" startTime="3695.750" stopTime="3698.862">

speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="3704.326" stopTime="3722.837">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    What I mean is if -- if the legislature has authorized inspection will be done under a system which does not violate the First -- the Fourth Amendment, how could we hold that that ordinance is invalid?

    Mr. Norman Dorsen 
    Well, I guess my answer to that question, Mr. Justice Black, is that an essential part of the validity in such an ordinance is that upon the refusal of entry by the individual that the government has to go to the magistrate to gain --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="3736.071" stopTime="3737.483">

    Is -- how would you say that?

    Mr. Norman Dorsen 
    That an essential part of the validity, a prerequisite to the validity and the ordinance that you describe is that even if it's tailored for daytime at reasonable times and so forth, that if the citizen says when the inspector comes, “I do not want you to enter”, that at that point, despite of the ordinance has worded you must go and get.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="3763.050" stopTime="3768.849">
