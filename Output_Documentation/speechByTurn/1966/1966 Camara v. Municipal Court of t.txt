    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Number 92, Roland Camara, Appellant, versus Municipal Court of the City and County of San Francisco. 
    Mr. Krause.
speaker="marshall_w_krause" startTime="34.742" stopTime="136.448">
    Mr. Marshall W. Krause 
    May it please the Court, Mr. Chief Justice and Associate Justices. 
    This is a health inspector case and involves with the meaning of the Fourth Amendment which is the vexing an important problem which has been with us for a long time. 
    The appellant in this case believes that the Fourth Amendment is more than written of mere words. 
    It was written of the long experience of the colonists under the English rule in framing the Fourth Amendment. 
    It was written as its very word state to protect the security of the citizens and residents of this country. 
    It was not meant to be a nose of wax to be twisted to the convenience of petty government officials. 
    This case arose when an official wish to inspect the apartment of the appellant because he had learned that the appellant was living in an apartment which he did not believe was covered by a certificate of occupancy in an apartment house. 
    He went to the appellant, asked him whether he as living in this apartment, the appellant said, “Yes, he was”. 
    The health inspector then said, “May I come in and inspect.” 
    The answer was, “Do you have a warrant? 
    Do you have a complaint?” 
    The answers to both of those questions were, “No. 
    This is a routine inspection.” 
    And it was a routine inspection, permission was denied. 
    Again, the health inspector came back --

    Justice John M. Harlan 
    (Inaudible) inspection required by the statute?
speaker="marshall_w_krause" startTime="146.119" stopTime="153.275">
    Mr. Marshall W. Krause 
    The appellee claims that that was the power that the inspector was pursuing at the time, yes.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="153.275" stopTime="160.880">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    But it was not done as it was in Frank versus Maryland, it's a relevant complaint by an individual?
speaker="marshall_w_krause" startTime="160.880" stopTime="259.866">
    Mr. Marshall W. Krause 
    No. 
    There was no complaint at all. 
    The only reason which has ever been offered is that the apartment may not have been the covered by the certificate of occupancy but that was sufficiently answered when the appellant said, "Yes, I do live here". 
    And then the inspector came back two more times and on the second -- third visit, November 22nd, 1963 in the afternoon, the inspector again required -- said that he wanted to enter the apartment. 
    It was denied, permission under exactly the same circumstances and for this offense on November 22nd, the appellant was charged with a crime. 
    We attempted to prohibit that crime through California procedures in the California Courts but that prohibition proceeding did not succeed because the courts below relied on Frank versus Maryland. 
    Now, the inspection was done under Section 503 of the San Francisco Municipal Code which provides that any city employee in the performance of his duties may inspect any premises at reasonable times as long as he is performing his duties. 
    You will note that the statute does not require any warrant. 
    It does not require any probable cause. 
    It was -- it does not require any complaint and no appointment is necessary.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="259.866" stopTime="271.377">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Now, the way you worded that, the way you said that was worded, that presumably I suppose with apply to a policeman looking for a contraband in a house or looking for a criminal?
speaker="marshall_w_krause" startTime="271.377" stopTime="288.929">
    Mr. Marshall W. Krause 
    It says any city official in the performance of his duties. 
    It's not limited in any way. 
    Although, it is a part of the Municipal Code the -- however, I would point out that the Municipal Code does contain criminal sections which punish certain acts as crimes.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="288.929" stopTime="311.543">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well, do you -- does it -- that wording it would seem to give blanket authority to the police department of the city to enter any house at anytime so long as he was looking for a criminal or looking for anything to do with the criminal offense without any warrant at all. 
    Is it -- as your -- has the State of California construed it to mean that?
speaker="marshall_w_krause" startTime="311.543" stopTime="337.772">
    Mr. Marshall W. Krause 
    No, they haven't. 
    In all fairness I should say, that I know of no instance where a policeman on his own in searching for some criminal evidence has used this statute as you say the wording of the statute as any city employee and certainly the policeman are city employees. 
    As of yet, no policeman has tried to use this section to my knowledge. 
    We have no guarantee that they wouldn't try it.

    Justice William O. Douglas 
    How about your Welfare Department?
speaker="marshall_w_krause" startTime="340.176" stopTime="372.392">
    Mr. Marshall W. Krause 
    The Welfare Department has not tried to use this section but we certainly maintain and there is a case in California called the Parrish Versus Alameda County where the Welfare Department does claim the right to come in to people receiving welfare and inspect to see if the regulations are being followed. 
    And we think that if this case should be affirmed that the welfare people would certainly take advantage of it as well as property tax people, urban development people, anyone who thought that they had a reasonable interest in coming into a home.

    Mr. Marshall W. Krause 
    Just mentioned it. 
    We don't -- we cite the Parrish case. 
    We don't discuss it fully. 
    We mentioned these examples that there and -- now, the --

    Is there any other cases interpreting this section other than this one?

    None your -- none at all.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    This is under the San Francisco Municipal Housing Code and I don't know about how your Supreme Court construe statutes but I would think that an ordinary -- at least to some accepted (Inaudible) construction as it would -- thought -- be thought to be limited to duties under that code.
speaker="marshall_w_krause" startTime="421.030" stopTime="423.996">
    Mr. Marshall W. Krause

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    But I understand that. 
    But I'm going back to my question about giving blanket authority to the police in San Francisco.
speaker="marshall_w_krause" startTime="428.797" stopTime="429.585">
    Mr. Marshall W. Krause 
    Yes.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="429.585" stopTime="432.050">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    I wouldn't think that this would --

    Mr. Marshall W. Krause 
    I would (Voice Overlap) --

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    (Inaudible) hearing from you about that?
speaker="marshall_w_krause" startTime="434.733" stopTime="442.655">
    Mr. Marshall W. Krause 
    I would doubt it and we don't claim that the police are using this to search for narcotics, peddlers or anything of that sort.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="442.655" stopTime="446.082">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Yes. 
    How about welfare? 
    That's not part of the Housing Code is it?
speaker="marshall_w_krause" startTime="446.082" stopTime="472.292">
    Mr. Marshall W. Krause 
    No, but the -- the why -- the reason I asked -- answered Mr. Justice Douglas' question the way I did is that this case obviously is going to be setting the trend for all such inspections. 
    And now under the law, if a health inspector is allowed to come in without a warrant certainly welfare inspectors, property tax people, other people interested in performing their duties officiously are not --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="472.292" stopTime="486.860">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Why is that so certain? 
    Why if you let an elevator inspector come into a building once a year to inspect the safety of an elevator, does it necessarily follow that welfare inspectors could knock on dwelling doors in the middle of the night.
speaker="marshall_w_krause" startTime="486.860" stopTime="512.177">
    Mr. Marshall W. Krause 
    Oh, I don't think the elevator inspector is an example which causes me any trouble because there's a public building and each elevator is licensed. 
    And we would contend that the elevator inspector has the right to come in and look at this license premises to determine whether it's safe. 
    And we contend that the health inspector has the right to come in to the public areas of an apartment house. 
    The fire inspector can look at the fire escapes. 
    It is only --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="512.177" stopTime="512.639">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Why?
speaker="marshall_w_krause" startTime="512.639" stopTime="512.808">
    Mr. Marshall W. Krause 
    -- the private area --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="512.808" stopTime="518.493">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Why if you're right? 
    Why can he without a warrant? 
    That building belongs to somebody even the public areas.
speaker="marshall_w_krause" startTime="518.493" stopTime="523.741">
    Mr. Marshall W. Krause 
    Yes. 
    That the reason that he can't without a warrant is that the Fourth Amendment says that the people shall be secure in their homes.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="523.741" stopTime="526.135">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    So I say why can he without a warrant? 
    Why can --
speaker="marshall_w_krause" startTime="526.135" stopTime="526.346">
    Mr. Marshall W. Krause 
    Oh!
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="526.346" stopTime="528.122">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    -- the elevator inspector come in annually?
speaker="marshall_w_krause" startTime="528.122" stopTime="532.400">
    Mr. Marshall W. Krause 
    Because this is the business premises open to the public and --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="532.400" stopTime="535.456">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Business premises are protected by the Fourth Amendment I think?
speaker="marshall_w_krause" startTime="535.456" stopTime="538.916">
    Mr. Marshall W. Krause 
    This is premises to the extent that they're not open to the public --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="538.916" stopTime="542.092">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    -- to the extent that the Fourth Amendment protects them they're protected, aren't they?
speaker="marshall_w_krause" startTime="542.092" stopTime="552.054">
    Mr. Marshall W. Krause 
    Well, persons, papers, effects and houses. 
    Now, whether the business premises come within those words or not is a question we don't need to answer.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="552.054" stopTime="556.762">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    I thought it had been long since decided by this Court that it had been answered --
speaker="marshall_w_krause" startTime="556.762" stopTime="557.202">
    Mr. Marshall W. Krause 
    Well --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="557.202" stopTime="559.597">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    -- that business offices are protected?
speaker="marshall_w_krause" startTime="559.597" stopTime="560.870">
    Mr. Marshall W. Krause 
    Yes. 
    There --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="560.870" stopTime="560.998">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Is it (Voice Overlap) --
speaker="marshall_w_krause" startTime="560.998" stopTime="562.410">
    Mr. Marshall W. Krause 
    There are protections for --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="562.410" stopTime="569.768">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    These structures, they belong to somebody. 
    It maybe a grasping landlord but he's a human being too, wasn't he? 
    He's protected?
speaker="marshall_w_krause" startTime="569.768" stopTime="812.603">
    Mr. Marshall W. Krause 
    Yes. 
    He's protected in the private areas but I don't think that if -- this Court has decided that if a man holds out his premises open to the public that he can object because a policeman walks in or because a health inspector walks in. 
    Those people have the right to enter just as any other member of the public or the premises' license such as a restaurant. 
    It has to maintain its license and as a condition of that license submits to inspection which all restaurants and other places do. 
    Then the inspectors may come in but homes, apartments, are not licensed and there is not that granting of consent. 
    Now, the Frank case is of course extremely important here. 
    We want to point out that the Frank case was decided before Mapp versus Ohio and the Frank case in its terminology and its discussion is all Fourteenth Amendment due process reasonableness. 
    We think that Mapp versus Ohio in deciding unequivocally that the Fourth Amendment contains the exclusionary rule binding on the states changes the complexion and the view in which this Court should view a search and seizure case coming from the state courts. 
    We think now that there's no question that the full power of the Fourth Amendment applies to such cases. 
    The Frank case found two kinds of security protected under the Fourth Amendment. 
    They found the security to be protected against the search for criminal evidence, to be protected by the warrant procedure but it said, when there's no specific search for criminal evidence then only test is reasonableness and no warrant is required. 
    That was the dichotomy drawn by Frank. 
    We don't think that this dichotomy is acceptable anymore now that the Fourth Amendment is fully applicable to the States. 
    But we point out that the Fourth Amendment is not limited in terms in any distinction between a criminal search and a noncriminal search. 
    It is drafted to protect security and does not mention the Fourth Amendment. 
    Does not mention the -- any dichotomy between criminal and non criminal. 
    It is true that when we're considering what effect the Fifth Amendment has when considered with the Fourth Amendment then we consider the protection against self-incrimination then we consider the criminal elements of this. 
    There is no historical evidence that we have found to satisfy the idea that there should be a distinction between an intrusion into ones home or criminal evidence purposes and for not criminal evidence purposes. 
    Both are intrusions. 
    Both I think were objectionable in England on the right controversy over general warrants ensued and the idea in England as it should be here today in America is that warrants are required for all such intrusions. 
    The colonist had experience with the intrusion of government officials attempting to enforce laws, basically smuggling laws. 
    The colonist objected and I would say that John Adams and James Madison objected to the searches of homes not because some smuggled goods might be found and some goods might be forfeited or someone might be convicted of a crime but because of the insult that the intrusion into ones home causes. 
    The insult that a knock on the door is a statement that we have the right to enter and you don't have the right to keep us out and we don't have to even tell you if there's something wrong or if there's some complaint. 
    This is the insult --
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="812.603" stopTime="839.323">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    I'd like to -- I beg your pardon. 
    I'd like to know what if any sort of entry as you believe would be permit -- constitutionally permissible under this ordinance. 
    You started talking about that. 
    Now this particular inspection wasn't it annual -- apartment houses inspection for the purpose of issuing an occupancy license, is that right?
speaker="marshall_w_krause" startTime="839.323" stopTime="855.719">
    Mr. Marshall W. Krause 
    That's what the claim is, yes. 
    But the particular inspection of my client's apartment, the only reason given is because the apartment may not have been covered in the permit of occupancy because it was on the ground floor rather than on the second or third floor.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="855.719" stopTime="863.756">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    But there was a store on the ground floor of this apartment building and the claim was that your client lived in the rear of the store, is that right?
speaker="marshall_w_krause" startTime="863.756" stopTime="865.878">
    Mr. Marshall W. Krause 
    Yes, he did live in the rear of the store.

    Yes. 
    Now, do you believe that its cons -- it would be constitutionally impermissible for the inspector to enter this apartment building at all?
speaker="marshall_w_krause" startTime="879.233" stopTime="898.302">
    Mr. Marshall W. Krause 
    No, sir. 
    I don't. 
    I think that it's permissible for the inspector to enter the common areas of the apartment house such as the hallways and the fire escapes which are open to anyone to contact the manager to see that his license is being enforced.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="898.302" stopTime="905.672">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    So that you would confine this to areas to which the public does not have access.
speaker="marshall_w_krause" startTime="905.672" stopTime="919.865">
    Mr. Marshall W. Krause 
    Yes, sir. 
    I think the home is that bastion of privacy which not only the framers of the Fourth Amendment meant to protect but that we must protect to preserve the security and privacy which is so significant today, the home, yes.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="919.865" stopTime="934.386">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Yes. 
    But on the ground floor there was a store and that -- the rear of that store as I understand the fact, perhaps I'm wrong was being used as your client's home.

    Mr. Marshall W. Krause 
    Yes. 
    That was a separate apartment and there's no dis -- no problem with that.

    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Now would you -- you would -- you'd have no difficultly with the proposition that the inspector could enter your client's place of business?

    Mr. Marshall W. Krause 
    Anyone can enter that place of business.

    He was selling books there.

    Mr. Marshall W. Krause 
    Some emergency or something of that sort, yes. 
    And there was a distinction there. 
    As a matter of fact the only objection to the health officer's presence came when he demanded to enter the resident's part of the appellant's premises.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="982.032" stopTime="1002.856">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Suppose a rat infestation survey were being made of the four square block area and let say, in your judgment, would it be necessary for the inspector to obtain a search warrant applicable to each house in that area?
speaker="marshall_w_krause" startTime="1002.856" stopTime="1057.186">
    Mr. Marshall W. Krause 
    Well, first of all, the procedure of the health inspectors would be to seek consent and we think that he should seek consent. 
    Not only should he seek consent but he should educate the public as to the value of his inspection as to what he is doing. 
    He should let people know in advance that he will be there and this will induce consent on the part of many people. 
    And now, if there are -- then people who resists, the question comes, is there sufficient facts to give to a magistrate under oath so that the magistrate may issue a search warrant under the Fourth Amendment to allow the inspection of that premises. 
    A search warrant would describe the premises to be searched, what was being searched for. 
    It wouldn't be just a knock on the door, an unexpected knock on the door.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="1057.186" stopTime="1064.182">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    In my situation, the police officer could -- only could say is that he's searching for migratory rats?

    Mr. Marshall W. Krause 
    Yes. 
    And I think under that situation, any house in any city could be inspected because there is at least one rat in every city, if not, many more.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1077.503" stopTime="1080.980">
    Justice Potter Stewart

    Mr. Marshall W. Krause 
    In my judgment, there must be probable cause under oath given to a magistrate that there are some reason to inspect these premises.

    Justice Potter Stewart

    Mr. Marshall W. Krause 
    If they went to the magistrate and they said we have a bubonic plague outbreak and it's likely to becoming from this area and we know that there are --

    Well many area in the city they might say.
speaker="marshall_w_krause" startTime="1383.969" stopTime="1437.127">
    Mr. Marshall W. Krause 
    Well, in that situation, I don't think they could get a warrant allowing them to inspect every home in the city unless they could show that there's some specific reason why every home in the city should be inspected. 
    I know that's an extreme example and you're backing me to the wall but I have to be consistent here and say that they should be able to come up with some facts that they can give an affidavit to a magistrate and if they can't they're not very good health inspectors whether the facts are that this is an old house that might be sufficient in a bubonic plague situation. 
    And because rat infester and old houses and rats carry bubonic plague, I think any good health inspector worth his salt could get a warrant and be able to give facts and solve that situation. 
    I don't --

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Can I ask this Mr. Krause. 
    An opinion in Eaton and Price, this was said of the situation then, but it was not shown that the inspector desired to make the inspection in pursuance to a regular routinized spot check of individual homes or in pursuance for a plan to blanket check of all the houses in a particular neighborhood or the like. 
    Oh, I understand you to say that if that implies that the -- in that circumstance no warrant is needed, you'd disagree, is that right?

speaker="marshall_w_krause" startTime="1543.330" stopTime="1543.933">
    Mr. Marshall W. Krause 
    Certainly, the --

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Well, how much less would you say that assuming that what was said in the dissent in Frank and Maryland where the rule mainly that something less was required than in the criminal case, how much less would satisfy?
speaker="marshall_w_krause" startTime="1558.979" stopTime="1582.708">
    Mr. Marshall W. Krause 
    That's almost impossible to answer. 
    Each case must come up on its own facts. 
    In this case, no warrant was even applied for and the government is claiming the right to go in without even applying for a warrant. 
    I think that the standard that a magistrate would use in judging a warrant for probable cause might well be different than a criminal case and in that extent I agree with what Mr. Justice Douglas said.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="1582.708" stopTime="1585.793">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    I can't help as to why -- how much less there ought to be?
speaker="marshall_w_krause" startTime="1585.793" stopTime="1611.843">
    Mr. Marshall W. Krause 
    Well, I've -- all I can say is that he must come up with some facts justifying an inspection of this specific house or this specific small individualized area and these must be particular facts. 
    If it were said in the affidavit that these homes were built 100 years ago similar homes are deteriorating that may be sufficient factual allegations to obtain a warrant. 
    The --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1611.843" stopTime="1656.758">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Suppose the fire department found that a defective wiring was the cause of many devastating fires and the people have been losing their lives because of these fires. 
    And the city thought it would be wise to require inspection of the wiring throughout the city to see if there -- that it was defective. 
    And a person refused to permit inspector to go in. 
    Would you say that the magistrate could not in those circumstances issue a warrant for the inspection just on those facts and no more?
speaker="marshall_w_krause" startTime="1656.758" stopTime="1715.268">
    Mr. Marshall W. Krause 
    Yes. 
    I would say that that the magistrate has -- would have no sworn facts before him indicating that the wiring in this house was in any way defective. 
    If you give me a little more facts if you say that the health officer or the electrical inspector was able to allege that this house was 50 years old and that the wiring is 50 years old that may be sufficient. 
    Let me throw out one more thing because I think it's important. 
    I think there are alternatives for the various situations you suggest. 
    I think of the city is concerned about wiring, it could require an affirmative obligation which wouldn't invade privacy that is that each householder get a certificate of compliance with current standards of wiring. 
    And that would be done by a licensed inspector of the house, the homeowners' own choosing at his own time and it wouldn't be the government intruding. 
    In other words, I think that it's worth working a little bit to protect this privacy under the Fourth Amendment. 
    I think that it could be done.

    No warrant was even applied for here. 
    So I don't need to go as far as I'm gone. 
    I feel that I must go this far because it is the Fourth Amendment in my opinion.

    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    As this -- been made clear here already, this case is unlike either the Eaton case or the -- or Frank against Maryland for that matter. 
    And it does involve a routine inspection which was required of the health inspector by an ordinance of the City and County of San Francisco. 
    And I have to disagree with Mr. Krause in saying that this is a case about a health inspector. 
    A health inspector was involved but what this case is about is not his rights. 
    The case is about the right of the people of the City and County of San Francisco to enact the ordinance that they did enact here. 
    Until an effect divests themselves of the absolute right of property to a minor degree in order to accommodate what they felt, not what I feel, but what they felt was the primary interest of protecting the health and safety of the people of that city. 
    Now, the same thing has been done in the area of water pollution and the area of air pollution. 
    The last decade has seen a real awakening. 
    There interest of concern or perhaps conscience but this entire nation in respect of the cities and the conditions in housing, and in all of the environment that we live in. 
    And this is a -- this is in San Francisco was only one of several hundred inspection codes and only one of several hundred programs financed locally and by the State Governments, and by the Federal Government for that matter, in order to bring about a better city, in order to bring about better housing, in order to prevent blight, in order to bring about a tolerable place for people to live, and that is what those case is about.

    Mr. Albert W. Harris, Jr. 
    No. 
    There was no evidence taken Your Honor in the Superior Court proceedings. 
    Now that was because the petition for a writ of prohibition that was filed on the Superior Court attacked the ordinance as invalid and unconstitutional on its face and that is a valid ground under California law to attack the jurisdiction of the criminal court, it was the Municipal Court. 
    Consequently, no evidence was taken during the hearing in the Superior Court. 
    And as is common, there was a great deal of colloquy between the attorneys and between the -- and with the trial judge. 
    But it was made clear that this inspection was pursuant to a San Francisco ordinance that requires an inspection of apartment houses and hotels annually, every year. 
    And that the inspection was for the purpose of determining compliance with the permit of occupancy that had been issued to the owner of the apartment house in order to operate the place and in conjunction with the licensing of that apartment house. 
    And that determination was adopted by the District Court of Appeal in reviewing the case on appeal and that is the Court of a last resort as far as this case is concerned.

    Now, there has been no contention here that there was any failure to comply with the ordinance. 
    I would like to touch just for a moment on the suggestion that perhaps the right of entry authorized by Section 503 here might be utilized by police officers in the enforcement of the state law relating to criminal conduct. 
    Now that has never been suggested by anyone. 
    The statute or the ordinance itself is limited to duties authorized or imposed upon a city employee by the municipal code. 
    This appears as a part of the housing code. 
    And I think it would be a very remarkable construction of that ordinance to say that it applies to anything that what it purports to inspections in the course of enforcement of the housing code by health inspectors as required by law. 
    Now, this inspection is not at the whim of -- as I pointed out of a health inspector. 
    He's obeying a law. 
    He is not entering in violation of law. 
    He is not taking a shortcut to law enforcement. 
    He is not trying to get in there in order to do something else. 
    He is abiding by what the people have directed him to do and that is to inspect these apartment houses annually.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Harris, one of the things that bothers some of us and me at least is this. 
    I don't think that everybody or any great percentage of the people are going to demand the -- a search warrant for a thing of this kind but in this day and age, and so many things are happening to women for instance. 
    If a stranger comes to her door and say -- your -- when her husband is away, she is there all by herself and he says, I want to come into your house to make an inspection. 
    Is there anything wrong for her to say, "Well, I want to see your authority to inspect my home before I let you in". 
    And then is there anything wrong in having the inspector under those circumstances, go to the magistrate and get the -- get an -- make an affidavit and get an inspection. 
    It would be much easier than to have a man come back three times as this man had did and each time without a warrant. 
    Now, those things when you're speaking of the health and the safety of your community, I think bear a little more heavily on public safety even in the -- than some of this routine inspections that you're talking about. 
    So, isn't there a real question of the right of privacy in the home here which a family would have a right to protect and particularly a woman and in the day time, a man is rarely there.

    The -- I think the -- what Your Honor has suggested would be a very prudent course for a lady who is confronted by a man who says he wants to make an inspection.

    Mr. Albert W. Harris, Jr. 
    Well, it probably.

    They may have a picture of course that could be forged as well.

    Yes, (Inaudible) the picture.
speaker="albert_w_harris_jr" startTime="3316.293" stopTime="3574.439">
    Mr. Albert W. Harris, Jr. 
    That's true. 
    I would think this that under those circumstances or let's say even apart from any fears, suppose she's got the children in the house and is in a state of confusion and she doesn't want to be bothered by somebody coming in at that time. 
    That it seems to me of -- a reasonable attitude on her part. 
    Now, this ordinance requires -- or only requires you to admit an inspector at a reasonable time. 
    We haven't had cases that have construed that language because there's -- this is the only known opposition to the ordinance but I think the pattern is very clear here and it is this that if this is a -- this is even an inconvenient time that you'd rather not have someone come in. 
    You might have some guests. 
    They're willing to come back in a couple of days. 
    They're willing to come back in a couple of weeks. 
    They came back here three times and each time were flatly denied entrance. 
    There was even a hearing scheduled in the District Attorney's Office which is a totally -- with an informal kind of procedure in California. 
    So, I think that it's perfectly proper for a lady to protect herself. 
    If she has doubts, she can call up the Department of Public Health and find out if this is legitimate. 
    Find out what's going on. 
    Now, I don't think it's any answer to that problem to say that the people should establish a search warrant procedure. 
    And I think in some of the questions here one of the main differences was brought out. 
    On a search warrant, you show probable cause to believe that contraband, to believe that the weapons of crime, to believe that smuggled goods or something are in a particular premises, a particular apartment, a particular home. 
    And the magistrate can weigh that and decide whether or not you should be allowed to enter into that home and search and reduce those things to your possession. 
    These inspections and particularly the -- this are the annual inspection that we've been discussing and the planned area inspections where several blocks are carved out for inspection every -- so often. 
    The whole purpose of this is to determine what the situation is in respect to those buildings, not whether somebody has something tucked away in a trunk or a chest some place but to find out what's going on in there. 
    And I don't think a magi -- I think the magistrate would be reduced to the position of either rubber stamping whatever is presented to him of -- to say so with the Department of Public Health that they want to make an inspection of this 10-block area. 
    Either that or he is going to turn himself into the Department of Public Health and the Planning Director and decide should we go to the Fillmore District. 
    Should we make inspections in the Mission District? 
    Should we go out in Hunters Point and make inspections in this area? 
    And I don't think our magistrates are frankly equipped for that or that there is any requirement of law that they do. 
    That's certainly no requirement of the Constitution. 
    The magnitude of an effective inspection program is such that I think any requirement of a search warrant would be abs -- would in effect mean you couldn't conduct the program. 
    We have 145,000 inspections in 1964 by the Department of Public Works, as I said before, 50,000 inspection trips to 16,000 buildings in the fiscal year of 1964 and 14,500 dwelling units inspected under the urban renewal program. 
    Now, there aren't enough magistrates in the United States to issue warrants on affidavits and examination of those of that kind of volume. 
    But the main thing is that the Constitution does not require it. 
    Your Honor -- Your Honors held in Frank against Maryland that the Constitution did not require a search warrant. 
    There's been no abuse of that power by the cities of this -- in this land where the cases or the instances of any abuse.

    There have never been any in San Francisco that I know of nor in Seattle. 
    And I think that the program has worked. 
    It's worked since the beginning of this nation. 
    It's been accepted by the Courts, by judges, by legislators, by the people of this country, and I have yet to hear one good reason, why the system should be changed. 
    The only thing I've heard is that there may have been a misreading of the -- of some of the cases. 
    Well, I don't think there was but even if there were that is not a good reason to do what I think this Court would be doing and that is taking a step backward when a step forward should be taken. 
    When the need for these programs is more apparent now than it was back in 1959. 
    It's clear there are no abuses, none here at all. 
    Why in the world impose a search warrant procedure that all of the judges, legislators, people, prosecutors, everyone of it -- since this nation was formed never deem necessary.

    Well --

    Mr. Albert W. Harris, Jr. 
    What facts would he ask for?

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well, I am -- for myself, I would suggest that if you have a health ordinance that calls for annual inspection for apartment houses and it's his duty to go to this apartment house. 
    And a man or woman won't let him in, all he has to do is go back and get a warrant to admit him. 
    And when he has that, he has the power of the law behind him, and if they don't obey that then we've got an entirely different situation. 
    I --

    I think Your Honor --

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    I think that most people would do that -- would let people in anyway if there's no danger of any -- anything wrong happening. 
    And he's not going to change her character and make them all demand search warrants, do you think so?

    Mr. Albert W. Harris, Jr. 
    Well, you'd never know for one thing any more of that search warrant were not a forgery than -- for the people whether that's suspicious. 
    But I think the basic thing is this, the people could provide for that procedure if they wish but they have not provided for that. 
    That what Your Honor has mentioned is not a search warrant, as I understand a search warrant at all.

    No, it's an administrative warrant.

    Mr. Albert W. Harris, Jr. 
    It would be a different thing and the Fourth Amendment does not have anything to do with that. 
    I say that is the legislative decision. 
    Thank you.
