    Mr. Francis X. Beytagh, Jr. 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    This wagering tax cases have been extensively brief and argued over the last two terms here and I doubt that in a few minutes anymore can be added. 
    I would like to mention that it seems apparent now that the Court and counsel are quite aware of some of the broader implications that underlie the decisions in these cases. 
    It's just not all that simple. 
    At the one extreme, he might say, “well, part of the tax is plenary.” 
    And the Congress can exercise it in anyway that it chooses on any subjects that it chooses. 
    And we don't concern ourselves with Fifth Amendment. 
    But the other he might say, “Well the Fifth Amendment is absolute.” 
    He has the right to remain silent and the Government can't violate that no matter what parts excise on. 
    But we don't think that either of those positions is sound as we read the decisions of this Court. 
    The Court has taken a position of accommodation when flight – when it's face put the clash such as this. 
    And our effort has been to suggest several alternatives that we think would provide a sensible accommodation in these cases. 
    As far as we know, no prior decision of this Court is held a tax invalid on Fifth Amendment grounds. 
    Indeed, as far as we know, the Court is consistently upheld. 
    Excise taxation of businesses whether they are illegal or legal. 
    It's consistently upheld the taxation of income from unlawful as well as lawful sources. 
    We submit therefore that against this back draft of the President of sensible accommodation here is – is a necessary.

    Mr. Francis X. Beytagh, Jr. 
    The accommodation that we think we've made by the Court in Kahriger and Lewis, Your Honor. 
    That the Congress chooses to tax a business and that tax is an appropriate one. 
    That it's fair to say that when a person decides to enter into that business, he is accepting the tax conditions that have been placed upon that – an engagement.

    Any other accommodation?
speaker="francis_x_beytagh_jr" startTime="196.162" stopTime="317.829">
    Mr. Francis X. Beytagh, Jr. 
    I think there are different positions that could be developed. 
    Professor Wright mentioned yesterday that we suggested just in passing our brief that perhaps, one of the problems here is the fact that forms prescribed are hardly neutral. 
    How they answer that we gave to the question post by the Court as to whether these forms had to be filled out, filed the presently prescribed forms was, yes. 
    Professor Wright apparently feels and we suggest that this maybe another way to reach this position. 
    It's not a way that seems to me is presently often at the Court because this kind of information seems compelled by the statutes and the regulations. 
    It maybe that if the statutes and the regulations could be amended in appropriate way. 
    This would be another way that the Congress could still tax in system with the Fifth Amendment. 
    I think there are some difficulties with that also but it is another variant. 
    I would like to enclosing -- just go quickly back over what the substance of the contention made here for unconstitutionality. 
    Now, petitioners don't deny that there are gamblers that essential of their position. 
    They don't say that the wager and taxes in a tax measure because they recognized that that was one of the questions presented in the Court in a petition for certiorari and it was not taken on that ground. 
    What they say is that they're excuse from compliance with the wager and tax laws because the business in which they're engage is unlawful. 
    They say therefore, compliance with these laws would require them to incriminate themselves.

    They couldn't pay with the death sentence of the Fifth Amendment, but they are. 
    And that's quite different to say that you can't tax them because their business is unlawful to entirely oppose to one another?
speaker="francis_x_beytagh_jr" startTime="363.035" stopTime="368.649">

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    In other words, if your view that when a man speaks the Fifth Amendment which is specific, directly aim statement that the Government if the Government will not decide that make him confess to a crime.

    Mr. Francis X. Beytagh, Jr.

speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="400.367" stopTime="428.888">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Certainly because they wouldn't be ask to confess to his crime. 
    That's all but the two are different. 
    And you're trying to equalize the claim that you can't give them help, admit you are guilt to the crime to acclaim that you can't beat with the crime that they have tax on an unlawful business. 
    And how could no suggests of that kind from anyone of the defendants.

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Do you mean like accommodation that the Fifth Amendment which was written with the purpose being to make sure that they could not go too far on the necessary in proper turnover to imply things about the defendant. 
    And when they did that, did it with a purpose that matters had been said, of forbidding something that entitles and forbidding the manner in which something else should be done. 
    What they did was to leave that open to the courts to construe the Amendment, so that the man could be made to confess with his crime, if you will use the word accommodation. 
    That's your argument of that the Fifth Amendment?

    Mr. Francis X. Beytagh, Jr. 
    In the Murphy case which we rely upon as this authority for the alternative rational we suggest that was indeed the essence of that case. 
    The Court said that in its view, it was necessary to accommodate the State in a federal interest.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="527.562" stopTime="532.506">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    That was a case involving State compact, wasn't it?

    Mr. Francis X. Beytagh, Jr. 
    Well, it involved the Waterfront Commission but witnesses were sought to be compelled to testify before that Commission and they resisted the inquiry on the ground that it might incriminate them under federal law. 
    And this Court held that they could be compelled on it, sir. 
    And that the Fifth Amendment didn't prevent that. 
    That their answers couldn't be use against them or their proofs in some subsequent prosecution and if the Government in that prosecution would have the burden of showing that its information and its evidence was from an independent source. 
    And we suggest these cases provide a suitable occasion for similar kind of rule.

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    If you are right here, why can't you use the same accommodation for the reference to the First Amendment or the reference to freedom of religion, freedom of press, and freedom of speech?

    Mr. Francis X. Beytagh, Jr. 
    Well, it seems to me Your Honor that the circumstances in which Fifth Amendment claims arise lend themselves to this kind of resolution. 
    And I don't know that circumstances in which First or other similar claims arise do. 
    That the Court has as you know adopted exclusionary rules in difference circumstances to provide some kind of accommodation between what the Government does and what the individual's interest does. 
    And that's what they did in Murphy and we suggest that that should be done here.

speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="1270.079" stopTime="1277.203">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Where is that? 
    There is a broad spectrum a federal statutes that requires the Government to decide the problem --

    Mr. Francis X. Beytagh, Jr. 
    The -- as we point -- we referred to these statutes in our brief. 
    We point out that there you have different elements that go into that crime, those kind of crimes. 
    And also, there maybe some distance between the information provided in the crime itself but then you're right.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="1301.250" stopTime="1316.686">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    I'd like to ask you this one more question. 
    This even go nowhere I know but I'm not sure I understand it. 
    How do you enter to the court under the briefs 2150.
speaker="francis_x_beytagh_jr" startTime="1316.686" stopTime="1430.140">
    Mr. Francis X. Beytagh, Jr. 
    We think that as we reach Shapiro that relates to records that an individual or business maintains. 
    Now I know that the term “Required Records” has been placed on that doctrine and there is a language in that regarding the opinion. 
    We point out on our brief that the kind of records that we're involved there or under the regulation of those records that are customarily kept in that kind of business. 
    It seems to us that that provides a sensible view as to this scope of Shapiro. 
    We think that the -- when the Government requires on the other hand the filing of reports and returns, and things like that to the Government an affirmative coming forth by an individual. 
    But there are different considerations. 
    These reports wouldn't be filed except for the fact that the Government require. 
    I don't know where you start, if you say that those kinds of reports and returns are also within Shapiro. 
    Because if you say that and it seems to me, the Government can require almost any kind of report or return to be made and that information could be use against an individual to prove his guilt of a crime. 
    And since there aren't any sensible stopping places along that line that we can divide. 
    And since -- it seems to us that there is a substantial difference between the kind of thing that we're talking about in Shapiro and the kind of thing involved with reports and returns. 
    We don't feel that the Court has to reach Shapiro here.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="1430.140" stopTime="1438.662">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Do you know of any other case? 
    Do you know that Shapiro have been applied in any States in the Shapiro?
speaker="francis_x_beytagh_jr" startTime="1438.662" stopTime="1442.162">
    Mr. Francis X. Beytagh, Jr. 
    As far as I know, this Court does not apply Shapiro directly.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="1442.162" stopTime="1466.880">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    -- Governments want to pursue as much as that State is confident and I understand to -- I don't know (Inaudible). 
    But if this in the required record something that you put estimates to the fact that would implementation if the Government or in fact, I don't know what is required that would be able to (Inaudible)?
speaker="francis_x_beytagh_jr" startTime="1466.880" stopTime="1489.966">
    Mr. Francis X. Beytagh, Jr. 
    Well as I said, the way that we reach Shapiro is that if we wage primarily to those kinds of things that are kept by someone incident to doing his business. 
    Now, I take that none of these people would send things into the Government. 
    They don't do it anyhow but they wouldn't send them in just --
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="1489.966" stopTime="1498.796">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    You mean the require the records and everyone having Shapiro with something that a person the affected the truth anyway from him?
speaker="francis_x_beytagh_jr" startTime="1498.796" stopTime="1572.468">
    Mr. Francis X. Beytagh, Jr. 
    I don't think it's necessary to go that far. 
    It seems to me that you can say that the kind of record you're talking about is of the nature that it would be expected to be kept by an individual whether the particular person kept in the past that particular kind of record and then the regulation came along and said, “You had to keep it or not, it seems to me is of the necessary test.” 
    It's the nature of the thing, what it is and how it relates to his business and to the regulatory program that's involved? 
    I don't think that that's an easy problem. 
    We took the position as the petition has pointed out in our previous brief. 
    That we didn't think the Shapiro question was presented here. 
    The Court asked about it after considered judgment we took the position we've taken. 
    I think it is a sound one. 
    I share the difficulty that not only you but some of the other members of the Court have it. 
    Thank you. 
   
   
   
   Argument of Charles Alan Wright
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1572.468" stopTime="1575.965">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Wright.
speaker="charles_alan_wright" startTime="1575.965" stopTime="1779.327">
    Mr. Charles Alan Wright 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    In six hours of real argument, nine briefs these cases have ranged far and we've speculated them in good many interesting things. 
    There is I think one fundamental proposition of constitutional law that is central to the petitioner's case and that I think does help to resolve some difficulties we've had. 
    It's a proposition this Court has stated placed dozen times in different ways to particular formulation. 
    I code this from the Pry v. United States from 195 US. 
    The Court there said, “The taxing power conferred by the Constitution knows no limits except those expressly stated in that instrument.” 
    Now I introduce from that three things. 
    First, that except was the Constitution itself says XY taxes must be uniform and there are other constitutional limitation of course. 
    There is no limit whatever on the taxing power of Congress. 
    In response to the question from Mr. Justice Fortas yesterday I said specifically that I think Congress has the power to tax wagering as such. 
    I think Congress has the power to tax robbery, kidnapping, anything that wants to tax is valid qualified of tax. 
    But the other hand from great proposition is that the taxing power must acknowledge those limits expressly stated from the Constitution. 
    And the limit presently relevant is the privilege against self incrimination of the Fifth Amendment. 
    Congress can tax whatever it wants to tax. 
    But it must device a way of doing so that does not require persons to accuse themselves of crime. 
    I do not think that these are irreconcilable. 
    For over half a century, the most important of our federal taxes, the income tax has been successfully administered even though it is not contended that the person is required to incriminate themselves. 
    The Sullivan Dictum is respected by the service. 
    The taxpayer's private records are not regarded as coming with the Shapiro Principle. 
    Yet we enforced the tax, if we have a reconciling some taxpayers who does not play forward his records. 
    The Government had no difficulty by netork prosecutions in other means in penalizing the violator and collecting the revenue of this due te. 
    I think that there are ways that the wagering tax could be collected without requiring gamblers to come forward and say, “I am person who has done an unlawful act.” 
    We suggest that some of them are in brief in all our argument. 
    I do not think that the Government simply because it needs revenues entitled to say that the person you must be a witness against yourself. 
    I was suggested yesterday that perhaps this case is an aide for certiorari case from Albertson. 
    I submit that it is that waits so far as the Government's attempt to then Kahriger and Lewis concerned. 
    The Government's other argument, its attempt to the use restriction argument phrases different problems. 
    I think perhaps the used restrictions is a constitutional way that this tax can be collected though as I indicated yesterday, I have the gravest doubt as to propriety of the use restriction being imposed by this Court. 
    And I'm not at all sure –-
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="1779.327" stopTime="1793.031">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Would you mind just – I know you said that yesterday as to that why. 
    Why you have to let it done in Murphy as you suggested that it would not be property with that the same formulation?
speaker="charles_alan_wright" startTime="1793.031" stopTime="1801.807">
    Mr. Charles Alan Wright 
    Mr. Justice Brennan, that's a very difficult question for me to answer for this reason. 
    I think from my client's point of view, I want to say, use restriction.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="1801.807" stopTime="1802.643">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Should say what?
speaker="charles_alan_wright" startTime="1802.643" stopTime="1845.394">
    Mr. Charles Alan Wright 
    I ought to argue for use restriction. 
    I think I have a better chance of reversing Grosso's conviction if I say to you, yes, suppose you use restriction because I still think that requires reversal in my case. 
    But I feel that I have a duty and you also as member of the bar of this Court to present only a position that I find intellectually acceptable. 
    And to me the notion that the Court in this particular statutory context could say that despite no indication from Congress that it wanted to use restriction, indeed every indication the Congress wanted this to be helpful to prosecutors. 
    For the Court now to do that, I think it would be for the Court to be making a law that it is properly if the Congress
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="1845.394" stopTime="1848.942">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Well, do you think we did when we did it in the Murphy?
speaker="charles_alan_wright" startTime="1848.942" stopTime="1875.123">
    Mr. Charles Alan Wright 
    I think as I said Mr. Justice White yesterday, perhaps, he should have let the Congress act there but I think that Murphy is distinguishable that the arguments were referring to Congress they are less strong when they are here. 
    You did not have the Murphy, a congressional statute that didn't so far as it could said to use this stuff.We do have that. 
    I'm --
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="1875.123" stopTime="1880.896">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Of course, you don't have that Grosso?
speaker="charles_alan_wright" startTime="1880.896" stopTime="1886.514">
    Mr. Charles Alan Wright 
    We don't have this clearly in gross somehow as we do with regards to the occupational tax.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="1886.514" stopTime="1897.978">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    -- as far as we do that. 
    If Congress to the whole (Inaudible). 
    Do you have that specific term if the argument (Inaudible).
speaker="charles_alan_wright" startTime="1897.978" stopTime="1978.063">
    Mr. Charles Alan Wright 
    That is right. 
    But we do have the Solicitor acknowledged yesterday. 
    We do have the internal revenue service, making the excise tax returns available to prosecuting authorities. 
    They apparently the administrators under the statute think that they are carrying out of congressional purpose when they disclose this information. 
    I'm not sure if the Government is not enlightening me with all the consequences if he used restriction would be in this very case. 
    Eleven form 730 weren't produce in evidence against my client. 
    Form 730 is well by his and his brother-in-law. 
    I don't know whether this would be permissible under the United States view of use restriction. 
    And as I suggested to both in the brief from yesterday, I think there is a terribly serious question whether they used restriction rule but not mean an end to the prosecution of gamblers. 
    It might produce more revenue from the United States but I think it would make the prosecution extraordinarily difficult. 
    Those are the problems of showing independent untainted source. 
    For these reasons and for the reason with regard to the unauthorized communication and the absence of the defendant in this counsel, the petitioner respectfully request that the judgment below be reversed.
