    Mr. James M. Nabritt III 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    This case, likely, the case that had just been concluded, involves the housing rights of the disadvantaged citizens in our society. 
    However, this case which is here on certiorari from the Supreme Court of North Carolina involves no issue of state action. 
    It is conceded that the respondent, Housing Authority of the City of Durham, is an agency of the State operating under State statutes and operating a low-income public housing project under a contract with the United States. 
    The question presented here is also not one directly involving any racial discrimination claim, but rather the more general one of whether a public housing authority may terminate a tenant's housing benefits, entirely arbritrarily, without giving any reason, without being accountable at all for what it does.

    Before you go on with the nature of the argument, what about the events (Inaudible)
speaker="james_m_nabritt_iii" startTime="126.674" stopTime="268.256">
    Mr. James M. Nabritt III 
    Your Honor's question relates to our reply brief and to the regulation adopted on February 7th after our briefs were filed by the Department of Housing and Urban Development. 
    In the first part of our reply brief, we have set forth an argument which we think, would support the decision by this Court, reversing the decision below and setting aside this eviction on non-constitutional ground. 
    However, we urge that the Court consider the constitutional questions and exercise its discretion to decide them for several important reasons. 
    We think that first, it is vital and most important that the -- this Court may claim that the rights of public housing tenants under the -- are protected under the Constitution that -- that public housing tenants have rights which the Court will protect and which the Public Housing Authority must respect. 
    It's -- it's no accident, I think, that 30 years have gone by since this Federal Housing Program was first adopted, and this is the first case to come to this Court where the tenants were in a position to assert rights against the Public Housing Authority. 
    And that's because these are people who don't have the money to litigate cases and who will rarely have the opportunity to do so. 
    So it's most important that if their constitutional rights are going to be protected, they're going to have to be protected by the administrative agencies, and the way that the administrative agencies can be stimulated to act is through a judicial decision, that February 7th Regulation represents that. 
    It was only after this Court had granted certiorari that the longstanding policy was reversed so that --

    If that is correct, Your Honor, we agree. 
    If, and it's an important if, the new regulation is construed to clarify one or two ambiguities about the right to a hearing. 
    I had intended to perhaps it would be worthwhile at this time, Mr. Justice Harlan, since you have raised the issue, if I discuss this new regulation in some -- in some detail.

    Mr. James M. Nabritt III 
    Your Honor, we argue that it's -- in part on the language of the regulation, but more on general precedence of the courts that this regulation can be applied to this case because it's a pending case and it's not final since it's here on the record here on certiorari.

    Mr. James M. Nabritt III 
    We -- we believe that the -- the trial court would be bound under the Supremacy Clause to recognize as a defense that this regulation, which is the one dated February 7, 1967 in our reply brief that this regulation which states that. 
    “It's essential that no tenant be given a notice to vacate without being told -- being told by the local authority the reasons for eviction. 
    That -- that a local court would have to honor that and say that a requirement -- that the Local Public Housing Authority coming into Court in violation of that rule couldn't prevail.” 
    This case arose now. 
    We think that a --
speaker="william_o_douglas" startTime="406.516" stopTime="419.222">
    Justice William O. Douglas 
    So if we remanded on that on that ground, what would happen? 
    Would it go back for the giving of the notice required under the new regulation? 
    Is that when it became a hearing?
speaker="james_m_nabritt_iii" startTime="419.222" stopTime="541.345">
    Mr. James M. Nabritt III 
    Well, now -- now, we're getting, Mr. Justice Douglas, to the area of -- of where the, certainly, regulation is not precise and specific. 
    For example, the regulation doesn't use the word hearing at all. 
    It says that it uses the term “private conference” and suggests that tenants be given an opportunity to make such reply or explanation as he may wish. 
    Now, if that means what I would call a hearing, that is a rudimentary due process proceeding where the tenant would have the right to know what authority was placed against him were, where he would have some sort of opportunity to probe their -- their case, to find out what facts they relied on and to -- and to challenge them with his own version of the facts, if he contested, assuming he contested them, and would -- and would have the right to have an impartial decision, and to know at the end of the hearing process what ground they rely on for their decision making. 
    And I think the circular can be construed by this Court to require it. 
    Then the Court might be able to avoid the constitutional question. 
    However, I think, as I began this entire discussion by saying as part to Mr. Justice Harlan's first inquiry that we think it important that the Court in these circumstances decide the -- the constitutional issue, the due process issue, and in doing so, might serve some of the same policies that are normally served by avoiding constitutional questions.

    And suppose they can't afford a counsel, that they have to have a counsel appointed for them.

    I -- the -- the court below did find her against her on that issue on a -- on a basis of stipulations, the stipulated testimony which is in the -- in the record at a page 7. 
    It was stipulated that the executive director of the Housing Authority, if you would call him to testify, would have said that, “Whatever reason there may have been, if any, for giving notice to Joyce C.

speaker="james_m_nabritt_iii" startTime="824.399" stopTime="909.682">
    Mr. James M. Nabritt III 
    That -- that is correct, Mr. Justice Douglas. 
    Your question points out that the new regulation doesn't say to the Housing Authority that your reasons for acting must be reasonable and they must not be arbitrary. 
    It only deals with the -- with the procedural side. 
    Now, I did not want to get too far away with that in terms. 
    It's part of Mr. Justice Fortas' question about what type of hearing procedure we thought was fundamental. 
    I'd -- I've answered it, I believe, with respect to the right to bring along a personal representative. 
    I think the right to have some sort of opportunity to put in 4evidence to -- as I mentioned to you that word the tenant's side of the version of the facts, the direct supporting witness is -- is essential. 
    An opportunity to know what the facts are that the Housing Authority is relying on for its -- to keep -- to put someone out of a project. 
    If they claim that she is -- that -- that a tenant is engaged in misconduct, she's really required to make known the facts on which they -- they purport the act and give the tenant an opportunity to disprove it and to challenge it.

    Mr. James M. Nabritt III 
    Our -- I -- I think so. 
    It seems to me the bedrock of our position in this case is the -- the concept expressed in just a few lines by Judge Edgerton in -- in the Rudder case. 
    They're -- they're quoted in our brief at the top of page 16, and the -- the language is this“The government as landlord is still the government. 
    It must not act arbitrarily, for, unlike private landlords, it is subject to the requirements of due process of law and arbitrary action is not due process.” 
    It seems to me that --

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    (Inaudible) and that you've been interrupted a great deal, but my -- my basis to tell you is she has a -- she was on these premises under an agreement which very explicitly gave either -- either party a right to terminate on 15 days notice without any -- without any cost at all.

    It -- it seems to me that's -- that it's only the -- it's not a sufficient answer. 
    So, say that the low-income tenant has no right vis–à–vis a governmental housing agency other than those (Inaudible) by a contract because the citizen must have the right to be treated fairly by -- by the governmental agency under the Due Process Clause. 
    So that, I think an inquiry as to what -- what the lease says doesn't decide the constitutional question. 
    But -- but in one form, it might be thought of as raising the issue of waiver, whether or not the -- whether or not the lease waive a constitutional right to -- to a fair treatment.
speaker="william_o_douglas" startTime="1056.134" stopTime="1075.902">
    Justice William O. Douglas 
    What you're saying is that the government can't -- as the proprietor of the housing agency discharge a tenant because of the -- the way he votes and the way he speaks ideology or economics or because his taste to literature and things of that kind? 
    You're talking about the First Amendment?
speaker="james_m_nabritt_iii" startTime="1075.902" stopTime="1208.259">
    Mr. James M. Nabritt III 
    Yes, You Honor, the First Amendment and the Fifth Amendment, I'd say. 
    It seems that I -- I can't say enough to emphasize the -- the potential of this kind of arbitrary power in suppressing the dissent. 
    There are 2.3 million Americans who live in public housing projects, half of them are Negroes, 31% are elderly people. 
    These -- these are the citizens in the society with -- with the lowest income groups. 
    That the citizens who have least effective voice in the political and community affairs. 
    It seems to me these are -- with dealing -- when Government deals with this group of citizens for it to exercise total -- or a claim -- total arbitrary power is most dangerous in the society. 
    The -- the reported cases and some unreported ones, too, in the housing field show the -- the kind of abuses, the kind of arbitrary things that -- that can occur. 
    Judge -- some of my associates are involved in litigations now pending in the Northern District of Alabama where Judge Grooms entered an -- an injunction with findings, temporary restraining order with findings against the Housing Authority, that undertook under this kind of arbitrary power, to threaten to evict the tenant because the tenant's daughter was pregnant and unmarried, even though the daughter didn't even live in the project. 
    A New York case Sanders against Cruz reports, a reported case, represents how the Housing Authority threatened to evict a tenant who brought a civil action against them on the ground that a tenant's teenage son was involved in narcotics and they were going to evict the tenant even though for a year before this, the son had been in federal hospital in Lexington or wasn't living with the family at all.

    Addressing myself to the question of the lease raised by Mr. Stewart's question before the -- the lunch hour. 
    Let me address this issue in this way. 
    In the first place, the lease itself doesn't say anything one way or another, about what -- whether or not the authority must give a reason for terminating. 
    It's silent on this. 
    In the second place, the authority's argument, I take it, concedes that they can't evict for a specifically unconstitutional reason such as in order to infringe free religion or to supress speech. 
    I take it that they concede that but they contend that they can evict and keep silent about what their reason is. 
    They don't suggest that they have any -- anything that justifies secrecy in terms of, you know, like classified information or security interest. 
    They assert it merely as the right not to -- to be required to say why they are acting.

    Mr. James M. Nabritt III 
    That -- that is correct, Your Honor. 
    That's the one that they referred to in the notice to Mrs. Thorpe to -- to vacate. 
    The lease may be terminated by the management by giving 15 days notice prior to the end of the term.

    By the tenant on the same term?
speaker="james_m_nabritt_iii" startTime="1331.411" stopTime="1490.208">
    Mr. James M. Nabritt III 
    Yes. 
    There is nothing in -- well, as I have said, there is nothing in there, either way, with respect to whether or not they have to have a reason or whether or not they have to state a reason. 
    They can see that they can evict under that provision in order to punish someone for speech or to violate free religion or to influence racial segregation or discrimination. 
    They -- they can see that, but what -- what they contend is that they do not have to tell why they -- they are acting and it's our view that if they don't have to tell, they can obviously act for a forbidden reason and that they are immune from -- from challenge and that really, their assertion is the claim, directly a claim to -- to arbitrary power. 
    Now, and I began earlier by talking about waiver. 
    It seems to me that if there is a right of the tenant to be free from this kind of arbitrary power, the governmental agency can't be handing out benefits in this kind of subsidy program for low-income people, subsidized houses. 
    Government agency can't require them to waive that -- that right and there can't, in any event, be a waiver of it unless there is -- there is a classic waiver in the Johnson and (Inaudible) knowing relinquishment of a known right or privilege. 
    Now, what -- what interest does the tenant have at stake in protesting against arbitrary power. 
    Well, at first, it's obvious on the -- on the face of the -- the findings which justify the housing program, the findings in the -- the -- their basic enactments that --- that the tenant's interest is an interest in having decent and safe and sanitary housing, and that he's only -- the tenant only admitted, only found eligible to get in the project in the first place if there is a scarcity of -- of such housing and if the tenant cannot afford decent, safe, sanitary housing on a private market. 
    That's the only way to get in, in the first place. 
    So, that to evict them, arbitrarily, is automatically to -- to remit them to the slums and that's obviously a -- a matter of great consequence in -- in the life of a family.

    And she makes no -- no allegation other than that of improper motive. 
    So that what we have really is the naked question of whether the authority has to give notice of its failure to renew a month to month tenancy.

   Argument of Daniel K. Edwards
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2335.589" stopTime="2337.430">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Edwards.
speaker="daniel_k_edwards" startTime="2337.430" stopTime="2483.981">
    Mr. Daniel K. Edwards 
    Mr. Chief Justice and if the court please. 
    In answer to something Mr. Justice Douglas asked, this is certainly not a First Amendment case.Whatever it is, it's not that. 
    This issue having been decided, there was a contention about the First Amendment rights, but that the issue was decided by the trial court. 
    The juror and was waived by both parties and has agreed that the judge is to decide the facts. 
    The petitioner at that stage of the game was not prevented from introducing any evidence about any reason that she could think of for her eviction. 
    She had available to her discovery procedure -- procedures under state courts to find out if she want to do at that stage, what the reasons or advantage. 
    He did not ask to use any of those and -- and confine themselves to this allegation that she was evicted because of the First Amendment right to assemble. 
    And then at the same time said she didn't know the reason because they wouldn't tell the reason, and somewhat contradictory is true, but the facts were found against her and the significant thing is that she was not precluded by the trial court from asserting any constitutional right that she might have felt had been violated in that term. 
    And so this case then, I think, presents the question has been suggested that can the government in any level, whether it is the local or state or national inject funds and money, public money into a housing program without at the same time being required by the Constitution to abandon the ordinary and normal rules governing landlord and tenant that are applicable throughout the land. 
    In other words, all those normal procedures of leasing and of renting are so or at least so unusual and outlandish as to -- as to be unconstitutional when the Government has used its physical powers to promote a housing project or any sort of housing program in the nation. 
    I'd like to, and I think that that is the essence of this case, is this lease which is not an unusual lease, it's a 30-day lease which is automatically renewable unless a 15-day notice is given to terminate. 
    Is that an inviolate instrument?

    That was the exception on the trial court's finding of fact, to the trial court's finding of fact.

    Mr. Daniel K. Edwards

    That -- that language is somewhat bothersome in the -- in the per curiam decision of North Carolina Supreme Court.

    You can't accept that this is true, except for the fact that was normal rules of -- of procedure are, to the effect, that when there is a finding of fact by the trial court based on competent evidence, it's not normal that that finding of fact shall be overturned by the appellate court for only the issues of lower rate. 
    And so the trier of fact here, did have evidence upon which it could have found that to be the fact. 
    And then when the issue goes forward the -- they don't raise here the -- the issue certainly, that the trial court was in error in making that finding of fact because there was evidence by way of the stipulation that -- that would permit and justify that finding of fact by the trial court. 
    And now, they do make the point that the Supreme Court of North Carolina by some of its language might -- his opinion might be construed as saying that the trial court did not have to make that finding of fact. 
    That the case could have been decided even without the finding of fact being made, but that does -- that's not a necessary construction of what the court -- the Supreme Court of North Carolina said, and we say that it should not be so construed.

    The trial court, if it had ruled that way, would have deemed inadmissible any evidence on that point. 
    It -- it did not. 
    It admitted the -- that was included in the stipulation, that was a point that was raised and the trial court, all it did was to -- to not ignore it, but to find as a fact that it wasn't true. 
    Now, if the trial court had deemed it immaterial, it would have been inadmissible. 
    The trial court would not have to go into a finding of fact that it was not true. 
    They would just say that -- they would have said that is not material, that's not relevant to the outcome of this case.

    Then in the -- nevertheless, he evicted her or attempted to, with this proceeding and before the justice proceed.

    Mr. Daniel K. Edwards 
    It is not a regulation. 
    It's -- I think it is more or less of an advisory sort of thing. 
    And for these reasons, and I am -- and I'm glad to have the opportunity to say something about that; as far as its applicability that this case is concerned, whatever it is, a directive or a recommendation it is ex post facto, as far as this -- and the relationship between the Housing Authority that I represent down there in the City of Durham, North Carolina and all of the federal agencies is by contract entered into by that housing authority which is organized under the state law, and they enter into a written contract with all of the federal agencies which sets forth what its obligations are to these federal agencies. 
    And one of the clauses in that contract is not that they shall obey any directive issued by the federal agency. 
    It doesn't say that. 
    So we -- whatever we are governed by is by contract and our contract with -- with the folks that issued this directive doesn't say that we have to pay any attention to it, in the first place. 
    And in the second place, so that I gather, it's in effect to say to us there is no use in sending it back for reconsideration in light of this directive, regulation, whatever you'd call it because it's not binding on -- on a landlord.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="3197.415" stopTime="3198.059">

    Mr. Daniel K. Edwards 
    That's correct. 
    It's not a part of the lease, then become a part of the lease by their issuance of the thing. 
    And the other point that I think is pertinent here is that in 1961, The Congress, in the Housing Act of 1961 as part of that act said, “The Public Housing Agency” and that language means these local housing authorities like the one I represent“ shall adopt and promulgate regulations establishing admission policies which shall give full considerations to its responsibility for the rehousing of those displaced by urban renewal or other governmental action to the applicant status of servicemen or veteran or relationship to the serviceman or veteran or disabled serviceman or veteran and to the applicant's age or disability and housing conditions related to the housing needs and sources of income.” 
    Now, that by law, places on my vote, that that little -- that that the housing authority in Durham, that responsibility and it is not the federal agency's responsibility by law to do that.

    He fired -- he fired the employee assigning a reason and say, “You are a security risk.” 
    And then under the procedures of the department upon firing him for a reason, you had to have a hearing, and it did have a hearing and there was not enough evidence. 
    But the court there took the position that if you fired him for no reason, which the secretary had the right to do, you didn't have to have such a hearing.

    Mr. Daniel K. Edwards 
    There are some cases on -- on page 9 of the brief that have to do with instances just of this sort where all that appears was that the tenant was given a notice to -- that the lease would terminate, it would not be renewed without and all, without any other reason being given for the eviction, and that reason was held to be sufficient about those state course. 
    Now, it's been universally held that where a reason was given and that that reason was an unconstitutional reason, then the eviction wouldn't stand. 
    But it's also been held universally wherever the question has arisen that where there's no reason given, then there was no constitutional requirement that the -- the notice that they're going to terminate the lease contain some reason. 
    And if you did give a reason, who then is to decide whether the reason is a good one or not, the sufficiency of the reason? 
    And just as the -- the distinctions pointed out by this Court in Vitarelli versus Seaton to the effect that if you didn't give any reason at all, then you had a right to -- to eliminate the employee. 
    But if you did give a reason, then you had to have a hearing on it and had to take evidence on both sides. 
    So, what we say here is that we had a lease that was not arbitrary and not out of line with leases generally in use, among landlords and tenants, that we have here a court proceeding that was in no way arbitrary, and that she had full opportunity during the court proceeding to present evidence on any issue of constitutionality that she saw fit to present it on, that she did in fact do so, that issue or fact was decided against her, and therefore there is no constitutional issue left in this case before this Court.

    They're under -- we get the federal funds under an instrument called the Annual Contributions Contract which we have entered into with the Federal Government or its agencies. 
    And that contract sets forth the terms and conditions whereby we get the federal money to contribute to this operation of this project. 
    And that contract was written some years ago. 
    This regulation -- the contract itself between us and the Federal Government doesn't say that any directive issued by the Federal Government will become incorporated in the contract, it doesn't say that. 
    Therefore, we say that the -- that the contract is not amended by this directive and that it's being ex post facto is --

    As long -- as long as we obeyed the law that the Congress passed and as long as we have complied with the terms of our contract with the Federal Government, I don't believe they could possibly. 
    Some of them, there are great many facets of this law relating to this subject that I am very unfamiliar with and I couldn't answer that question fully. 
    But I am not familiar with anything. 
    I'm sure that our contract doesn't provide any assessment at all.

    There is a provision that after the so-called directive or regulation, “In addition to informing the tenant of the reasons for any proposed eviction action; from this date, each local authority shall maintain a written record of every eviction from a federally assisted public housing. 
    Such records are to be available for review from time to time by HUD representatives and shall contain the following information” and then they have the name of the tenant, date of the notice, and three specific reasons for notice to vacate. 
    Now, that's certainly couched in -- somehow, whoever wrote it, the Department of Housing and Urban Development thought it was something in which the Housing Authority had to provide.

    Well, that -- and furthermore, I should -- in answer to that query, I think that the -- the language of the thing refers to the reason for eviction. 
    And we gave her the reason for eviction, which was that her lease had run out, that her lease had terminated, had expired, and that's the reason she was -- the basic reason she was evicted.

    Well, that hardly reaches the question, does it?

    This is a very unusual case, it's not that there's a great mass of them, you don't -- you don't do it that way. 
    It's just -- it's just that we don't think that the Constitution requires us to change that form of the lease, that's not so unreasonable as to be unconstitutional and that's our position.
