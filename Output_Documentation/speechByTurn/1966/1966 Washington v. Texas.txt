Washington v. Texas
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="0.000" stopTime="15.640">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Jackie Washington, Petitioner, versus the State of Texas. 
    Mr. Fender.
speaker="howard_m_fender" startTime="15.640" stopTime="122.234">
    Mr. Howard M. Fender 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    On the occasion of adjournment yesterday, there was a discussion going on concerning the parallel I was drawing between a statute which prohibits lunatics, and idiots, drunkards, from testifying in the statute in this instance which prohibits a codefendant from testifying. 
    In order to give you the example of why I think parallel was well drawn Your Honor, I would like to review briefly some of the facts in this case although I dont think they're entirely necessary to a determination question. 
    Nevertheless counsel yesterday in his argument indicated that if the codefendant had been allowed to testify that he would exonerate the petitioner in this case. 
    The petitioner, a young man who went around and gathered up a gang, he was searching for a gun. 
    He placed it in the hands of his drunken codefendant, placed the rest of his gang around the house to throw rocks at the house to bring someone to the front door. 
    And apparently at that time he lost his courage. 
    And according to his testimony and according to the affidavit of the codefendant, the last minute, he turned and ran. 
    I'd like to point out to the Court that he'd be perfectly guilty as a principle even though he did lose his courage and ran at the last minute. 
    He started the whole thing going. 
    He organized the expedition. 
    He was the general that laid down the plan of action and was therefore completely culpable for the death of the deceased in this case. 
    Now --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="122.234" stopTime="130.836">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Was it agreed that they plan the expedition for the purpose of murdering this man?
speaker="howard_m_fender" startTime="130.836" stopTime="139.490">
    Mr. Howard M. Fender 
    Oh, to the purpose of shooting him Your Honor and actually, it was for the purpose of shooting him. 
    At the trial, they naturally claim that they were just trying to fight. 
    The deceased had been --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="139.490" stopTime="142.246">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well, if that -- that was a contested fact, I take it?
speaker="howard_m_fender" startTime="142.246" stopTime="158.631">
    Mr. Howard M. Fender 
    Yes sir. 
    The deceased had been running around with the petitioner's girlfriend, age 16. 
    And some bad blood had arisen between them and he went around and said he was going to go there and shoot him.

    Mr. Howard M. Fender 
    The -- at that time, under a single hearing, the jury found guilt or innocence and fixed the punishment. 
    Under our new code, guilt or innocence is first determined except in murder -- in capital cases which still continue that way. 
    So the jury under the present system still fixes both in capital cases which murder is.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="195.369" stopTime="208.365">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well then, did the jury fixes the punishment, I presume it might be quite relevant whether he abandoned the intention to do whatever he's trying to do before --

    Well.

    Mr. Howard M. Fender

speaker="earl_warren" startTime="231.290" stopTime="233.868">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Because he was the codefendant only.
speaker="howard_m_fender" startTime="233.868" stopTime="239.711">
    Mr. Howard M. Fender 
    And because the statute specifically prohibited codefendants from testifying for one or another at that time, yes sir.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="239.711" stopTime="240.519">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Yes, yes.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="240.519" stopTime="242.519">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    What was his sentence, the codefendant?
speaker="howard_m_fender" startTime="242.519" stopTime="307.915">
    Mr. Howard M. Fender 
    (Inaudible) got 50 years, Your Honor. 
    And I might add that the -- in an examination of the record here you will see that the codefendant at the time of his trial was trying to lay it all on the petitioner. 
    The affidavit of the codefendant according to the statements of attorneys in the -- in our transcript here, he was switching around and after he gotten his 50 years, which we feel is the perfect justification for the legislature adopting this rule. 
    That is to having been convicted, given his 50 years then the codefendant Fuller was going to turn around and switch his story. 
    And it's not adequate to say that perjury can be brought because as this Court well knows conflicts and statements do not necessarily support perjury. 
    First place we'd have to prove at which time the man was lying. 
    But he obviously was changing his story from the time of his trial when he was putting on the petitioner that is the codefendant Fuller was changing his story from the time of his own trial to the time of this trial.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="307.915" stopTime="312.314">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren

    I cannot --

    Mr. Howard M. Fender 
    My explanation to that Your Honor is that the -- if the prosecutor in interrogating these people as prospect to witnesses, unless he should make some improper promise and of course that would invalidate any witness' testimony.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="339.448" stopTime="341.315">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Invalidate it or so that he (Voice Overlap) --
speaker="howard_m_fender" startTime="341.315" stopTime="344.330">

    It'd be a subject (Voice Overlap) -- it will be subject to attack, Your Honor.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="344.330" stopTime="346.587">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Subject to his credibility, wouldn't it?
speaker="howard_m_fender" startTime="346.587" stopTime="367.004">
    Mr. Howard M. Fender 
    But assuming no improper inducement on the part of the prosecutor, if one codefendant is willing to turn states evidence, the prosecutor is privileged to use it. 
    And I think that is a practice that is followed in states whether or not they have such a statute as Texas has.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="367.004" stopTime="376.999">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well, in principle though what is the difference between him testifying for one side but not being able to testify for the other now, (Voice Overlap)?
speaker="howard_m_fender" startTime="376.999" stopTime="392.168">
    Mr. Howard M. Fender 
    The natural tendency to be more truthful when you are making incriminating statements about a friend and then if you are making statements in his support which I think is a natural human tendency.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="392.168" stopTime="397.495">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Yes, and -- well, not so human tendency for him to accuse rather than to excuse?
speaker="howard_m_fender" startTime="397.495" stopTime="405.340">
    Mr. Howard M. Fender 
    To be truthful in his accusation than to necessarily be truthful in his effort to gain freedom for his friend.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="405.340" stopTime="415.909">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Of course you have another human element depended and to assume, that is the impulse to testify before the Government for any possible (Inaudible).
speaker="howard_m_fender" startTime="415.909" stopTime="467.024">
    Mr. Howard M. Fender 
    That is possibly true but at the same time if the codefendant is subject to acquittal, the severance statutes which were mentioned yesterday permit either of two codefendants to file a motion for severance and to require the trial of the other man first so that he may establish his innocence and thereby become a free agent and competent witness for the codefendant. 
    In this instance the -- Fuller was tried first, convicted and given 50 years. 
    The state felt that it would avail them nothing in the way of seeking the truth of this story to put him on the stand. 
    And in accordance with the statute opposed he's getting on the stand. 
    This has been the ruling of Texas for time immemorial and many other states have had this rule. 
    Some use -- still retain the rule that prohibits codefendants from testifying for one another.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="467.024" stopTime="473.791">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Why did the legislature of Texas change the law since this case?
speaker="howard_m_fender" startTime="473.791" stopTime="480.056">
    Mr. Howard M. Fender 
    Mr. Chief Justice, every prosecutor in the state is asking that same question. 
    All I can say is we, we have to live with it now. 
    We --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="480.056" stopTime="480.242">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well, --
speaker="howard_m_fender" startTime="480.242" stopTime="498.326">
    Mr. Howard M. Fender 
    We have lost a great many of our tools. 
    We still try to go on. 
    I don't believe it was necessarily required but in the sweeping revision of our Code of Criminal Procedure, this was included as one of the changes that the legislature brought about.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="498.326" stopTime="501.292">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    And what it considered fairness?
speaker="howard_m_fender" startTime="501.292" stopTime="533.099">
    Mr. Howard M. Fender 
    I presumed -- presume so Your Honor but I'd -- I would like to add that I don't feel the mere fact that the legislature has now changed the statute would necessarily reflect that the prior statute was bad just as our changing from a single hearing wherein guilt and innocence and punishment were determined to stage hearing. 
    There's not in my mind necessarily mean that the single hearing was bad. 
    And in this instance I feel it's just a change that has come about with the changing times. 
    But I still don't feel that that should be any indictment of our former system.

    Testify on his own defense?
speaker="howard_m_fender" startTime="561.746" stopTime="629.752">
    Mr. Howard M. Fender 
    That's true and also there was a common law rule that developed this rule originally and the common law has been changed. 
    Then most -- and the principle authority cited by petitioner in his brief, the Funk case goes into that but I don't think it's authority for what we're considering here today as I pointed out in my brief. 
    The Funk case was an effort to define or redefine the common law because it was a federal trial and it was necessary for them to apply the common law of the state in determining their procedure. 
    But it -- I don't see that there's any authority for overwriting the statute because this Court in writing in Funk each time that they mention the change always added a proviso in the absence of congressional action or in the absence of legislative statement whereas in our case, we have a statute. 
    There was no question of the common law being applied in this Texas trial. 
    The only place is whether or not our statute is valid as it appears to be for quite sometime. 
    Now, I would like to once again --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="629.752" stopTime="630.818">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    May I ask you what provision?
speaker="howard_m_fender" startTime="630.818" stopTime="631.523">
    Mr. Howard M. Fender 
    Yes sir.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="631.523" stopTime="637.236">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    What affect do you give to the provision of the Sixth Amendment, the compulsory process of witnesses?
speaker="howard_m_fender" startTime="637.236" stopTime="735.972">
    Mr. Howard M. Fender 
    I was just getting ready to mention that, Mr. Justice Black. 
    I feel that the Sixth Amendment to the constitution guarantees to every person who is going to have to stand trial that any witness that is available in his favor will be brought into the Court. 
    In other words you cannot deny him the right to have his witnesses present. 
    In this instance, the witness was available. 
    There's no question about that. 
    He was right there at the Dallas County jail and the Court had to control all remedy; he was admitted that although he was not put on the stand because of the objection that he was available and could have been put on the stand. 
    The state cannot deny a man the right to have a sheriff go out and get the defendant's witnesses in just the same way that he will go out and get the state's witnesses. 
    That to me is the meaning of the Sixth Amendment. 
    But in this instance the man was disqualified. 
    And I feel that you're in the same position as you would be if you brought a man in by compulsory process. 
    And a motion was filed by the state to prohibit his testimony on the grounds that he knew nothing but hearsay testimony, and therefore could have no possible basis for testifying. 
    And if at a hearing on the motion in limine, the Court determined that the witness knew absolutely nothing about the facts of the case except something that he had heard. 
    The Court did properly exclude the testimony of that witness on the grounds that he was disqualified by a reason of lack of knowledge. 
    That would not deny the man compulsory process to bring his witness in. 
    It will only bar the witness from testifying after he arrives in the courtroom.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="735.972" stopTime="748.921">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Suppose the States could go further and abide but no relative of any person charged with the crime should be allowed to be testify for defense?
speaker="howard_m_fender" startTime="748.921" stopTime="762.205">
    Mr. Howard M. Fender 
    I would presume that such a statute would be subject to attack even though I don't -- I can't reasonably expect a legislature in its wisdom to pass such a statute. 
    Nonetheless, I think that would be subject to attack for the reason --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="762.205" stopTime="763.235">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    On what ground?
speaker="howard_m_fender" startTime="763.235" stopTime="785.374">
    Mr. Howard M. Fender 
    On the ground that that would deny a man a fair trial without reason. 
    That it would be outside of the police power of the state to arbitrarily and capriciously prevent anyone from testifying. 
    Whereas I do not believe that the prohibition of a codefendant is arbitrary or capricious but rather that it's based in sound judgment although the judgment has now been changed.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="785.374" stopTime="822.787">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    I didn't (Inaudible) the words, or at sometimes disturbing, arbitrarily and capricious as a substitute for the Court, the Court can utilize to make new laws, constitutional laws when it so desires. 
    But what I was talking about was rather this right -- the Sixth Amendment some on which to having that available means to have them -- have to be used, whether that -- why in your judgment the Sixth Amendment shouldn't be construed so as to bar what Texas has done here?
speaker="howard_m_fender" startTime="822.787" stopTime="837.503">
    Mr. Howard M. Fender 
    Well I think by the same token if it bars that, it would also bar their right to exclude idiots, lunatics, and drunkards which is why I brought it up yesterday. 
    There would be no end to it if you can't bring in -- I mean if you can't --

    And yet I've never had any quarrel with the statute.

    In the Reid case, the question retroactivity arose. 
    I'm sure that there are great many prisoners in the State Penitentiary in Texas right now who in one way or another would claim that they were denied the right to call a codefendant. 
    These are men whose cases have long since been put to rest. 
    Their time for -- neither they took their appeal or their time for appeal has long since expired. 
    It would occur to me that in the event you do overturn this that you might put sometime limitation as you have done in some of your recent decisions so that we would not be faced with a substantial number of applications for writ of habeas corpus in our Court of Criminal Appeals and our federal courts seeking to reopen these cases on this basis.

    I would like to simply remind the Court one more time that this is a hearing under the Sixth Amendment with regard to compulsory process. 
    And the State was made by the counsel, that Spencer, Reid and Belle were affirmed by this Court on the basis that no specific provision the constitution was violated. 
    And in view of the fact that the witness was available in the courthouse and was only prohibited from testifying by the State statute, I would like to urge upon the Court that the principles enunciated in Spencer, Reid, and Belle, would be applicable here because no specific provision of the constitution has been violated. 
    The compulsion of the attendants of witnesses in my view point was not denied to this man. 
    The testimony was denied to him under the statute after the witness had been made physically available to him. 
    The mention of Bonner versus Beto which is pending in the Fifth Circuit and has to do with the husband and wife relationship and the denial of her testimony under similar circumstances where she was a co-indictee is under motion for rehearing by our office. 
    And if we lose there, we're going to ask you all to review it unless you little too adversely in this case and we consider it ill-advised to do so.

   Argument of Charles W. Tessmer
speaker="charles_w_tessmer" startTime="1446.113" stopTime="1478.363">
    Mr. Charles W. Tessmer 
    By way of a few brief concluding remarks, I would like to point out that only a few states prohibit the use of a codefendant at this time. 
    They're listed in the Appendix A of the brief. 
    That's Alabama, Alaska, Kansas, Nebraska, South Dakota, Texas, and Wyoming. 
    I do believe however that in fundamental fairness, the other states outside of my home state Texas apply the rule equally against the State and against the defendant in prohibiting the competency of a codefendant as a witness. 
    With reference to --
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="1478.363" stopTime="1481.399">

    Mr. Charles W. Tessmer 
    It's my opinion, that's true Your Honor. 
    The State cannot in those few states, not -- neither can the defendant. 
    But in Texas, the State may call the accused co-principal.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="1490.402" stopTime="1493.731">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Well, is there any other State which has a statute like this?

    Mr. Charles W. Tessmer

    Mr. Charles W. Tessmer 
    To my knowledge, no Mr. Justice Harlan. 
    In answer to counsel's argument about the record, I would suggest Fuller versus the State, the opinion cited in our brief. 
    The codefendant being first tried as to whether or not he mislead the state. 
    His confession introduced by the State. 
    He stated as follows, Then I saw a man come out on -- of the house on the porch. 
    This is codefendant Fuller testifying in his confession used for the State. 
    That's when I shot the gun one time, Jackie ran. 
    Jackie is Washington. 
    Therefore the State used this evidence, (Inaudible) but its true that Jackie did not fire the gun and that he ran. 
    And I therefore challenge counsel's remarks about perjury and what had happened in the first trial.

    And --

    -- testify against -- rather he indicate that the defendant here had more to do with it than (Voice Overlap) --
speaker="charles_w_tessmer" startTime="1554.057" stopTime="1621.428">
    Mr. Charles W. Tessmer 
    He admitted that in the trial record of firing a shot, he simply tried to justify it on the grounds that he meant to frighten and did not intend to hit the deceased when he came on the front porch, when he fired the shotgun. 
    But in his confession made shortly after arrest used for the state, he clearly exonerated our client. 
    Now, I think all agree that a man is not guilty of a crime by being physically present at the scene unless he by act, word, or gesture encourages the commission. 
    The defense withdrew from the intention and the plan is a valid defense and was so charged by the jury in the Washington case. 
    By way of conclusion, Mr. Justice Harlan pointedly remarked yesterday, is this in fact a compulsory process case? 
    I would say yes. 
    I disagree with the Attorney General of Texas when he states that process means merely getting one to court. 
    I think the effective process is the same as effective counsel, that the legitimate ends of process is to not get the man to the Court outdoor and stop there but to get him into the witness box where he can tell a truthful story.

    Mr. Charles W. Tessmer

    Here the petitioner itself --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1653.543" stopTime="1665.688">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Now, often a testimonial privilege not to testify by its very hypothesis.

    Mr. Charles W. Tessmer 
    I would say that the application in a given case might fall. 
    My point would be that it makes no difference whether we approach this case to the Sixth Amendment by way of the Fourteenth by incorporation. 
    Or whether we approach it under the Fourteenth Amendment alone because in any concept of ordered liberty, the precept that one should have a right to offer the truth by way of defense is a valid precept in law and one that should be enforced by virtue of the Fourteenth Amendment of the constitution.

speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="1724.730" stopTime="1729.395">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Is there any specific provision of the constitution before Congress.
speaker="charles_w_tessmer" startTime="1729.395" stopTime="1824.230">
    Mr. Charles W. Tessmer 
    Then Your Honor I would argue that under the Fourteenth Amendment and that under the fundamental fairness doctrine the right to be heard, the right to make a defense in court that certainly as the Court of Appeals in the Fifth Circuit reasoned in Bonner v. Beto. 
    That where the State by legislation and the trial judge by enforcing the State statute by order suppresses, suppresses evidence showing the truth, the truth of the accused is not guilty, then certainly the principles of Brady against Maryland should be brought in this case. 
    And therefore the conviction would be just as invalid where the State legislature suppresses the truth by statute. 
    And the trial judge enforced it from as if the prosecutor or the Attorney General of Texas suppressed evidence knowingly that would show innocence of the accused. 
    I think either -- by authority of Brady against Maryland or by authority of Pointer against Texas specifically the Sixth Amendment right to compulsory process, this case should be reversed. 
    As pointed out in the Ferguson case and in concluding, that where a truth is sought in a criminal case to be shown by way of defense. 
    That it would seem that any bar to the ascertainment of that truth which is not reasonable are not applied to both parties must fall as was said in the Ferguson case. 
    The indulgence in such an age worn time disallowed principle would be to go backwards into the past. 
    And I respectfully submit in conclusion that this case must be reversed.

    I suppose -- what would you say if the -- does the defendant calls a witness and the witness gets some stand and he is asked a question that calls for hearsay, would you think -- then it has a right to elicit that hearsay from that --
speaker="charles_w_tessmer" startTime="1997.015" stopTime="1999.240">
    Mr. Charles W. Tessmer 
    Certainly not Your Honor. 
    The rules of evidence --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="1999.240" stopTime="2000.512">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Why not?
speaker="charles_w_tessmer" startTime="2000.512" stopTime="2005.734">
    Mr. Charles W. Tessmer 
    Because we deal with rules that have a guarantee of truthfulness to it. 
    Ours --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2005.734" stopTime="2007.576">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    You mean -- do you mean hearsay is unreliable?
speaker="charles_w_tessmer" startTime="2007.576" stopTime="2008.721">
    Mr. Charles W. Tessmer 
    Unreliable.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2008.721" stopTime="2022.468">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    But what if the Texas legislature says, not only is hearsay unreliable but testimony of uncertain witness with a certain relationship to another is unreliable. 
    We judge both to be unreliable in the same category.
speaker="charles_w_tessmer" startTime="2022.468" stopTime="2029.379">
    Mr. Charles W. Tessmer 
    Then I think this honorable Court should weigh in the balance, the reason for it, and the effectiveness of such a rule.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2029.379" stopTime="2035.304">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    So you really think our question is -- isn't the rationality of the Texas Court's judgment?
speaker="charles_w_tessmer" startTime="2035.304" stopTime="2036.903">
    Mr. Charles W. Tessmer 
    Yes, particularly the rationale.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2036.903" stopTime="2040.101">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Are there Texas legislature judgments?
speaker="charles_w_tessmer" startTime="2040.101" stopTime="2056.866">
    Mr. Charles W. Tessmer 
    I would say to this extent that the judgment of the Texas legislature and the enforcement of this particular statute, allowing the prosecution to indict those they think are involved in the crime, and thereby eliminate every possible witness that's indicted until he's tried and acquitted. 
    Certainly that --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2056.866" stopTime="2074.547">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, now let's -- let's say that the Texas legislature had a statute which it may have, I don't know against hearsay. 
    That no hearsay in our courts except in limited -- with limited exception and the reason is that it's unreliable. 
    Do you agree with that judgment?
speaker="charles_w_tessmer" startTime="2074.547" stopTime="2087.005">
    Mr. Charles W. Tessmer 
    I agree they could certainly do that Mr. Justice White because the dying declaration is statutory. 
    We find the -- a reason that it's trustworthy when a man's dying. 
    And he says somebody shot me. 
    Hearsay is untrustworthy but we permit exceptions.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2087.005" stopTime="2110.012">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, let's assume for the moment then that -- let's assume for the moment that you believe and then the Texas legislature also has the present statute, codefendants may not testify if the state objects? 
    What if you believe that that was as rational as the hearsay rule, you wouldn't think then that the Sixth Amendment would outlaw that statute?
speaker="charles_w_tessmer" startTime="2110.012" stopTime="2114.328">
    Mr. Charles W. Tessmer 
    I would think that the Sixth Amendment would outlaw the statute if the --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2114.328" stopTime="2116.713">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, it doesn't outlaw the hearsay statute, you say.
speaker="charles_w_tessmer" startTime="2116.713" stopTime="2126.888">
    Mr. Charles W. Tessmer 
    Would outlaw this statute, Mr. Justice White, if its application evolved and invoked the depravation of Sixth Amendment rights.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2126.888" stopTime="2133.623">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Oh, I agree with that. 
    That's the question. 
    Do you say that the Sixth Amendment is not violated by a hearsay statute?
speaker="charles_w_tessmer" startTime="2133.623" stopTime="2136.634">
    Mr. Charles W. Tessmer 
    I say that, yes Your Honor.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2136.634" stopTime="2143.387">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    What if you believe that the codefendant statute was as rational as a hearsay statute?
speaker="charles_w_tessmer" startTime="2143.387" stopTime="2144.003">
    Mr. Charles W. Tessmer 
    Well, first of all --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2144.003" stopTime="2154.772">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    And the testimony of your codefendant was as unreliable as hearsay. 
    Now let's just assume that. 
    Then I suppose you can not reach the same conclusion on this.
speaker="charles_w_tessmer" startTime="2154.772" stopTime="2161.967">
    Mr. Charles W. Tessmer 
    I would answer it this way. 
    The credibility as for the jury, as triers of the fact, they can adjudge the credibility of the codefendant far better than the legislative.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2161.967" stopTime="2164.394">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    (Inaudible) except for hearsay?
speaker="charles_w_tessmer" startTime="2164.394" stopTime="2165.243">

    Or even the Attorney General figures --

    Except to hearsay?

    Mr. Charles W. Tessmer 
    Subject to hearsay, Your Honor.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2167.969" stopTime="2168.171">

    Well, that --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2168.171" stopTime="2183.203">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    I suppose you wouldn't say though that if as to hearsay that the statute said that a defendant could not produce any hearsay but that the prosecution would or could that it would be bad.
speaker="charles_w_tessmer" startTime="2183.203" stopTime="2186.151">
    Mr. Charles W. Tessmer 
    I would feel that would be highly unfair, Your Honor.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2186.151" stopTime="2196.645">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well, then why isn't it unfair to allow the defendant's wife to testify in his behalf but to prohibit the State from allowing her to testify in its behalf?
speaker="charles_w_tessmer" startTime="2196.645" stopTime="2198.962">
    Mr. Charles W. Tessmer 
    We do not prohibit the State from --

    Funk case and the Hawkins case?
speaker="charles_w_tessmer" startTime="2203.985" stopTime="2221.493">
    Mr. Charles W. Tessmer 
    I would say Mr. Justice Stewart since time immemorial, our courts and all courts of law, England is not to the contrary, have recognized the most intimate relationship in the world as man and wife. 
    And that anything that comes between what God has joined together, they must follow unless there's a real necessity for it.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2221.493" stopTime="2225.038">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    No, we're talking about the ascertainment of truth in a criminal trial, aren't we?
speaker="charles_w_tessmer" startTime="2225.038" stopTime="2225.437">
    Mr. Charles W. Tessmer 
    Yes Your Honor.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2225.437" stopTime="2237.503">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    And certainly, the -- prohibiting the Government from getting the true facts from the wife of the defendant is to impair that process of ascertaining the truth, is it not?
speaker="charles_w_tessmer" startTime="2237.503" stopTime="2247.880">
    Mr. Charles W. Tessmer 
    I would agree with that and I certainly think it must face the balancing of interest test just like the Fifth Amendment prohibits the prosecution from calling the defendant and ascertaining truth.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2247.880" stopTime="2250.578">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Exactly, I mean, although he may if he wants to testify in his advocate.
speaker="charles_w_tessmer" startTime="2250.578" stopTime="2259.066">
    Mr. Charles W. Tessmer 
    Certainly, but we must here balance the rights involved which is more important to Fifth, the Fourteenth and the Sixth where they conflict.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2259.066" stopTime="2283.455">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    And I suppose also you would say that the state could limit itself in any way it wants to the manner in which it would prosecute a man because it is not subject to the Bill of Rights. 
    But that it -- there are certain things that it cannot do as to an individual on its Bill of Rights, and wouldn't that be a factor in it too?
speaker="charles_w_tessmer" startTime="2283.455" stopTime="2292.477">
    Mr. Charles W. Tessmer 
    I would certainly think so and I think it would go back to a fundamental fair right to trial under the Fourteenth Amendment of the constitution Your Honor.

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    With reference to yesterday, there's a man who gives hearsay evidence to testify to have knowledge of the facts of an offense?

    Mr. Charles W. Tessmer 
    Of course, the hearsay rule has no application except for the matters offered to prove the truth thereof. 
    Secondly I would say that the hearsay rule is valid and reasonable.

    What is the hearsay rule?
speaker="charles_w_tessmer" startTime="2315.184" stopTime="2335.662">

    That out of court statements made without the sanction of both which you're offered to prove that that statement is true and made without the right of confrontation of that hearsay witness, and made without the right to cross-examine that hearsay witness would certainly be violative of due process. 
    Certainly if there's a valid reason for it because we just said in Pointer --

    Mr. Charles W. Tessmer 
    Your Honor, there's some colloquy in the record about objections. 
    The citation is 397 S.W. 2d, South Western Reporter Second at page 434 wherein the State used Fuller's confession as evidence of the truth of what happened.

    The confession set out in that case.

    Hearsay.

    Justice Byron R. White 
    Now if you were to hear from one of these other states that has a statute like this except that it applies to both the state and the defendant, you'd be making the same argument, wouldn't you?
speaker="charles_w_tessmer" startTime="2468.141" stopTime="2470.409">
    Mr. Charles W. Tessmer 
    I would be making the same argument with this --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2470.409" stopTime="2471.937">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Based on the Sixth Amendment.
speaker="charles_w_tessmer" startTime="2471.937" stopTime="2495.328">
    Mr. Charles W. Tessmer 
    On the Sixth Amendment with this exception Mr. Justice White. 
    And that is that if the rule were applied equally against the state and the defendant equally, that neither one could use him. 
    And if the rule as I believe it to be in some of those states is that after trial of the other man, he has no interest whether he's convicted or whether he's acquitted, then from many of those states permit him to testify. 
    We don't. 
    We'd have to wait 50 years.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2495.328" stopTime="2513.950">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Yes. 
    But let's assume right here that in this -- this was in another state what happened here and the defendant offered his codefendant (Voice Overlap) objection. 
    I suppose you would be making the same argument such that that's an irrational judgment.
speaker="charles_w_tessmer" startTime="2513.950" stopTime="2532.768">
    Mr. Charles W. Tessmer 
    By virtue of the concurring opinion in Ferguson against Georgia, I would agree wholeheartedly with that concurrence that that statute should fall. 
    Justice -- some of the justices felt that the Article 40, 416, Georgia Code should fall even though there was no objection in the trial court to not being sworn.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2532.768" stopTime="2543.494">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    I take that your basis is that the Sixth Amendment doesn't overwrite sensible or rational testimonial qualifications statutes.
speaker="charles_w_tessmer" startTime="2543.494" stopTime="2546.033">
    Mr. Charles W. Tessmer 
    I would agree with that to some extent, yes Your Honor.

    I would say that -- pardon me?
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2548.680" stopTime="2549.900">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    It's the balancing proposition.
speaker="charles_w_tessmer" startTime="2549.900" stopTime="2572.053">
    Mr. Charles W. Tessmer 
    The balancing, I would say that the Sixth Amendment, the right to a speedy trial is somewhat relative and this is something that you couldn't automatically say work the constitutional deprivation whether it was six months or three months or a year. 
    Certainly, it's not as strong as Pointer confrontation, cross-examination, and compulsory process. 
    Thank you very much.
