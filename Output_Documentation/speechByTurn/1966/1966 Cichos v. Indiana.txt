Cichos v. Indiana
speaker="john_p_price" startTime="0.000" stopTime="116.235">
    Mr. John P. Price 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    May I first move the admission pro hac vice of my adversary Mr. Douglas McFadden, the Deputy Attorney General in the office of the attorney general for the State of Indiana. 
    I would so move his admission if I could sir. 
    The issue presented by the instance case pertains to the nature and quality of the protection against double jeopardy. 
    Specifically we have asked this Court to revisit the decision of Palko versus Connecticut. 
    Specifically this case then concerned itself with whether the protection against double jeopardy is of such statute so as to be immune from state encroachment under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. 
    The petitioner in this case was charged in two counts, the first was the violation in Indiana of the crime of reckless homicide and then the second count, the offense of involuntary manslaughter. 
    After a lengthy trial the petitioner was convicted only of the crime of reckless homicide and the jury returned no verdict on the count of involuntary manslaughter. 
    Although we submit it's not really germane to the academic question here, it is well settled in Indiana that jury silence on account is tantamount to an acquittal. 
    So I submit that in every legal effect this petitioner was convicted of the crime of reckless homicide and acquitted of the crime of involuntary manslaughter.

    Mr. John P. Price 
    Mr. Justice, there is another statute in Indiana which I think recognizes the very double jeopardy features that we're submitting to you today. 
    In that it provides these two counts may be joined in one indictment or affidavit. 
    The trial then can concur simultaneously as to both. 
    It goes on to point out however that conviction as to one if they're tried separately is a bar to a prosecution of the other and if there tried concurrently that a defendant may be sentenced only as to one.

    None -- in this case, this petitioner was then charged as this statute to which you refer permits in two counts with both of these offenses. 
    Remembering of course that there qualitatively identical so in effect he was charged twice with the same offense in the sense that no element is in one that's not in the other. 
    He then appealed his conviction which resulted only on the reckless homicide count to the Indiana Supreme Court and the Supreme Court of Indiana reversed.

    Mr. John P. Price 
    No sir, no sir. 
    We sit back down and petitioner again retried not only for reckless homicide but also for involuntary manslaughter for which he had been legally acquitted. 
    Petitioner raised the question of his protection from double jeopardy both under the Indiana and Federal Constitutions at the trial level and the trial court held against his contention based apparently on its reading of the Palko decision.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    The Indiana constitution contain a --

    Double jeopardy.

speaker="john_p_price" startTime="374.937" stopTime="411.992">
    Mr. John P. Price 
    It does sir. 
    But the courts have interpreted the Indiana constitutional double jeopardy provision substantially different in the federal courts that had interpreted this one and this case is a classic example. 
    I think the Indiana Supreme Court recognizes clearly that the Green decision interpreting double jeopardy in the federal constitution is not the law in the State of Indiana. 
    The appeal to the Indiana Supreme Court then resulted in an affirmance surely.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="411.992" stopTime="416.267">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    But what is that, the Indiana test of double jeopardy?
speaker="john_p_price" startTime="416.267" stopTime="420.019">
    Mr. John P. Price 
    Well, insofar as the -- if you're speaking of the same evidence type --
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="420.019" stopTime="420.664">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Yes, that's what it --
speaker="john_p_price" startTime="420.664" stopTime="570.817">
    Mr. John P. Price 
    -- Mr. Justice and I think it is to that degree somewhat attend to the federal test. 
    But if you are talking about vertical or horizontal offenses where there has been an acquittal or an implied acquittal such as existed in the Green decision then the interpretations are totally different, the antifascist of each other. 
    The Indiana statutes have another provision to the effect that when a petitioner or when an appellant appeals in Indiana and secures a new trial. 
    This is what he gets and by that they mean a new trial as to every thing including charges for which he's been acquitted. 
    Now, I submit this is diametrically opposed to the decision of this Court in the federal level in Green, in the Green decision. 
    I point out the affirmance of the trail court's decision in -- by the Indiana Supreme Court partly to call your attention to a phrase which I think typifies the character and nature that the Indiana Supreme Court has given to double jeopardy when it stated in its opinion that this right, the protection from double jeopardy is not a hallmark under either the federal or state systems of jurisprudence. 
    I think it's clear from this opinion that the Indiana Supreme Court regards double jeopardy as something totally within its power to obliterate or control. 
    I submit that the state in its brief in this case has not really objected at any point to the question but what -- there was double jeopardy. 
    Its argument has proceeded entirely on the question of there was a waiver or perhaps no prejudice exist here or some other aspect to it. 
    But we are in complete accord as far as I understand their position to be that double jeopardy actually existed. 
    This man was retried again from the count of involuntary manslaughter for what she had already once been legally acquitted. 
    And when it is remembered that involuntary manslaughter and reckless homicide are identical qualitatively in essence this man stood trial twice on four different counts for the identical offense.

    Now I submit there is some questionableness about that statute permitting a joinder up to qualitatively identical offenses. 
    But we're not raising that question here. 
    We're raising the fact that he was actually tried twice on involuntary manslaughter after he had first been acquitted of that offense.

    Mr. John P. Price 
    Well, the involuntary manslaughter statute is a much older statute which is enacted really from the common law. 
    It's a common law originated type of statute and covers the traditional involuntary manslaughter offenses. 
    Reckless homicide is a specific automobile offense geared to securing prosecutions and convections for automobile deaths. 
    But -- and they do have separate penalties, this is true. 
    The involuntary manslaughter situation would cover cases that the reckless homicide would not factually.

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Oh, but that's not -- that's the -- you're just using a presumption there, just a rule, a normal rule that that you will assume there was an acquittal if there is silence by the jury. 
    And here there isn't a silence by the jury as to involuntary manslaughter in the sense that they -- they find guilty of every elements they detect to make it out.
speaker="john_p_price" startTime="960.911" stopTime="981.876">
    Mr. John P. Price 
    This is true. 
    There is a finding of guilty on the reckless homicide charge which includes every element of involuntary manslaughter. 
    But I cannot escape from the fact and maybe it is repetitive that he was tried. 
    I think really in terms of double jeopardy it makes no difference whether he was convicted or acquitted. 
    He was in jeopardy on involuntary manslaughter.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="981.876" stopTime="995.313">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Well, I know -- I think you answered the Chief Justice earlier Mr. Price that the -- had they limited the weak prosecution to the prosecution under the label reckless homicide, you wouldn't be here?
speaker="john_p_price" startTime="995.313" stopTime="996.534">
    Mr. John P. Price 
    Yes sir. 
    But I --
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="996.534" stopTime="1018.179">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    So that I must -- as I have trouble with, if the test of double jeopardy is prosecution a second time for the same conduct -- for the same conduct, what difference would it make whether they -- if they're entitled to do it under the label of reckless homicide, why would they be entitled to do it under the -- on the label involuntary manslaughter?
speaker="john_p_price" startTime="1018.179" stopTime="1121.767">
    Mr. John P. Price 
    I think it makes substantial difference Mr. Justice Brennan. 
    First, in a forced prosecution leverage in the sense of two counts for the same thing, I think there's something inherently unfair in permitting the state to enact over and over and over again ad infinitum in different -- with different names the same statutory offense. 
    Then I think to subject him to trial twice after the jury has at least failed to convict him certainly the presumptions are in favor of a criminal defendant here I think. 
    I think all the laws to that effect. 
    Then you necessarily must interpret the jury verdict in favor of the state in order to reach this type of conclusion and the third reason is that in Indiana under Burns Indiana statutes 91820. 
    All felonies with indeterminate sentences -- all felonies with indeterminate sentences have a court function to determine the sentence. 
    The court actually determines the sentence in Indiana. 
    This is the import of that Section, 91820. 
    Any where there is a felony with an indeterminate sentence it is a judicial function to determine the sentence within those indeterminate propositions. 
    Now, if you are to accept the state's position here that the jury could really pick out which one of this they were going to convict on, you would be running directive -- directly contra to the very Section in Indiana which says this is a court function. 
    The court determines this sentence not the jury by picking out one or the other of exactly the same offenses.

    Sir I don't see how it can help but reach Palko but not because of the four times that he was tried for the identical offense but because of the fact that he was tried twice for an offense for which he had once been legally acquitted. 
    Now, it's true in Parco the facts arose differently and that the state had a right to appeal under the Connecticut statute. 
    Now, to that degree the facts are different but there was a retrial of the man on the same offense in Palko and that's exactly what occurred here. 
    He was retried for this same offense for which he'd been convicted or acquitted. 
    Now, I see no difference academically whether does offenses happen to be stack up vertically like they were in Green includable offenses or whether there set side by side horizontally as they are here. 
    In fact academically it seems worst to do it this way.

    Mr. John P. Price 
    I am certain that there was not. 
    Certain as I can be without going through the entire record. 
    The jury was told that there was no provision here to return a verdict on only one of these two counts. 
    In fact if I may answer this way Mr. Justice, I think this would in itself impose an improper provision because the statute in Indiana specifically provides in all indeterminate sentence cases that it's a court function to determine the sentence not a jury function. 
    And if a court would take it upon itself at the trial level to say to the jury, you determine which one of this you're going to convict of. 
    You have delegated that its sentence making power form the judiciary to the jury.

    Mr. Douglas B. McFadden 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    The major question in this case is not whether the double jeopardy provision of the Fifth Amendment is incorporated in the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth and therefore directly applicable to the states because even assuming arguendo that it is. 
    Ronald Cichos was not twice put in jeopardy. 
    Let me just briefly go back to the facts. 
    Ronald Cichos went to trial on a two count, amended affidavit charging him with reckless homicide and involuntary manslaughter. 
    The jury came in with a verdict, finding him guilty of reckless homicide. 
    From that verdict he filed a motion for new trial. 
    The trial court overruled his motion and from the ruling on the motion for new trial he appealed, the Supreme Court of Indiana assigning as his only heir the trial court's ruling on the motion for new trial. 
    Supreme Court of Indiana granted him the exact relief that he prayed for. 
    They grant him of a new trial which in Indiana under Indiana's appellate procedure means a complete new trial. 
    And this is what he received on the second trial and also he received an identical verdict.The jury again came in finding him guilty of reckless homicide. 
    It is our position that the petitioner's reliance upon Green versus United States is completely unfounded. 
    Green versus United States is wholly inapplicable to the case at bar on -- for several reasons, one of which is the waiver question. 
    Now this Court rejected the Government's contentions on waiver on the double jeopardy on -- after a -- the granting of a new trial in Green Versus United States. 
    But that however does not dispose of the question on waiver in this case for the reason that in this case you're dealing with state appellate procedure and the constitution does not require a state to provide a system of appellate review. 
    Does not provide a system of appellate -- require a system of appellate procedure. 
    This Court in McKane verus Durston said that a state may accord an appeal upon whatever terms it deems proper which was cited with approval in Griffin v. Illinois. 
    So it is our position first of all that Ronald Cichos waived the double jeopardy question when he sought a new trial in the Indiana Supreme Court. 
    The only limitation that this Court is put upon McKane v. Durston was that in Griffin v. Illinois when it said, "The state's appellate court system cannot be discriminatory under the Equal Protection Clause." 
    It's not to say that a state must provide a system of appellate review but only that it cannot be discriminatory. 
    So, the waiver question cannot be decided by this Court in the same way that was decided in Green because you are dealing with two different systems unless this Court is prepared to say that there is a constitutional right to appeal. 
    It must hold Ronald Cichos has waived the double jeopardy question but even if we assume arguendo that he has not waived the double jeopardy question, Ronald Cichos was never twice put in jeopardy in this case. 
    Because it's been pointed out Indiana law and we will agree with Mr. Price, reckless homicide and involuntary manslaughter where an automobile is involved or identical offenses requiring identical proof only the punishment differs. 
    Reckless homicide carries a punishment of 1 to 5 as in this case, involuntary manslaughter 2 to 21. 
    It is for this reason -- it is our position that Stroud versus United States is controlling in the case at bar and not Green versus United States because here you cannot say that the jury silence is tantamount to acquittal.

    In that connection may I ask, I noticed your Supreme Court that in saying that it was not conclusively as an implied acquittal that they do that especially since this Court judicially know that trail court practice of telling jury to return the verdict on only one of the charges in view of the limitation on penalty. 
    My question is, was this jury told in the first trial? 
    I don't see it in the (Inaudible) records.

    I see.
speaker="douglas_b_mcfadden" startTime="2238.409" stopTime="2365.734">
    Mr. Douglas B. McFadden 
    The jury however, it would appear from the Supreme Court's opinion as Your Honor has pointed out was aware of this and therefore the jury's silence on the involuntary manslaughter count must be taken as a manifestation of mercy and certainly not acquittal because the fact that you have the identical fact patterns and proof required. 
    Now, this is what distinguishes this case in Green versus United States is the failure of proof question. 
    There is a difference in the proof required for felony murder, second degree murder and manslaughter. 
    Well in Green, you had a man who was convicted, charged and convicted of felony murder. 
    After this the jury found him guilty of second degree murder after which they went back for a new trail and he was found guilty of felony murder. 
    Now, -- well the distinctions are subtle, there is a difference on the proof required between felony murder and second degree murder. 
    Felony murder requires proof of a killing and the perpetration of one of the common law felonies. 
    In this instance it was arson. 
    Second degree murder is a finding of a killing with malice in the absence of premeditation. 
    So it's possible for the prosecution to have failed in its proof in that first trial in Green and then come back for another chance at it in the second trial. 
    It might contrast in Stroud versus United States you had a man who went to trial three times for first degree murder. 
    The first time he received the death sentence. 
    After a successful appeal, he received a sentence -- I think it was life. 
    After again a successful appeal he received the death sentence and this Court affirmed the decision below saying that the jury's decision in that second case was not a failure of proof, it's not sufficient to put him on double jeopardy but was nothing more than a manifestation of mercy on the part of the jury which is exactly what we have in this case.

    Your Honor he was never convicted of involuntary manslaughter. 
    Both times the jury came in and found him guilty of reckless homicide. 
    You see --
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="3228.933" stopTime="3292.861">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Mr. McFadden, looking again at the instruction which is certainly detailed that sets out one, two, three, four, five and instructs the jury you may answer one of these and no more. 
    And the first one as I recall it is if you are to find him guilty generally you just find, say yes. 
    Guilty generally and then as a matter of law there told that carries the higher penalty and number two is if you want to find him guilty of reckless homicide fill in this, the answers to these questions and that carries such and such a penalty. 
    Number three is, if you want to find him guilty of involuntary manslaughter fill in this question, the answers to these questions and then they carry such and such a penalty. 
    Now, why is -- why didn't the jury deliberately make a choice here? 
    When it filled in the answers to the questions on reckless homicide, why isn't that exactly like Green as in -- as implying a rejection or an acquittal on the basis of the involuntary homicide?
speaker="douglas_b_mcfadden" startTime="3292.861" stopTime="3298.544">
    Mr. Douglas B. McFadden 
    Because here unlike in Green, you don't have a failure of proof in the sense --
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="3298.544" stopTime="3323.214">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    No but here the jury -- actually here the jury's given a choice. 
    The jury may find reckless homicide or involuntary manslaughter or a jungle verdict of guilty. 
    They're given those three choices and among the three the (Inaudible) the reckless homicide. 
    Now, why isn't that a rejection by the jury in the sense of an acquittal --
speaker="douglas_b_mcfadden" startTime="3323.214" stopTime="3323.625">
    Mr. Douglas B. McFadden 
    Because if you --

    -- on the other two choices?

    If you have -- because you have a requirement of identical proof Your Honor.

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    But did this jury rejected both, it rejected both the general verdict which would have carried the manslaughter penalty and it rejected the involuntary manslaughter count specifically and chose specifically the reckless homicide.

speaker="douglas_b_mcfadden" startTime="3349.495" stopTime="3368.873">
    Mr. Douglas B. McFadden 
    Your Honor is right on the punishment. 
    There was a rejection on the punishment but not on the facts as far as guilt is concerned. 
    There was no rejection on the guilt but there was a rejection on the punishment and that is our point. 
    This was a mitigation of punishment by this jury and not an acquittal on the facts.

    What you really have to do to reverse this case then I would suppose you would argue is to say that he couldn't have been retried on reck -- for reckless homicide either.

speaker="douglas_b_mcfadden" startTime="3452.853" stopTime="3610.985">
    Mr. Douglas B. McFadden 
    No, I will not go that far because he was never either. 
    Never was he acquitted of involuntary manslaughter and the final analysis, I am compelled to defend the decision by this Court in Palko versus Connecticut and the opinion written by Mr. Justice Cardozo and compelled because in it's very core and in its very heart it is right. 
    It is right because it recognizes the distinction that double jeopardy and if I might also add this speedy trial clause, the Sixth Amendment stand on a different footing on the remainder of the Bill of Rights. 
    They stand on a different category because now with these two you deal with procedural constitutional rights and not evidentiary constitutional rights or what also could be terms substantive constitutional rights. 
    Now, I draw those three distinctions in the sense that speedy trial and double jeopardy constitute a bar to prosecution when they are violated. 
    You have a violation of one of the evidentiary constitutional rights, he receives a new trial. 
    But double jeopardy since it did not -- since appellate procedure did not exist at common law as it does in modern America procedure involves questions of policy and policy questions which are not subject to the clear mandate of a constitution should be left to court's exercising there supervisory powers. 
    Therefore the policy questions should be left to the highest court's of the states rather to then to this Court with exception and this exception does exist that this Court, I think has recognized there is some double jeopardy in the Fourteenth Amendment. 
    Not the same as the Fifth Amendment but there is some double jeopardy there. 
    Well that's the same double jeopardy that existed at common law. 
    Now, the double jeopardy in the Fifth Amendment, I think we have to recognize is the double jeopardy that as applies in the federal system to modern appellate procedure. 
    Therefore because it is a policy question it should be left -- supervisory capacity of highest courts of the states under this Court over highest courts in the federal system. 
    We therefore ask this Court to affirm the decision of the Supreme Court of Indiana. 
   
   
   
   Rebuttal of John P. Price

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Price.
speaker="john_p_price" startTime="3612.448" stopTime="3785.927">
    Mr. John P. Price 
    Mr. Chief Justice, please the Court. 
    May I first comment on the questions that have been asked concerning the Indiana statutes and the question of, if an acquittal occurs as to one offense the effect upon a second trial for the other and I refer to page 15 of our brief where the statute itself is quoted if I may take from that statute this sentence, "With respect to the offense of reckless homicide and involuntary manslaughter, a final judgment of conviction of one shall be a bar to the other." 
    It does not say an acquittal presumably, State of Indiana especially if the Supreme Court has interpreted the statutes it could not only enact statutes endlessly for the same offense but could try then piecemeal under that Section. 
    The state's argument, if it please the Court presumes that there is no constitutional encroachment regardless of how many times the legislature may reenact the same qualitative statute that there is never a point where this has constitutional implications and I submit to law is just not that calloused. 
    The state says that Cichos here may have been put in jeopardy but he waived his jeopardy. 
    He waived it by taken a new trail on the conditions that the State of Indiana imposes. 
    I submit to you that the state cannot impose a relinquishment of a constitutional protection as the price of an appeal whether an appeal be a constitutionally guaranteed right or not and I cite two cases from this Court that arose in Indiana, Dowd versus Cook, 340 U.S. 206 and Lane versus Brown, 372 U.S. 477. 
    There the appellate procedure for an indigent defendant was left solely to the discretion of the public defender whether the public defender wanted to order a transcript or not and this Court struck that down as discriminatory and improper. 
    The state could not impose this type of price for the exercising the right to appeal.. 
    On the question of mootness and no prejudice, I submit to you that any time may jury has within it the power to compromise on alternative counts for the same offense compromising jury possibilities of the worst sort are present. 
    I submit to you that prosecution leverage of the worst sort is present when a state cannot only enact over and over again the same offense but can try over and over again for the same offense.

    Justice Byron R. White 
    Counsel, I'm looking at this original transcript and the court's instruction number 10 has this in it, if you find defendant guilty on either count on the affidavit and say nothing about the other count that would be equivalent to finding him not guilty on the count you do not mention. 
    Now, the Indiana Supreme Court seems to disagree with that but whether it does or it doesn't, wasn't the jury told what it would be doing if it didn't mention count two?

    Mr. John P. Price 
    No sir, we're arguing that we should have a new trial under reckless homicide, it's all we're asking here.

    You're not asking -- you don't -- you're not saying that you would be barred from being retried for reckless homicide.

    Mr. John P. Price 
    That is correct sir, that is correct. 
    Now, I think that may have been on the case at one point but at this point we are only asking to be tried on one count, the count for which this man has been convicted and to leave the prosecution leverage and the compromising jury possibilities in this dual count out of this trial.

    Do you stand that it was waived, your trial (Inaudible)?

    Mr. John P. Price 
    No sir, if that is double jeopardy I am not. 
    My contention is that we raise the question of double jeopardy insofar as it pertains to the retrial of the involuntary manslaughter statute. 
    I think there is a very grave question whether he can be tried all over again for reckless homicide but that was not injected at the trail of the case. 
    Thank you sir.
