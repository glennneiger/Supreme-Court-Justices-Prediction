    Mr. Nick Chaivoe 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    As Mr. Skopil indicated in his opening argument the two primary problems involved here and which I am going to discuss the question of jurisdiction which is two-pronged. 
    One is question of jurisdiction over the subject matter of this suit, and secondly the question of jurisdiction of the persons. 
    It is the respondent's position in this case that whether or not the persons injured in the Greyhound bus, the 35 persons who were injured in the Greyhound bus as a result of this accident had a right to proceed against the insurance carriers under the case of Brillhart versus Excess Insurance Companymust be decided according to the laws of the state and it should be pointed out that the State of Oregon as stated by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals has no direct action statute permitting a cause of action to be brought against the insurance carriers until after judgment, that is judgment against the person carrying the coverage. 
    Furthermore the statute State of Oregon is even more restrictive. 
    There are two statutes Oregon revised statute 23230 which states that only after judgment is secured against the assured may the individual then proceed against the insurance carrier. 
    The second statute 730 ORS 736.320 sets forth that bankruptcy does not relieve the insurance carrier of its responsibility. 
    That after judgment is unsatisfied for 30 days then the person securing the judgment may proceed against the insurance carrier. 
    These are the only two statutes in the State of Oregon committing recovery against an insurance company arising out of a casualty of this nature. 
    We submit then that based upon the laws in State of Oregon there is no subject matter jurisdiction here. 
    The injured persons in the Greyhound bus are not claimants under the interpleader statute 1335.

    Mr. Nick Chaivoe 
    We have moved for a change of venue Your Honor, but that point has never been reached by the Oregon District Court because of the District Court’s position on the restraining order. 
    We filed a interlocutory appeal under 1292 (b) and the circuit court then took jurisdiction on this matter has -- has since come up as a result of the jurisdiction of the decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals. 
    The question of venue has never been argued in the Oregon Courts. 
    The Court in Oregon feeling that before they proceeded any further in this matter we should wait for the final determination of the whether or not interpleader would like.

    Mr. Nick Chaivoe 
    This is a matter in equity Your Honor and we believe that once equity takes jurisdiction over the case that there is no right of trial by jury traditionally in equity. 
    The interpleader statute thus has not have provision for trial by jury and I believe there is one case and I am not certain the exact title, Signal Oil case which I believe supports my position that once in equity, no right of trial by jury exists.

    Mr. Nick Chaivoe 
    This is our interpretation of what would occur Your Honor. 
    We have, we’d have a mass trial of 35 persons claims perhaps 40 persons if we include the bus driver and the driver or the owner of the pick up truck, its somewhere between 35 to 40 persons involved in one mass trial without a trial by jury without the individual damages of each person being presented as we feel to a jury and we feel should have a constitutional right to trial by jury under the United States Constitution and under Constitution of State of Oregon.

speaker="james_griswold" startTime="586.843" stopTime="666.379">
    Mr. James Griswold 
    That’s correct Your Honor. 
    If the Court passes on this question of jurisdiction it may not reach these other things as to jury trial. 
    In our case for these clients of course an affirmance of the Ninth Circuit would solve these problems. 
    Actually the problems are much more far reaching than the question of service upon the Canadian and this I think is well borne out by the other two decisions that are matters, cases that are now pending, cases that have been presented to the District Court in Oregon, as presented to this Court by the brief amicus curiae and the case of Travelers Insurance versus Greyhound out of Louisiana. 
    We have given the citation in our brief of the Travelers case. 
    For the Court’s information that the matter has been taken to the Fifth Circuit, oral arguments were held on February 1st, this is the Travelers versus Greyhound case. 
    The primary problem that concerns us in the overall picture is this question of a jury trial. 
    What kind of a jury trial if any would be obtained by these people if interfered –
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="666.379" stopTime="672.010">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Suppose they have no jury trial problem, how would you feel that?

    Mr. James Griswold 
    How would I feel about that?
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="673.480" stopTime="676.482">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    This case.
speaker="james_griswold" startTime="676.482" stopTime="709.401">
    Mr. James Griswold 
    If a jury trial was granted I then would ask the Court what kind of a jury trial? 
    Is this were 35 attorneys representing 35 plaintiffs would appear in one trial before the Court on liability, or one trial before the Court on the question of damages as to these people, one jury for all of these issues or would there be separate jury trials each -- for each party, each injured person on the question of liability and upon the question of damage.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="709.401" stopTime="723.070">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Assuming you could get separate jury trial precisely as you could get in state courts in each of the cases how would you feel about this transfer if that were true?
speaker="james_griswold" startTime="723.070" stopTime="857.044">
    Mr. James Griswold 
    The only damage that I could then see from a selfish point of view for the injured people would be that they could not then choose -- make the choice of forum that they would presently have if it were not for interpleader. 
    That the residents in the State of Washington, the Longview case is presently on file in the General Fire versus Greyhound, they could not proceed in Longview, Washington. 
    The residents of the State of California could not proceed in California. 
    This would be the damage or the injury. 
    In a personal injury case of course the choice of forum is most important to the injured party. And I say this because they have the right to choose their Attorney that will represent them rather than a trial committee. 
    They most often will hurry to their homes after an injury and seek the attention of their family doctor. The cost of taking depositions or having their doctors travel a distance to the place of trial could be substantial. 
    These are the ramifications of taking these people from so many states and so many of them and bringing them all together in one state Oregon, California, Washington whatever it might be or it could have been possibly except for the policy defense here, it could have been Montana. 
    So it isn’t just a grant or denial of a jury trial. 
    It's a grant or denial of all of these other aspects which accompany a jury trial and speaking for the plaintiffs in this cause and I feel that I am speaking for plaintiffs in the Louisiana bus accident and the plaintiffs in the Grants Pass Oregon accident. 
    Interpleader in this type situation, even with an individual jury trial for each party injured, if through interpleader would have necessity be in one Court in one jurisdiction and would cause additional expense and additional delay.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="857.044" stopTime="897.833">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    I am not sure sir that I quite understand your theory then as to what the interpleader statute means. 
    Is it your theory that the interpleader statute means that in this case State Life couldn’t deposit the principal of its policy in a Court and that judgment could not be obtained against State Life in any other court, although the plaintiffs would be free to bring their actions in any other court and I have to say that. 
    Is that your theory of what it means?
speaker="james_griswold" startTime="897.833" stopTime="930.806">
    Mr. James Griswold 
    No, I don’t believe that I would approve that statement Your Honor. 
    The interpleader proceeding means that everybody is brought to -- in my mind, everybody is brought to one Court, the appropriate restraining orders are entered preventing them from doing anything other than in that Court and if in this case by their complaint if it's found that there is insurance coverage that money would then be deposited in Court and State Farm will then walk away. 
    This of course is what they want.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="930.806" stopTime="932.980">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Money is deposited at the outset, isn’t it?
speaker="james_griswold" startTime="932.980" stopTime="935.097">
    Mr. James Griswold 
    Yes that’s correct, (Inaudible) yes.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="935.097" stopTime="957.734">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Now well if that is so then what you’re telling us is that all of these consequences that you believe to be adverse, follow on necessity once it is determined that State Life may bring a proper interpleader action.
speaker="james_griswold" startTime="957.734" stopTime="960.022">
    Mr. James Griswold 
    Yes and there this is additional consequence Your Honor.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="960.022" stopTime="963.173">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    You mean there no -- is what I say here right?
speaker="james_griswold" startTime="963.173" stopTime="964.306">
    Mr. James Griswold 
    Basically yes, Your Honor.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="964.306" stopTime="989.128">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Now if that is so then how do you dispose of the language in the interpleader statute saying that two or more adverse claimants -- saying that an interpleader action maybe brought where two or more adverse claimants et cetera are claiming or may claim to be entitled to such money and property?
speaker="james_griswold" startTime="989.128" stopTime="995.740">
    Mr. James Griswold 
    Well the question Your Honor under the Bill Hart (ph) case is whether or not under the Oregon law these people are claimants.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="995.740" stopTime="997.663">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    May be claimants.
speaker="james_griswold" startTime="997.663" stopTime="1117.457">
    Mr. James Griswold 
    Well its claimants who are claiming, or may claim. 
    The Ninth Circuit Court held that these people in this position in an action arising out of tort were not claimants within the meaning of the Interpleader Act because they could not be claimants against this petitioner in Oregon State Farm. 
    A distinction which I must make in this situation is the duties and the responsibilities of this petitioner, State Farm, as compared to the duties and the responsibilities the majority of the Interpleader proceedings. 
    I'm talking about the life insurance companies, I'm talking about the trust companies, the bond companies, the surety broker, bonds on broker surety bond. 
    In these situations the person that is obligated to make payment of money has only one obligation and that is to pay that money and two or three people claim that from him, he doesn't know which way to turn so the interpleader statute protects him, he plays into court in that ends it. 
    State Farm has two obligations under this contract. 
    When they sell this insurance policy, they have several hands out receiving the money. 
    This comes in to cover the cost of claims. 
    They have a handout to cover the agency premium. 
    Also included in this is the hand that covers the cost of defense, because they have in this contract the duty and the obligation to defend all the lawsuits brought against their assurers. 
    Now selfishly speaking we are not interested as to whether State Farm’s assurers are by protected by State Farm or not on the face of it, but basically we are when there is a limited policy as here --
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="1117.457" stopTime="1130.846">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    The problem there is, since it mirrors some section or sub section (a) of the Interpleader statute expressly lists policy of insurance?
speaker="james_griswold" startTime="1130.846" stopTime="1131.710">
    Mr. James Griswold 
    That’s true, yes it does.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="1131.710" stopTime="1140.077">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    And is there anything in the legislative history or elsewhere that qualifies that?
speaker="james_griswold" startTime="1140.077" stopTime="1222.231">
    Mr. James Griswold 
    My answer is not to my knowledge Your Honor. 
    The only qualifications of that language are the decisions of the various District and Circuit Courts which are cited in the briefs. 
    Some of these Courts say it doesn't apply in this of type situation others have said that it does. 
    I started to indicate to the Court the interest we do have in State Farm defending its insured, it’s assured and that is that if there are funds, individual funds of the assured and actions are maintained against him, without the insurance defense the providing of a defense for the assured, his own individual funds would have to be used to retain counsel and court cost and this in a case of this nature would becomes substantial and any funds that the individual defendant might have which would normally under judgments shall I say be available to the injured parties would be spent in performing a duty, which we feel or performing the function of defending this case which we feel is the duty of State Farm. 
    Now there are we feel --

    No, no. 
    This matter comes to this Court very early in the pleading stage. 
    The restraining order was entered. 
    Greyhound filed a motion to dissolve the restraining order and to dismiss the action and then withdrew that motion. 
    Now it says it would be convenient if they are permitted to come in. 
    We filed a motion to dissolve the restraining order and to dismiss. 
    This was denied by the trial court and the Ninth Circuit courts’ opinion.

    Justice Byron R. White 
    Do you know of any reason why if Interpleader was permitted in this case it shouldn’t be permitted also in the case where there is simple multiple claims?
speaker="james_griswold" startTime="1361.225" stopTime="1418.967">
    Mr. James Griswold 
    Well, the basic purpose, the foundation for Interpleader is to remove the danger to the petitioner in an Interpleader proceeding from possibly being held for more than their contractual duty. 
    A life insurance company, a suit for $ 10,000 in New York and a policy in 10,000 in California. 
    Interpleader permits them to bring both people in one court and they only have to pay the one $ 10,000. 
    This is one of the primary functions of interpleader as I read the decisions and the works by Professor Chapman. 
    So if it would be impossible or if the petitioner and Interpleader could not show that the claims exceed the amount of the fund if I may use that expression, I don’t believe they would be entitled to Interpleader at all.

    Justice Byron R. White 
    Now I'd this a -- if you limited Interpleader to this situation you describe it, is this the recurring situation, is this frequent?
speaker="james_griswold" startTime="1430.720" stopTime="1591.584">
    Mr. James Griswold 
    I would basically say no it has not been frequent up to now. 
    The cases are sparse on this point. 
    Since this matter has come into our office there have now been three involving Greyhound only and yet I can’t help but comment that I see in the paper or on television of a lady that caused the death of several children in the state -- in New England, I don’t recall the state. 
    I think there was also a school bus accident with several injuries and I believe some deaths within the last few years -- within the last few weeks. 
    I think as we grow and as our highways fill with vehicles that carry more and more people this problem will become more and more common. 
    The situation we face here is an attempt to develop this particular law, this theory or rule of law and I think that it’s gone beyond bounds already and I’m thinking of the case as presented to this Court in the brief amicus curiae. 
    If the Court will recall the contents, this would indicate that Greyhound Incorporated owns Greyhound Lines and owns an insurance company. 
    The insurance company had a $ 500,000 policy on Greyhound Lines. 
    They have filed a similar matter with it being a single vehicle accident that happened in Oregon. 
    I can see as indicated in brief amicus curiae a possibility that the insurance programs as they might develop in the future would make efforts to take advantage of this situation. 
    We indicated in our brief that if interpleader is granted there would appear that the result reached in Travelers Indemnity versus Greyhound would be an appropriate relief. 
    This is a limited restraining order which is the thing that shall I say damages or hurts the injured people in an interpleader. 
    What it does is prevent these people from executing on judgments, executing against the insurance carrier, but they may proceed as they wish to obtain these judgments.

    You think the liability with he undertook when he insured it undertook when it ensured was even though the limit for damages was $ 20,000 you think that sky was the limit so far as the duty of spending money to defend the insured and maybe 100 different lawsuits in 50 different states, that’s your point.

    We get back to my question of a jury trial. 
    The convenience of the party, this happens in Oregon interpleader’s filed in Oregon. 
    We get back to our jury trial and whether or not under the interpleader system. 
    Of course the Signal Oil case is cited in petitioner’s brief indicates fairly that there is no jury trial authorized in this kind of a proceeding because it is an equity, but assume that, that rule is modified by this Court in this matter, still I question whether it would be in fact the jury trial is guaranteed by our Oregon Constitution.

    The question of the Chief Justice must be answered by us in this manner. 
    They can go anywhere they want to to sue as long as they get jurisdiction, they have that right, but they forget the provisions of 1404 of the judicial code which gives the District Court sound judicial discretion in determining which is the most convenient forum. 
    Mr. Skopil has advised us that he had to bring this proceeding in the District Court of Oregon is the only state where they could jurisdiction over their assured. 
    The District Court may exercise its discretion and say no, this case should be transferred to the state where most of the claimants reside, where the accident happened for the convenience of parties and witnesses.

    Well that just might be, now let me ask you one more question here if I may. 
    Why does State Life have to bring the action where it can obtain personal service on Clark. 
    I thought the interpleader statute – that an interpleader action could be filed wherever one of the, or more of the claimants resides?
speaker="john_gordon_gearin" startTime="2181.530" stopTime="2211.671">
    Mr. John Gordon Gearin 
    That is under 1335, but this particular action also involves a suit for declaratory judgment by the insurer to determine the initial question of whether or not there was coverage and that particular phase of this proceeding must be brought in the district of Oregon. 
    The interpleader statute under 1335 gives any district in which one or more of the adverse claimants resides then you -- of the actions which could be in California.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="2211.671" stopTime="2219.924">

    Mr. John Gordon Gearin 
    There are adverse claimants Your Honor. 
    The cases so hold, Adams Underwriters versus Lloyd's and the Revere case. 
    Because to say that an widow with two children who has lost the breadwinner of the family is not an adverse claimant to an insurance policy that insurers the man who drove over the wrong side of the highway is certainly felicitous in the extreme.

speaker="john_gordon_gearin" startTime="2254.653" stopTime="2306.770">
    Mr. John Gordon Gearin 
    No that -- the Court of Appeals in this case held that they were not adverse, but it offends our sense of reality to say that an insurance company does not met with adverse claims when its insured is obviously a tortfeasor, obviously owes this money and there is just a limited fund. 
    They are adverse one for the other and in this case there are only nine of these 35 claimants who seek to avoid the consequences of the District Court's discretion in this matter. 
    The rest of the many claimants, some 20 odd in number, have go along with what the District Court has done, because they feel it’s proper. 
    These small group of claimants seek to take some advantage, undue advantage of the other claimants.

    That is within the discretion, the sound discretion of the District Court. 
    Under Rule 42 the court can consolidate cases where they have the same issue of fact and law. 
    And to think that a District court would for 35 consecutive weeks try one case after the other, the same case, the same witness is ridiculous because the Court would be subject to censor. 
    The rule was designed, Rule 42 was designed to prevent delays, to have a consolidation of cases where you have the same identical question of fact and law and the same thing involves whether you have a passenger on the left side of the bus or a passenger on the right side of the bus, you still have the identical questions which should be consolidated for trial under the rule.

    I know, but what I’m asking is, can they maintain the jurisdiction over in the Oregon Court and then say Case A shall go to state of Maine, Case B shall go to Florida, Case C shall go to California because of the injustice it would do if those plaintiffs have to come to Oregon.
speaker="john_gordon_gearin" startTime="2521.341" stopTime="2542.948">
    Mr. John Gordon Gearin 
    I think not with respect to a segregated trial of liability. 
    Perhaps with regard to their trial of damages, the Court may well have jurisdiction to say we’ll try a liability here and if there is liability Mr. Wood you may try this case elsewhere because your doctors are in Maine, your doctors are here, you reside here. 
    Now, that may very well be the situation.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2542.948" stopTime="2544.170">

    Half a jury trial?
speaker="john_gordon_gearin" startTime="2544.170" stopTime="2630.753">
    Mr. John Gordon Gearin 
    That’s correct because the Court has given broad discretion, it's given these wonderful tools to the Federal rules to bifurcate the trial, to consolidate, to have his pretrial practices and kept them all together. 
    One further thing that bothers me was a comment by the Court with regard to the varying death limits. 
    In a suit for declaratory judgment the District Court in which the case is tried in an interpleader action applies the conflicts of law, rule of the State where it says that is the case of Griffin versus Mccoach, a 1946 case in 313 U.S. 
    The reason text writers however say that it should -- that problem of conflicts of law should be decided by the District Court within the limits of his discretion and that’s one thing that we ask again that this Court extend the jurisdiction to this type of case, how, when, where and the manner in which the discretion is exercised, the jurisdiction is held, is to be determined by the District Court according to the individual case the facts than before it. 
    This Court should not place a tight and begrudging hand on this statute which says 1335 when there are two more adverse claimants to the same fund. 
    We are here incidentally, we’re not the petitioner. 
    Thank you.

    May I ask you this question Mr. Gearin? 
    If you did not have -- if your Greyhound didn’t have this insurance, would it be entitled to be here today?
speaker="john_gordon_gearin" startTime="2644.482" stopTime="2657.050">
    Mr. John Gordon Gearin 
    Greyhound would not be entitled to be here today unless it were named a defendant in a interpleader action. 
    Greyhound in this accident had no insurance. 
    They were self insurers under the Interstate Commerce Act.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2657.050" stopTime="2658.074">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    I see.
speaker="john_gordon_gearin" startTime="2658.074" stopTime="2677.441">
    Mr. John Gordon Gearin 
    We would not have a right if it pleases the Chief Justice to come into Court and say, we -- everyone is suing us all over, we want them all in one basket, we would like to have that right because the expense of defending 35 cases up and down the Pacific Coast and throughout the United States is a tremendous task on the witnesses and parties.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2677.441" stopTime="2691.227">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    So the difference -- the only difference between not having the insurance and having it would be that the Oregon Court in this situation has given jurisdiction where otherwise it would not have?
speaker="john_gordon_gearin" startTime="2691.227" stopTime="2692.519">
    Mr. John Gordon Gearin 
    That is correct, it would not have --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2692.519" stopTime="2729.621">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Let me ask you this, if that is true and if it does save you an enormous amount of money to have this right, the interpleaders as you exercise it here, would there be anything to prevent Greyhound from just having a nominal amount of insurance and then carrying it’s own to all intents and purposes and have it for the sole purpose of getting them to proceeding of this kind where otherwise would not have it?
speaker="john_gordon_gearin" startTime="2729.621" stopTime="2734.534">
    Mr. John Gordon Gearin 
    That’s the suggestion made by the amicus curiae I think it’s entirely fallacious if it pleases --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2734.534" stopTime="2736.631">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    No the question isn't fallacious, the answer might --
speaker="john_gordon_gearin" startTime="2736.631" stopTime="2736.921">
    Mr. John Gordon Gearin 
    I didn’t mean --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2736.921" stopTime="2741.372">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    The answer might be, but how about, what is the answer to it?
speaker="john_gordon_gearin" startTime="2741.372" stopTime="2814.609">
    Mr. John Gordon Gearin 
    The answer is one of the economic impossibility. 
    No businessman would deliberately have low limits in order to take advantage of this and we don’t look forward to this catastrophes. 
    The insurance is to protect, the insurance is to protect the individual for which a substantial premium is paid and Your Honor misunderstood me, the statements in the brief amicus curiae are absurd. 
    To think -- to suggest to this Court that a responsible business will deliberately go out and have a small policy of insurance which would expose the company to tremendous liability just to take advantage of something like this. 
    The insurance is to protect the company against liability imposed by law and if you don’t have insurance I think that the -- it would be poor business practice, it would be unsound economically for a company to have this in mind when they go out to do it, it imputes the bona fides of everyday business and I assure the Court that insofar as Greyhound is concerned, we don’t have it and the stockholders certainly could bitterly complaint against any management that were foolhardy.

    Does every big carrier have the insurance?
speaker="john_gordon_gearin" startTime="2821.269" stopTime="2828.329">
    Mr. John Gordon Gearin 
    Most carriers do, there are some who are self insurers, as Greyhound was in the accident we’re talking about here.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2828.329" stopTime="2829.041">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Yes --

    And we would have no right to interplead.

    They were considered foolish and worthy in assuming this liability.

    No, but they didn’t setup --

    Would there be anymore if they had a small amount of insurance to go --

    Mr. John Gordon Gearin 
    That would be merely a dummy for impure motives which we didn’t not have and we do not have. 
    Insurance is to protect the public, and the public should be protected in this case.
