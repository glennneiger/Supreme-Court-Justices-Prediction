    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    No. 28, Transportation Communication Employees Union, petitioner vs. Union Pacific Railroad Company. 
    Mr. Kraemer.

    Mr. Milton Kramer 
    Mr. Chief Justice, May it please Court. 
    In 1951 or there about, the Union Pacific Railroad installed a battery of new machines in its yard at Las Vegas. 
    These were 11 machines of 7 types. 
    This battery of machines performed work that prior thereto was performed in part by telegraphers represented by the Transportation Communications Union and in part by the clerks but it assigned all this works to clerks. 
    Although we performed work, the midi fact was work formally by telegraphers in part. 
    The TCU (Transportations Communications Union) filed a claim with the railroad claiming that assigning this work or even committing it to be performed by a craft other than the telegraphers was a violation of the Collective Bargaining Agreement. 
    The claim was in the words of every Labor Act handled in the usual manner and without agreement. 
    It was then submitted to the National Bureau of Adjustment, the very Division. 
    We asked the Board to hold that having the communications aspect of the work performed by employees other than telegraphers was a violation of the agreements and that the remedy should be that each time it happened, the senior idle telegrapher, at the time it happened, be paid a day's pay. 
    The Third Division gave notice of its proceeding to the Brotherhood of Railway Clerks which represented the clerks and offered them an opportunity to participate, to be heard that they care to. 
    The clerks replied stating that they understood the dispute was over the interpretation of the telegrapher's agreements that is whether the telegraphers’ agreement covered part of this work and our understanding is incorrect said the clerks. 
    We did not get a response. 
    The clerks’ response continued that “if my understanding with this dispute is correct, we are not involved and we do not care to be heard”. 
    They added that the rights of the employees represented by the brotherhood of railway clerks is predicated on the clerks’ Collective Bargaining Agreement and not on any other and that if at any time or for any reason, the carrier should assign work covered by the clerks’ agreement to employees not covered by the clerks’ agreement. 
    They would take the appropriate steps under the Railway Labor Act. 
    Now, in the proceeding, the carrier argued to the board, among other arguments that all the work was covered by the clerks’ agreement and they were committed to make that argument. 
    Now the Court of Appeals in this case is in error in one statement it made. 
    It says that evidence of the clerks’ agreement was excluded by the Adjustment Board Rules of Evidence. 
    Now there is not a word in the record to support that and in fact, it is not so. 
    The regulations of the Adjustment Board commit anybody to submit anything it wants. 
    Doors are wide open. 
    About the award of the adjustment board sustained the claim of TCU (Transportation Communication Employees Union) used to be named Order of Railroad Telegraphers. 
    There's been a change in name.

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    It's really on the pleading then --
speaker="milton_kramer" startTime="543.820" stopTime="700.687">
    Mr. Milton Kramer 
    Well, it's more than pleading, the pleading that these papers contain an argument. 
    They are both statements of fact and briefs. 
    It's written argument rather than oral although occasionally there maybe an oral argument. 
    Well, the Adjustment Board with a new proceeding as a member, sustained this aspect of the telegrapher's claim and ordered the carrier to compensate the senior idle employee each time it happened. 
    And the Union Pacific refused to comply and it refused to pay the senior idle employee and we brought an action to enforce the award under Section 3 (p) of the Railway Labor Act. 
    The District Court held that the clerks were an indispensable party to that lawsuit, to enforce this award which said that the telegrapher's contract had been violated, and dismissed for that reason. 
    The Court of Appeals wrote two opinions. 
    The first opinion it reversed the holding of the District Court saying that the clerks were not indispensable to the court proceeding but that they were indispensable to the Adjustment Board proceeding and the case should be remanded to the Adjustment Board which would require the clerks to participate. 
    But then later, withdrew that opinion and affirmed but it affirmed not on the ground that the clerks were an indispensable party to the court proceeding as the District Court has done. 
    But that the award was invalid because the clerks, I'm quoting, “for all practical purposes became party to the administrative proceedings. 
    Now, just what the Court meant by that I don't know. 
    It is unclear what the board should do but I presume what they meant was that the Adjustment Board must make an interpretation of post agreements. 
    At the same time, whether or not the clerk's participate, they did say that the Board should make a complete disposition of the dispute as to all concerned parties. 
    And I presumably admit, that you must make a ruling on the meaning of the clerk's agreement. 
    Well, the first one remanded, reversed and said that the District Court should not have dismissed the case but should have remanded it to the board. 
    And the second case, it said the award was invalid and therefore, the enforcement suit should be dismissed.

    Mr. Milton Kramer 
    Most of the argument, Your Honors, is on the record beginning on page 5 through 71 is reported, just about all that was submitted to the Board in writing. 
    85 and 71 of the record. 
    The Court of Appeals said that this lays a jurisdictional dispute between two unions. 
    There is no dispute here between two unions. 
    The only dispute involved here is, did the telegrapher's agreement covered the work and that the carrier, therefore, violate it when they designed it to other than telegraphers. 
    The BRC, the clerks thought that they weren't involved in that dispute. 
    They thought that they had any right just predicated on their contract which has not been violated. 
    But if you assume that there is a dispute here between two union, as the Court of Appeals held, the Adjustment Board doesn't have a jurisdiction to resolve disputes between unions. 
    Its jurisdiction is provided in Section 31 of the Act. 
    It is dispute “Dispute between and employee or group of employees and a carrier or carriers”. 
    Now, if there is dispute between unions, it doesn't come into that category and the Adjustment Board couldn't decide it. 
    But in any event there is no dispute here between the unions. Clerks are not disputing the meaning of telegrapher's agreement and vice versa.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="953.262" stopTime="964.338">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Then that the only reason that the only way they said that they are not in any dispute is that they would both say that, well, the employer has simply contracted with two unions for the same work.

    Mr. Milton Kramer 
    If it was so determined, yes.

    And that then there is no dispute between the unions?

    Between the unions there is no dispute.

    That the employer could pay them both.
speaker="milton_kramer" startTime="974.078" stopTime="1112.246">
    Mr. Milton Kramer 
    Yes, and it's all contracted, or were to see to change the agreement but which they did not try do. 
    This award came out five years ago and they still haven't tried to change the agreement. 
    They could serve a Section 6 notice and go through the procedures of the Railway Labor Act and if they weren't successful in persuading one union or the other to change the agreement, it could then unilaterally change the rule. 
    But it has not even tried to do that. 
    Also the Adjustment Board could not, in this proceeding, issue a final and binding interpretation of the Clerks Agreement because there is no dispute between the carrier and the clerks over that meaning of that agreement. 
    The dispute must be between the carrier and the union and they have no dispute over the Clerk's Agreement and unless there is a dispute, the Adjustment Board would not have jurisdiction to render an interpretation of it. 
    And secondly, even if there were such a dispute, before the Adjustment Board can exercise jurisdiction, the Railway Labor Act required that the dispute be handled in the usual manner up to and including the Chief Operating Officer of the carrier designated to handle such disputes. 
    Until that's done, the Adjustment Board does not have jurisdiction. 
    And that hasn't been done with respect to the Clerks Agreement. 
    In fact, the National Railway Adjustment Board Regulations in conformity with that provision, said that it will not entertain a petition, will not consider a petition unless the subject of it was handled in the usual manner on the property up to and including and so forth. 
    So they couldn't issue a final and binding interpretation of the Clerks Agreement within their jurisdiction under the Railway Labor Act. 
    There was no dispute so they had no jurisdiction and it was not handled and so they did not have jurisdiction. 
    Very easy, they -- Well, if the Railroad agrees with them, they would let them go on doing the work, pay twice but they could seek to plea -- pardon? 
    Well, they could seek to change one of the agreements.

    If the Adjustment Board holds and it contracted to give the same work to two different crafts, yes. 
    And, but if the Adjustment Board holds that and the adjustment rulings are not reviewable on the merits, then it must seek to change one of the agreements. 
    And under the Railway Labor Act, you can change it unilaterally after you follow certain procedures. 
    But it hasn't made any effort to do that. 
    What it really should have done is before installing these machines, was to negotiate. 
    But it didn't try.

    Justice John M. Harlan 
    I suppose that what you're telling us may be put this way that Railroad has a contract with the telegraphers and the Railroad has a contract with the clerks and those don't necessarily have to be synchronized or consistent. 
    And it is the Board dysfunction to attempt to do so, is that it?
speaker="milton_kramer" startTime="1190.494" stopTime="1307.208">
    Mr. Milton Kramer 
    It is distinctly not the Board's function, that Board has no authority to change agreements. 
    Its jurisdiction is limited to the interpretation or application. 
    And that's perfectly clear from the statute. 
    Believe it, if it weren't perfectly clear from the statute, the legislative history, the draftsman and the chief proponent told Congress that they would definitely have no authority to cleanse the rules. 
    All they could do would be to interpret/agree on rules. 
    And the Adjustment Board just can't synchronize or accommodate one to the other or what have you. 
    It could only interpret and nothing else. 
    Also, the carrier says that they are entitled to be protected, if they could comply with the award. 
    Of course here if they comply, it's only paying money but sometimes they are ordered to get someone to work. 
    And they are entitled to be protected. 
    Where will they get that right, if they contract with more than one organization for the same work? 
    Why shouldn't they be liable to both? 
    And if the Adjustment Board can relieve them of their liability under one, which has no jurisdiction to do, it would simply destroy Collective Bargaining on the subject and the scope of the agreement. 
    Every Union, I came to -- asked that certain work be included in this contract, would give an affirmative answer. 
    (Inaudible) put it in new agreement and (Inaudible) new agreement, anybody who wants it. 
    And then when one of them says you violated my agreement, we go to the Adjustment Board, the Adjustment Board awards it to one and they're home free with the others. 
    Well, there is nothing in the Railroad Labor Act that does that? 
    The Adjustment Board can't set aside agreements, can't change them. 
    They simply destroys Collective Bargaining if they could do that.

    But if the carrier's contention is right that they could be relieved of liability on their other agreements, if it's found out that one covers it, I said they can deliberately contract with anybody who wants it.

speaker="milton_kramer" startTime="1498.831" stopTime="1547.229">
    Mr. Milton Kramer 
    Well, I suppose one way to be done would be for the railroads to decide which union it ought to have it and so the other union, with a notice to change its agreement. 
    And then when you have the negotiations and you have your mediation and possibly other procedures under the Railway Labor Act, including a proper arbitration and to be detected and the carrier can make the change in a lot of ways, once it's going through those procedures. 
    And the TCU agreement would thereby be changed -- when that provision would be out. 
    Now, whether they would strike over, I don't know but not likely. 
    It's only a handful of jobs involved. 
    They might. 
    But at that time, some years hence, we would first have the possibility of strike.

    Mr. James A. Wilcox 
    Well, I should find out to you right away. 
    But we are not speaking of the explicit/unambiguous agreements. 
    These agreements simply describe a job and the clerks come along and tell us that this is clerks work. 
    The telegraphers come along and tell us that this is telegraphers work. 
    And when we denied the claim, they progress it to the board as simply a dispute under the Clerks Agreement or under the Telegrapher's Agreement, and refused to recognize that any other party has any interest. 
    It is our position, however, that ever since 1934, the Adjustment Board was given this power and the duty to resolve work assignment disputes. 
    Indeed, this Court, in a very early case, the Pitney case, 326 U.S. was just as Black speaking for on that point a unanimous court, held that the N.R.A.B. -- the Adjustment Board, had jurisdiction over a jurisdictional dispute, and I'm quoting, involving the railroad and two employee accredited bargaining agents. 
    Mr. Justice Black also stated that the Board was specially creative to interpret contracts such as these in order finally to settle a labor dispute. 
    A few years later in the Slocum case again, Mr. Justice Black, he said that the Board's jurisdiction in these work assignment disputes was exclusive. 
    This Court in the Slocum case was presented with the precise dispute that you have before you. 
    In that case, the clerks and the telegraphers were each claiming, respectively, that their ambiguous contract covered in the work in question. 
    The railroad got a little tired of this and went into a New York State Court for a declaratory judgment. 
    The New York Court affirmed for, I believe, the clerks and the telegraphers obtained certiorari from this Court. 
    The question presented there was whether or not the Courts should have jurisdiction over these type of disputes which depend for their resolution on an interpretation of the collective agreement. 
    And this Court in Slocum said that the Courts do not have jurisdiction. 
    But went ahead to point out that the Adjustment Board does have jurisdiction? 
    Indeed, in our brief, we haven't the exact page, we quoted from the telegraphers' brief before this Court in Slocum in which they told this Court that the Adjustment Board has jurisdiction over all the parties.

    Then there are other responding submissions. 
    But only the first submission of each party is included in the record and included in the printed award. 
    And at page 35, you will notice that the carrier, the Union Pacific, pointed out that for the Board to sustain these claims would be to deny the clerk employees their rights to perform the work would abrogate the agreement negotiated between the carrier and the Clerk's organization and would seriously affect by such action the rights of Clerk employees.

    The question that has not been answered since.

    Mr. James A. Wilcox 
    Of course, absolutely. 
    The petitioner's crucial argument here is that the Union Pacific may have bound itself by contract in the same work to both clerks and telegraphers. 
    It is our position and we think quite clear under the law that this is not possible under the National Labor policy. 
    It may be impossible as a common-law but it is not under the National Labor policy as spelled out in Sections 2, 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 9th of the Act, especially 2.9. 
    Briefly that section provides that a carrier upon receiving a union certification as a representative of some of its employees, the carrier shall treat with the representative as so certified for the purpose of collective bargaining. 
    From the earliest back in 1937, this Court said that 2/9th of the Railway Labor Act imposes the affirmative duty on the railroad to treat only with the true representative and the negative duty to treat with no others. 
    This Court re-stated that in the General Committee case at 320 U.S.

    The Labor policy then -- posed nevertheless somebody makes a mistake and you have two Collective Bargaining contracts that cover the same work as the Adjustment Board have power to resolve the conflict. 
    Then it's got the power to say that the reason in contract A shall be disregarded. 
    And that contract B -- employees in contract B can get the work.

    Mr. Wilcox, what -- if you would prevail, what would prevent the carrier from sitting down with two groups rather than to reason that out at the bargaining table would make the two agreements ambiguous enough so that it might be interpreted either way And then, when there was a disagreement between the unions to have it and one of them brought a proceeding before the Adjustment Board and the railroad said, “well, we have just emphasized and I only let you two unions find that out and which ever one prevails and it's alright with us”.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Here you have got that situation, except for the matter of intent that I put in -- you've got two situations where these people claim, at least, that the ambiguities in the two contacts raise an issue as to which one of the unions is entitled to the work. 
    And the railroad just steps aside and says, “Alright now, that's no problem of ours; you just find it out before the Board here and what every one gets, it's alright with us”. 
    Doesn't that be tracked from a collective bargaining -- the integrity of bargaining?
speaker="james_a_wilcox" startTime="2811.256" stopTime="2821.933">
    Mr. James A. Wilcox 
    If that should occur, it would certainly be tracked from the integrity of bargaining but bear in mind that only one of those two unions is entitled to the work.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    I know but would you have the right to say, “Well, we don't care. 
    It isn't essential for us to bargain right down to a final determination of rules entitled to this. 
    The board would take care of that and we don't have to worry about it, we are not preferring a proceeding before the Board and the Board will let it go to the -- let the two unions find that out and whichever prevails for the Board, it's alright with us”.
speaker="james_a_wilcox" startTime="2851.536" stopTime="2869.506">
    Mr. James A. Wilcox 
    Well, we must. 
    Under the law we can only deal with the true unions. 
    The other union -- the other representative would even have a right to serve Section 6 for the work which the other -- for example the clerks have the right to perform.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2869.506" stopTime="2896.221">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    But you've got the situation here where you claim you, then I have no doubt you bargain on a plea and here, there are two unions that you say ought to be brought before the Board to have it determined which one shall have a work. 
    Now, that's an issue. 
    I would say that's an issue that could well have been determined at the bargaining table.
speaker="james_a_wilcox" startTime="2896.221" stopTime="2909.953">
    Mr. James A. Wilcox 
    Without the possibility of creating a lot of strike, I don't see how it could be worked out at the bargaining table. 
    We're not -- we're going to get either of the two unions to agree that the work belongs to the other.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2909.953" stopTime="2920.783">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Aren't you obliged in your bargaining agreement to determine what work an individual union is entitled to have and what work another union is entitled to have.
speaker="james_a_wilcox" startTime="2920.783" stopTime="2930.825">
    Mr. James A. Wilcox 
    That would depend, Sir, on whether they're -- who they represent and the scope of their representation. 
    Clerks would represent clerical work. 
    Telegraphers --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2930.825" stopTime="2932.867">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    The clerks could what?
speaker="james_a_wilcox" startTime="2932.867" stopTime="2947.544">
    Mr. James A. Wilcox 
    The clerk's organization would represent employees performing clerical work. 
    The signalman's organization represents employees performing signal work which I think answered that question.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2947.544" stopTime="2959.480">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well, I suppose that bargaining agreements would and probably should determine the extent of signal work and the intended clerical work, didn't they?
speaker="james_a_wilcox" startTime="2959.480" stopTime="3019.781">
    Mr. James A. Wilcox 
    Now that I believe, Mr. Chief Justice, it's decided by the authority of the clerk representative. 
    In other words, the signalman, for example, has the authority under the law to represent signal employee, i.e. those that perform signal work. 
    The only place where we get into trouble is in the clerical-telegrapher field because there even a telegrapher does performs some clerical work and we get this cross. 
    And as a result the clerks and the telegraphers have dreamed up this what we call “double barreling” -– one goes the Board, gets its claim sustained then the other goes to the Board for the same work, gets that claim sustained. 
    Indeed, the MKT Railroad had, I believe four or five enforcement actions pending against it in different courts by the clerks and telegraphers on the same work.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3019.781" stopTime="3032.375">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Am I correct if this award is enforced, at least one man who belongs to the telegraphers' union will get paid as if he worked when he didn't work.

    Mr. James A. Wilcox 
    No, sir. 
    If the award is enforced as it was sustained by the Adjustment Board, the Union Pacific will be forced to pay a telegrapher around the clock - that would be three telegraphers a day all the way back to 1951.

    Yes, and that is exactly, Sir, what happened, a number of years ago, the telegrapher's (Inaudible) voted with the railroad and he was quickly taken off the Board and ever since then, then the labor members voted as a union ; block voting and by that simple device, they can continue to get the neutral to decide and resolve this dispute.

    No, not necessarily. 
    No, as a matter of fact, over nine, the telegraphers man is off the Board because he voted with the railroad --

    Yes, Sir.

    Justice Byron R. White 
    Why they don't set up a board for taking as a dispute, we already have a board law?
speaker="james_a_wilcox" startTime="3315.118" stopTime="3322.806">
    Mr. James A. Wilcox 
    Yes, the board is permanent and the referee is generally -- well they are picked on an ad hoc basis for a docket of say, 30 cases.

    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, how do you suggest that the -- you think that this award should be enforced? 
    And your idea is that both unions should be before the Board. 
    How does the Board get them to court when the clerks say, “sorry we have notice by we don't want to come in, in the first place you do not have jurisdiction. 
    We want -- we have no dispute with the carrier at all”. 
    We're doing our work, he is paying our people. 
    And if we did have one, the negotiations should have to start on the profit, like the Act said”.
speaker="james_a_wilcox" startTime="3360.581" stopTime="3366.457">
    Mr. James A. Wilcox 
    Well, if the Board was told to performance duty, the clerks would be in there very short --

    Justice Byron R. White 
    I didn't understand you.
speaker="james_a_wilcox" startTime="3367.856" stopTime="3386.209">
    Mr. James A. Wilcox 
    If this Court affirms Pitney and Slocum and tells this Board, this Adjustment Board, to perform a duty that Congress intended of it, I can assure you that the union performing the work, the clerks in this case, will be in there to protect that work.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3386.209" stopTime="3393.090">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    What you're saying is that you would expect the Adjustment Board to make this decision and to interpret both contracts.

    Mr. James A. Wilcox 
    Yes, sir.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3393.919" stopTime="3400.804">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    And then if the clerks wanted to stay out while their contracts were being interpreted, let them stay, but they would be bound?
speaker="james_a_wilcox" startTime="3400.804" stopTime="3402.477">
    Mr. James A. Wilcox 
    I think so, yes, sir.

    They had an opportunity -- give a notice to them and they stayed out?

    Mr. James A. Wilcox 
    They stayed out. 
    And we've talked about Mr. Kraemer's argues that we are asking for 10k. 
    It's our position that we had 10k all the time but because of these devices have not been able to utilize it. 
    However, it is interesting to note that when 10k was before the court, before the Congress -- representative Gerald W Landis -- on the floor stated, “This conference report will take care of labor abuses without destroying laborers' rights. 
    It completely outlaws jurisdictional strikes, wild cat strikes and secondary boycott. 
    These are labor evils and not laborer's rights. 
    In order to stop the strikes which threaten the national welfare, we have set up a plan, referring to 10k like the Railway Labor Act in many ways –-
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3468.352" stopTime="3471.541">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    -- many ways as you said.
speaker="james_a_wilcox" startTime="3471.541" stopTime="3483.595">
    Mr. James A. Wilcox 
    We have set up a plan in many ways like the Railway Labor Act. 
    From the earlier, the Adjustment Board has had this jurisdiction and should exercise it.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3483.595" stopTime="3503.015">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Wilcox, I'm just going to ask you this. 
    Would you tell me specifically how many members would be on the Board if you prevailed and the clerks must be brought in and how these people are selected?
speaker="james_a_wilcox" startTime="3503.015" stopTime="3530.844">
    Mr. James A. Wilcox 
    The membership, Mr. Chief Justice, on the Board will not change whatever this Court does in this case. 
    The Third Division where this case was before, it was a permanent; you call a permanent board although they are subject to removal by their own employer. 
    Five labor members and five carrier members, each side paying their own members, and those would be of the same union, of their union.
speaker="james_a_wilcox" startTime="3530.844" stopTime="3532.098">
    Mr. James A. Wilcox 
    They don't have to be no.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3532.098" stopTime="3533.062">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    So they don't have to be.
speaker="james_a_wilcox" startTime="3533.062" stopTime="3534.380">
    Mr. James A. Wilcox 
    No, it wasn't intended that way.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3534.380" stopTime="3536.321">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    But they can be?
speaker="james_a_wilcox" startTime="3536.321" stopTime="3537.946">
    Mr. James A. Wilcox 
    They can be--
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3537.946" stopTime="3538.867">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    -- often are?
speaker="james_a_wilcox" startTime="3538.867" stopTime="3551.740">
    Mr. James A. Wilcox 
    They often are. 
    The Third Division, however, has I believe jurisdiction over 12 crafts -- that would be 12 different unions. 
    We have only five unions here represented on the Board.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3551.740" stopTime="3565.814">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Now, let me ask you this. 
    Who will approve of those five members, that carrier, the telegraphers union or the clerks union in this case?
speaker="james_a_wilcox" startTime="3565.814" stopTime="3567.804">
    Mr. James A. Wilcox 
    All operating together, sir.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3567.804" stopTime="3574.084">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well, suppose that they don't operate, suppose they can't operate together?
speaker="james_a_wilcox" startTime="3574.084" stopTime="3599.469">
    Mr. James A. Wilcox 
    Well, if they can't pick them in, then the National Mediation Board picks a man from that side of the table. 
    In the same respect that if a carrier fails for 30 days to appoint a member of the Board, the Mediation Board does if for us. 
    And that's the same way with the labor members. 
    In practice, however, this organization or as a Railway Labor Executive Organization, they pick the membership.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3599.469" stopTime="3603.835">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    And that Railway Labor Executives has membership of whom? 
    Just the brotherhood or –
speaker="james_a_wilcox" startTime="3603.835" stopTime="3605.434">
    Mr. James A. Wilcox 
    All railroad unions.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3605.434" stopTime="3607.052">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Non-operating as well?
speaker="james_a_wilcox" startTime="3607.052" stopTime="3619.245">
    Mr. James A. Wilcox 
    Except I believe the engineers, but all the non-operating -- indeed, it's essentially -- more of it in the non-operating field.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3619.245" stopTime="3633.562">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, I suppose that if they pick them jointly that it would be assume that some of them would come from the clerk's union and some would come from the telegraphers.
speaker="james_a_wilcox" startTime="3633.562" stopTime="3637.663">
    Mr. James A. Wilcox 
    Well, perhaps, I -- It would be up to deliver union labors.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3637.663" stopTime="3644.180">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well, you wouldn't expect one of them to say, will you take telegraphers to say, “Will you take all clerks, that's all right. 
    We don't care”.
speaker="james_a_wilcox" startTime="3644.180" stopTime="3645.334">
    Mr. James A. Wilcox 
    Oh! 
    No, it would not be that way.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3645.334" stopTime="3646.164">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    It wouldn't happen --
speaker="james_a_wilcox" startTime="3646.164" stopTime="3646.337">
    Mr. James A. Wilcox 
    NO.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3646.337" stopTime="3647.477">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Whether be some or both?
speaker="james_a_wilcox" startTime="3647.477" stopTime="3649.030">
    Mr. James A. Wilcox 
    Yes, that's right.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3649.030" stopTime="3669.695">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Now, in this case for instance, you assigned this work to the clerks. 
    Isn't it entirely natural that your five people in voting for the railroad would join with those who were friendly to the clerks and therefore you would win in every situation?
speaker="james_a_wilcox" startTime="3669.695" stopTime="3707.031">
    Mr. James A. Wilcox 
    That could happen and it could be perfectly lawful. 
    But as I stated, it was never intended that any member of the Board look after only one certain interest. 
    In other words, the labor union members have the duty to look after the whole of the labor union side. 
    And if they want to avoid this, it would be simple matter for the five labor members and the five carrier members. 
    It's a deadlock and allow this to go a neutral for a decision, which is exactly their practice today as we outlined in appendix C.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3707.031" stopTime="3714.987">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    What you're saying really -- they really act not as a tribunal of ten but of a tribunal of two because they blocked vote, is that it?

    Mr. James A. Wilcox 
    Yes. 
    They have up to now. 
    The only time as I pointed out that they didn't when the telegrapher member on the Board voted with a railroad to deny a clerk's claim; that night, he was removed from the Board in emergency session –

    I am fairly familiar with the Board's docket and I would say that the Third Division, which is the one you are merely concerned with, is approximate 2 ½ years behind. 
    But it is fast catching up. 
    Responsible people on our side of the table indicate that within a year-and-a-half, they should be on a current basis of say 6 months.
