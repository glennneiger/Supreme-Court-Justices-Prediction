    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    James B. Giles et. al, petitioner versus Maryland. 
    Mr. Forer?
speaker="joseph_forer" startTime="9.205" stopTime="103.998">
    Mr. Joseph Forer 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    This case arose as a proceeding under the Maryland Post-Conviction Procedure Act which is a statutory substitute for habeas corpus and coram nobis. 
    The petitioners who were serving life sentences and are serving life sentences following the commutation of death sentences challenged their conviction for rape under the Act on constitutional grounds. 
    The first question that I will argue is whether the conviction of the petitioners was obtained in violation of due process by reason of the prosecution suppression of material evidence favorable to the accused. 
    And for that purpose, I must first give you a condensed summary of the evidence which came out at the petitioner's criminal trial. 
    The petitioners are brothers. 
    On the night of July 20, 1961, they were swimming and fishing in the Patuxent River near their home. 
    As they left the river with the companion Joseph Johnson, they encountered 500 feet from the river in deep woods an automobile. 
    In that automobile were two people, a 16-year old girl named Joyce, and a 21-year old man Stewart Foster.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    What time of the night was it?
speaker="joseph_forer" startTime="105.605" stopTime="407.594">
    Mr. Joseph Forer 
    This was late at night close to midnight. 
    An altercation started at the car between the Giles brothers and Johnson on the one hand and Stewart Foster on the other. 
    The testimony is in conflict as to what caused the altercation and who provoked it and for present purposes, I'd not go into that. 
    But very early in the altercation, at the time when James Giles and Johnson threw some stones at the car, Joyce ran out of the car and into the woods along the side of the dark road. 
    According to her testimony, she ran a distance of 30 feet at which point she stopped because she said she was out of breathe and she had fallen. 
    John Giles soon afterwards left the car while the altercation was still going on to come back into the woods and came upon Joyce. 
    The two of them were together there for approximately 10 or 15 minutes during which time they had some conversation. 
    Joyce herself testified that she was the first person to introduce the subject of sex. 
    In that she offered John Giles to have intercourse with him if he would help her get away. 
    John Giles also testified to that offer. 
    But he gave it a little more body, he testified that she also explained to him that she was on probation and couldn't afford to get caught in the woods and didn't want to get in any trouble and for that reason she was anxious that he help her get away. 
    After they have been quietly in the woods together for a while. 
    The altercation of the car ended when Stewart Foster was knocked out and then ran off. 
    The other two young Negroes, Joseph Johnson and James Giles, came into the woods along the same path and they came upon John Giles and Joyce. 
    At this point, there's a very serious cleavage in the testimony. 
    Joyce testified that the three men were there and that each one of the three they're after having intercourse with her. 
    She testified that she did not resist, she testified that she made no outcry, she also testified that she made no remonstrance. 
    She didn't even say to them, “Please let me alone.” 
    She also took off her own clothes. 
    This was her own testimony. 
    She said she submitted this way because she was frightened. 
    The Giles brothers testified that as the two who had been delayed came along the path, Joyce called them over saying to John, “Well I know what you boys want.” 
    Then she called them over and said, “I know what you boys like” and then urged them to have intercourse with her. 
    She took off her own clothes, she was the stage master of the affair. 
    She directed the order of intercourse. 
    And then the course of this transaction, she told them that she had had 16 or 17 other boys that week and two or three more wouldn't make any difference. 
    She told James Giles that she was in trouble, and that if she were caught in the woods, she would have to claim that she was raped. 
    She repeated to John Giles that she was on probation and that if she were caught in the woods, she said she would have to claim she was raped. 
    According to the testimony of the Giles brothers, John Giles refused the invitation of the intercourse, the other two accepted the intercourse. 
    At the trial, on redirect examination by the state, Joyce was asked if she was in fact on probation at the time of this episode. 
    She denied that she was on probation and thereafter on cross examination of the petitioners, the State very effectively ridiculed their testimony that she had told them that she was on probation. 
    At the trial, the Giles brothers being indigent or represented by court appointed counsel. Joseph Johnson, the third man in the affair was also indicted but he got his case severed and transferred at Orlando County and he's not in this case although it's an open secret that his faith abides this case.

speaker="joseph_forer" startTime="436.236" stopTime="437.785">
    Mr. Joseph Forer 
    Oh no, this happened in Montgomery County.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Yeah, yeah.
speaker="joseph_forer" startTime="439.061" stopTime="1182.137">
    Mr. Joseph Forer 
    The Patuxent River is the border line between Montgomery and Howard and they were on the Montgomery County side. 
    Now, the trial started one day December 4 and it ended the next that's from the choosing of a jury for the jury verdict of guilty. 
    The only defense witnesses for the petitioners with the technical and academic exception that the defense counsel also called two of the policemen and they tried unsuccessfully to get them to admit that Joyce had originally told the police that she was even raped by two men rather than by three. 
    They denied it and the only listed to help defense, the whole thing was a factless maneuver because Joyce had already admitted that she had originally told that to the police. 
    The case went to the jury. 
    It was a conflict between credibility. 
    This all white jury had to decide whether to believe this 16-year old white girl or these two young Negroes. 
    And the story that these two young Negroes gave was the most implausible story. 
    It was that under these rather frightening conditions, the 16-year old child solicited intercourse with three Negro strangers. 
    For the jury to believe their story, they would have to find that this 16-year old child was incredibly wanted that she was probably mentally disturbed and there was no evidence of either condition. 
    They would also have to believe that this girl who was not on probation went around intuitively telling people that she was on probation. 
    The jury found them guilty and their story didn't impress the trial judge, Judge Pugh, very much either because although under Maryland law, he had a choice of sentence from 18 months they day he imposed to that sentence. 
    These two brothers were at that time aged 20 and 22. 
    Joseph Johnson didn't feel any better in this trial at Minneapolis. 
    After the appeals were exhausted on November 16, 1962, 11 months after the verdict, a new trial motion was filed on behalf of the petitioners alleging the newly discovered evidence. 
    The circuit court denied this motion without even looking at the newly discovered evidence on the ground that the motion was filed too late. 
    They said under Maryland rules if you want to file a motion for a new trial on the base of newly discovered evidence you have to file within three days after verdict. 
    This ruling was affirmed by the Maryland Court of Appeals. 
    Subsequently, in October of 1963, Governor Tawes commuted the death sentences of the three men, that is, for two petitioners and Johnson to life. 
    This post conviction proceeding was filed about six months after that in May of 1964. 
    It was heard in the circuit court of Montgomery County though before a different judge than the sentencing judge. 
    And after an evidentiary hearing, the circuit court found that the petitioners had been denied due process by reason of the fact that the prosecution had suppressed material exculpatory evidence. 
    The state appeal and the Court of Appeals reversed -- the Court of Appeals heard the case en banc and they reversed five to two. 
    And that then we came here. 
    Before I get into a discussion of the evidence which came out at the post conviction trial and a description of the evidence that we claim was suppressed, I would like to mention a couple of the legal issues that are involved. 
    The legal issues in the suppression point all arise out of one sentence. 
    They all arise within the framework of one sentence over the Court's decision, 1963 decision in Brady against Maryland. 
    And in that case, the court said and I quote, “We now hold that the suppression by the prosecution of evidence favorable to an accused upon request violates due process where the evidence is material either to guilt or to punishment irrespective of the good faith or bad faith of the prosecution.” 
    Now, in that case, the qualification of on request is explainable by the fact that in that case, the evidence which had been withheld had been requested. 
    In fact, none of the lower courts which have passed on suppression cases have ever made a requirement that the defense had to request the information before the nondisclosure could be excused. 
    And this is true of cases which were decided before Brady including two Third Circuit cases which Brady cited with approval of stating the correct rule and two of cases cited after Brady and it was true in this very case. 
    In this very case, the Maryland Court of Appeals did not require a showing of a request for disclosure and it is perfectly obvious that the -- if you -- a requirement of a request would defeat the rule because the time when a defense needs disclosure the most, is when the defense is so ignorant and so uninformed that it doesn't know what to request or even whether to request. 
    So for the future purposes, I shall assume that the Brady rule applies without the need for a request for the exposure abiding the facts. 
    That brings me to the second requirement of the Brady case and that is that the withheld evidence be material. 
    And Brady didn't explain the meaning of the test of materiality. 
    The Maryland Court of Appeals didn't explain it either but if you analyze what they did, it is perfectly clear that they held that evidence is immaterial unless it were so strong that as to be full through. 
    If there was any possibility that it might not have affected the result then it wasn't material. 
    Now, it seems to us that the analogy here should be to the test of materiality which this Court develop in cases like the Napue case where the fault was the introduction of testimony known to the prosecution to be incorrect and the failure of the prosecution to correct the incorrect testimony. 
    And the tests stated by this Court in the Napue case was that the evidence, the wrongful -- the admitted evidence, was material and tainted the conviction if the false testimony, “May have had an effect on the outcome of the trial” and the Court has applied the same tests to cases where evidence where illegally obtained evidence and violation of the Fourth Amendment was admitted. 
    So in they against Connecticut, the test was whether the admission of the evidence -- there was a reasonable possibility that the admission of the evidence might have affected the result. 
    Now, this kind of case is a corollary case to the use of false evidence and it seems to us clear that the same test of materiality should apply namely if the evidence if the evidence have been revealed, was there a reasonable possibility that it would have affected the result. 
    In our view, this test of materiality was more than that. 
    And now I come to our description of the evidence that we claim was suppressed and which was brought out at the post-conviction proceeding. 
    The evidence falls under two categories. 
    The first category is evidence of the events between the episode the alleged rape of July 20, 1961 and the trial in December 1961. 
    The evidence shows this, on the 9th of August 26, 1961, one month after the alleged rape, three months before the trial, Joyce went to a party, and at the party she had intercourse with two men; one in the bathroom, one in the yard. 
    Early the next morning, she took an overdose of drugs and a suicide attempt and she was taken to a hospital and was kept in the hospital in the psychiatric ward of the hospital for 10 days with admitting diagnosis of a psychopathic personality. 
    While she was in the psychopathic ward of the hospital she was visited by a boyfriend of hers named Busty. 
    Busty asked her why did she attempt suicide. 
    She told Busty that she had been raped the night before the suicide attempt by these two men that whom she had had intercourse at the park, and she gave him the names of the men and all the detail. 
    Busty reported this rather officiously because she didn't ask him though. 
    Busty reported this to her parents. 
    Her mother first called sergeant way up in Montgomery County police who was in-charged of the investigation resulting in the conviction of petitioners. 
    And she told Sergeant Whalen that Joyce had been raped again. 
    So Whalen asked her where did this take place and she said in Prince George's County. 
    So Whalen said well don't bother me, tell it to the Prince George's County police and presumably he went back to sleep. 
    So she or her husband reported it to the Prince George's County police. 
    Detective Sergeant Wheeler of the Prince George's County Police came to the hospital to interview Joyce in connection with this complaint. 
    When he interviewed her, the first thing she told them was that these two men at the party had had relations with her against her will. 
    But he then questioned her further. 
    In the course of the questioning it became perfectly apparent that she had not been raped, that she engaged in voluntary intercourse, she had put up no resistance and that the most she had was an unexpressed mental reservation. 
    She really didn't want to engage an intercourse with these two boys at that time. 
    She said at that particular time because she was afraid that if all the other boys at the party got to know about it, they would all insist on having intercourse with her. 
    Otherwise, she said she wouldn't even have had this mental; reservation, and she also admitted that in the past with one of the two men with whom she have had intercourse at the party, she had had relation with. 
    They were white. 
    Which boy? 
    You mean the second rape claim?

    Mr. Joseph Forer 
    That's the first, this is what then the --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="1205.299" stopTime="1207.727">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Do you think that would have been admissible on that trial?
speaker="joseph_forer" startTime="1207.727" stopTime="1344.708">
    Mr. Joseph Forer 
    Yes. 
    In a few -- if I may hold it until I finish my account of the evidence because I haven't concluded it I will come to that question Justice Black. 
    She also told Wheeler a little more than these circumstances, she also told Wheeler something about her sex history generally. 
    He told him that for the past two years since the time she was 14, she had had intercourse relations with so many different man and boys that she didn't know how many including many of them who were strangers. 
    Joseph told them that on numerous occasions she had engaged in oral settlement. 
    At this point Wheeler marked the case closed on count. 
    Now, to get to Justice Black's question, these episodes and these are episodes within the first category for purposes of the precedence and the evidentiary question. 
    It seems to us that this is narrative account to have four components. 
    First is that she made a false accusation of rape against somebody else. 
    Secondly that she attempted suicide and incidentally at the post-conviction proceeding and psychiatrist testified that this of the 16-year old girl was itself indicative a serious mental disturbance. 
    Third, she was hospitalized in the psychiatric ward and, fourth that she had a sex history indicative of nymphomania. 
    Now, the authorities numerous authority dealing with sex cases in various jurisdictions hold even in the abstract that any as to each one of these four components that they are admissible in evidence where there is a defense of consent because they are indicative of the mental illness of the prosecutor and because they are indicative of a well-known syndrome which involves as a characteristic element, a compulsion on the part of a young girl to contrive sex offenses by men.

    Is that clear on the law of Maryland?
speaker="joseph_forer" startTime="1347.185" stopTime="1365.608">
    Mr. Joseph Forer 
    In the law of Maryland, nothing gets clear on the evidence. 
    All I can say is that the majority said we will assume that this information could reasonably have been deemed admissible and useful. 
    The --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1365.608" stopTime="1369.441">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    I'm not talking about this case, do you understand? 
    I'm talking about the case law of Maryland.
speaker="joseph_forer" startTime="1369.441" stopTime="1482.263">
    Mr. Joseph Forer 
    The case law of Maryland isn't clear one way or the other. 
    Just not clear one way or the other. 
    However, this -- on the one hand the majority -- at least the Court that sets the law in Maryland. 
    Majority said we're willing to assume it would have been admissible. 
    The two judges in the minority said we think that it was reasonably admissible or a reasonable possibility of admissibility and pointed out that when you come to the close question with evidence, you can't tell whether it's admissible until you see how it's produced when she seems to me make the most sense. 
    The grounds on which is often a particular way the counsel works within and so forth. 
    And the trial judge in the post-conviction proceeding also said that he thought that there was a reasonable possibility of admissibility and he also said, he doesn't have to find the least admissible in case there were a trial. 
    In another ground of materiality here, is that with this kind of information, it seems to us that defense could have applied for and would have received a pretrial mental examination of the prosecutor. 
    And considering the evidence which we do not claim to be suppressed but the newly discovered evidence in addition to what I have described, there is certainly a very strong possibility that this mental examination would have been adverse to the girl's credibility. 
    If I may anticipate the next question, there is no law in Maryland one way or the other as to whether or not pretrial mental examinations can be ordered in such a situation. 
    Now, aside from the fact--

    And we also explained what sanctions are available to the Court if the prosecutor refuses to take the -- such a mental examination. 
    This is the new law and as I say there is no precedent in one way or the other in New Jersey.

    No, on the basis of state law.

    Mr. Joseph Forer 
    Well, that's not correct either, it might be because if you -- first, you never can tell really whether the evidence is admissible or not, but secondly, this may be evidence which will lead them to evidence which they can produce in an admissible form. 
    So the question really isn't in the --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="1756.504" stopTime="1767.849">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Well the prosecuting attorney has got to give all -- got to cite all of the evidence that he thinks might lead them -- let them be lead to obtain some other evidence to be admissible.

    Mr. Joseph Forer 
    Now, the prosecuting attorney has to make the judgment, whether evidence that he has is reasonably exculpatory and material and is the kind of evidence that the other side might not have. 
    And the Court of Maryland, the Court of Appeals of Maryland held this state law as well as federal law held that where there is a possibility, a reasonable possibility of materiality and admissibility, the prosecutor has a duty to inform either the defense or the judge or the jury of this exculpatory evidence.

    Mr. Joseph Forer 
    They just said that's the law. 
    They -- now, whether they were interpreting state law or federal law and -- but I will say that this principle has been announced not only by the state of Maryland but by federal circuits including the District of Columbia Circuit, the Griffin case which was cited by the Maryland Court of Appeals. 
    That's certainly a law in Maryland. 
    But the peculiar relevancy of this testimony is that it would have made plausible the testimony of the petitioners that was otherwise unbelievable. 
    It would have made plausible that that testimony which required the jury to believe that she was the kind of girl that would have acted and spoken that way that in other words, she was not just an ordinary child, but she was the kind of child that Lillian Helman wrote her famous play about.

    Knowledge of the state's attorney?
speaker="joseph_forer" startTime="1955.149" stopTime="1974.566">
    Mr. Joseph Forer 
    It was the knowledge of the state's attorney who was the chief prosecutor would personally drive the case. 
    He had the same knowledge incidentally that the -- that Lieutenant Whalen who was the chief detective in-charged of the investigation then. 
    So in this case, I don't think we have any problem as to who is to be prosecuted.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="1974.566" stopTime="1977.990">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    What did he know if anything of the conversation between Joyce and Sergeant Wheeler?
speaker="joseph_forer" startTime="1977.990" stopTime="2159.967">
    Mr. Joseph Forer 
    I -- if he were just told that, I will come to the knowledge aspect in just a moment but I want to correct one -- I want to follow up one other thing. 
    This information wasn't admissible merely to impeach Joyce's credibility. 
    In my opinion, it was also preoperative a substantive evidence of their testimony that she had said to them in the woods, “I have 16 or 17 other boys this week and two or three more won't make any difference.” 
    Does this testimony A, makes it entirely plausible that she did have 16 or 17 other boys that week and B that whether or not she had it, she would go around and tell it to relative strangers. 
    So it would have corroborated that. 
    Now, let me come to the second category then I'll get to the question of knowledge but I would like to clean out what the evidence that we're complaining about the -- you recall that I said that the petitioners testified that Joyce have told them variously that she was on probation or in trouble and that if she were caught in the woods because of this thing on probation or in trouble she would have to claim that she was raped. 
    Now, there was no corroboration of this testimony and the petitioner's testimony to this effect was ridiculed by the state and Joyce denied that she was on probation. 
    Now, as the post-conviction proceeding showed at the time of this episode in the woods that was pending against Joyce a petition in the Juvenile Court of Prince George's County alleging that she was beyond parental console and a recommendation of a court case worker that she be put on probation. 
    So Joyce was A, in trouble and B, although she was not on probation she was in the status close to it that a lay person might have described as probation. 
    And furthermore, as the evidence of the post-conviction proceeding showed, in fact she did call it probation because on the Saturday before the Thursday of the alleged rape by the petitioners, she went out with a boyfriend of hers Pat Stevens and she told Pat Stevens let's stay in Laurel. 
    Let's not go down to Hyattsville because I'm on probation. 
    And in fact, she wasn't on probation. 
    She was in this near probation status. 
    This evidence, the materiality of it can possibly be controverted because it would have corroborated critical testimony of the petitioners which I believe obviously negatives rape and it would have removed a false impression created before the jury by the cross-examination of the defendants and by the state's witness' denial of being on probation.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="2159.967" stopTime="2164.378">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr.

    Mr. Joseph Forer 
    Was not known, he tried to find out what there was against her in the Juvenile Court of Prince George's County and Montgomery's County because he knew the boy's story and he was refused to access for the record.

    Both courts. 
    We have got a written permission from the juvenile court of Prince George's County and a ruling which I cannot to this day understand and which I cannot explain the basis for, Judge Moorman refused to introduce an evidence so then we finally managed to get in the key point by means of stipulation. 
    Let me now come to the knowledge of the prosecution. 
    The Court of Appeals found that the prosecution consisted of the state's attorney and the investigating police. 
    For present purposes, that means party who was the state's attorney and who tried the case and Lieutenant Whalen who was the detective in-charge of the investigation.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2287.629" stopTime="2293.680">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    The ruling of the Court will include the -- all of the police in that county and all of the staff of the prosecutor.
speaker="joseph_forer" startTime="2293.680" stopTime="2300.055">
    Mr. Joseph Forer 
    That's right, but the only knowledge that -- but in fact all of the knowledge--
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2300.055" stopTime="2300.991">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Was in these two individuals.
speaker="joseph_forer" startTime="2300.991" stopTime="2301.548">
    Mr. Joseph Forer 
    Was in this two.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2301.548" stopTime="2302.747">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    In this case.
speaker="joseph_forer" startTime="2302.747" stopTime="2355.728">
    Mr. Joseph Forer 
    And the only way we established knowledge was from their own lips. 
    Now, Kardy the state's attorney and Whalen the head of the detectives knew the evidence chose this and they were found by the Court of Appeals and by the trial court to know about the attempted suicide and about the second rape accusation but they knew them only in a general way and they didn't know the details and all the subsidiary evidence for the simple reason that they were not interested and made no effort to investigate. 
    Kardy for example testified that he knew that he know that Joyce had taken this overdose of drugs and he assumed that it was intentional and motivated. 
    He happened to have their motive but he assumed that it was a suicide attempt.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2355.728" stopTime="2357.013">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Kardy was who?
speaker="joseph_forer" startTime="2357.013" stopTime="2357.673">
    Mr. Joseph Forer 
    What?
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2357.673" stopTime="2358.624">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Kardy was who?
speaker="joseph_forer" startTime="2358.624" stopTime="2413.697">
    Mr. Joseph Forer 
    The state's attorney. 
    He also knew that Joyce have been involved in an allegation of another rape and that nothing had come of this allegation, not even the produce formal charges. 
    But he hadn't bothered to find out and didn't know that the allegation was made by Joyce because he didn't bother to find out. 
    And the same thing was true of Lieutenant Whalen, the detective lieutenant. 
    Although after all, although he didn't know immediately that Joyce had instigated the charge, he got the information of this second alleged rape from the girl's mother. 
    And that by itself should indicate, it seems to me a definite possibility that the complaint originated with the girl. 
    Now --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2413.697" stopTime="2415.626">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    That was a telephone call from the girl's mother?
speaker="joseph_forer" startTime="2415.626" stopTime="2417.778">
    Mr. Joseph Forer 
    Yeah, he got a telephone call from the girl's mother and --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="2417.778" stopTime="2419.780">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    And then learned that it happened in a different county and said that --?
speaker="joseph_forer" startTime="2419.780" stopTime="2660.555">
    Mr. Joseph Forer 
    Yeah, that's right. 
    And he said, don't bother me with that. 
    Now, in short, they did know, they know she had taken this overdose, they assume that the suicide, they knew that she was involved in the second rape accusation. 
    Now if you limit, if you limit the state's knowledge or the responsibility of the state merely to what they knew they actually knew without more, we say that under the authorities and under any kind of reason, that was material in and of itself. 
    They knew there was a suicide attempt or they knew enough about it. 
    They knew there was a second rape accusation which apparently was false and they had very good reason to believe that Joyce have instigated it. 
    And that would be enough. 
    But I want to go further, there's another grounds for materiality here. 
    Not only would this evidence have been enough in and out itself. 
    But if you assume as the Court of Appeals of Maryland did that there is a duty to divulge anything that is possibly material and that this duty was breached here. 
    Once you have a breach of a duty to divulge, then when you get to the question of whether the breach of the duty was prejudicial, you're past the question of breach which means whether or not the evidence was material. 
    Then you should look, not only at the value of the precise things known to the prosecution and not divulge but also at what the defense was in all likelihood and in years surely would have discovered if the duty had not been breached. 
    If Kardy and Whalen had told the defense what they knew, any diligent defense would have checked with the police department of Prince George's County and would have gotten the whole story that Lieutenant Wheeler had knew and would have had everything else. 
    And this was a point made by the dissenting opinion. 
    The dissenting opinion said, in order to determine materiality, first, what they actually knew was itself material, but secondly that having breached the duty of divulgence of disposure that this information was material because of -- it would have been a great value for the defense by further investigation. 
    Now, we have an alternative theory for -- on the question of knowledge, this is an alternative theory with regard to category one of the suppressed evidence that is the history of the false rape accusation and the attempted suicide. 
    But it is the only theory that we have with regard to the nondisclosure of the fact that she was in this near probation status. 
    We say that under certain circumstances for the purposes of the suppression doctrine, it is right to charge the prosecution, not only with what they actually knew but also with constructive knowledge of what they should have known if they had conducted an unbiased investigation and if they had shown the most rudimentary diligence in the performance of the obligation that they owe to the state as public officials and to all accused to investigate allegations of crime with some kind of elementary diligence. 
    And we say here that this duty to the public was breached.

    Justice Hugo L. Black

    Mr. Joseph Forer 
    No, I think that overstates my position Justice Black. 
    I say, well first of all, the prosecution here did investigate. 
    In the course of the investigation, they came upon evidence which was indicative of innocence. 
    Instead of performing the duty to conduct an unbiased investigation, they turned their back on the others. 
    They deliberately closed their eyes --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="2715.828" stopTime="2719.532">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Is their duty to these defendants to conduct an unbiased investigation?
speaker="joseph_forer" startTime="2719.532" stopTime="2807.570">
    Mr. Joseph Forer 
    Are they certainly do. 
    They owed a duty to the defendants and they owed a duty to the public. 
    And at minimum that duty is not to deliberately close their eyes to exculpatory or possibly exculpatory evidence in order that they may then have an excuse not to turn the evidence over to the defense. 
    Now, all I can say Justice Black is that there is a minimum of authority on this point. 
    This Court hasn't spoken on that point. 
    There are a few lower court cases which do hex the prosecution with constructive knowledge because it was information which they should have known. 
    Now, let me rehearse the circumstances here which called upon them to make some kind of an investigation. 
    First, the medical testimony, it was indicative of intercourse but not of forcible penetration. 
    You have a 16-year old girl alone in the woods late at night with a 21-year old man, originally with three men. 
    She ran a great distance of 30 feet to escape being ravished. 
    She was first to offer sex to John Giles. 
    She didn't resist, she didn't expostulate, it was capital offense, the defense was indigent, the information was -- the indicated information to check was readily available to the prosecution and the police.

    Mr. Joseph Forer 
    No, but of course under the law of Maryland, the unchastity of a woman who has been raped is admissible at the conviction for the purpose of determining sentence but we're not going into that here. 
    But if she was raped, she was raped, our point is that she wasn't raped and that the state suppressed evidence which to any reasonable mind would have corroborated and made plausible the testimony of these two young men who otherwise had nowhere else to turn.

    Mr. Joseph Forer 
    No. 
    Now, let me stay for a minute on the policy consideration. 
    It said well, this is the past of nondisclosure. 
    The prosecution doesn't have to be the defense counsel. 
    The prosecution can't be expected to disclose information available to the defendant. 
    Now, the information here was not available for the defense. 
    And the state is in a position where it must disclose. 
    It not only has superior resources it has an obligation to see that justice is done, as all prosecutors always say, make luncheon speeches but do not necessarily carry out. 
    And the state's nondisclosure of exculpatory evidence can't be excused even if there is as there was not here negligence on the part of the defense. 
    Supposed both were at fault, it's a different kind of fault, where the fault is refusal to -- is a concealment, a withholding of the information that you have, on one side the prosecution side and the fault on the defense side is a failure to acquire the information which it could have gotten if it had tried. 
    Where the prosecution fails to disclose information that it has the best you can say for it is that it is deliberately exploiting a mistake or negligence by the defense counsel in order to try to get his client sent to the chair or convicted for a long time. 
    And even if the prosecution isn't being malicious about it then at least they had the last clear chance and tort terms and they didn't take advantage of it nor is this passive nondisclosure. 
    The vice is not the failure to disclose. 
    The vice is prosecuting without failing to disclose. 
    And there was nothing passive about the prosecution in this case. 
    And this nondisclosure was no more a passive thing than a stationary part of a moving machine. 
    I would like now to turn to my equal protection argument.

    Mr. Forer, suppose this is not a rape case, but suppose it were a case of grand larceny and a witness testified against the defendant. 
    And let's suppose the state knew that this witness had some sort of a record, or had been arrest let's say without being convicted. 
    And this witness had himself arrested.

   Argument of Donald Needle

    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Mr. Needle?
speaker="donald_needle" startTime="3779.075" stopTime="4022.808">
    Mr. Donald Needle 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    Because all of the importance really of the facts of this case I think because of the gloss which the petitioner's counsel has perhaps put on those facts that should be reviewed. 
    We have to keep in mind that what we're talking about number one is information known to persons in two counties of the State of Maryland we're talking about information number one known by the state's attorney Leonard Kardy of Montgomery County. 
    We're talking about information known by Lieutenant Whalen the chief investigator of this case who was also in Montgomery County. 
    But the most important information known is the information known in this case by Sergeant Wheeler of the Prince George's County police. 
    The other most important information in this case also Prince George's County information is located number one, in the Prince George's County hospital record; and number two in a juvenile court record of Prince George's County. 
    Now, the basis of our brief really is that this case has got to analyzed in proper perspective. 
    The first thing that has to be ascertained is what did the prosecution includes know, or what is the prosecution charge for it. 
    Who is the prosecution? 
    Now the Court of Appeals of Maryland found even a more broad rule that has been announced in the past, the Court of Appeals said that the prosecution would consist in this case of Kardy the state's attorney and his assistance and the police of Montgomery County. 
    Now, notice that is the police of Montgomery County. 
    We argue that information known not only by Kardy in this case by perhaps known by some other officer in Montgomery County even under the Court of Appeals opinion could be said by the defense analogy in this case to be imputable to the prosecution. 
    Now, we maintain that our own Court of Appeals was even too broad that what should be known by the prosecution should be the knowledge of the state's attorney and additionally the knowledge of the investigating officers. 
    Now, we maintain that if the rule is any different, what -- where are we going and what does it mean? 
    Now, Montgomery County has a population of approximately 500,000 people the same with the other adjourning county. 
    Or let's look at Jersey City, New Jersey, and let's look at New York City. 
    Is every police officer of either of these adjourning municipalities jurisdiction to know number one, who are to be the state witnesses? 
    Who has made a complaint of crime and is to testify in the case? 
    Are all state or municipal police officers to know that fact much less whether or not any particular piece of information that they might have would be useful if they don't know the facts of the case? 
    Much less, what, excuse me -- much less whether a particular piece of information that they might have about a witness what if you tell what it would be. 
    So therefore, we claim that the only legitimate rule which can be passed, the only practical test of prosecution knowledge can be that of actual knowledge of the prosecutor and his assistants and his agents. 
    And secondly, of those officers that investigated the case. 
    Now --

    Mr. Donald Needle 
    I think that implication can be read into the language of the Court of Appeals. 
    But of course --
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="4311.846" stopTime="4338.888">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    It is very important for us to know just what the Court of Appeals decided and as I understood your prior statement, the Court of Appeals said that the prosecution is chargeable with the knowledge that Mr. Kardy and his assistant and with the knowledge of all of the police in Montgomery County, is that correct?
speaker="donald_needle" startTime="4338.888" stopTime="4530.232">
    Mr. Donald Needle 
    The course came out with an odd statement that the prosecution should be charged with knowledge of the state's attorney and his assistants and of the police department of that jurisdiction which has the control or the jurisdiction to hear the case. 
    And that in the next sentence, they said, this would mean applying to this case that our interest is in the knowledge of the state's attorney Kardy and of Lieutenant Whalen who were the only or Whalen was the only Montgomery County officer actually involved. 
    Now, I would like to point before getting further into the legal argument of this case that the state's evidence was not solely the evidence of Joyce Roberts against the evidence of petition. 
    And our case was not an uncorroborated case. 
    The evidence was clear. 
    This Joyce Roberts only 16 years old did go out to Patuxent River area at midnight. 
    And she went out there with three boys. 
    But the evidence is clear that she went there to go swimming and others were to meet them there. 
    That when the others didn't come within minutes, they left. 
    Joyce Roberts and the three boys started to go. 
    Their car then ran out of gas. 
    Two of the three boys out with Joyce Roberts in that car left to get gas, leaving Joyce Roberts and Stewart Foster in that car. 
    It is at this point that the Giles boys who had been swimming and fishing came upon the scene and they saw the car. 
    And of course this is where the evidence becomes conflicted. 
    The Giles boys testified in the trial that the reason that they broke into that car, the windows were locked -- the windows were closed, the doors were locked. 
    But the reason why they shattered those windows of that car and drags Foster out of that car and not being conscious was because they claim that Stewart Foster had a gun in that car. 
    Now here is Stewart Foster in that car, Joyce Roberts in that car and here are three persons that are opposed to this one other man. 
    Now, the complete and credulous proposition that was forwarded by the defense just didn't support the proposition. 
    So you have a demolished car to corroborate the state's case. 
    You have Stewart Foster found at two o'clock in the morning by the first police officer who arrived on the scene, you find him bloody, you find him hysteric, you find that he's taken and rushed to the hospital and given eight stitches. 
    You find Joyce Roberts lying on the ground, well this is the testimony of the first police officer on the scene.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="4530.232" stopTime="4532.097">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    You find what lying on the ground?
speaker="donald_needle" startTime="4532.097" stopTime="4714.087">
    Mr. Donald Needle 
    Joyce Roberts sir, the prosecuting witness. 
    The first police officer that arrived on the scene testified of what he found and described Foster's condition which I have just related and then described what he found as far as Joyce Roberts' condition. 
    She was found lying on the ground with her blouse on open in a semiconscious condition. 
    The police officer and Stewart Foster had to pick Joyce vilely up off of the ground and help her get dressed. 
    She was taken to the hospital. 
    Now, was there any evidence in the hospital record, of any force? 
    Well, the answer is yes. 
    The doctor testified for the state at the trial that there were operations of the shoulders, of the legs, and of the neck of the prosecuting witness. 
    They further testified that there were leaves, there were dirt and grass adherent to the back of her body. 
    There were numerous spermatozoa cells found in the vagina. 
    Now, we maintain that this is not a case of uncorroborated testimony of a prosecuting witness which has served now to place three persons in jail that the state's case was fully corroborated. 
    Now, the prosecutor knew this evidence ahead of time. 
    In addition to that, the prosecutor spoke to and interviewed Joyce Roberts. 
    He spoke to her before the Giles case. 
    He spoke to her before the Johnson case which was held there. 
    He had an interview with the defense counsel, Mr. Steven Prescott. 
    He told the defense counsel that as far as he was concerned, this girl was 100% that there was nothing as far as he knew that would cast any aspersions whatsoever on her credibility. 
    Now, the Court of Appeals of Maryland found that by the Giles version of this incident to their own counsel. 
    Their own counsel must have known, number one, that this girl was a sexually promiscuous girl and that her background was not of the finest. 
    There was evidence in other words which the defense counsel knew wherein the Court of Appeals said which should have been investigated. 
    Mr. Forer has named certain things the defense of the case was that Joyce Roberts had told these defendants that she had that same week engaged in intercourse with 16 other persons. 
    Now, if that was true, and if the defense counsel knew that, was there any obligation on the defense counsel to go and to find out whether or not there was any truth in this assertion. Now, what did the defense counsel do?

    Mr. Donald Needle 
    Yes sir. 
    And he was assigned in September and had approximately three months to prepare for this case. 
    Now, what was the preparation? 
    Number one, he claims that he went to the Montgomery County juvenile court because the petitioners had allegedly been told by Joyce Roberts that she was on probation and that if she was caught she would have to claim rape. 
    They went to the juvenile court because they had an indication that the juvenile court might have something. But they weren't allowed to see the juvenile court records. 
    Why? 
    Because as I have pointed out in our appendix, Maryland Rule 922 said that in order to see a record of the juvenile case, you must seek and obtain the permission of the judge. 
    Now, it is admitted that this was not sought. 
    Now, wouldn't that in and of itself the simple matter of getting a judge's signature permission to see a record, does this in itself show a lack of diligence?

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    I noticed that Mr. Prescott was asked the question by Mr. Kardy in the cross-examination. 
    At the top of page 215, Mr. Prescott said he made efforts in Montgomery County and Prince George's County in regard of the juvenile court, so on that basis you knew there was some action of proceeding in both jurisdiction. 
    And to know they didn't even go so far as to tell me that. 
    They just told me that I could not have the records that they have there. 
    The information I got from sending that came from Giles (Inaudible). 
    It was not suggested that he knew something and he asked for them but they wouldn't let them have them. 
    I don't know who they would be.

    The point is as far as prosecution knowledge of this report there was none.

    Although he attended that hearing he was never in the courtroom except when he testified and Whalen never saw this report and it is admitted in the petitioner's brief that no one or the prosecution ever saw this report.

speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="5636.220" stopTime="5645.391">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    What I don't quite understand is what you referred as to 174 is the stipulation is it not regarding the Prince George's County procedure?
speaker="donald_needle" startTime="5645.391" stopTime="5646.016">
    Mr. Donald Needle 
    Yes sir.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="5646.016" stopTime="5660.776">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Well now one of the proceedings which interest me even more. 
    In Montgomery County on September 5, 1961 which is at page 275 petition is exhibit three for identification.
speaker="donald_needle" startTime="5660.776" stopTime="5679.503">
    Mr. Donald Needle 
    Your Honor please, the initial petition in this case concerning Joyce Roberts which ended in a hearing on September the fifth in Montgomery County had been filed in Prince George's County. 
    And that is the same hearing that we're talking about on the stipulation.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="5679.503" stopTime="5681.229">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    That was transferred to Montgomery was it?
speaker="donald_needle" startTime="5681.229" stopTime="5739.998">
    Mr. Donald Needle 
    Yes. 
    Now, the reason that that was transferred to Montgomery County and we point that out in our brief is that subsequent to the date of April the 4th when this initial Prince George's County petition was sought, Joyce Roberts and her family had been subjected to gross harassment. 
    The mother had requested Lieutenant Whalen to have her placed in protective custody. 
    And Lieutenant Whalen called the judge of the juvenile court of Montgomery County and told the judge of that court that this girl is to be a necessary witness in the state's case. 
    A hearing therefore was held in Montgomery County and it concerned therefore the original facts contained in this stipulation plus the fact that the state wanted her held for her own protective custody. 
    And that's why the hearing was held in Montgomery.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="5739.998" stopTime="5753.363">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Well then, what's the significance of that paragraph summary of hearing which I referred to before particularly and also she was the state witness in the case where two adults are charged.
speaker="donald_needle" startTime="5753.363" stopTime="5755.533">
    Mr. Donald Needle 
    That is what I just explained sir.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="5755.533" stopTime="5758.111">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    That's not the Giles case. 
    It referred to that.
speaker="donald_needle" startTime="5758.111" stopTime="5760.992">
    Mr. Donald Needle 
    Yes sir, yes. 
    It wasn't the Giles case.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="5760.992" stopTime="5784.838">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Wait a minute apparently here occasion for hearing and also that said child is a necessary witness on behalf of the state regarding a criminal case pending in the circuit court for Montgomery County. 
    And the summary of the hearing that she was a state witness in the case where two adults are charged in this August incident, I understand were two men involved at the party.
speaker="donald_needle" startTime="5784.838" stopTime="5789.809">
    Mr. Donald Needle 
    Yes sir, but no charge ever made this report refers only to the Giles case.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="5789.809" stopTime="5793.329">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Well I thought there were three involved in the Giles case?
speaker="donald_needle" startTime="5793.329" stopTime="6092.643">
    Mr. Donald Needle 
    There were three involved sir. 
    But they were treated as distinct cases. 
    The Giles brothers is one case because a severance had been asked as far as the third party was concerned. 
    So, if I might continue that what we're talking about here then is not only a question of uncorroborated testimony. 
    But a grossly clear picture drawn by the state is to what occurred on that night. 
    Now, very briefly, we maintain that other than the question of the utility of information which is the only rule which Mr. Forer suggests as the court contests that there are many, many other factors in this case to be given very serious consideration before any one rule can be made to be imposed upon the states under the due process clause. 
    Consideration has got to be given as I pointed out number one, what did the state know or what was the state chargeable with knowing? 
    Consideration has got to be given, we maintain, to what did the defense know or what was the defense chargeable with knowing. 
    Now, as relates to the evidence itself, consideration must be given not only to usefulness of that information. 
    Consideration must be given to the admissibility of that information. 
    Again, to the discoverability of that information under existing rules of discovery and inspection available in the states. 
    Now, Maryland Rule 728 which is said out in this petition is broader than Federal Rule 16. 
    Under neither rule would any of these evidence have been discoverable in a manner of pretrial discovery had it been requested. 
    Now, we state that this is a very important factor to be determined along with the mere question of possible usefulness of this information. 
    It's discoverability. 
    It's availability. 
    Now, was this evidence merely cumulative or impeaching? 
    Now, if it was so, it would not have been material exculpatory evidence. 
    And finally, was the evidence contradictory of anything that happened in the trial? 
    The answer is no. The evidence was not contradictory of anything that happened in the trial. 
    Now, the only aspect that Mr. Forer can point to trying to show some semblance of contradiction would be the fact that Joyce Roberts denied that she was on probation. 
    However, the stipulation at the time of the trial and prior thereto she was not on probation. 
    She never was on probation and still -- and is not now. 
    So there is no contradiction of any trial testimony. 
    So we maintain that before a rule can be passed in this case that the state must disclose not only what it knows but what it maybe should find that very careful consideration has got to be given to these other factors, to what the state really knew to the question of due diligence and equal availability of this knowledge to the defense to the question of the admissibility of this information to the question of whether the evidence could have been discovered even had it been asked and note finally that in the Brady case, one of the questions or one of the prerequisites to relief was that a request for information has to be made. 
    Now, our Court of Appeals as I have already pointed out showed that these defendants must have known -- must have known of the character and reputation of this girl or at least had something that it should have gone and investigate. 
    Now, we maintain sir that no case has ever held so far as we now that unless the state has exclusive knowledge of information that the defense knows that and that is the exclusive knowledge of information within its own control that is equally available to the defense counsel that a suppression has been maintained under the Fourteenth Amendment. 
    Now, we maintain that the Fourteenth Amendment imposes not so broad an obligation as that which is sought here. 
    We say that the Fourteenth Amendment does say that a prosecutor is to prosecute with earnest and as vigor. 
    You have said that in the Burger Case and we maintain that what the prosecution is precluded from doing by the Fourteenth Amendment is not from becoming a partisan but by having his partisan should turn into impartiality to become impartial to the extent of being disequal of to the extent of being desized.

    Let me ask you when I hope this is a very simple question.

    Now the police assumed that the prosecuting attorney knew what I have just stated to you. 
    Now, is it in your position that he does or does not, that he would or would not have had the duty to inform the defense of those facts that when they get to firmly that's a question that is susceptible with fairly direct answer.

    Justice Abe Fortas 
    The state's attorney has knowledge that in other instance involving other men at another time the prosecuting witness complained to the police that she had been raped. 
    The police investigated and they concluded that the prosecuting witness had not been raped but there was no basis for such a charge that the prosecuting witness had been a willing cooperator in the venture. 
    In those circumstances, then along comes the Giles case. 
    Those circumstances, is it or is it not in your theory that the prosecuting attorney must disclose these facts to the defense?

    At night?
speaker="donald_needle" startTime="6562.679" stopTime="6625.099">
    Mr. Donald Needle 
    Right, that is the answer sir. 
    Now, the chronology of the events were that one of the boys asked Stewart Foster for a cigarette. 
    Foster said he had no cigarettes. 
    One of the boys then asked Foster for money. 
    Foster said he had no money. 
    The boys then went behind the stalled vehicle in which Joyce and Foster were in. 
    It's at this point where the defendants claim they saw Stewart Foster bending down as so reaching for something. 
    They also claim that Foster had called them certain racial names that there had been an argument. 
    And because of these names and because Foster was reaching down that it was then that they broke the windows. 
    So there had been a conversation of course prior to the rocks being thrown. 
    Now, what was said is a question of interpretation, the state's interpretation where the state's evidence was that there was nothing to provoke this attack.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    We'll recess now. 
    I said it before you, take your chair. 
    I want to broaden now the question that Mr. Justice Fortas asked you a little bit, suppose that the state knew and the prosecution I mean at the time of the trial of these petitioners what the state now knows and what we now know from this record would the prosecution have been obliged to divulge to the defense any of those matters concerning the prior conduct of this girl for after the rape?
speaker="donald_needle" startTime="6683.713" stopTime="6708.204">
    Mr. Donald Needle 
    I would answer Your Honor that Fourteenth Amendment does not impose that obligation in this case because the facts of this case as they are now all cumulatively known. 
    Number one would not have been admissible in evidence. 
    They -- we admit would have been useful. 
    But --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="6708.204" stopTime="6709.091">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    It would have been what?
speaker="donald_needle" startTime="6709.091" stopTime="6758.976">
    Mr. Donald Needle 
    Useful sir. 
    But we maintain sir that utility of information is not to be considered by itself that there are even with all of these cumulative evidence too many other factors involved here. 
    The admissibility of the evidence. 
    The fact that the evidence could not have been discovered under the Maryland rules and the implications that would be drawn by the state having to give this type of information. 
    We maintain sir that under the Fourteenth Amendment that there would have been no obligation on the state's attorney had he known all of these evidence cumulatively even as opposed to what he in fact didn't know.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="6758.976" stopTime="6791.991">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well, borrowing your rules of evidence and considering the question of whether or not these men had a fair trial and in that were entitled to take all signs and circumstance of the record into our consideration. 
    Would you say that if the state then knew what you now knew and in order to have a fair trial they should have the divulged that information to the defense.
speaker="donald_needle" startTime="6791.991" stopTime="6811.519">
    Mr. Donald Needle 
    I would answer no sir that with all of these information cumulatively that what it now shows would not have precluded or did not prevent the petitioner from obtaining a fair trial.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="6811.519" stopTime="6857.484">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well, let -- let's put it this way then, the -- let's go to the sentencing process. 
    If they had that information is it not likely that the judge would have taken that information into consideration in sentencing these men and that in doing so, he would have expired some other sentence other than death even down to I think you said that minimum was 18 months or something like that 18 months to death might be not then of even some other sentence than that if that had disclosed to them?
speaker="donald_needle" startTime="6857.484" stopTime="6882.427">
    Mr. Donald Needle 
    Yes sir, I think in that regard that perhaps this evidence might under a moral obligation have been disclosed as regard to the issue of sentence but I point out also in answer to your question to that the claim of the petitioners here is not that this evidence related so much to the sentencing because that's really a moot question at this point since the sentence has been commuted by the governor.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="6882.427" stopTime="6890.549">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Does that make it moot because the judge might have given him 20 years, might have given him 15, or might have given him 10 might have given him 18 months.
speaker="donald_needle" startTime="6890.549" stopTime="6891.717">
    Mr. Donald Needle 
    This is correct sir.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="6891.717" stopTime="6893.987">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well so you can't say that's moot can you?
speaker="donald_needle" startTime="6893.987" stopTime="6927.339">
    Mr. Donald Needle 
    Well, perhaps it's not moot sir but perhaps I (Voice Overlap). 
    That is correct Your Honor. 
    I think that perhaps that the better answer is that the claim of the petitioners goes to the due process aspect of the fairness of the trial as regards their guilt or innocence not as regards the punishment to be imposed. 
    And I think the claim here relates to due process in consideration of guilt of or innocence of these people.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="6927.339" stopTime="6930.331">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Do they wave everything but that?
speaker="donald_needle" startTime="6930.331" stopTime="6936.009">
    Mr. Donald Needle 
    Well I don't say that they waive it sir but I say that this is what they are claiming here.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="6936.009" stopTime="6939.459">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Why isn't it here? 
    They didn't waive it.
speaker="donald_needle" startTime="6939.459" stopTime="6944.273">
    Mr. Donald Needle 
    Then I would assume by implication that the question would be here. 
    Yes sir.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="6944.273" stopTime="6982.304">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Because they're not -- the gravamen of their charge is not that it's admissible that could be thought out by different manner but the gravamen of their complaint is that this information was in the hands of the state and they did not divulge it. 
    And whether it's on the trial I would say that whether it's on the sentence if it is just improper that that should have -- information should have been given to them it should have been given to them if not for the trial certain report for the sentencing process which was later.
speaker="donald_needle" startTime="6982.304" stopTime="6992.696">
    Mr. Donald Needle 
    Well, Your Honor as I have said, I agree that as regards to the sentencing aspect of this case, this evidence certainly would have been useful.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="6992.696" stopTime="7003.202">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Useful well by of course it have been useful.

speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="7121.252" stopTime="7130.430">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Isn't that in direct contrary of what the record but the discovering of the Giles?

    Mr. Donald Needle 
    The record shows sir that Lieutenant Whalen stated that he had had a conversation with the doctor. 
    Now both the doctor denied and Lieutenant Whalen denied that this conversation had ever taken place but the most that I can show as far as the presence of Lieutenant Whalen at that particular hearing would be that at one particular point, he was there --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="7155.466" stopTime="7165.431">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    But in formal record at page 275 of the record it says that those (Inaudible) Detective Whalen.

    And over it and then summarizes the hearing. 
    Page 277 it says Lieutenant Whalen stated that Dr. Connor of hospital of Montgomery (Inaudible). 
    Now the inference to the written record was ever introduced from the post-conviction hearing I gather that Whalen was there.
speaker="donald_needle" startTime="7189.553" stopTime="7190.327">
    Mr. Donald Needle 
    That is correct.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="7190.327" stopTime="7256.834">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    What was the basis for and I noticed that before Whalen have been invited to the post-conviction hearing that the probation officer, the juvenile court probation officer Lynn Adams and Lynn Adams was at by counsel for the petitioner what went on at the hearing? 
    Who said what to whom? 
    There was objection, objection was sustained. 
    The object I suppose to the question was to show that Lieutenant Whalen who was there or to find out if he was there, he was there what kind of information he obtained at that hearing? 
    And if the juvenile court officer Lynn Adams has made an investigation a part of this hearing which the record shows that she had, you would think that there might have been a lack to disclose to the hearing other than just give the through summaries that are (Voice Overlap).

    The record as far as my recollection is was to void of any evidence one way or the other and my impression from my own knowledge of this case is that the judge did not have before him these records I am not certain but as I say, I don't think he did it and it wasn't sure.

    The first comments or in this case concerning sex was not made at the time Joyce Roberts was found.

   Argument of Robert C. Murphy
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="7947.172" stopTime="7956.511">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Murphy, the time has expired but we've taken so much of the time, I'm going to give you 10 minutes to conclude your argument if you will please.
speaker="robert_c_murphy" startTime="7956.511" stopTime="8377.084">
    Mr. Robert C. Murphy 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    I will be mindful of the fact that we have overstayed the time. 
    I was -- I would develop what argument I could make it within an abbreviated period of time that it will be brief and somewhat abortive. 
    The second one of the petitioner relates to the Maryland's former practice where all the -- which limits the trial motion for three days including on any go round, including newly discovered evidence. 
    My brother challenges that on the basis of the Fourteenth Amendment and says and that seems that the state has required to provide to condemn persons a reasonable opportunity presumably through a due trial mechanism demonstrate their innocence on the basis of newly discovered evidence that the Maryland rule of three days simply was not reasonable, was lacking in fundamental fairness and a classic due process terms that is shocking to the universal sense of justice. 
    We say in response to that Your Honor is that due process does not require a new trial and that where a state grants a new trial, it may impose such time limitations on the availability as it sees fit. 
    We don't here maintain the three days is reasonable or unreasonable and I might add, that's no longer the Maryland Rule, we now have the 90-day new trial motion for newly discovered evidence but this Court has enunciated the principal proposition many years ago. 
    Mr. Justice Holmes in the case of James versus Appellant, 192 U.S. in 1904 decision he said subsequently and very briefly in three sentences and with the Court's permission, I will simply quote that on this particular point, “We no more can doubt the power of the legislature to enact that statutes of limitation or motions for a new trial and we can doubt its power to an access of statute for the bringing of action. 
    It may be a questioned whether there would be any constitutional objection to a law making the original judgment final and doing a way with new trial altogether.” 
    Re-hearings, new trials are not essential to due process of law either in judicial or administrative proceedings cited in earlier case of this Court, Railroad Company versus Bach as in 154 U.S. 
    That proposition remains the law of the land as I understand it Your Honor of course the new rules of the court both state and federal and federal rules of criminal procedure setting forth time limitations on new trials that are now with us. 
    We -- the former rule of the expiration of the term of Court has a cut off period for new trials is no longer the law but there have been cases of this Court where individuals sought to avail themselves of new trials after the 5-day period. 
    This Court has said, this is a matter of power of jurisdiction. 
    You must do it within the period specified or not at all. 
    Again, I say the question of the power of jurisdiction there is not due process requirement involved. 
    My brothers seem to suggest that -- apparently seek to utilize a due process clause here as a vehicle to create power or to enlarge power as we say of course they are being held constitutional predicate for a new trial here. 
    The State of Maryland's limitation of three days although it may appear unreasonable is not unconstitutional. 
    There is a second point perhaps more difficult, the equal protection argument of my brother, basically amounts to this. 
    As Your Honors know in Maryland the jury is the judge of the law and the fact in the criminal case. 
    From that predicate, the intention is made that the Maryland Court of Appeals has denied the petitioners in this case equal protection of the law when they substituted their judgment for the exculpatory value of the alleged rape claim, the alleged suicide evidence for the determination that may have been made for a jury. 
    They say in essence that we have picked out a specie of case and have applied a different standard to this type of case and we would do any other case we violated around the principle and the principles of due process and equal protection. 
    We say to that of course that the predicate to make that argument a rational one is that the Maryland Court of Appeals had indicated that the evidence of question was admissible. 
    It did not. 
    The Maryland Court of Appeals held that the evidence of the false rape claim and of the suicide attempt was not admissible so that the equal protection argument falls right there. 
    It requires a bottom of admissibility of the evidence before it can be utilized. 
    I think what my brothers had in mind was the fact that the Court of Appeals, fortuitously perhaps stated that even if this evidence were admissible and nevertheless it wasn't of sufficient exculpatory value to be -- to give rise of the application of the suppression doctrine for that we say it is. 
    This was a Post-Conviction Procedure Act proceeding with which I am sure Your Honors are familiar. 
    We have that Act in Maryland. 
    That is a civil case. 
    This was not a trial of criminal case but many of that in Maryland and all our Post-Conviction Procedure Act case there is no jury. 
    The judge determines all relevant matters of fact and law. 
    Suppression cases are treated like any other case. 
    The voluntariness case for example of a confession, the trial judge makes all relevant determinations. 
    We haven't treated suppression cases any different than we treat any other case. 
    It's not a violation of equal protection. 
    If I haven't made myself clear in this brief time I'm talking rather fast but we would say this as Your Honors recall in Thomson versus (Inaudible), you said in essence that substantial allegation of newly discovered evidence where all of these available in a federal habeas corpus setting that if such allegations are made and incumbent upon a trial judge to have a hearing to determine whether or not this newly discovered evidence would furnish a predicate for a constitutional claim. 
    You also said that the newly discovered evidence which merely goes to the question of innocence or guilt is not grounds for such a hearing and in other words I think the essence of what you've done was to reaffirm the proposition that a new trial was not an essential reading of due process. 
    But you haven't slammed the door and said that you can't do anything with this newly discovered evidence or whatsoever. 
    Again, I apologize for this and --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="8377.084" stopTime="8387.894">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren

    They are not only willing, they have insisted. 
    Let me first answer the question that Mr. Justice Brennan raised. 
    There was no, no pre-sentence investigation in this case. 
    The judge could have ordered one, he did fail to order one.

    Mr. Joseph Forer 
    Not only do I know but it would have been impossible within the -- in the five-day interval that conducted such an investigation. 
    I do know there was none. 
    Secondly, there was no pre-sentence investigation between verdict and sentence. 
    The judge just in order and there was not and he sentenced him to death without pre-sentence investigation and after a five-minute hearing in which the only thing that was offered was some reputation testimony by one person which is in the record. 
    Secondly, on the question of sentencing, there is -- we would not be satisfied to have a case where a portion of the law I'll say that right now. 
    But it is true and this is relevant to your question Mr. Chief Justice. 
    There is a Fourth Circuit case construing Maryland law in the advanced sheets. 
    It's not in neither brief. 
    Whitaker against the Warden 362 Federal Second 838, 362 F.2d 838 which construing Maryland law on the question of sentence says that it is unquestionably clear that the promiscuity of a rape victim would be admissible in mitigation of sentence. 
    I want to -- on the question of petitioner's exhibit 3 --

    I just don't understand our counsel can say we didn't offer it. 
    It's right there in the record at page 173 of the record we offered it. 
    The state objected and the Judge Moorman excluded it on the state's objection. 
    Why he did it, I can't understand.

    Now the counsel for the state suggested that the lieutenant denied. 
    The lieutenant denied being at the hearing, as I read the record, he admitted that he was at some hearing but he can't remember what the date was.

    No, what happened was --

    He couldn't remember what went on the hearing he was at.
speaker="joseph_forer" startTime="8672.279" stopTime="8963.553">
    Mr. Joseph Forer 
    No, it was more than that. 
    He admitted being at the hearing. 
    He showed a very weak memory to the point where he couldn't even remember things that the hearing folks are saying. 
    But he did say that on -- he wasn't at the hearing at all times. 
    He said he went in and out a couple of times. 
    That's the gravamen of his testimony. 
    He was at the hearing but he said that he didn't remember some of it and he wasn't in the hearing every minute of the hearing. 
    On the question of what transpired at the car, the version given by Mr. Needle seems to me to be an inaccurate account of the state's evidence. 
    It certainly does not correspond to the contrary evidence of the defense. 
    Furthermore, among the new evidence that we sought to get a hearing on was a great mass of evidence in addition to the evidence that we claim suppressed including evidence relating to Stewart Foster and the accounts given by Stewart Foster after -- immediately after this alleged rape which would have served to corroborate the testimony of the defendants that they would not the aggressors. 
    They did not provoke the altercation and we were never able to get that new evidence in because of the Maryland three-day rule. 
    Now, we're not claiming that the evident information that was suppressed proves innocence. 
    But what we are saying is that the information was of a quality that the defense should have had the opportunity to present that or the fruits of the information to the jury. 
    And it wasn't up to the prosecutor to decide whether or not this kind of evidence should be given to was at least he could have done was leave it to the judge as to whether the jury should pass on it. 
    And now, at this late date, the Court of Appeals says he probably breached his obligation but the evidence wasn't sufficiently exculpatory and in that respect, the Court of Appeals is invading the providence of the jury which in Maryland law is the sole judge of the exculpatory value of admissible evidence and in that respect, we were denied equal protection under all the opinions in the Brady case. 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may I have about three minutes on the question of the admissibility? 
    Mr. Needle also states the Maryland law very seriously when he says that there would not be admissible under Maryland law the fact of a prior false rape claim. 
    In Smallwood versus Warden which was a case by the federal district court of Maryland which is quoted in our brief, Chief Judge Thompson granted habeas corpus because of a suppression of a prior rape accusation where there wasn't even evidence that it was false. 
    In this case, neither the majority nor the minority adopted his theory that this evidence is clearly been held inadmissible. 
    They said it might well have been admissible and we've all -- but we don't pass on it in this content. 
    Now, what he is talking about is the case of Rau against the State which was decided in 1919 which was a statutory rape case in which the evidence that the child involved had made a prior accusation was offered solely on the theory that it impugned the character of the girl. 
    At this time, because there was so little knowledge of psychiatry, it wasn't offered on the theory for which it is now considered admissible, namely the theory of showing either mental illness or mental bias, a kind of corrupt bias against the class of people namely men of whom the accused are members. 
    The Maryland Court of Appeals in 1919 well this kind of evidence is not admissible as going to character because we don't care about character. 
    But that is why neither Smallwood against the Warden nor the majority here said this means that the evidence is inadmissible for other purposes. 
    For other purposes it is clearly admissible. 
    Of those grounds, I want to thank the Court for giving me the extra time. 
    Thank you.
