    Mr. Willard J. Lassers 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    At the habeas corpus hearing before Judge Perry, the -- we produced evidence regarding a pair of jockey shorts. 
    These shorts were originally introduced with the 1956 trial and at that time it was evidence from Mr. Litterly that I mentioned yesterday that these shorts have Type A blood on them and there was some out there evidence which we question that that the little girl who was murdered also had Type A blood and these shorts according to the prosecution theory had been worn by the petitioner and had been abandoned by him in his flight.

    She didn't say. 
    It was fudge. 
    It appeared as though she was based at a school record tied in with the child's weight. 
    But she made the statement that she had a Type A blood and that's all the evidence there was at the trial as to the little girl's blood type.

    Yes, we made various inquiries at the hospital and so forth. 
    They turned up some slips which showed Type A blood but the exact timing and dates and it was very confused. 
    We couldn't establish it either way.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="150.060" stopTime="154.862">

    Mr. Willard J. Lassers

    Mr. Willard J. Lassers 
    That is -- it's my understanding that that is correct, Mr. Chief Justice. 
    Now, at the District Court hearing, for the first time, Judge Perry permitted us to have a scientific examination made of the shorts and at that time, we produced evidence showing that the shorts were saturated not with blood but they were saturated with paint. 
    Now, we've actually brought up the shorts up here, they look terrible Your Honors and they -- all what you see here is paint and not blood.

    That is a disputed fact. 
    Now, our chemist testified that he could find no evidence of blood. 
    He made this test in December of '63. 
    Now, there was testimony back in '56 by the state witness Litterly that he found blood on the shorts. 
    But our man couldn't find any in '63.

    Mr. Willard J. Lassers 
    They have not challenged that.

    Is there any question amongst as to where these pants were in '56 to '63?
speaker="willard_j_lassers" startTime="464.606" stopTime="527.532">
    Mr. Willard J. Lassers 
    They were in the hands of the prosecution up to the time of the trial and then they were in the -- I believe in the possession of the trial court. 
    I'm not certain of that. 
    And then they were transmitted to the Supreme Court of Illinois and we got them into the hands of the District Court from the Supreme Court of Illinois and then they went to the Court of Appeals and then they came to this Court. 
    Now, the -- there are two other errors Your Honors that we feel are critical here. 
    One relates to the state's star witness, Betty Baldwin who is now Betty Baldwin-Curry who testified that on the night of the murder that this -- that the petitioner admitted the crime to her in the course of a taxi ride, he was a taxi driver and in 1963, before Judge Perry, she recanted her testimony and denied that she had ever -- that he had ever made such a statement to her.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="527.532" stopTime="533.173">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Did his confession make any reference to having admitted the crime to her?
speaker="willard_j_lassers" startTime="533.173" stopTime="535.384">
    Mr. Willard J. Lassers 
    I don't -- no, I don't believe it did.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="535.384" stopTime="537.219">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    I thought it had.
speaker="willard_j_lassers" startTime="537.219" stopTime="597.921">
    Mr. Willard J. Lassers 
    It did? 
    Mr. Rosenfield says that it does make such a reference. 
    Now, at the '63 trial, again by discovery, we learned for the first time of a statement in the prosecution files given by this woman very shortly after the crime. 
    At the '56 trial, she was asked how long she had known the petitioner and her answer was two years. 
    And at the 19 -- and the statement that she gave to the prosecution right after the crime was that she had known him for five weeks. 
    Now, that was first learned by us in 1963. 
    Then there was a whole long list of other facts known to the prosecution prior to the ‘56 trial which cast serious doubt on the reliability and trustworthiness of this witness.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="597.921" stopTime="604.459">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    What was the time relevance here or importance of the length of time she had known him?
speaker="willard_j_lassers" startTime="604.459" stopTime="717.065">
    Mr. Willard J. Lassers 
    Because if she had known him for two years, Mr. Justice Black then if she conveyed the impression -- conveyed the impression to the jury that it was the -- that there was the kind of relationship between them that if he had committed a crime that he would admit it to her whereas if it was only five weeks, it would be less likely that he would make such an admission to somebody that he had just knew very briefly. 
    Now, the -- my time has expired, Your Honors and I want to save some time for rebuttal. 
    We're not going to -- because I have mentioned that I don't want the Court of Appeals that we think that they're unimportant but there were serious questions with regard to being cut off in the examination of a key defense witness Mrs. Alice Baxter who is the landlady. 
    And the landlady came up to the 1963 trial and said that he was in his room in her house at the time that the crime took place. 
    In '56, before the trial, the defense counsel tried to interview this witness. 
    She spoke to him once or twice and then the -- then she called the prosecution and the prosecution told her that she has a constitutional right not to talk to the defense counsel and then she refused to talk to him any further. 
    So she was listed as a prosecution witness in 1956. 
    She was not called by the defense in '63, as I said, she came forward and she said that he was in her house at the time of crime.

    Mr. Willard J. Lassers 
    I intended to deal with that Your Honor but my time is going down except for the fact that there was a lie about the hair plus the fact that the prosecution told -- he asked to see his parents and the police told him, “You can't see your parents. 
    Your parents don't want to have anything more to do with you.”

    Mr. Willard J. Lassers 
    Oh! 
    No, no. 
    The defense counsel would refuse to say that she was unreliable.

   Argument of Maurice Rosenfield
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1202.529" stopTime="1212.695">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Rosenfield.
speaker="maurice_rosenfield" startTime="1212.695" stopTime="1240.481">
    Mr. Maurice Rosenfield 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    I appear here on behalf of two amici, the American Civil Liberties Union, Illinois Division and the Chicago Radio Station, WAIT. 
    The amici are here because they believe of what is said to be a ghost which stalks the legal system.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1240.481" stopTime="1242.002">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Ghost of what?
speaker="maurice_rosenfield" startTime="1242.002" stopTime="1319.760">
    Mr. Maurice Rosenfield 
    What is said to be a ghost, which stalks the legal system, the possibility of sentencing an innocent man to death has come to life in this case. 
    We believe it has come to life in this case. 
    We argue that police and prosecutor indecency measured by due process standards, concealed the innocence of this accused, petitioner here. 
    The controlling case is Brady against Maryland. 
    And the crucial point is the suppression of an official report of the State Bureau of Criminal Identification and Investigation to the effect that here, found in the vagina of a victim was not that of the accused. 
    The crucial point is that this report was suppressed for eight years. 
    It was known to the prosecution. 
    It was sent to the prosecution. 
    The prosecutors admitted the habeas corpus hearing that they knew about it. 
    The report was never disclosed. 
    It was brought to life for the first time in the habeas corpus proceeding in the federal court.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1319.760" stopTime="1333.388">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Was there any evidence adduced by the prosecution at the trial to the effect that this hair was from the body of the defendant?
speaker="maurice_rosenfield" startTime="1333.388" stopTime="1336.375">
    Mr. Maurice Rosenfield 
    Hairs were not admitted at the trial at all. 
    Nothing --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1336.375" stopTime="1338.033">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    There is no evidence at all --

    No evidence at the trial at all on hairs.

    Mr. Maurice Rosenfield 
    All we know.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1342.505" stopTime="1345.379">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    This man was convicted without any evidence at all --
speaker="maurice_rosenfield" startTime="1345.379" stopTime="1345.854">
    Mr. Maurice Rosenfield 
    About the hair.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1345.854" stopTime="1346.723">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    - one way or the other --
speaker="maurice_rosenfield" startTime="1346.723" stopTime="1346.957">
    Mr. Maurice Rosenfield 
    One way or the other --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="1346.957" stopTime="1348.674">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    -- that the hair is from his body?
speaker="maurice_rosenfield" startTime="1348.674" stopTime="1417.218">
    Mr. Maurice Rosenfield 
    Crucial point. 
    The point I'm making is that the official report of the state -- Criminal Investigation Department was exonerated, totally exonerated. 
    It's impossible for the mind to conceive of any explanation for that hair of being in the vagina of the victim, other than it was a hair of the attacker. 
    And this, we are told by recognized police manuals, all of the police manuals, happens frequently in rape and sex cases. 
    In fact, the cardinal principle in the investigation of such cases according to the police manuals is to search for hairs. 
    That was done. 
    Now, the fact that it was in the vagina, stands admitted on this record by the Attorney General of Illinois. 
    No question has been raised about that, no one has ever raised that question. 
    And the critical point is the suppression of the report which is not an inference, that's null and that's admitted. 
    The report was never disclosed.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1417.218" stopTime="1421.383">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Is there any question as to whether this was a pubic hair or not?
speaker="maurice_rosenfield" startTime="1421.383" stopTime="1458.087">
    Mr. Maurice Rosenfield 
    We know for comparative purposes, Mr. Chief Justice that a pubic hair was taken from the accused. 
    The nature of the hair in the child's vagina is not exactly known. 
    Inference, I would think that it is pubic because the hair, the forensic medicine books tell us that hairs have different characteristics from the different parts of the body but I can't say that there's anything in the record. 
    All we know that it was a hair, the probability is that it was a pubic hair in the vagina of an eight-year-old child. 
    Now the --
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="1458.087" stopTime="1466.765">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Your -- your position is a little different in that, isn't it? 
    That is to say that there was a written report by --
speaker="maurice_rosenfield" startTime="1466.765" stopTime="1467.160">
    Mr. Maurice Rosenfield 
    There was a written report.

    -- by a state scientist --

    Mr. Maurice Rosenfield

    Justice Abe Fortas

    Mr. Maurice Rosenfield

speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="1536.544" stopTime="1544.115">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    And the state -- the state scientist who examined this so reported.

    Mr. Maurice Rosenfield 
    So reported.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="1545.082" stopTime="1554.152">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    And that his written report so stated that it was in the possession of the prosecution before trial and at the time of trial, is that right?
speaker="maurice_rosenfield" startTime="1554.152" stopTime="1564.652">
    Mr. Maurice Rosenfield 
    It was sent to the prosecution. 
    It was in the hands of the prosecution, the facts that were known to the prosecution and that is what I meant to be saying is the report that was suppressed.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="1564.652" stopTime="1586.461">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Now, did the -- yes, I see. 
    The hair that was in this plastic container or rather in the vaginal smear, was that identified as a pubic hair in the written report?
speaker="maurice_rosenfield" startTime="1586.461" stopTime="1620.791">
    Mr. Maurice Rosenfield 
    That was -- the hair in the container was not identified in the report as a pubic hair. 
    In answer to Mr. Chief Justice Warren a moment ago, I said that I thought the probability was high that it was a pubic hair because pubic hairs are known to have different characteristics from hairs of -- from other parts of the body. 
    However, the report does not say that. 
    It does state that the hair of the accused which was compared was a pubic hair and therefore it was found to be a mismatch.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="1620.791" stopTime="1644.012">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    And your point, very simply stated is that whatever the inference may or may not be that this is relevant and of great importance as part of the trial and that the prosecution had a duty to advice a defense in its existence.

    Did he testify at that time that the police told him they had found the hair that matched with his?
speaker="maurice_rosenfield" startTime="1718.809" stopTime="1772.555">
    Mr. Maurice Rosenfield 
    He testified at that time and the episode is somewhat garbled. 
    No one paid much attention to it because it was never known until eight years later in a habeas corpus proceeding that the state report existed, exonerating report existed. 
    At that time, he testified that somewhere during the 52 hours of detention, he was somehow told that hair has incriminated him. 
    That's all it appears that that hair is somehow incriminated him. 
    It does not appear that it was told that a hair was in the child's vagina. 
    He was simply told that the hair has incriminated him. 
    He asked, he jumped to the microscope himself and said let me look and “them hairs don't match”. 
    This is his testimony at the trial in the trial record and it's all we know about the hair episode.

    When -- I might say this Mr. Chief Justice, when the accused counsel were permitted to look at the state's evidence, there were hair, hairs were among the evidence exhibited to them but no -- not the report just for hairs as evidence that the state would rely upon, so as counsel would be jumped or they form the opinion if the hairs were somehow favorable to the state.

speaker="maurice_rosenfield" startTime="1956.937" stopTime="1973.956">
    Mr. Maurice Rosenfield 
    It was out of the presence of the jury. 
    It was at the hearing on the admissibility of the confession in which he was recounting chronologically what happened to him during the 52-hour incommunicado detention period. 
    Now, the treatment of this point --
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="1973.956" stopTime="1980.088">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Does the record show whether the hairs themselves were in the Courtroom on the occasion of that testimony?
speaker="maurice_rosenfield" startTime="1980.088" stopTime="1985.667">
    Mr. Maurice Rosenfield 
    It does not show. 
    The report certainly was not, the exonerating report.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="1985.667" stopTime="1996.718">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    And that I gather when -- after the confession was admitted, the state as part of its case, I think you've already told us, offered no hairs as exhibit.
speaker="maurice_rosenfield" startTime="1996.718" stopTime="2117.672">
    Mr. Maurice Rosenfield 
    They offered no hairs as part of their case. 
    Now, the Attorney General in response to all of these about the hair offers two points. 
    One point is a formal one that no request was made by the accused counsel of -- for the evidence we claim was suppressed. 
    This, we are submitting to Your Honors, that the Brady against Maryland cannot be read as requiring such a request and we have cited the case, U.S. versus Wilkins decided by Judge Thurgood Marshall which reviews all the authorities on this. 
    Incidentally, this point was very similar to the point that bothered the Court before the Jencks case. 
    It was very much the same point that a report was available to contradict and the question was raised and the point was made in Mr. Justice Brennan's opinion in the Jencks case that how could anyone be expected to know the contents of report they hadn't seen. 
    The other point that the Attorney General makes is that the accused himself somehow knew because of this colloquy that took place during the 52-hour detention period. 
    Note, the Attorney General is in the awkward position of claiming that the accused -- a statement they made to the accused that hairs matched is to be treated as fulfillment of their obligation under the Constitution to disclose that the hairs did not match. 
    Now, there was no disclosure at all that the hair within the child's vagina didn't match the accused hair. 
    There was simply some general garble conversation during this long detention period about hairs.

    Mr. Maurice Rosenfield 
    Never so identified, Mr. Justice Brennan, that's just what I'm saying yes sir. 
    Now, an electrocution for this man was averted six hours before it was to occur only as a result of the intervention of the United States District Court in the habeas corpus case. 
    The District Court reached the correct result perhaps for wrong reasons.

   Argument of Richard A. Michael
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2186.436" stopTime="2192.883">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Michael.
speaker="richard_a_michael" startTime="2192.883" stopTime="2302.664">
    Mr. Richard A. Michael 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    The contentions of the petitioner in this case can be basically summarized into two broad categories, one, the lack of access to certain information, and secondly, the validity of the admission of his confession at the trial. 
    Concerning first, the issue of the defense's access to information perhaps their most significant issue is that of the finding of the hair. 
    Now, with respect to this issue, it is important to first determine what was revealed and what was not revealed. 
    At the District Court, when the petitioner testified, he testified that when in those same proceedings he had heard the state's attorney testify as to the result of this examination. 
    This was the first he had ever heard about that hair. 
    However, this conclusion is cast into doubt by his testimony at the trial itself. 
    Now, I'm talking about the chambers testimony that he gave when the question of his -- the admissibility of his confession first arose for the determination by the Court before it was submitted to the jury. 
    At that time, he testified that in effect he testified, “They took some pubic hairs from me. 
    They told me that another hair that it matched with. 
    I demand to look in the comparative microscope. 
    I looked, and I said those hairs don't match. 
    I'm just using the exact language with --

    They're not my hairs.” 
    And the state had this report from its own laboratory to the effect that they did not match. 
    Do you not think there was an obligation on the state to disclose the fact that it did have such a report and that it was consistent with what the defendant said?

    Mr. Richard A. Michael 
    Your Honor, I submit that on the basis of this record, the duty to disclose is not present for three reasons.

    He was told, according to the petitioner's testimony that a hair was found in the vagina of the victim that it matched his -- I beg your pardon that his were taken for comparison purposes and a comparison was going to be made.

    The defense could've made a motion for -- the defense knew Your Honor that there was a hair found in the vagina of the victim.

    They never -- they had enough information Your Honor in closing argument and nothing else had been done to make -- to argue in closing argument to say, “Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, the state knew that there was hair found in the vagina of the victim.” 
    The state took, mere comparison with the defendant's and they never introduced that at trial, except the information was totally in the hands of the defense, the inference can be drawn that that -- I beg your pardon Your Honor, the prosecution.

    Mr. Michael, may I ask you questions? 
    Suppose that the report, I'm trying to get the state's position now, suppose at the written report in the hands of the state were to the effect that the -- in the smear, there was found a hair, that is a pubic hair, you think that it was found in the little girl, and that the pubic hair that was found there did not match the pubic hair of the defendant. 
    Let's suppose in other words that these were -- this sort of overwhelmingly exonerating report. 
    In your -- in the state's position, would the state be obligated to disclose that to the defense? 
    I think perhaps from my point of view that may be close to the knob of our problem.
speaker="richard_a_michael" startTime="3167.561" stopTime="3245.289">
    Mr. Richard A. Michael 
    Your Honor, we of course start with the -- with your proposition with Brady versus Maryland holds that evidence favorable to an accused relevant material to the evidence of either guilt or punishment in the hands of the -- on request, must be revealed. 
    We start with that as our basic proposition. 
    So then we ask on applying that proposition to the facts of the -- if I may, to the facts of this case first. 
    We submit that first there was really no nondisclosure. 
    We submit that he knew the hair was found in the vagina of the victim. 
    We knew that his were being taken for comparison purposes. 
    We know that he stated on the record that those hairs did not match him that that was never denied. 
    As thus interpreted, he knew the hair was found. 
    He knew what comparison was made. 
    He knew that they didn't matched, if we can put any credence in his own ability to compare, and I don't know enough about the hair examination to know that if a layman looks in that he can see whether it's obvious that hairs match or do not match. 
    But nevertheless, he admittedly denied it, immediately upon looking on it, immediately denied it and that denial was never denied.

    Justice Abe Fortas 
    I know but maybe there are some limits to looking upon a capital case which the state demands a man's life and there are some limits to looking upon it as solely upon test of wits and abilities.

    Do you think that the state would be justified as a constitutional matter in not volunteering that information?
speaker="richard_a_michael" startTime="3306.464" stopTime="3377.554">
    Mr. Richard A. Michael 
    I would assume, Your Honor that if one, you can see the materiality of this testimony. 
    Now, I must add in answering this question that both the District Court and the Court of Appeals based their decision on this point upon, the question of materiality of the evidence. 
    The District Court stated the hair found in the vagina of the victim was of not consequence and did not prejudice the petitioner's case. 
    The Court of Appeals stated, there is absolutely no evidence in the record to show that that hair was in the vagina was of the perpetrator of the crime, and they further held that on the basis of the damaged condition of the body, it could've been deposited by anybody who had examined the body or anybody who had handled the body since the crime. 
    That was the conclusion of the Court of Appeals, Your Honor. 
    So, but if we assume the materiality of the evidence, if we assume a proper request was made as envisioned by Brady versus Maryland, I then ask you that that information would have to be divulged, yes sir.

    Mr. Maurice Rosenfield 
    I assume that they -- the only way I can answer that question Your Honor is that they were given the right to view all the physical evidence in the case. 
    He made that motion. 
    They were allowed to go in. 
    They were allowed to view all the physical evidence in the case. 
    Now, they could've based -- the hair was seen of record that they saw the hairs when they made that view. 
    A motion -- in addition of the fact, that the defense knew that the hair was found in the vagina of the victim, knew that hair of petitioner was taken for comparison purposes. 
    I do not submit that it is too great a burden on the prosecution -- on the defense.

    He stated it, he didn't state whether it was in vial or how it was.

    Mr. Richard A. Michael 
    The Court does not. 
    The -- in the Court the state's attorney was asked why he opposed that motion, and he testified Your Honor that he opposed it because they -- he could not be assured. 
    He was not assured that the evidence would not be -- the chain of evidence would not be some way destroyed by the tests that were going to be taken. 
    That is why he opposed it, the reason -- the ruling of the judge, however, is not in the record. 
    The reason or the ruling of the judge is not in the record, Your Honor. 
    We turn then Your Honors to the question of the bloody shorts. 
    Now, the chemist for the state literally testified at the trial -- testified at the trial that the shorts did contain blood. 
    And the state's attorney also testified -- stated in argument referred to these shorts as bloody shorts.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    May I ask before you get to the District Court.

    Mr. Richard A. Michael 
    I do not think the record indicated that he pointed to any spot, Your Honor.

    Mr. Richard A. Michael 
    No statement was made to the jury Your Honor, as far as I know that there was any paint on these. 
    There was then therefore, the jury would, I assume allow to draw the inference that all the spots were those of blood. 
    On the other hand, I do not think any direct statement was made any given spot or all spots were blood.

    Mr. Richard A. Michael 
    As far as I know Your Honor, in the District Court they did make a scientific examination of all the evidence. 
    One Martin, a chemist employed by the petitioner here, took 12 strands at out of the more heavily stained areas of that garment, 12 fibers. 
    He examined those 12 fibers, each out of one of the heavily stained areas. 
    His testimony was that ten of the fibers contained paint. 
    One of the fibers are kind of a carbon substance and one of the fibers an unidentified substance.

    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Mr. Michael, when the shorts were introduced at the trial, did the defense make a motion at that time that they be permitted to have a scientific examination of it?
speaker="richard_a_michael" startTime="4038.294" stopTime="4044.813">
    Mr. Richard A. Michael 
    As far as I know Your Honor, and I think this is correct, the only motion from the scientific examination was the one that we have referred to with respect to --
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="4044.813" stopTime="4082.469">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Alright, now try to get at the theory of this case. 
    Suppose at the trial, the state offers the shorts and testimony is to be offered or is being or has been offered to the effect that those are blood stains. 
    The defense then moves in an appropriate way to be given the opportunity to have a scientific examination of the shorts. 
    In Illinois law, what would happen?

    Mr. Richard A. Michael 
    Generally speaking, I would submit that it would be granted, Your Honor. 
    The general rule under Illinois law is that, it was enunciated by the Court by the way in reviewing this case, is that there is a qualified -- red-light lining to the discretion of the Court to allow the defense to make scientific evidence of the --
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="4101.832" stopTime="4110.216">

    Mr. Richard A. Michael 
    Yes sir.

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    -- where he said he put it.
speaker="richard_a_michael" startTime="5298.117" stopTime="5320.695">
    Mr. Richard A. Michael 
    Yes, Your Honor. 
    We turn then Your Honors --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="5320.695" stopTime="5329.606">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Now, did -- is -- which is true, that they did find this thing after the confession or before?
speaker="richard_a_michael" startTime="5329.606" stopTime="5332.571">
    Mr. Richard A. Michael 
    My understanding of the record is that they found it before the confession, Your Honor.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="5332.571" stopTime="5341.257">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    And that this, while it might not have been with intention to deceive, but was, untrue?
speaker="richard_a_michael" startTime="5341.257" stopTime="5355.214">
    Mr. Richard A. Michael 
    If that is -- as I read that, Your Honor, I am not absolutely clear just what the meaning of it. 
    If you interpret that as saying that we took his -- what he told us and went out and there we found it then it would be untrue, yes Your Honor.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="5355.214" stopTime="5362.158">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Yes.
speaker="richard_a_michael" startTime="5362.158" stopTime="5455.295">
    Mr. Richard A. Michael 
    We turn then to the question of the advice to Mrs. Baxter that she had a right not to talk to the defense in this case. 
    Now, Mrs. Baxter testified at the pardon and parole proceedings that she had been receiving many calls and was being bothered by the defense attorney and she was, in her words, perturbed. 
    She called up the state's attorney and asked what the situation was. 
    He told her in effect that, “You have a right not to talk to the defense if you want to.” 
    This is corroborated by his own testimony at the District Court where he testified that he told other witnesses amongst her that by request that they had a right not to talk to the defense and they must make up their own mind whether they wanted to or not. 
    Now, we submit that this statement is absolutely correct. 
    Absent a subpoena to some particular hearing, every private individual has a right not only to talk not to the defense, but not to talk to the prosecution, absent an appropriate subpoena. 
    We submit that there was absolutely no violation of any rights in respect to that statement.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="5455.295" stopTime="5478.306">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    I was wondering about her testimony when it was offered and when the Court was asked for permission to permit her testimony as a court witness. 
    The prosecution said they would consent to it only if her unreliability was conceded. 
    Now, why would that -- is that a normal thing?
speaker="richard_a_michael" startTime="5478.306" stopTime="5521.480">
    Mr. Richard A. Michael 
    Let me correct that statement. 
    Just -- my understanding, Your Honor is with that the Court said that rather than the prosecution. 
    The Court said, “If you will state to me that she is unreliable in some way, I will allow you to call her as a court's witness. 
    If you do not so state then I will give you great latitude in asking leading questions and various examinations you want, but I will not call her as a court witness.” 
    They then refused that offer -- they refused the Court's offer to have called her and have this great leeway in question -- with respect to leading questions. 
    I assume they testified because they did not want to be bound by the testimony of someone whom they did not know who was going to testify.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="5521.480" stopTime="5537.317">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Is that a test of whether a person -- the defendant should be entitled to call a witness as the Court's witness that he must admit that there's some unreliability?
speaker="richard_a_michael" startTime="5537.317" stopTime="5641.569">
    Mr. Richard A. Michael 
    I think it is -- the question is pretty much within the discretion of the Court, Your Honor. 
    And I don't think it's subject to review for abuse in the same way as the scientific evidence was as I referred earlier to the question of Mr. Justice Fortas. 
    I think that if the Court -- if you can show some reason to the Court why he should be called as the Court's witness, that he pretty well usually is. 
    The Court, in exercise of its discretion in this case, merely believed that they had not shown sufficient grounds to exercise his discretion in that regard. 
    We turn then to the question of the unreliable witness, Betty Baldwin, not Betty Baldwin-Curry. 
    The prosecution -- the petitioner in this case contends that the prosecution was in error for calling that witness when they knew that she was unreliable. 
    We submit, Your Honors, that there is absolutely no constitutional requirement that prohibits the calling of a witness, who in the past has not been believed if, and this is the big if, they do believe her testimony on this occasion. 
    Now, on this occasion, the evidence is rather complete that at least two people so testified that they fully believed her on this occasion. 
    On that basis, they called her and we believe that it is a proper to call a witness whose testimony you believe even though at some past occasion you may not have believed this witness' testimony.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="5641.569" stopTime="5655.204">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Which one would they believe? 
    Which part of her testimony would they believe, for in the Court, she said she had known him for two years and prior to that time she had told the police that she knew him for five weeks?
speaker="richard_a_michael" startTime="5655.204" stopTime="5710.081">
    Mr. Richard A. Michael 
    Well, there is another factor in that regard, Your Honor. 
    When -- if the she had told the police that she knew him at the time of the crime for five weeks. 
    Now, this question was asked at the trial which was ten months after the crime. 
    How long have you known him, not how long had you known him Your Honor, not how long had you known him at the time of the crime, but how long have you known him, which means from the present past. 
    And I submit, Your Honor, that the correct answer to that would have been 11 months, because she had known him at the time that question was asked for 11 months. 
    Now, I submit Your Honor, that to allow that to go unrefuted is absolutely immaterial. 
    There is no materiality at all in this record to the significance of whether that she had known him 11 months or two years. 
    The defendant states there is some materiality --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="5710.081" stopTime="5717.752">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Do you have the citation to that, but don't take the time to look. 
    If you don't know, don't bother.
speaker="richard_a_michael" startTime="5717.752" stopTime="5720.185">
    Mr. Richard A. Michael 
    You mean as to the -- where as to the formal questioned asked?
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="5720.185" stopTime="5722.531">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    As to whether they said, “How long have you known him?”
speaker="richard_a_michael" startTime="5722.531" stopTime="5790.831">
    Mr. Richard A. Michael 
    Yes I have it right here, Your Honor, it's in Volume 2, -- Volume 2 page 702 at the top of the page. 
    At the very top of the page, Your Honor, it refers “Do you know the defendant Lloyd Eldon Miller?” 
    She said, “Yes sir.” 
    “How long have you known him?” 
    “Approximately two years.” 
    The principle -- there is concluding that thought Your Honor also if there's a contention under Napue versus Illinois that they allowed knowing testimony to go in the record as they did not contradict that statement. 
    There is absolutely no evidence in this record that they were aware of the statement was made. 
    Now, there was the fact that that statement had been made to the prosecution, but there was no evidence that they had gone down that statement and checked every one of her answers against them, I'm sure they knew it in substance. 
    But this was such a, I submit, immaterial point that they probably didn't even realize that she was violating the statement that they had given, or at least there's no evidence in the record that they had, Your Honor.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="5790.831" stopTime="5853.661">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Michael, may I ask you concerning this witness if it is the fact that they have concluded before this proceeding that this witness had made a false accusation against another person for a crime that she said he had confessed to her but was not true. 
    And then also that she had made another one which was under investigation and which the experts found that it was inconclusive but they believed that she was not telling the truth and that the county authorities who prosecuted this case suggested that they discontinue the investigation of the truth of that statement until this case was tried so she could be a witness here.
speaker="richard_a_michael" startTime="5853.661" stopTime="5899.048">
    Mr. Richard A. Michael 
    Your Honor, what you say is very -- is in substance. 
    Now, I know of only one prior occasion that she had made a story about another crime that was this narcotics story. 
    With respect to that statement, she was given a lie detector test to check whether it was right. 
    The result was inconclusive. 
    They said that they found -- they did not believe her, although the test was inconclusive and that they were going to drop the matter. 
    The only other instance that I can think of which talks to their -- to the unreliability relates to the statement that Mr. Malmgren, the attorney for the petitioner had tried to coerce this witness. 
    Now, as far as I read the record in this case, those claims have never been disproving, Your Honor.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="5899.048" stopTime="5920.986">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    I understood that there was an investigation of that, and the authorities indicated that they thought that was not true, but the people who prosecuted this case suggested that the investigation be discontinued until after the trial of this case.
speaker="richard_a_michael" startTime="5920.986" stopTime="5970.817">
    Mr. Richard A. Michael 
    That was -- the statement that they believe was not true of hers related to the narcotics story, Your Honor. 
    There was no evidence one way or another whether they believed the story with respect to the Attorney Malmgren. 
    However, they did -- the statement -- the prosecution did say, “Let's not get that question out of this case so there'll be no question of prejudice,” you know, to the defendant by the fact that his attorney made the some question of improper statements to a prosecution witness. 
    So that was how it all advanced and was either the last statement in the record on that Your Honor is that it either still pending or is been dismissed. 
    I assume it has been dismissed, but there has never been a hearing on it. 
    It has never been proved conclusively one way or another whether that allegation was correct or not. 
    Thank you, Your Honors.
