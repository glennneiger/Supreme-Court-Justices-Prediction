    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Number 164, Ayako Honda et al., Petitioner, versus Nicholas deB. Katzenbach, Attorney General of the United States.

    Mr. Joseph L.rauh, Jr. 
    May it please the Court. 
    Petitioners are 4100 Japanese-American death claimants under the Trading with the Enemy Act who held Yen deposit certificates in the California branch of the Yokohama Specie Bank on the December 7, 1941. 
    On December 7th, after the Japanese attacked, the Government seized and ultimately liquidated all the assets of that bank in this country and there is about $10 million there as a result of the seizure and liquidation. 
    During the war, the class of people who are the claimants here were relocated out of this western states and that history needs no repetition here. 
    After the war, following this Court's decision in Markham v. Cabell, the statute was amended to permit debt claimants to sue under the Trading with the Enemy Act against the assets which have been seized and liquidated and were there. 
    Two years following 1946, 7500 claimants were filed by the deposit holders in the California branch of the Yokohama Specie Bank. 
    So by 1948 or 1949, the Government was ready to act. 
    For the next decade, just elapsed while the Government was trying to figure out whether what rate to pay.

    Or for themselves or their relatives save, that have been either way. 
    But there was a history in the trial examiner found that many people have been paid in dollars in this country. 
    Anyway, after the trial examiner held that you got your money back in dollars at the prewar rate and that he was overruled by justice and they said, the post war rate, they wrote a letter that everyone of these 7500 and they said, Your claim is perfectly good but all you can get is the post war rate which is one-ninetieth, and they made this representation on page 6 of the record in this letter they wrote. 
    We must pay you only one-ninetieth because that's the rule of law under Deutsche Bank. 
    We have to just give you one-ninetieth. 
    So for a man who have a $100 Mr. Justice Stewart, the man who have a $100 that he put in, the Government in that letter offered him under the word must that that's all they were legally authorized to do $1.18 plus interest.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    I have to study the briefs to say that (Voice Overlap) --
speaker="joseph_lrauh_jr" startTime="392.048" stopTime="560.843">
    Mr. Joseph L.rauh, Jr. 
    I think there is and I think the Government does not challenge that. 
    Well, this letter of 1958 is a -- well, if I may use the expression as a lulu. 
    They say you can have one-ninetieth of what you put in. 
    But you can't even have that unless you file your original deposit certificate and then they say, Look, wouldn't you fellows be better off if you went to Japan and took the 2% or less, it's slightly under 2%. 
    The Government was more anxious even though it was a trustee of these funds to get rid of the claims, not to pay them. 
    So only 1800 out of the 7500 send in their money, their certificates, 1600 went to Japan through the withdrawal route and the 4100 that we represent here this morning in these class suit waived that they did nothing. 
    Why? 
    Most of them didn't have lawyers. 
    Most of them have language difficulties. 
    The class of a certificate might be as much as one of the small claims, 17 years of delay and they were discouraged and they finally decided to wait and get whatever they could waiting. 
    Nothing again happened for three years. 
    Then that final schedule comes up and the final schedule doesn't have the 4100 on it because they haven't sent in the certificate of deposit. 
    The 1800 who had sent in their certificates of deposit were on the final schedule and they brought suit, that was the Abe case. 
    While the Abe case was pending, Your Honors granted certiorari in 1963 in the Aratani case involving the Sumitomo Bank and the identical question, what is the rate of exchange After Your Honors granted cert, the Government settled. 
    And it settled in Abe for the full face value without interest, or you could put it half of the claim because the interest was about the same as the principle here. 
    They've had settled for 50 times the amount that we were offered, and I would just like to call Your Honors attention to a remarkable statement in the Government's brief, read it on page 182, reading this at the bottom of page 22, reading as follows, The Attorney General did not repudiate his legal position thatpayment at the post war rate was required. 
    I most respectfully suggest when you pay 50 times the post war rate, when you pay the full amount of the pre-war rate without interest, it's a little hard to say that you're not repudiating your legal position that you only have to pay the post war rate.

    We'll pay Mrs. Kendall at the Abe rate. 
    They're not treating the Abe rate as some strange thing. 
    The Abe rate, a settled rate -- well anyway, we went to them after the settlement was made with Abe and said, You know, treat us 4100 the same way that you treated them. 
    You're a trustee of these funds. 
    You've got the money. 
    Give us the same they could -- oh, no! 
    The statute of limitations bars you because you should've sued within 60 days of the final schedule.

    Furthermore, if the Government wants to take care of those two, our class suit as the Government points out contains two of those people.

    Mr. Joseph L.rauh, Jr. 
    We got the notices. 
    Yes, Your Honor. 
    Now, we claim that there are four grounds of estoppel or tolling. 
    Now they overlap a little bit but there are really four separate in fair grounds. 
    The first place is the clearest estoppel. 
    They made a representation of 2%, we -- they said it was a must representation, we can't pay more, we relied on that. 
    We knew we can always get the 2% in Japan. 
    So we didn't send in the certificates. 
    They changed their position. 
    Pay a 100% without interest or 50 times what they give us. 
    Another -- no question but for this wrongful representation, we would have sent it in. 
    The Government's erroneous representation does the whole thing and it's a clear case of estoppel. 
    What's the Government answer to this? 
    They say, You need a misrepresentation and you don't have one here. 
    They're wrong on both counts. 
    Under Burnett and Sterns of the cited cases you don't need a misrepresentation but I don't have to argue that because you do have a misrepresentation. 
    The misrepresentation was a statement that they can only pay 2%. 
    It doesn't have to be willful. 
    The Glus case I respectfully suggest, that the Glus case is not a case of willful misrepresentation because Footnote 2 of Your Honors opinion in Glus says in so many words that the representations were either willful or unintentional.

    Mr. Joseph L.rauh, Jr. 
    It was not a willful misrepresentation Your Honor and I simply suggest that you don't need a willful misrepresentation. 
    A mistake, a wrongful representation is sufficient and that's what we have. 
    Fifth -- as they said, we must only pay a 2% and then they offer a 100% to the others. 
    And the -- really as trustees, they should've offered everybody. 
    That's really what Judge Wright was saying in his dissent below. 
    There was not only estoppel, there was tolling. 
    It was perfectly reasonable for these people to wait while the Abe suit went forward. 
    The Government was on notice. 
    It was -- it's just like Burnett. 
    The Government was on notice in Burnett because it was the wrong venue. 
    The Government was on notice here that these people were making their claims and I don't see that the ones in -- a matter of fact, it's a better case than Burnett and all -- it all -- or let me just suggest why it's better than Burnett. 
    Small claimants mostly without lawyers, reason to expect that they would get the same treatment and finally and most important, that Government has these funds which they took from the bank, they're the trustee of these funds for the deposit holders. 
    That's -- it's -- and I would therefore suggest that it's an easy case after Burnett. 
    Thirdly, we should --

    I don't think the Government ought to treat people worse than the New York Central Railroad. 
    They do a good job of it themselves. 
    The Government's involvement in petitioners delay adds to these things and I can't -- in the limited time available, do any better than explaining exactly why they didn't -- after all these discouragements, they didn't send in there certificates in 1958. 
    It is hardly surprising that most of the claimants failed to send in their original certificates in response to the Government in solving an erroneous suggestion, 17 years after it seizure their rights that they could have no more then and should settle for 2%. 
    What is surprising is that the Government which delayed 20 years before it finally made its indispensable and undefended 2% offer they don't claim it was right. 
    They paid the -- 50 times that should even ask this Court to bar petitioner's admittedly valid claims.

    In a -- if -- and so were the -- in the sense -- in the technical sense that the boys who fought in comrade team 442. 
    Oh yes, Your Honor. 
    The claims are admittedly valid -- no, the Government is not arguing against the validity. 
    What they are saying is that some time despite all their action, despite all the efforts of the -- that were made in the time, despite their delay, they can rely upon the defense of a statute of limitations even though the purpose of the statute of limitation is that there's a stale claim. 
    There's no stale claim here. 
    There's no problem of defense against the stale claim. 
    The claim is admittedly valid so, you have all four of these reasons as a clear estoppel on a representation, as a clear tolling while waiting for this, the Government is involved in this as the claims that are admittedly valid. 
    And I just say there's an overwhelming case of estoppel and tolling. 
    What's the Government's answer to this? 
    Well, that was the point. 
    The Government says as Your Honors said, We're not like the New York Central Railroad. 
    The Government's answer is, Because of sovereign immunity, we don't have to do anything like anybody else does. 
    Tolling and estoppel don't apply to us because of sovereign immunity. 
    Well, this is wrong for three reasons. 
    First, there was a taking. 
    A -- I don't believe that this Court would ever hold that equivocal that when you take a creditor's -- where you take his debtor's assets away, you're not doing anything to him. 
    When they took the assets of the bank away, they took away the chance of collecting the -- on these deposits. 
    But then Congress said, We'll pay you. 
    And Congress did not do this out of some kind of a feeling -- of just benevolence. 
    Congress themselves said, this is the House Report. 
    But for the vesting of their debtors' property, they would presumably have been able to pursue ordinary remedies against the debtors and they gave the debtors these opportunities and there is not one word, and I make this is very, very significant, there's not one word suggesing that they were giving up their sovereign immunity. 
    And I respectfully suggest that they didn't give up their sovereign immunity because they didn't have it to start with. 
    This was sovereign liability because this was property taken. 
    This was property taken from residents here who had -- who at that time were not able to be citizens as Your Honors suggest. 
    Finally, I do not suggest that once a waiver -- I do not suggest that there's one way or another on the final question which is involved in yesterday's case, the Crown Coat case which finished this morning. 
    We don't have to go that far but I don't see any reason why you don't have the -- why -- there should be a rule even in general principles that there isn't a tolling against the Government. 
    I don't see any reason why the Government should suddenly get out of tolling just because it is the Government estoppel and tolling once Congress waives immunity, there's no evidence it wants to waive a little bit and not give them the full benefit of the tolling and the estoppel. 
    Now, I'd like to reserve the remainder of my time and simply suggest that we have here made an overwhelming case on the equitable and estoppel and tolling. 
    The only question that arises whether the Government gets special treatment of getting out of that and I see no reason where a constitutional issue arises or where Congress makes no slightest indication that it wants to bar tolling and indeed itself indicates that we want to do the fair thing and allows tolling in two instances as they're set forth on page 24 of our brief.

    The money goes into the War Claims Fund. 
    It would be no difference, if Your Honor please, if the money went into the general revenues. 
    The money goes to someone else instead of the people who have the deposits in the bank and who Congress said should get it. 
    Congress in 46 said, the deposits in the bank should go -- the assets of the bank liquidated should go to the debt claimants on the bank. 
    It is true that if we don't get it, it goes into the War Claims Fund. 
    It may very well go to some big -- a concern with a claim against Germany or Japan overseas. 
    But if it wasn't Congress' intention that this be done and indeed the Government never made this point until in its briefed now. 
    When we went to the Government and said, You're a trustee of these funds. 
    Give us the same treatment that you gave the Abe holders. 
    The two answers were statute of limitations and administrative convenience.

   Argument of Richard A. Posner
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1475.693" stopTime="1479.485">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Posner.
speaker="richard_a_posner" startTime="1479.485" stopTime="1633.085">
    Mr. Richard A. Posner 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court. 
    We asked for affirmance here on two independent grounds. 
    First, we invoked the settled rule that the Government may not be a estopped by the conduct of its officials to plead limitations as a defense. 
    This is because in a suit against the sovereign, the statute of limitations is jurisdictional and a warrant of jurisdiction may not be waived. 
    Now, there's no constitutional issue in this case, there is no taking. 
    There was a seizure of some of the assets of the debtor, the Yokohama Bank. 
    The Yokohama Bank or its successor bank remained in existence, remained amenable to sue and as Mr. Rauh pointed out, many of these claimants had in fact sought recovery against the bank rather than against the vested property. 
    And now, I will leave further discussion of that broader principle on which we rely to our brief and turn to the narrower ground and that is that even where there's a suit between private parties to which the doctrine of estoppel could properly be applied, there's no factual basis for its invocation here for there was no arbitrariness and no injustice or unfairness in the manner in which the Government process these claims. 
    And before I review the various events which lead up to this suit, I would mention one issue, one fact which seems to us extraneous to the legal issues here although it is -- has been stressed heavily in petitioner's briefs and that is the nationality of these claimants. 
    This suit does not arise from any measure taken by the Government against Japanese-Americans in World War II. 
    Section 34, the trading with the Enemy Act which is the statute in suit here is not a law which relates to any particular national group. 
    It is simply a provision for American creditors, whatever their national background -- of enemy concerns whose property was vested.

    But were they represented by lawyers and that -- have a legal advice available to them?
speaker="richard_a_posner" startTime="1770.351" stopTime="1969.466">
    Mr. Richard A. Posner 
    Well one point is this, in order to bring this class action on behalf of these 4100 claimants, all one needed was a single representative of the class, a single individual and a number of individuals, how many I don't know but at least the named plaintiffs here did have counsel. 
    Now as I will go on to show that even with respect to individuals who didn't have counsel, we believe that the notice that was given by the Government here was all that the statute or that fairness they require, and I'll try to explain that at greater length. 
    Now, I begin with the letter which Mr. Rauh mentioned, which the Alien Property Office sent to all claimants including the petitioners here and where they had counsel -- of record their counsel. 
    In 1959, notify me -- that was the amount that the office was prepared to allow and outlining the procedures of four payment and the judicial remedies that they would have and this letter is printed at pages 6 and at 29 of the record, and the letter made four points. 
    First of all, it reported the ruling of the office that the claims could not be allowed in full because of the post war decline in the value of the Yen. 
    I stressed the letter -- stated what the Department of Justice had decided on this legal question. 
    It did not say that -- it did not represent that in fact a payment could only be made at that rate because it went on to explain that there were judicial remedies for -- of individuals who were not satisfied with the Department's ruling. 
    Now, in this -- the rule in question has been described by petitioners as an arbitrary one in which the Government later repudiated and I -- it maybe helpful to explain briefly what this issue was. 
    These claimants had deposited dollars in the American branches of the Yokohama Bank and had received in exchange certificates, interest bearing, certificates of deposits, six months certificates deposit which recited and recited only that the bank was making a deposit of Yen in its home office in Japan and that the certificate could be repay -- would be repaid in Japan in Yen. 
    Now of course, when these depositors asked for their money back from the Alien Property Office, they were asking for dollars and it was necessary to translate this yen obligation into dollars.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="1969.466" stopTime="1981.227">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Excuse me Mr. Posner. 
    You mean to say that under the certificate of deposit as you understand that repayment could be demanded only in yen?
speaker="richard_a_posner" startTime="1981.227" stopTime="2156.768">
    Mr. Richard A. Posner 
    On the face of the certificate, that is clear. 
    Now -- and it was because the certificate was unequivocal on its face that the Government relied upon the rule of the Deutsche Bank case, opinion by Mr. Justice Holmes which holds that obligations -- which held incidentally in the context of an Alien Property Bank Deposit case arising from World War I, that an obligation payable in foreign currency in a foreign country. 
    In that case, the creditor takes the risk of currency fluctuation right to the day of judgment. 
    Now, it's true that there was a practice of these Japanese banks on the West Coast of repurchasing certificates in dollars. 
    Now, it's a question, a difficult question, whether what the banks were doing was simply accommodating customers or whether in fact the banks practice a very -- the obligation on this certificate and made it an obligation to repay in dollars. 
    This is a closed question -- it has never been authoritatively resolved that I stressed that it's a genuine question, and when the Alien Property Office resolved it in favor of the post war rate, it was not acting arbitrarily, it had a reasonable legal basis for its action. 
    Now, this matter in 1959 went on to inform each claimant that if he desired payment of his claim in the amount allowed, he should submit his original certificates of deposit to the Alien Property Office or if he'd lost or mislead them, an affidavit stating that he had not received payment elsewhere. 
    This also was not an arbitrary requirement. 
    It was not a mere barrier placed in the path of people trying to collect their money because, the area -- the office knew that many of these claimants had sought a recovery directly from the bank in Japan and the office felt that it ought not pay claims that had already been satisfied. 
    Now thirdly, the letter informed each claimant that actual payment of the claim would have to await the compilation of a final schedule which listed all claims and hereto, for -- this is incidentally expressly required by the statute and this toois not an arbitrary requirement far --

    To skip ahead momentarily, when the Government made the settlement with the 60 -- with the 1800 claimants who had submitted their original certificates and we brought a suit against the Alien Property Office challenging this exchange rate. 
    When it did that, it gave them $6 million. 
    It assumed that this was the end of the Yokohama Bank Alien Property account and that the surplus could then be paid over to the War Claims Fund. 
    And one of the purposes of the Alien Property Program is to create a fund to the satisfaction of war claims because the Alien Property -- vested property is the only source of that fund. 
    In other words, there was reliance by the Government on the fact that the settlement with the 1800 wound up the entire account.

    No. 
    Were there no statute of limitations problem, the Government would have offered them the same settlement as those litigants who would sue. 
    The Government here is in the position of a trustee since a purpose of the Alien Property Program is to create a fund for war claimants. 
    The Government does not feel that it ought to waive, if it could waive valid legal defenses against creditors. 
    And the feeling, if the belief was and is that individuals who will adequately and fully apprise of their judicial remedies had failed to bring timely suit were not entitled to participate in the settlement the distinction being one of the most fundamental in the law between those who pressed their rights and those who sleep on their rights.

    That's the problem here and as I understand it, you're saying that the Government did not feel that liberty to waive the statute of limitations so similar that you could -- the Alien Property Custodian didn't feel that way because what it'd be doing then would be in fact taking money from the War Claims Fund and using it for the purposes of paying people who -- my hypothesis did not have a -- strictly go right to it because of their failure to file their claims in time?

    Mr. Richard A. Posner 
    That's correct. 
    And there's an additional answer to that and that is that when the Government settled with the original group of plaintiffs. 
    It was on the understanding that this would wind up the account and leave a surplus for the War Claims Fund. 
    Has the Government not relied on the 60 days statute of limitations as excluding any possibility, any further liability on the account it might not have settled or it might have settled on different terms. 
    And this underlines the practical importance in this situation of having a rigid date, a bar date after which the office can with confidence wind up the account and distribute it among the various beneficiaries.

    Mr. Richard A. Posner 
    Well Your Honors, it's the kind of problem that arises customably in the Government. 
    An example would be a claim under the Social Security Act. 
    If you file a claim with the Social Security Administration and there legal counsel makes a determination that you're not entitled to be paid, they will send you a letter saying, I'm sorry. 
    We can't pay you under our view of the law. 
    Now, then you have 60 days there as here to go into Court and challenge that determination as arbitrary or as unlawful. 
    Now very frequently, when the Government is sued like any litigant, like any defendant act as the matter proceeds through the courts. 
    The Government assesses its chances of victory in terms of offers per settlements that are made and very frequently compromise this case just like other litigants. 
    When it does so like any other litigant, the Government does not necessarily either capitulate, here it didn't capitulate that it paid only half of the -- a man's claimed and nor does it acknowledge that from the very outset it had made an error and acted arbitrarily. 
    As a matter fact --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3661.300" stopTime="3661.934">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Or did the (Voice Overlap) --
speaker="richard_a_posner" startTime="3661.934" stopTime="3664.420">
    Mr. Richard A. Posner 
    -- there is no -- it did not.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3664.420" stopTime="3668.253">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    -- did it make the settle because it thought it had acted arbitrarily?
speaker="richard_a_posner" startTime="3668.253" stopTime="3782.349">
    Mr. Richard A. Posner 
    No, absolutely not. 
    The Government had prevailed in the District Court and the Court of Appeals and on a very technical issue having to do with the rule of -- with the application of the Duetsche Bank opinion. 
    There was room for a court to go either way and the Government felt that while victory wasn't assured for. 
    On the other hand, neither was defeat and therefore did not simply pay these people what they were asking and capitulate. 
    It bargained for a -- what seemed like a fair 50-50 settlement. 
    The Government has never acknowledged and does not acknowledge now that the Alien Property Office was wrong. 
    Let alone arbitrary in its determination that the post war rate had to apply because the certificate on its face said that this was an obligation payable in yen in Japan. 
    It is -- and it is not a case where a misrepresentation was made that it was ever suggested to these individuals that the Government absolutely would not pay except at this low rate. 
    Of course the possibility remained open and it was alluded to in the very first letter that the courts would compel the Government to pay more or that in the event of the -- a judicial attack, the Government as a matter of prudence and good executive management would compromise before a final judgment.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3782.349" stopTime="3841.548">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    But isn't there a difference between this and the instance you raised here, it isn't the question as to whether the claim is just in amount. 
    It's a question of what you should do and must do under the law, and you told these people that you must pay them only 2% as a matter of law. 
    Now, you'd won all the way to say in the lower courts, I didn't know the mere granting of search in the case because the Government do change its positions radically as it did -- we didn't hear when it operates to the -- with the detriments of a lot of other people who are equally entitled to such amount of money.

    Mr. Richard A. Posner 
    Mr. Chief Justice, when we -- when the Government compromise this case after certiorari was granted we didn't -- it was not done because the Government felt that the granting of certiorari was tantamount to a reversal of the decisions below. 
    But because a settlement offer was made and the settlement offer seem reasonable under circumstances but the effect of this settlement --

    Mr. Richard A. Posner 
    No. 
    I think not. 
    I think the fact of compromise is not a repudiation of the litigant's original position. 
    It is not a confession of error nor did the settlement I might add prejudice the individuals here. 
    As far as the legal issues are concern, it seems to me they would be identical if the case had proceeded to a final judgment and they had received their -- all their money. 
    We would still be arguing that the present claims were time barred.

    Your Honors heard the Government concede that most of people didn't have lawyers but the Government counsel suggested that all the name plaintiffs did have lawyers. 
    That's absolutely untrue and I would like to -- Your Honors please to do me the courtesy of looking at the page 16 of the green brief. 
    On page 16 of the green brief, you will see that four names were added as names -- it's the reply brief that four names were added as a plaintiff -- named plaintiffs on page 16 of the green brief and that the Government concedes that the last three did not have counsel at any time.

    Mr. Joseph L.rauh, Jr. 
    Yes, Your Honor. 
    They did and my point about that would be that the counsel as well as the man reasonably thought that the -- there was only one issue here. 
    What would the rate of pay be? 
    This was -- I can say there's -- with a smile on my face I was not in the case at that time. 
    But counsel of -- the counsels were in the case reasonably thought that since there's only one issue. 
    The issue of the rate when that issue was settled its going to apply to everybody. 
    Now I'm afraid Mr. Justice Fortas, I didn't satisfy your question about whether these people, these resident aliens, these Japanese-Americans were protected by the Constitution. 
    I believe they are protected by the Fifth Amendment to due process. 
    I believe that those who were not paroled or interned are treated both by the Constitution and by the statute as to save our citizens and that their rights are protected there, and that this was -- which was a clear taking of the assets underlying their debts which is really had cost the -- the lost of funds, caused the devaluation clearly raises a constitutional provi -- and that constitutional point which is only satisfied by a provision for fair return at the Society International Ray Rogers that there must be a fair procedure for return, I say what happened here was not a fair procedure. 
    Mr. Justice White, you used the word late filers. 
    I just like to point out, we were on time filing. 
    We filed in time. 
    We were treated as such. 
    We simply didn't bring the suit at that time because we thought we would get the same protection that the others got because it was only one issue. 
    As far as the war claims issue is concern Mr. Chief Justice that was never raised until in this Court. 
    The war claims issue is an afterthought, when we asked to be treated the same, they said, No. 
    The statute of limitations bars you and we're not going to go through this. 
    We want to wind up. 
    The war claims is an afterthought brought in here that is irrelevant because the real purpose of the statute was to treat, give the assets.

    Mr. Joseph L.rauh, Jr. 
    At page 5 of our complaint -- at the page of the record of our complaint, we asked if they be paid in the same conversion ratio as the plaintiffs in (Inaudible) v. Kennedy. 
    We did that because of this reason, we felt that the --

    Yes, but you don't speak for all the people who withdrew their claim?

    In Japan? 
    No, Your Honor. 
    There are 1600 people there and I suggested earlier that the Government had mention them and said, isn't too bad about them and why should we paid because of them. 
    And my suggestion was the two of our --we are not, as I've explained to Mr. Justice Stewart, we are not --

    Mr. Joseph L.rauh, Jr. 
    -- making that point but we are saying that the Government really now want to settle this after Your Honors rule if it should be favorable to us. 
    We do have two of our plaintiffs who are in that category --

    But you have -- all the people that in this class you represent would be bound by your representations here, if that -- if we just assume that you won this case and extends the statute of limitations is not far to your suit. 
    Some of your clients discharged you and said, we want our own lawyer and furthermore, we won't be bound by that. 
    If were not -- we're going litigate and if cert is granted again on the Duetsche Bank issue?

    Mr. Joseph L.rauh, Jr. 
    I cannot say on a class suit what would happen. 
    You always has -- Your Honor knows and as it imply, you always have to give notice. 
    If we were to win we go back to the District Court. 
    They'd have to give notice to everyone and if someone were going to complain, I'm not going to say they would. 
    I am of course bound to argue that for the complaint namely that the -- all we are entitled to is the Abe settlement. 
    That's all we sued for. 
    We sued for that because we felt the Government was a trustee of funds they had seized which funds would have paid our deposit holders and which therefore they should now pay to us. 
    We therefore sued for the exact amount because we felt they were the trustee for all the claimants. 
    Thank you.
