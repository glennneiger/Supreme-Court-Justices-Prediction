Cooper v. California

    Number 103, Joe Nathan Cooper, petitioner versus California. 
    Mr. Traynor.

    Mr. Michael Traynor 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    This case is here because of a vital piece of grocery bag that was unconstitutionally seized from the defendant and unconstitutionally used against him at his trial. 
    It presents the issues whether if it is ever only harmless to violate the United States Constitution and whether in fact it was harmless here. 
    Defendant Cooper was prosecuted and convicted for selling two bindles of heroine wrapped in a piece of brown paper bag to a police informer who is both unreliable and untrustworthy. 
    At the trial, the prosecution placed this unconstitutionally seized piece of brown paper in the same exhibit as the two bindles of heroine and the other piece of brown paper within which they have been wrapped. 
    He presented it before to the grand jury. 
    The piece of paper was obtained after the police had set up this controlled narcotic buy. 
    And on the appeal of this case, the Attorney General of the State of California argued to the District Court of Appeals that this unconstitutional evidence was highly relevant. 
    Petitioner was hurt in the trial court by the use of this evidence. 
    He was hurt also in the appellate court by the notion that violation of the constitution can be dismissed as harmless. 
    I think a fair premise from which to start in this case is that prosecutors act rationally. 
    The -- when they bring a prosecution against a man, they don't bring it if they believe he's innocent, they bring it because they believe he's guilty and that he'd be -- and that he deserves a conviction. 
    And in introducing the evidence in that case, they've act on the assumption that that evidence will hurt him. 
    There would be no reason for a prosecutor to bring in evidence in a case unless he felt that it would contribute to the conviction of a man that he assumed to be guilty. 
    Why should an appellate court speculate that this decision of the prosecutor was harmless when the man's constitutional rights were violated not only by the seizure of the evidence but by the use of that evidence at trial.

    Mr. Michael Traynor 
    This Court -- the petitioner here relies on the rule of the coerced confession cases and the many other cases that this Court has decided in which the violation of the constitution has not been considered harmless. 
    For thirty years since Brown against Mississippi, this Court and the federal court in habeas court proceedings with judiciary records of the state courts and convictions obtained on the basis of coerced confessions. 
    Here and in Miranda, this approach is totality of circumstances approach was rejected. 
    The approach that the respondent asks this Court to take here would impose an even more unmanageable burden upon the federal courts and this Court on reviewing the facts in the records in each case. 
    As the Attorney General of the State of California argued in the other case, what this rule requires is an examination of the entire record and the entire case and the evidence in each case. 
    In the coerced confession cases, the issue and the burden of review was limited to the very small issue whether the confession obtained was voluntary. 
    Here, the burden of review would be one of reviewing the entire record. 
    In the coerced confession cases, the totality of circumstances approach which has now been rejected, there was on some cases, a legitimate purpose for going in and for the courts undertaking this burden, mainly, the purpose of helping the prosecution if the confession was voluntary, it often was a crucial piece of evidence and the man would -- and the man's conviction would be sustained. 
    But here by hypothesis of the prosecution, the evidence has no value. 
    They are not seeking the burden -- seeking the court to review the facts of cases to obtain utility of otherwise valid evidence because by their own hypothesis, the evidence is irrelevant. 
    The State's arguments in its brief that the state courts can be expected to honor the Fourth Amendment is contradicted I think by its irresponsible argument that an application of a harmless error doctrine is a question of state law and not federal and cannot be reviewed by this Court or by the state court or by the federal court. 
    It is also contradicted by their attempt to trivialize the Preston case. 
    The Preston case is a crux of this case. 
    There was violation of search and seizure of evidence from an impounded car and the state concedes in its brief that the vehicle forfeiture statute in the State of California did not itself authorize the search. 
    It attempts to argue that the vehicle was in custody under that statute and that therefore the search was legal. 
    These same facts were present in the Preston case. 
    The State's argument is nothing more than attempt to evade and trivialize the Preston rule.

    Mr. Michael Traynor 
    I have not found a case in this Court construing the federal harmless error statute to permit the dismissing the violations of the United States Constitution as harmless. 
    In my review of the history of that legislation, some of which is reproduced in appendix B to my brief suggests that the harmless error federal statute was never intended to apply to violations of the United States constitution. 
    The history is also reviewed in a very helpful case by Justice Rutledge in the Kotteakos case and the conclusion there is that the harmless error statute of Congress was intended to apply to breaches of etiquette or breaches of minor rules of evidence in the trial courts and not to violations of the United States constitution or to violations of important statutes. 
    There was a statute --

speaker="michael_traynor" startTime="553.523" stopTime="585.617">
    Mr. Michael Traynor 
    I'm not sure it held that; I think on the -- in the Kotteakos case, Mr. Justice Black, that the court did review and tried to make a careful review of the record. 
    And there was a dissent on that case by Justice Douglas on the ground that his review of the record, he felt there was -- it was harmless. 
    I believe the court in the Kotteakos case did review the entire proceeding but contrast to that to a case in language they used with a violation they've -- they left aside a question of a violation of a constitutional norm or an important statute.

    Mr. Michael Traynor

speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="631.291" stopTime="690.409">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    I suppose the position might be that there might be something so trivial that they don't amount to violations of the constitution. 
    For example, suppose that the -- something were introduced in evidence that no relationship to the case whatever but somehow got into evidence but it turned out that it was illegally seized. 
    And on theory, that would be a violation of the constitution but it would be so remote from the major thrust of the case that it would be pretty definite to say that a conviction ought to be set aside on that ground by the two ways of praising it perhaps, one is at -- in a particular case then (Inaudible) violation of the constitution and the other that it's harmless error?
speaker="michael_traynor" startTime="690.409" stopTime="692.079">
    Mr. Michael Traynor 
    Mr. Justice Fortas, let me, attempt to answer --
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="692.079" stopTime="712.829">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Well, would you take the -- you really mean that anything -- that if something happens in a case that's in violation of constitutional no matter how remote or unimportant or insignificant or trivial, that automatically it can have a conviction?
speaker="michael_traynor" startTime="712.829" stopTime="771.286">
    Mr. Michael Traynor 
    That's the result to which my argument leads and I would argue for that case and I've so argued in my brief. 
    And let me answer, if I may, in two respects, your question Mr. Justice Fortas. 
    The -- that type of case, I think will be the exception that proves the rule because the rule ordinarily will be that the prosecution's purpose will be to use evidence that will be harmful. 
    But suppose for example, that instead of the brown piece of paper bag in this case that closely resembled the paper in which the bindles had been wrapped; that the police, a week after the man's arrest and without a warrant and not incident to the arrest, and without any danger or other justification for a search had gone to the man's house and taken the kitchen sink. 
    That even in such a case, I would contend that the constitution would require a reversal. 
    That type of example, if such a thing were allowed --
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="771.286" stopTime="774.161">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Well, that really is a kitchen sink position?
speaker="michael_traynor" startTime="774.161" stopTime="798.449">
    Mr. Michael Traynor 
    It would be, yes, Your Honor, would be. 
    The very fact -- the police might be encouraged to do that, to ransack a man's home to obtain such evidence. 
    And the very fact that the prosecutor thought it could get away with such frivolous evidence would reveal to me great reason for requiring a reversal in that case. 
    And I think it is Your Honor (Voice Overlap) the exception that does prove the rule.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="798.449" stopTime="811.486">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Is this position essential for your case without -- can't you win this case on another basis?

    Mr. Michael Traynor 
    Yes, Your Honor I -- the primary and first argument in my brief was that we should win this case on the fact.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="818.440" stopTime="826.332">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    And that even if the harmless error rule is constitutionally permissible, you'd still win?
speaker="michael_traynor" startTime="826.332" stopTime="891.469">
    Mr. Michael Traynor 
    That's right, Your Honor, because an application of that rule denied due process to the defendant in this case. 
    The facts and the reasons why we argue prejudice in this case are that this was an extremely weak circumstantial case against the defendant. 
    If the prosecutor had thought that the observations of the police of this transaction between their unreliable informer and the suspect were sufficient, why did they go out a week after the arrest to search for more evidence and to ransack the car and obtain it? 
    This piece of evidence and I think it's important to note that it was placed in the same exhibit as the two bindles of heroine and the other piece of smaller brown paper that the defendant was charged for selling. 
    There would have been no reason to place it in the same exhibit had not the prosecutor intended the court to draw the inference that the two pieces of brown paper, one that wrapped the bindles of heroine and one that had been unconstitutionally seized, came from the same source, mainly the defendant.

    Now there are a lot of knots in there. 
    But in substance, what he is saying, is that you've got to be sure and this is on 764, you must be sure that the error did not influence the jury or it had but a very slight effect.

    Mister Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    This case as one on the facts then the harmless error rule might as well be dumped and jettisoned specifically and definitely and we'll forget about it. 
    We submit that the error here was harmless whether you apply the California rule or whether you apply the rule announced here in Fahy versus Connecticut. 
    Now if I may, Your Honor, I'd like to touch on a point that Mr. Chief Justice Warren raised, the argument of the preceding case, and that was the suggestion that the state, the Attorney General that argued that this evidence that was illegally obtained or so the District Court of Appeal of California held was both relevant and important. 
    I think, I'd like to clarify that, if I may, Your Honor, at this --

    At point and I turn to page 253 in the record filed in this Court and that includes a portion of the brief filed by the Attorney General of California in the appellate court and this was included at the request of the appellant, Mr. Cooper. 
    You'll note the heading of the argument, its part two of the brief, the whole brief doesn't include it and the heading is this "even assuming the scrap of paper was illegally seized --"

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Yes.
speaker="albert_w_harris_jr" startTime="1408.254" stopTime="1591.957">
    Mr. Albert W. Harris, Jr. 
    And this was an argument made in that court as we're arguing here that the error was not prejudicial assuming there was any error. 
    We raised in the brief and I'd like to touch on that point if I have any time, the argument that the search here was not unconstitutional at all. 
    In fact, it was a constitutional reasonable search and the evidence is admissible but I don't want to get off under that right at the moment. 
    But we argue that it's true below that assuming there was an error, that error was not prejudicial. 
    Now, we did say, turning over to page 254, that the scrap of brown paper was also highly relevant, that's about two thirds all the way down the page. 
    And there we were drawing on an analogy where the decision of the California Supreme Court in People versus Harem. 
    We did not say and -- Your Honor, and I don't think we meant to say any place that this evidence was important in the sense of having great weight in the disposition and decision of the case. 
    We did say it was highly relevant and I stand by that, it was relevant. 
    We don't think it had great weight in effect of the outcome of the case and I think those are compatible positions to please the court. 
    Now, it's argued that the District Attorney puts evidence in. 
    He thinks it's relevant and he thinks it's going to contribute to the conviction. 
    And consequently, who was he to come up here and say that it's not or that it's only a harmless error. 
    Well, that's all right if we're penalizing the District Attorney. 
    But that is not what the appellate court set for, they set to do justice and the constitution of California imposes that duty upon them. 
    Now, there's no question in my mind that the District Attorney believe that this evidence was relevant and he believed it was admissible and he believed it tended to prove guilt, otherwise, he wouldn't have put it in. 
    But that's true in every case; that's true in every case, and the harmless error rule presumes that the evidence will be relevant. 
    If it isn't relevant then what is it doing in the case to start with and in itself would be error to admit it. 
    I think there's no question that if -- that the rule presupposes some degree of relevance; that it does tend to prove guilt. 
    But that's not the complete answer because if it were, then the rule would be reversal and not a careful consideration of the record and the impact of the evidence. 
    Your Honors have made it clear, going back to Kotteakos and even clear as in Fahy versus Connecticut, if you please, that you will not take that approach. 
    The simple approach, if it was received in evidence and relevant than we'll reverse. 
    You didn't do that in Fahy against Connecticut. 
    You didn't do that in Kotteakos which involved a different problem but nevertheless the discussion I think is relevant.

    (Inaudible)
speaker="albert_w_harris_jr" startTime="1628.252" stopTime="1912.290">
    Mr. Albert W. Harris, Jr. 
    The evidence as presented by the people very briefly was like this. 
    An informant had agreed to call Copper, make arrangements to buy heroine. 
    He -- the evidence is that the informant dialed the number, an agent over listening to the call. 
    This was Cooper's telephone number. 
    That is the place that he was residing. 
    A lady answers the phone and the informant asked for Joe and Joe came to the phone. 
    An agent overheard the conversation. 
    He recognized Joe Cooper's voice over the telephone. 
    Informant says "How about a dukes?" 
    And this is the parlance of that particular business. 
    Joe said "All right" 
    And the informant, they said or he said, "Where"? 
    And the informant said "Over at Newels (ph) Market" 
    Now at the same time as the informant for placing this call at the instructions of the police and with the police officer right there hearing it, talking to Cooper, two other agents, supposing a federal agent were out at Cooper's residence across the street and down the block. 
    They observed a man that fit the resemblance of Cooper. 
    They were a couple of blocks away and they couldn't be entirely certain, come out and get into his car, it was a car he customarily drove. 
    Sure enough, he turned out headed towards Newels Market. 
    In the meantime, the officer -- officers who were with the informant and who placed the call took him up near Newels Market. 
    Well, they didn't want to walk up and drop him off in front of the place so they dropped him off a block or two away and one of them followed him and there were two other agents who were staked out in other positions. 
    Now they've -- the purpose here was to keep this informant under continual observation. 
    They had searched him back at the police station. 
    So that they could exclude the possibility that if he returned with heroine, he got it from anybody except Cooper, assuming he did in fact contact Cooper. 
    If they couldn't exclude the possibility that he got it from anyone else, they would not be satisfied Cooper had sold him the heroine. 
    It's not only a matter of evidence for the court ultimately. 
    It's a matter of proving these to themselves because they're not going to take the informant's say so. 
    And they did the best they could to keep him under surveillance. 
    The informant without going into all of the detail about that, and there's some argument about, well, a couple of witnesses said looking at the car, it appeared to be Cooper and a couple of them did. 
    There were several identifications. 
    One of the agents, as he walked up to the front of Newels Market saw Cooper turn in, turn of from Cutting Boulevard and head towards the parking lot. 
    He identified Cooper positively driving the car, this was Cooper's car. 
    They -- most of them had seen him before, observed him around Richmond. 
    Two of the officers had the informant in sight at all times from leaving the federal agent's car walking over to the market, going in the lot, contacting Cooper. 
    There were some conflicts and Mr. Traynor has pointed them out with great detail. 
    The Defense Attorney went through every possible detail of the observation and there were some inconsistencies but that all goes to the question of sufficiency and it goes to the trial judge. 
    In the event, the evidence, there is sufficient evidence that he was observed at all times and Mr. Green, who was the informant returned to the car, a federal agent waiting for him, gave him two bindles of heroine. 
    Now, the bindles are white paper wrapped around a white powder which is heroine and which was ultimately analyzed and determined to be heroine. 
    These two white paper bindles were wrapped in a piece of brown paper, a piece of grocery sack paper. 
    And this is the object that was handed to the federal agent in the car. 
    Now, that is not the piece of brown paper that we're talking about or that we're concerned about. 
    There is no problem, I think, before this Court as to the admissibility of the heroine, the paper in which the heroine was contained. 
    I'll get to the piece of brown paper in just a minute. 
    But this is what the case was all about; it was whether Joe Cooper sold heroine to Green, the informant. 
    They had given the informant marked money as their common practice. 
    So that if they picked up whoever sold him the heroine and found the money on him, it would tend to corroborate the fact of the sale.

    Did the informant testify?
speaker="albert_w_harris_jr" startTime="1913.947" stopTime="1960.510">
    Mr. Albert W. Harris, Jr. 
    No, he did not, Your Honor. 
    The -- on any event, Mr. Cooper -- there was an attempt to follow Mr. Cooper after the sale. 
    They weren't certain it was heroine at this point. 
    They later ran a field test on it down at the police station. 
    So they didn't arrest him. 
    As a matter of fact, they tried to follow him but he got away. 
    They staked out the car in the downtown Richmond, and about two to three hours later, arrested Joe Cooper when he returned to the car. 
    At that point, according to the agents, he said, "there's marijuana or marijuana cigarettes or something to this effect under the visor of the car," pointing to the car.

    Mr. Cooper, Your Honor, the defendant. 
    Well, it didn't turn out that there ever was any marijuana in there. 
    But at the time, apparently he was trying to distract the officers. 
    They'd come up to him one on one side, one to the other. 
    Now, when -- after he made this comment, they looked in the car, he put over -- took his left hand and went over his shirt pocket, pulled out a small object wrapped in brown grocery sack paper or in brown paper, anyway.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="1985.454" stopTime="1987.379">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Is that the paper?

    Mr. Albert W. Harris, Jr. 
    That is not the paper, Your Honor. 
    We haven't come to that yet. 
    This he popped in his mouth. 
    An agent attempted to grab his hand and the -- both hands went into Mr. Cooper's mouth and he bit and he bit hard and he inflicted serious injuries on the finger of the agent. 
    Well, he was charged with that too but I won't go into that side of this case. 
    But we still haven't come to the piece of brown paper although we have two at this point. 
    But neither are involved here and there's no question about the admissibility of the evidence raised here. 
    Well, he goes back to the station and the next day, he's questioned and there's no argument here about any problem in the questioning and he admits that he put something wrapped in brown paper in his mouth at the time of his arrest. 
    Again, we're not -- to the evidence we're talking about. 
    Well, in all of these things that I've touched on I'd intended to go onto greater details to show the accuracy of the evidence in the following of Mr. Green to make the buy and all of that but I don't want to pursue that on great length.

    Mr. Albert W. Harris, Jr. 
    Yes, Your Honor, we're going to finally going to get to that. 
    Now, the piece of brown paper that we're talking about here; first is mentioned by Agent Broom who was more or less in charge of this operation. 
    He is called a witness stand by the people. 
    He identifies the two bindles and the brown paper they were wrapped in which constituted the sale of heroine that -- this is all about. 
    That is not the brown paper. 
    He identified that. 
    Now, the defense attorney takes him on cross-examination and he says to him, "Well, now, what about this other piece of brown paper"?

    The defense attorney first mentioned that he said this, "Now perhaps then -- this is at page 114 of the record. 
    Now perhaps I forgot about this yesterday or didn't see it or didn't perhaps see that, "Where does this piece of paper come in"?

    The defense attorney interjected the question on his cross and I don't claim any invited error or anything of that kind but it was first mentioned by the defense. 
    On a re-direct, the district attorney comes back to us, and that's at page 130 of the transcript of the record on appeal here. 
    And then he says "I'll show you this piece of brown paper and ask you if you can identify that"

    Mr. Albert W. Harris, Jr. 
    I believe so, yes sir. 
    Now let -- then another interesting point here is that the -- when it went into evidence was right after the people had called a criminalist who identified -- who testified that the heroine was heroine, that is the powder was heroine.

    Two pieces?
speaker="albert_w_harris_jr" startTime="2410.984" stopTime="2457.349">
    Mr. Albert W. Harris, Jr. 
    That's correct, Your Honor. 
    One, that the paper bindles had been wrapped in at the time of the buy, the other, the one that was found in the glove compartment. 
    And it -- the interesting thing is that when this exhibit was received in evidence, the criminalist identified the bindles and that they contained heroine and he'd been given them and so forth and there's no mention at that particular point in the transcript of this other brown piece of paper but it was no doubt it was received in evidence together with the others. 
    Well, now that, Your Honors, is the last mentioned, I think I'm right about this, and if I'm not I'll be corrected. 
    That is the last mention of that piece of brown paper until Joe Cooper is up in the District Court of Appeals.

    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Can we be sure that the heroine and the paper in which it was wrapped including the brown paper in which it was wrapped would've been received in evidence as exhibit four if that material had not been connected to the appellant Cooper by means of the additional piece of brown paper?

    Justice Abe Fortas 
    (Voice Overlap) of emphasis upon it, it seems to me that the brown paper was the same as the brown paper wrapping the heroine and that the brown paper was the same as the brown paper that Mr. Cooper swallowed.

    Mr. Albert W. Harris, Jr. 
    That's correct, Your Honor. 
    That -- the Attorney general made that statement that it was highly relevant. 
    I think it did tend to show this. 
    Oh, I could come to that in just a moment. 
    That was the last mention of that brown paper in the course of the trial.

    Mr. Albert W. Harris, Jr. 
    Oh, it lasted, I guess, a day or two, Your Honor. 
    It was a court trial; was not a jury trial. 
    There was no argument at the close of the evidence as there frequently is not at the -- in a court trial. 
    At least in California, the evidence there, it is. 
    The judge when he found Joe Cooper guilty of selling heroine and that's what this case is all about, stated very briefly, we've quoted it in our brief and I won't quote that same language but what he felt to be the convincing evidence, the defendant at the close of the defense of the People's case moved for a dismissal on the ground that there was a reasonable doubt about the state of the case at that moment. 
    Pointing out for example, the informant hadn't testified. 
    And the judge said this at page 208 of the printed record, "Actually, I see no reason, Mr. Moran", that was the defense attorney, "This believe at this point the basic testimony of the officers. 
    I have no doubt that the defendant was out there. 
    I have no doubt that Green was out there, the informant. 
    I have no doubt that the contact was made. 
    The two bindles are here. 
    Agent Lee says they were turned over to him by Mister Green after the contact. 
    As in all cases, on some of the details are differences of opinion. 
    As a matter of fact, it would be most unusual if this were not so.

    What page is that?

    Mr. Albert W. Harris, Jr. 
    That's at page 208 of the printed record, Your Honor. 
    And then there's a very similar statement over at page 242 of the printed record. 
    This is after the defendant had taken the stand. 
    And what does the defendant testify to? 
    He testifies to an alibi. 
    He says he was not here at all. 
    He says he didn't receive a phone call. 
    And in fact, he was with a lady he knew and they've gone out to North Richmond to visit a -- among other people, to visit her father. 
    But no witnesses calls in support of that position. 
    And it stands simply on his testimony. 
    On page 242, the judges heard the evidence. 
    Bear in mind there's no jury, so it's strictly the judge deciding the case. 
    Well gentlemen, there's no reasonable doubt or otherwise in my mind that the phone call was placed as testified. 
    And that the officers were outside the defendant's aunt's home. 
    That he answered the phone there. 
    That he did go over to Newels Market and was identified there and met Mr. Green and Mr. Green thereafter did turn over the bindles in evidence to Agent Lee and they were found to be heroine. 
    And the court will find the defendant guilty. 
    No mention of that brown paper later found in the glove compartment, whatever.

    Mr. Albert W. Harris, Jr. 
    No, Your Honor. 
    It is not. 
    As a matter of fact, that entire exhibit was destroyed. 
    There isn't anything in the record about it but it was destroyed sometime after the District Court of Appeals had resolved the case. 
    But we don't have it here. 
    We do have the description now; it was described in the record as somewhat larger than the piece that the heroine, the bindles of heroine was wrapped in, somewhat larger piece of brown paper. 
    There was never any evidence that, for example, that they'd matched the places where it was torn to indicate that it was -- that would -- had been torn from one sheet.

    Mr. Albert W. Harris, Jr. 
    A question of confrontation, a failure to call the informant as a witness. 
    But this is the only item of evidence that he claims to constitute a constitutional error. 
    I think that's a fair statement. 
    Now, we've contrasted in our brief the situation in this case and Fahy against Connecticut, for example, where Your Honors have looked through the evidence in detail. 
    You didn't reverse simply on the basis that there was illegally obtained evidence but you went through it on detail. 
    You can do that and I hope you will with this piece of brown paper. 
    It doesn't corroborate, it doesn't tie in, it doesn't do anything as to the phone call, as to the observations of Mr. Green, as to the instrumentality, the heroine itself.

    We think on a fair appraisal of this evidence, the whole record has been pointed out here that this was not prejudicial under the Fahy test.

    And in the lawful custody of the state, I think, if there's any question about that then you have quite a different problem.

    And in a narcotics offense where the narcotics were sold from the car, it would have been perfectly proper to search this car at the time of the arrest under anybody's view of the law. 
    And we say that the fact it was searched a few days later, it having come into the lawful custody of the state and the defendant having no right to its return at that time, then the search is not unreasonable within the Fourth Amendment.

   Rebuttal of Michael Traynor
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="3573.368" stopTime="3576.287">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Conclude your argument.
speaker="michael_traynor" startTime="3576.287" stopTime="3784.199">
    Mr. Michael Traynor 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    The portion of the story of this case that was related to you by the Attorney General was fairly stated but it's not the complete story in this case. 
    This case is a very weak factual case. 
    It began when the federal agents started the eavesdropping on the defendant's home and turned up no evidence of any sales of narcotics. 
    The next step the police took in this case was to arrest at dawn an unreliable and untrustworthy informer and subject him to several hours of interrogation. 
    At the conclusion of which, he agreed to act for the police as a participating informer and what is commonly as a police-controlled narcotics buying. 
    The two officers who were stationed outside the defendant's residence only said that he took the description of the defendant, that the man who came out of the house. 
    One of those officers said the man limped. 
    The other officer said he'd walked fairly normally. 
    There was a discrepancy at the outset in their physical identification. 
    The mark money that was given to the informer as one of the ingredients of trying to tie the sale to this defendant was never found. 
    The other ingredient of trying -- that the officers are trying to tie this sale to the defendant was to have him supervise and constantly observe the transaction. 
    This attempt failed. 
    Agent Alameda, who was stationed down at the market, lost sight of the informer and the suspect during the crucial two to three minutes of transaction occurred. 
    The two other officers were stationed at a point more than a hundred yards away. 
    Their view was obstructed in part by a passing and parked cars and they also conflicted on the very important part of their testimony. 
    One of them placed the informer inside the car on the right hand side. 
    The other one placed the informer had to be standing outside the car at the driver's side. 
    Mrs. Galley (ph), who is the aunt of defendant that was home, they've tried to place him in residence with regard to the phone call on re-direct examination, was asked about the phone call. 
    She said, "I've answered the phone and I've told him that only the girls that would be calling him." 
    In this case, we had a testimony that there was a man calling and not girls. 
    The participating unreliable untrustworthy informer was never produced as a witness at this trial. 
    He was never in the case although he was the really most important salient witness against the defendant. 
    The defendant took the stand and testified in his own behalf and contradicted the testimony of these police officers. 
    This was such a weak case that the prosecutor must have thought and did think that every piece of paper, every scarp of evidence including a scrap of paper would be necessary to contribute to a conviction and so it did. 
    It is for this reason in the constant references to the attempt of the prosecutor to establish the connection between brown paper, the swallowing of the piece of brown paper package at the time of the arrest. 
    The defendant's use of the brown paper in testimony during his unconstitutional interrogation at the police station and the placement and finally and most importantly the placement of this illegal piece of paper in the very same exhibit as the subject of the crime for which the man was charged.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3784.199" stopTime="3806.514">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Mr. Traynor, do you think it's clear that the Supreme Court of California held that this paper was seized unlawfully in reliance upon the federal constitution?
speaker="michael_traynor" startTime="3806.514" stopTime="3835.185">
    Mr. Michael Traynor 
    I think there's two parts to that answer, Mr. Justice Stewart. 
    One is as of a matter of state law they construed the vehicle forfeiture statute not to authorize the kind of search that was made here. 
    Without that kind of authority, this case became for the state -- District Court of Appeal the same kind of case as the Preston case. 
    Simply, a vehicle in lawful custody, and they said it was in lawful custody.

    In lawful custody.
speaker="michael_traynor" startTime="3835.979" stopTime="3848.063">
    Mr. Michael Traynor

    And that being in lawful custody was simply a Preston case and was controlled by it.

    Mr. Michael Traynor 
    That's right, Your Honor and they relied on both the Preston case and the case in California called the Burke case which followed Preston which involved the obtaining of a car under the vehicle code when a man's arrested on the highway obtaining and putting him on custody.

    No, this is -- this case is here because it was a violation of the United States Constitution.

    Justice Byron R. White 
    And if the Preston --
speaker="michael_traynor" startTime="3922.910" stopTime="3924.125">
    Mr. Michael Traynor 
    Under the Preston --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3924.125" stopTime="3958.406">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    -- if -- let's assume for a moment that Preston was erroneously interpreted to bar the search without a warrant of a car which is in the lawful custody of a -- of the police. 
    Let's assume that Preston didn't quite -- let's assume this car was stolen for example, and assume Preston does not bar the police from searching without a warrant a stolen car which they've taken in their possession. 
    Now would the --
speaker="michael_traynor" startTime="3958.406" stopTime="3976.033">
    Mr. Michael Traynor 
    Your Honor, I think that would be a would be a very difficult argument to make because on the record in the Preston case, the -- one of the arguments made was that the police had caused to believe that the car was in fact stolen and that it was in lawful custody of the police because it was stolen. 
    And in fact, the Solicitor General in his brief --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3976.033" stopTime="3994.417">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    I agree with that argument. 
    Well, I'm just saying -- let's assume that Preston didn't hold this at all. 
    Then I suppose the court below would've been -- if this is wrong relying on the Preston. 
    They do not -- anyway, they're not relying on a state rule.
speaker="michael_traynor" startTime="3994.417" stopTime="4097.724">
    Mr. Michael Traynor 
    I'm not so sure that would be the correct answer, Your Honor. 
    This -- the District Court of Appeal, if that were the case, I think properly relied on Preston even assuming as -- even assuming Preston was not controlling. 
    Preston -- I don't think should be read as simply establishing the outer limits otherwise, to read it otherwise would discourage the state and federal courts from taking the decision to this Court and following them and applying them in the cases where they should be controlled. 
    The District Court of Appeal properly, I think, interpreted the Preston case to apply to this. 
    We have the same element of lawful custody in both cases. 
    The state's reliance on the Ninth Circuit Federal Court case under the narcotics statutes is a case that didn't even bother to cite the Preston case even though it was decided after it. 
    The -- there's really no justification for distinguishing the Preston case here. 
    What the state is really attempting to do is to overrule the Preston case or to trivialize it by exceptions that there are no available exceptions in this case. 
    The important point I wanted to make coming back is that this was an extremely weak case against the defendant. 
    Every piece -- every scrap of paper was necessary and it was used and it hurt and it hurt the defendant in the trial court and it hurt him in the appellate court. 
    And for that reason his conviction was unconstitutionally obtained and for that reason also it must be reversed respectfully. 
    Thank you very much.
