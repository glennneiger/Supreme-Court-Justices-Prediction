Berger v. New York
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="0.000" stopTime="30.779">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Number 615, Ralph Berger against the people for the State of New York. 
    Mr. Brill?

    Mr. Joseph E. Brill 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    My client, Ralph Berger was convicted in a state prosecution for conspiracy to bribe the chairman of the New York State Liquor Authority. 
    His conviction was affirmed by the appellate courts in the State of New York and in each instance without opinion. 
    However, in the Court of Appeals, then Judge -- Chief Judge Desmond and Judge Fold, now Chief Judge Fold dissented in an opinion which appears at page 691 of the record here. 
    The questions before this Court as limited by the order allowing certiorari are found at page 3 of our brief. 
    They involve the constitutionality of the New York State permissive eavesdrop statute and on the assumption of constitutionality of such statute whether the ex parte orders for secret electronic bugging were made on adequate showing of probable cause. 
    Prior to the trial, a motion was made on behalf of petitioner to suppress evidence and leads thereto on the ground that the same were obtained in violation of his constitutional rights by trespassory electronic bugging of constitutionally protected areas. 
    That motion to suppress was denied, was lead to renew before the trial court. 
    At the outset of the trial, during the proceedings under the renewed motion to suppress, the parties entered into a stipulation under which it was agreed that without the evidence and the leads obtained from the electronic eavesdrop devices placed in certain private offices, there was no information to present to a grand jury or on the basis of which to prosecute the petitioner and that all of the evidence and all of the leads thereto were activities at those two locations. 
    The electronic bugs in those private offices were installed under authorizing officers -- orders, I beg your pardon, issued ex parte by a state judge pursuant to Section 813 (a) of the New York Code of Criminal Procedure. 
    Those orders made on April 10, 1962 and of June 16, 1962 for the separate premises involved, permitted the prosecutor, his agents, and police working under his direction, and I quote “to overhear and record by means of any instrument, any and all conversations, communications and discussions, that may take place between the persons present in the above mentioned room and to do all things necessary to permit said conversations, communications, and discussions to be overheard and recorded.” 
    The ex parte orders renewed the eavesdropping for 60 days and were thereafter renewed for additional similar periods. 
    Later in my discussion I shall advert to the -- in detail to the question as to whether they were submitted to the judge who made the orders, adequate proof to support a finding of probable cause as required by the Fourth Amendment of our federal constitution.

    Mr. Joseph E. Brill 
    It was not a wire tap Mr. Justice Douglas. 
    It was a microphone concealed in a telephone box such as it's usually covering the type of telephonic equipment found in any home or any private office connected to unused telephone wires, run through those unused telephone wires into another building where a listening post had been established and where those unused telephone wires were then connected to a recording device, a recorder.

    On the telephone, I would have to say, no, Mr. Chief Justice. 
    It got that which was said in part incidentally the recording itself was inaudible. 
    It was -- as I characterized in the trial court, “gobble de goo.” 
    It was almost impossible to make anything have it except as it was put together in the course of the thousands of playings of the recording by the district attorney's office and the police squad attached to it in order to make a transcript which eventually was submitted to the jury, in order to aid it in understanding what was being said.

    The second one was the office of a man named Harry Steinman, who in the course of the proceedings, in which the eavesdropping was conducted under the first warrant is purported that to be a person who was to pay $30,000.00 for a liquor license. 
    He is described as a liquor license applicant. 
    He is later named in the indictment itself as a co-defendant.

    Mr. Joseph E. Brill

    Justice Tom C. Clark 
    The other building?
speaker="joseph_e_brill" startTime="866.978" stopTime="1313.520">
    Mr. Joseph E. Brill 
    Yes sir. 
    We then present to this Court two issues. 
    Firstly, whether the New York ex parte judicial permissive eavesdrop statute may constitutionally authorize under the Fourteenth Amendment and as our amicus Civil Liberties Union urges under the First Amendment, a trespassory intrusion by electronic bugging in private premises to make a general search for evidence to support a criminal prosecution. 
    Secondly, on the assumption that the Fourth Amendment constitutionality of that statute is satisfied, where the ex parte orders for those room eavesdrops based on an adequate showing of probable cause. 
    It appears that this is the first case in which this Court is called upon to consider the merits of the constitutional question of whether otherwise unconstitution -- constitutional trespassory room bugging can be made constitutional by an advanced ex parte judicial order and whether a State statute setting up such a system is constitutional. 
    The recent Osborn decision does not reach this issue and I shall refer to Osborn in my discussion. 
    It is true that in Osborn, a form of electronic monitoring was approved on the basis of advanced judicial permission and it is true that in Osborn, several of the justices of this Court, joined in the decision apparently because this judicial permission was deemed to remove the constitutional objections under the particular facts in that case. 
    In the first place, Osborn involved a “minifon” device and not a surreptitious intrusion. 
    The “minifon” problem has always until now been regarded by this Court differently from the trespassory room bug. 
    Minifon type activity was approved by this Court in the On Lee and Lopez cases. 
    Trespassory room bugging has been disapproved since the Silverman decision. 
    It cannot be argued from this that the factor of advanced judicial permission in the Osborn “minifon” situation where the justices who had dissented or otherwise differed from the majority in On Lee and Lopez joined in the Osborn majority. 
    It cannot be argued from this that Osborn has settled for all purposes and for all types of electronic monitoring, the problem of advanced judicial permission as a cure or otherwise unconstitutional electronic eavesdropping. 
    Aside from the distinction between a “minifon” device and a room bug in private premises, Osborn is distinguishable from our case on several other grounds. 
    And Osborn fails to solve the entire problem of advanced judicial permission for several other reasons. 
    We have set forth in detail in our brief at pages 58 -- 55 to 58, the several distinguishing points affecting Osborn. 
    Above all, there is the matter of specifically limiting the monitoring -- the electronic monitoring which it was possible to do in Osborn where they were aiming at a specific scheduled conversation to be held at a specific time. 
    But how can this be remotely compared to a 60-day general room bugging order to overhear all conversations in a private place? 
    Whatever principles or standards maybe derived from the forms of the judicial permission which was approved in Osborn, those principles and standards cannot possibly be satisfied by 813 (a) of the New York statute and they have not been satisfied in this case. 
    Since Osborn then does not reach the question of advanced judicial permission for trespassory bugging, we must in this case explore an uncharted sea, that is, we have no guidance from any decision of this Court with the exception that I will mention to help determine what kind of judicial permission for trespassory bugging might be constitutionally acceptable or indeed where there any kind of judicial permission can constitutionally be devised for trespassory bugging. 
    I just mentioned that some guidance has been offered in earlier decisions of this Court. 
    I was referring to the discussion of Mr. Justice Lopez -- of Mr. Justice Brennan in the Lopez case, but the point was not pursued to conclusion in that discussion. 
    It was expressly left for a later day. 
    This case brings us to that day. 
    The immediate question in this case is whether New York State found a constitutional solution for the problem of judicial permission? 
    May I read excerpts from the New York statute? 
    An ex parte order for eavesdropping maybe issued by any justice of the Supreme Court upon oath or affirmation of a District Attorney, or of the Attorney General, or an officer above the rank of sergeant of any police department of the State, or of any political subdivision thereof, that there is reasonable ground to believe that evidence of crime maybe thus obtained, and particularly describing the person or persons whose communications, conversations, or discussions are to be overheard or recorded and the purpose thereof. 
    Any such order together with the papers upon which the application was based, shall be delivered to and retained by the applicant as authority for the eavesdropping authorized therein. 
    A true copy of such order shall at all times be retained in his possession by the judge or justice issuing the same. 
    As applied in this case through the eavesdrop orders that were issued, the statute as I've already indicated was given its maximum scope. 
    The eavesdropping was permitted for 60 days and then for renewed periods of 60 days. 
    It was permitted on an outright trespassory basis in private room premises. 
    It was permitted to be done as a deliberate, unrestricted search for evidence of any crime, and while I pass for the moment full details as to probable cause, I note here that the warrants used for electronic search were wholly unlimited in the sense that they bore no relation to the alleged probable cause.

    Mr. Joseph E. Brill 
    In the proceedings on the motion to renew Mr. Justice Fortas, all of the reels of tape which were taken at the listening posts, were produced in Court marked as exhibits and in a dry run before the Court at which time they were present, actually attempting to record what was being reproduced, three certified court reporters, who attempted to make transcripts of that which was being reproduced. 
    As a result of the dry run before the trial court except for one reel which became Exhibit 61 (a) in the trial, all of the others were excluded on various grounds suggested and stated by the trial judge. 
    Primarily, they were held to be a material, irrelevant, no probative value, and they were also inaudible and impossible to understand.

    I understand that there have been some perjury indictments. 
    I understand that there have been other indictments. 
    There was at least one other indictment charging a conspiracy to bribe perhaps to conspiracy to bribe officials of the New York State Liquor Authority. 
    And I am not entirely clear as to the details with respect to the bugging or the wiretapping in each of those cases, but I am satisfied, for example that, there is presently pending an indictment in New York involving the Attorney Harry Neyer, whose premises were a bugged under the April 12, 1962 order on the basis of which it is said that there was a development in which he in a telephone conversation with a petitioner in this case led to further activities.

    In this case, the necessity for taking proof was obviated because of the stipulation which was entered into between the District Attorney and myself in which it was agreed that all of the evidence and all of the leads came from the trespassory bugging in these private offices and without that evidence and without those leads, there would be no case on which the prosecution could have gone forward.

    Mr. Joseph E. Brill 
    I will. 
    I will Mr. Justice Brennan. 
    If there is ever going to be a statutory system of curing unconstitutional electronic eavesdropping through the cure of advanced judicial permission and anyone believes it will be this statute or one like it. 
    We have taken the position in our brief that no system of judicial permission can be constitutionally devised for this area except perhaps and I emphasized perhaps for the case of supreme public emergency and then only for security and not for prosecutorial purposes. 
    In order for this particular case to be reversed by this Court, it is not necessary that a Court agree with this in this broad policy position suggested in our brief, but I think that useful lines of analysis are opened up in our suggestion which can be helpful in deciding this case. 
    For example, should the constitutional right of privacy be subject to judicially permitted electronic intrusion without limit as to what kind of crime the police eavesdropper is seeking? 
    The New York statute is unlimited in this respect. 
    For example also, should the constitutional right of privacy be subjected to judicially permitted intrusion without even defining at all in the judicial warrant, what private conversations criminal or non-criminal maybe be searched? 
    Is that the way it was done in Osborn? 
    The New York statute, however, permits such search and indeed, it makes it inevitable. 
    It seems to us indisputable that this particular statute goes too far by any rational standard of our privacy traditions under the Constitution. 
    The argument on this point could end here without going on to ask, what kind of a better statute might satisfy the Constitution? 
    We take it that the Court maybe interested in having us explore the question in its broader extensions and for that reason, we have included in our brief a discussion of the broader policy implications of judicially permitted electronic eavesdropping. 
    And the conclusion which we have proposed is again that no system of judicial permission can satisfy the Constitution for any case of electronic search where the purpose is criminal prosecution. 
    I've asked myself whether some position short of this perhaps could be worked out to allow judicially permitted electronic eavesdropping for criminal prosecutions and I have not been able to find a constitutionally, logical or palatable answer short of outright ban. 
    One reason, why we have believe that necessary to formulate our position is the advent of the age of the parabolic microphone and no one knows what has yet to come? 
    I have not yet touched on the subject of Fifth Amendment self-incrimination. 
    The Court is frequently spoken of the interplay feature as between the Fourth and Fifth Amendments. 
    The indiscriminate character of electronic room bugging and the warrants in this case, make it inevitable that Fifth Amendment rights as well as the Fourth Amendment rights are immediately threatened. 
    The rights are threatened both through the general search that is intrinsically involved in any such indiscriminate room bugging and they are threatened even more acutely in this case by the search for mere evidence. 
    In fact, the search for mere evidence is the expressly declared purpose under the New York statute and under the warrants issued in this case. 
    I come now to our second point, that is, assuming the federal constitutionality of Section 813, we asked whether the ex parte eavesdropping orders authorizing the intrusion nevertheless are invalid under the Fourth Amendment because they were not based upon an adequate showing of probable clause. 
    These ex parte orders here were secured on application to a judge under the provision of that statute 813 (a).
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="1980.848" stopTime="1982.604">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Are the applications in the --
speaker="joseph_e_brill" startTime="1982.604" stopTime="2325.839">
    Mr. Joseph E. Brill 
    They are, Mr. Justice Brennan. 
    The applications in support of the first order made on Attorney Neyer's offices, with respect to Attorney Neyer's offices appear at 681 to 683 inclusive of the record and the applications in support of the second eavesdrop order on the premises of Steinman appear at pages 685 to 687 inclusive of the record. 
    We take the position that the record of the proceedings on the renewed motion to suppress before the trial judge, fails to establish that any sworn testimony or evidence was adduced before him indicating that any showing or presentation was made to the issuing judge beyond the affidavits recited in the orders as the basis for the issuance of the Neyer and Steinman eavesdropping. 
    The validity of the orders then must stand on the record made before the issuing judge. 
    And as Your Honors can see that record in the case of each order consisted only of the affidavits of two assistant district attorneys in the application for and in each instance the order itself. 
    The affidavits, primarily the affidavit made by Mr. McCanna which is adopted by reference, by Mr. Scotti, in the Neyer's eavesdrop, rarely -- merely recite in conclusory fashion that the affiance have “information” and “evidence” that a conspiracy exists to force persons seeking to obtain or retain liquor licenses to pay large sums of money for them. 
    And that Harry Neyer, an attorney, must be engaged to carry the bribe or extortion money to the State Liquor Authority official. 
    No facts are set forth concerning what information or evidence is alleged to be in the prosecutor's possession, or the source of that information or evidence, or the reliability of the source. 
    The order itself asserts that it was made on the affidavits of the two assistant district attorneys and makes no reference to “minifons” or any other information or evidence. 
    In the application in support of the second Steinman eavesdrop order except for references to the earlier Neyer eavesdrop, and that from it evidence was obtained indicating that Steinman had agreed to pay $30,000.00 to Neyer to secure a liquor license, that Court was informed of no more than it was on the Neyer application. 
    Here again, no facts are set forth in the affidavits identifying the persons from whom the evidence was obtained or the reliability of such persons, or any reasons for crediting them. 
    The Steinman order itself recites as does the Neyer order that it was made on the affidavits of two assistant district attorneys. 
    It likewise makes no reference to “minifons” or any other information or evidence. 
    It is apparent then that except for a reference to a prior eavesdrop of attorney Neyer's office and an innocuous statement that Steinman was a prospective license applicant required to pay $30,000.00, the allegations in support of a Steinman order are sheer unsupported conclusions based on general claims of information or evidence in the prosecutor's possession. 
    In short, the affidavits on both applications furnish nothing upon which the magistrate could make an informed, and deliberate determination as required by this Court in Aguilar v. Texas. 
    Contrast these inadequate affidavits with a meticulous showing required to be made and in fact made to the district judges in Osborn, the federal Fourth Amendment decisions preclude the giving of any weight to any after thought suggestion that the respondent could have justified both eavesdrops on the basis of prior “minifon” recordings. 
    Indeed, the record keeping requirements of 813 (a) negate any possible intention by the New York legislature that eavesdropping when subjected to later Court review should be sustainable on the basis of anything beyond what the formal record itself states. 
    I ask this Court to note that the references to prior “minifons” and other information now suggested as a basis for probable cause was mentioned for the first time by the prosecutor on the renewed motion to suppress before the trial court. 
    Finally in view of Osborn one may ask, “Where are the judicial permissive orders for the “minifon” surveillance which the prosecutor claims were antecedent to and supported the application for the room bugging orders in this case.

    Mr. Richard Uviller 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    Our aim in this matter is to define electronic eavesdropping as a search and seizure, subject to the control of the Fourth Amendment and capable of judicial regulation there under as any other search and seizure. 
    We believe that in electronic eavesdropping under the Fourth Amendment there can be lawful means of acquiring evidence when it is executed and carried out in conformity with traditional Fourth Amendment regulations. 
    It should not be too difficult to define it as a search and seizure. 
    This Court has already regarded it as a Fourth Amendment question in another context in the Silverman case. 
    Indeed it is strongly analogous to conventional search and seizure for tangible objects, a primary difference being that what is sought in the case of an eavesdrop is words or speech. 
    Indeed, this is not so different from a conventional search and seizure when the object of that search is also words recorded in the nature of invoices, checks, bills, and so forth. 
    This is indeed a more sophisticated means of search and seizure. 
    As our economy and culture has grown more sophisticated so have our devices of law enforcement.

speaker="richard_uviller" startTime="2828.842" stopTime="2836.989">
    Mr. Richard Uviller 
    I -- It is -- it is our contention -- it is our contention that this is not a means for compelling self-incriminatory statements.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="2836.989" stopTime="2841.612">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Well, as if you say its like a search warrant, it is?
speaker="richard_uviller" startTime="2841.612" stopTime="2907.957">
    Mr. Richard Uviller 
    A search warrant in our view is not a compulsory document in the same sense as a subpoena either. 
    I -- I'm aware Justice Fortas of the Boyd doctrine in which the Fourth and the Fifth Amendments are in a sense blended and indeed in that era and in the emerging understanding of civil liberties protected by these Amendments, there was some language about the compulsion of a search and seizure or of a search warrant. 
    I suggest that the Fifth Amendment has no place in our contemporary understanding of the Fifth Amendment. 
    It has no place in a search and seizure situation. 
    The Fifth Amendment has no place where the search and seizures where incriminating evidence obtained from the person. 
    The Fifth Amendment has no place where it is for physical substance such as a man's blood obtained from the person. 
    Was there a compulsion when blood was taken in Schmerber? 
    I should say that there was the most oblivious sort of compulsion in the sense that a man against his will was held down while his veins were pierced.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="2907.957" stopTime="2911.158">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    I see, your reliance is on Schmerber?
speaker="richard_uviller" startTime="2911.158" stopTime="2972.354">
    Mr. Richard Uviller 
    Well, I think that Schmerber is -- is enlightening in this regard, Justice Fortas. 
    I do not rely upon it entirely because I do think that Boyd or Gouled decision has today the respectability of the -- of one of the federalist papers. 
    I mean it is extremely difficult for an advocate to address critical remarks to the Boyd decision. 
    I do feel in all candor that there might maybe some reverence attributed to that opinion which is not fully deserved. 
    And -- when I -- I mean to discuss mere evidence, although it was quite fully and very interestingly discussed yesterday. 
    I still think that I cannot succeed here unless I can persuade the Court that the Gouled rule and to the extent that the Gouled rule relies upon Boyd should be no longer followed. 
    It should be disregarded.

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Did you have challenge to Boyd or the concurring opinion of the majority?
speaker="richard_uviller" startTime="2976.602" stopTime="3038.521">
    Mr. Richard Uviller 
    The majority opinion; I -- I see Boyd and this is really essential to my argument, Justice Black, I see Boyd for all that it does express some very important principles which have contributed to the growth of civil liberties in this country and I can well understand how such a man as Justice Brandeis would have appraised it as highly as he did. 
    But I see Boyd at heart as a property founded decision. 
    I see the essence and heart of the -- of Boyd decision as Entick against Carrington. 
    And Entick against Carrington as being a trespass decision, a decision which does not hold up with pride, the right of the individual to be secure and private in his thoughts and deeds from the intrusion of government, but a decision which holds up consistent with the English in early American policy which holds up the right to property as the superior right and all else follows there from.

    Mr. Richard Uviller 
    The Fifth Amendment or the Fifth Amendment in Boyd and the similar privilege as mentioned in Entick, it seems to me was brought in almost by the way. 
    I do not think that the Fifth Amendment or the privilege against self-incrimination really pertains to a search and seizure. 
    It's not just Schmerber. 
    It's because the two are very different, the Fifth and the Fourth.

    Mr. Justice, every piece of evidence that is obtained is incriminatory.

    Mr. Richard Uviller 
    Justice Fortas the Court found no difficulty in saying that there was no compulsion in Osborn and in Hoffa despite the fact that that very situation pertained there.

    Why -- well, but is it as far as compulsion --

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    There's no Pardon at this stage --

    No Mr. Pardon no Mr. Vic in this case. 
    Mr. Pardon and Mr. Fit Vic a little microphone fixed to the wall, but as far as compulsion is concerned is there any greater degree of compulsion when two people talk in their office overheard by a microphone and when two people talk in an office overheard by a recording device on one of them. 
    I say that to bring compulsion into the Fourth Amendment, the Miranda case Mr. Justice Douglas, I've read and reread and I think the Court went to considerable lengths in that case to explain just why they felt that there was an atmosphere of coercion inherent in certain types of interrogation. 
    And I'm – and if we read the Court's intend to that decision correctly. 
    We believe that those conditions must exist before there is compulsion. 
    Simply the conversation between a police officer whether he'd be obvious and open, or whether he's then be concealed does not have in it that sort of compulsion which brought the Fifth Amendment into plain random.

    Justice William O. Douglas 
    Of course, the seizure of a letter by a subpoena or the seizure of a letter by a warrant doesn't have in it the element of voluntariness that we normally associate it with?

    – would make a distinction between subpoena and warrant. 
    Now in Boyd they were -- they were -- they were joined together although that was indeed it seems to me a subpoena type of statute. 
    In a subpoena the defendant is required to bring forth the incriminating evidence against himself and in effect connect it to himself by authenticating it, that characterizes a subpoena. 
    In a warrant situation, not only does the accused not have to do anything himself but he is required to do nothing.

    Goodbye.”

speaker="richard_uviller" startTime="3331.764" stopTime="3336.932">
    Mr. Richard Uviller 
    Correct. 
    It does not compel self-incriminatory statements from the man anymore.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="3336.932" stopTime="3346.060">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    It just says that you have a choice between making yourself incriminatory statements or going to jail, that's all?

    Mr. Richard Uviller 
    That's correct, sir. 
    Exactly the way if a Court -- Justice Fortas, if a court orders a man's arrest on probable cause by warrant, that man is required to submit to that arrest because the court had ordered it. Is that an invasion of his privacy? 
    It seems to me that an arrest is at least created an invasion of a man's privacy. 
    He's listening to what maybe said in his office. 
    If he is -- if that can be ordered by a court on probable cause, then cannot a -- all -- all investigations every aspect of the -- of a criminal prosecution from the stand -- from the point of getting the evidence, the point of getting the defense.

    Justice Abe Fortas 
    The problem is -- the problem is to whether -- the problem is whether the compelled action, the two -- two questions. 
    One is the action compelled in a sense; and two is, whether the action is in violation of constitutional right. 
    And there you have when you're talking about the -- whether this is a voluntary action or whether it has an element of involuntariness and I was suggesting as a remote hypothesis that where a man is required to do something on pain of going to jail that that may not be totally voluntary. 
    Next question is whether -- what he is being compelled to do is something if the State can properly compel the citizen to do or whether it is in violation of the citizen's constitutional rights.
speaker="richard_uviller" startTime="3441.092" stopTime="3456.334">
    Mr. Richard Uviller 
    Justice Fortas, there maybe misunderstanding here but I read the implication of what you said to me. 
    That anytime the search warrant for a gun is issued by a court and a defendant is required to yield that gun pursuant to that search warrant there is a violation of the Fifth Amendment.

    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Oh, you've quite misunderstand me, of course you do.

    I'm talking about conversations, statement of the person that is obtained from him either by the an application of force as in the old days or by a surreptitious trespass as it seems to me a current practice in some areas right now.

    Well perhaps if I may, Justice Fortas, I'd like to address myself to the use of the word trespass. 
    That word is used frequently by my adversary and indeed it's used frequently in this connection generally. 
    By a trespass, I understand an unauthorized, an unwarranted invasion of either a man's premises or some other aspect of his private life. 
    To use the term trespass where we are talking about a surveillance pursuant to a court order issued on probable cause seems to me to be a confusion of the issue and a misuse of the term trespass.

    I go further than that and I was about to say it would be a crime because New York does make this action a felony. 
    The felony of eavesdropping, a statute which is enforced and which people have been indicted and this by authorizing the overhearing and interception, and recording, takes the action out of the ambit 738 of the crime.

    Mr. Richard Uviller 
    Could it? 
    Yes, sir. 
    It certainly could. 
    However, there wouldn't have to be Fourth Amendment requirements followed and what that means to me, are these -- these conditions. 
    One that it would have to be probable cause to believe that evidence of crime could be obtained in this manner and that is the basic Fourth Amendment foundation it seems to me for one. 
    Second, the order would have to be specific and particularized the place in which it could occur -- could occur which is again Fourth Amendment and the thing to be seized -- now this it seems to me is -- that's one of my most difficult hurdles here. 
    If I am going to try to analogize electronic surveillance and the search for and seizure of words, spoken words with a search for tangibles, we may -- we must define what we mean by the seizure of the thing of -- in as much as if that is incapable of particularization as is alleged here then we cannot bring this within the permissive as well as the prohibitive features of the Fourth Amendment.

speaker="richard_uviller" startTime="3830.485" stopTime="3915.240">
    Mr. Richard Uviller 
    I don't see that that is a significant distinction in the sense that, a man who goes in with the minifon face the facts, may also record other things. 
    The man gets on the telephone and talks to someone else and so on. 
    I think the principal difference is that there's no search in the minifon situation. 
    It's just a conversation preserved by a memory device, electronic memory devices. 
    In the search, in bringing electronic surveillance within the search, I have no difficulty with its generality because it seems to me a search is inherently invites nature general. 
    If the search can be defined as the use of the senses to perceive, to perceive in the quest for a particularly designated object, then clearly a search for tangible objects is necessarily general and it perceives the innocuous along with the -- with the guilty. 
    It perceives the mere along with the other or non-evidence. 
    It perceives everything that comes in the natural range of the particular sense of human faculty that's being employed for the search. 
    So it seems to me the fact that an electronic eavesdrop also perceives the innocuous, perceives the irrelevant to its object, if you will, does not invalidate it either from a -- from the standpoint of an analogy with conventional search and seizure or --

    And if you're search had uncovered something else, you cannot obtain it. 
    A string of lower court cases which I've cited in the brief, indicate the contrary have said that once a police officer is lawfully on the premises for one reason or another either executing a lawful warrant or for some other reason, he does not have to close his eyes to incriminating evidence that falls within the --

    There's a conflict on what to do if you discover evidence of a different crime and the one you're looking for, and that conflict is true on -- on conventional search cases.

    As there -- I suggest that the Harris rule is the sound of one as far as this is concerned. 
    The generality of the search then is controlled by the Fourth Amendment only as to place. 
    The language of the Fourth Amendment in limiting the search as distinct from the seizure limits it only as to place, not as to thing. 
    And I think that this is rational and reasonable as I have said because the search naturally perceives more than the designated project.

    Mr. Richard Uviller 
    I -- I don't know how I got into this jam.[Laughter] 
    I hold no brief for this position and I'm happy to accept the search without the seizure on the Fourth Amendment. 
    I think the serious question here is whether or not this particular device, this particular means of obtaining a search and seizure or search or seizure is inherently beyond the control of the Fourth Amendment. 
    Are there aspects to this particular variety of the acquisition or method of acquisition of evidence in criminal case which inherently place some beyond the Fourth Amendment and the first of these of course to be overcome is the so-called the “evidence rule”. 
    We've devoted considerable time in our brief to our view of the mere evidence rule and its contemporary viability. 
    It is no great art to cite numerous authorities from this Court and other scholarly sources as to the contemporary lack of reason or rationale for the exclusion of evidence because it is of an evidential value only. 
    The concept of evidential value only or mere evidence, it strikes me, has little to do with the Fourth Amendment. 
    The Fourth Amendment, I should think authorizes, authorizes permits the acquisition of evidence which is of an incriminatory nature for the purpose of use as evidence. 
    We're not now talking about a trespass. 
    We're not now talking about the trespass upon a man's right to hold his plot of ground secure against the footsteps of the king's officers. 
    We're talking about a right which is much more intangible and much more precious if you will right than not which is the right to privacy itself. 
    Now, the right to privacy is as much invaded by a search for contraband as it is by a search for mere evidence.

    In discussing the Gouled case and the mere evidence rule, I should make it clear at the outset that we have quarrel with the -- a proposition for which Gouled has been repeatedly cited by this Court even during this term. 
    And that is, that an entry by deception is for the -- it's for the Fourth Amendment purposes equivalent to an entry by force. 
    When we speak --

    Equivalent to what?

    Mr. Richard Uviller 
    Well, it would be overruling quite a lot Mr. Justice but it would also be consistent with quite a lot. 
    I would suggest that this Court in its own decisions had very frequently ignored the so-called mere evidence aspect of the Gouled rule either by not citing Gouled at all or in many instances by what I think is a distortion of the meaning of Gouled and that is --

    Mr. Richard Uviller 
    Yes, sir, yes, sir and that is by the construction of instrumentality to be so broad that in fact it includes what I would consider more realistically speaking mere evidence. 
    Indeed I could argue here for a distinction between this case and the mere evidence rule of Gouled by simply noting that the conversations in this case were in furtherance of a criminal conspiracy, a conspiracy and agreement implies conversations between the conspirators and the words used here from furtherance.

    Mr. Richard Uviller

    Justice William O. Douglas 
    Well, that's in the Camden and as I've read Entick and Carrington puts the two together.

    Mr. Richard Uviller 
    As I -- as I recall what Lord Camden said in Entick was that the search for private papers is more heinous than the warrants issued by the Star Chamber rather than stating that they would be equivalence. 
    And I think that he based that on the fact that a search for private papers that was mere evidence, but on the fact that the right to possession of private papers was in the person from whom they were taken and that this right to possession made the seizure a serious trespass. 
    I suggest that the -- the foundation of the mere evidence rule is totally inappropriate to rule of evidence. 
    That it -- that it relates purely to a question of, who has the right to possess? 
    Contraband; you do not have the right to possess therefore it maybe seized. 
    The instrumentalities of a crime by medieval and perhaps even present day thought become themselves somewhat infected and have to be purified by the church or state and therefore can be seized.

    But I suggest that this is all consistent with a notion of property, who in whom was the property interest? 
    And only -- and you could deprive a suspect of property only if you could show that he did not have a property interest in it.

    I don't think I'm reinterpreting it Mr. Justice Fortas. 
    I think that's the -- that it -- that it has been reinterpreted and I'm trying to restore to its original interpretation. 
    Our -- our -- many of our constitutional rights were founded on 18th Century notions of private property and have been reinterpreted to a more intangible and more contemporary notion of a right to privacy that exists without regard to whether one has property seized or invaded in the course of the breach of the privacy.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="4878.206" stopTime="4906.107">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Well, if you -- if you limited that to the Fourth Amendment search and seizure, and if you limited it to verbal statements, perhaps history would not in the future because in those days they did not have the blessing under these magnificent devices by which people's words could be picked up and recorded surreptitiously?
speaker="richard_uviller" startTime="4906.107" stopTime="5056.941">
    Mr. Richard Uviller 
    May I respond to that Mr. Justice by saying that in our brief we advocate an abandonment of the Silverman-Goldman distinction. 
    Consistent with our position that there is a right to privacy that it exists without regard to the boundaries of physical property, we suggest that there should be Fourth Amendment regulation of any search whether it be by physical trespass or by electronic intrusion. 
    And so, these magnificent devices which Your Honor referred to, which can pierce walls without physical trespass, should by all rights come within the regulation of the Fourth Amendment both as to proscription and as to permissiveness. 
    And the same standards which authorized the physical intrusion in the search for evidence of a -- of a tangible nature should control the search for evidence of an oral nature whether or not made by physical intrusion. 
    I think that perhaps what we're tending toward here is an underlying feeling that all who considered this problem are confessed to and that is that there is somewhere in all of us a deeply rooted and essential repugnance for the notion of the silent -- all of the invisible ear of the state present during what is considered by most of us to be an extremely private and personal event, and that is speech within protected quarters. 
    Certainly, I and we are not immune from that sensation of repugnance and revulsion of for these intrusions, but I'm trying to suggest that by analysis, all attempts, all efforts by law enforcement to enforce its laws inevitably involved some intrusion. 
    Indeed in many instances of conventional searches not heretofore challenged, it seems to me that the intrusion is at least as great as that by electronic eavesdrop. 
    Indeed, it is too final line to draw. 
    In Irvin for example, there was no order. 
    The dirty business which Mr. Justice Holmes referred to in the slogan with which we have to contend in these matters was not addressed to electronic surveillance per se, but it was addressed to electronic surveillance without prior mandate by Court.

    Mr. Richard Uviller 
    Perhaps so and if so, if Justice Bradley in Boyd meant to exempt private papers or certain types of evidence like that from the permissive aspect of the Fourth Amendment, then I suggest that he does so without foundation in constitutional history. 
    The Fourth Amendment does not say anything about the type of evidence to be seized. 
    It talks only about the manner in which a search can be executed. 
    And the clear implication to me of the Warrant Clause of the Fourth Amendment is that if the standards set forth in the Amendment itself are adhered to, that a warrant may issue for the search and seizure of virtually anything.

    There's still room in Fourth Amendment though you forgot about this.

    One not to be reasonable, one that might not be reasonable, it might not be reasonable to search and seizure of private right.

    Mr. Richard Uviller 
    Without in anyway abandoning that position based on the reasonableness clause which I would adhere to, what I'm arguing here is that the order of the Court must conform to the spirit of the warrant clause. 
    And that -- that if we are -- since we are not allowing, let us say, eavesdrops incident to an arrest or eavesdrops necessitated by some sort of abstract of reasonableness. 
    But in New York, we have the statutory scheme which presupposes a court order and that court order based upon probable cause, I suggest that that statutory scheme was drawn with the Warrant Clause in mind. 
    And that it is -- it is the obedience to the warrant clause which would justify the -- the 813 (c) scheme. 
    Now, the -- the particular --

speaker="richard_uviller" startTime="5672.342" stopTime="5826.008">
    Mr. Richard Uviller 
    Yes, sir, I am sir. 
    The surreptitious, let's talk for a moment about the surreptitious nature of this type of evidence gathering. 
    There is no question about the fact that this is surreptitious. 
    Indeed it depends for its effectiveness on being surreptitious. 
    It could hardly be argued that eavesdropping should be permitted only if a presentation of the order is made to the suspect prior to the time that the bug is installed. 
    It could hardly be argued indeed that a public record should be made of the order prior to the time that the bug is installed. 
    It is by its nature secret. 
    Is that secrecy itself essentially repugnant? 
    It does not offend Fourteenth Amendment principles of Due Process. 
    I suggest once again that it is nothing but another variety of a very common more enforcement investigative technique and that is surreptitiousness. 
    Let us take for example the simplest form which I doubt anyone could argue was contrary to constitutional principles. 
    And that is following a man, surveillance by keeping him in sight, and going with him wherever he goes secretly, recording his movements. 
    Is that an invasion of privacy? 
    It is, but indeed, there's not even a requirement for a warrant for that. 
    Perhaps, they should be, but I would suggest that with or without a warrant, it has never been challenged as a secret surveillance and an invasion of privacy because of its secrecy. 
    This is true indeed of many law enforcement techniques, some of which was sanctioned by this Court in this term such as for example, the purchase of narcotics by a person who is masquerading as a narcotics user. 
    He is a police officer. 
    He is secretly gathering evidence by the purchase of these narcotics to use against the man. 
    Is the fact of secrecy, the fact of deception there in and of itself so essentially repugnant to our notions of liberty and privacy as to invalidate it, I think not. 
    So here too, I think that the element of secrecy the fact that the entry to install a bug was surreptitious indeed would have been the crime of burglary, had it not been for the order. 
    I do not think that in of itself should warrant exclusion of this very valuable and important means of obtaining evidence otherwise inaccessible.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="5826.008" stopTime="5882.760">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    That is -- even though that is true, why shouldn't there be some record made of what was obtained and have that made a public record? 
    They could provide that it couldn't be opened unless and -- unless it became necessary in some proceeding or something, but why wouldn't they'd be entitled, if it's a search and seizure, why wouldn't that be entitled under the same kind of protection that one gets on a search warrant? 
    But here although there hundreds and hundreds of judges around the State and thousands of police officers who can engage in this traffic and not one of them is subjected to any supervision in the manner in which he did it. 
    Now, do you think that comports with Due Process?
speaker="richard_uviller" startTime="5882.760" stopTime="5945.005">
    Mr. Richard Uviller 
    Mr. Chief Justice I agree that it should be solved. 
    I see no reason why there should not be a record made, a public record made. 
    I see no reason why the prevalence should not be subject to legislative or executive inquiry. 
    Indeed it would help a great deal if we knew just how often these devices were used and in what sort of case, and in what -- with what results. 
    I think there should be such a record made and I think that the Constitution doesn't require it then some policy does. 
    However in New York, that is in effect done because the order is a written document.

    These two documents are placed in the records of the court and in the records of the public agency by which they were acquired. 
    They are subject to challenge and to inspection on subsequent occasions after the termination of the investigation in question.

    It was not filed in the sense that there's any room other than the record room of the district attorney's office in which all of these orders are placed, but as far in the sense that it becomes part of the Court record.

    The --

    Is there any -- is there any statutory ban on constituting the police revealing this information that maybe that they then have seen on tapes except in connection with a criminal proceeding?
speaker="richard_uviller" startTime="6202.186" stopTime="6308.996">
    Mr. Richard Uviller 
    Yes, sir. 
    I believe there is. 
    And I -- we have this -- the amicus is set forth if Your Honor has if the amicus Attorney General of New York has set forth all the statutes in New York dealing with this particular area. 
    I would like to come to the particular order and the question of probable cause if I may. 
    Here the sequence of events set forth in the brief of the respondent, indicates that – although there were two eavesdrop orders in question here; one on an attorney named Neyer and the other on Steinman, the results of only the Steinman evidence was used against this defendant. 
    The first one, Neyer, provided the lead and indeed was referred to in the affidavit seeking the Steinman order. 
    However, as to the Neyer order and it was not on Berger's premises, Berger the petitioner here, never spoke into that microphone or in its vicinity and therefore we suggest that as to the first order, this Neyer order, Berger is without standing under the Jones against the United States to contest the legality of the order. 
    True, that insofar as the background of that order became the background for the Steinman order, he may contest that, but as to the face of the affidavit and whether it spelled that probable cause efficiently on the face of the Neyer affidavit, I suggest that by all conventional rules, he has no standing to raise it. 
    As to the Steinman order where he does have --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="6308.996" stopTime="6312.909">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Just why -- just why doesn't he have standing, I didn't quite get that?
speaker="richard_uviller" startTime="6312.909" stopTime="6384.353">
    Mr. Richard Uviller 
    Because there was no -- he's not a party aggrieved by that search. 
    He was not one whose cartilage was invaded, it wasn't his office, though, was he there during the -- the existence of the tap? 
    Nor was his voice recorded by the eavesdrop. 
    Therefore, there was no invasion of his right to privacy by the tap on Neyer -- by the bug in Neyer's office. 
    I suggest under Jones that not only must he be the defendant, but he must also be the party whose constitutional rights were invaded to be able to challenge the bonafides of the order under which it was installed. 
    I'm not suggesting that he doesn't have a basis for challenging the Neyer eavesdrop insofar as it was used to obtain the Steinman eavesdrop and indeed it was. 
    The affidavit for the Steinman drop referred to the fact that matters have been learned over the Neyer eavesdrop, but the only question really on appraising the adequacy of an order from a probable cause standpoint, is what did the judge who signed the order, the warrant if you will know at the time he signed it, and was that which was revealed to him sufficient to constitute probable cause.

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    And for this we stick to the four corners of the affidavit?

    Mr. Richard Uviller 
    The Steinman affidavit.

speaker="richard_uviller" startTime="6389.607" stopTime="6419.977">
    Mr. Richard Uviller 
    No, there is more than that. 
    The judge -- unfortunately the record is not too clear on this, but the judge indicated that he had been told various other things by the district attorney who presented that affidavit to him. 
    And there is some evidence in this record as to what he was told but unfortunately neither the judge's minutes nor any papers were introduced to that effect, though, there is evidence to amplify the Steinman affidavit. 
    I suggest that in this instance there is sufficient there to constitute probable cause and indeed --
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="6419.977" stopTime="6421.628">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    By there -- by being there you mean, just the appropriate --
speaker="richard_uviller" startTime="6421.628" stopTime="6422.995">
    Mr. Richard Uviller 
    The Steinman order
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="6422.995" stopTime="6424.075">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Yes, I mean just the affidavit?

    Just the affidavit.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="6424.775" stopTime="6425.206">

    Yes.
speaker="richard_uviller" startTime="6425.206" stopTime="6508.813">
    Mr. Richard Uviller 
    Just the affidavit. 
    Now the order itself that was issued on Steinman which is also here for review, incorporates that affidavit by reference and I suggest that the two have to be read together. 
    While the order itself says, may over hear and in all conversations occurring at this place during this period, it also adopts the affidavit itself. 
    And reading with two together, the order specifies the thing to be seized and it specifies it by referring to the crime to which it relates. 
    Now, I suggest that this is adequate specification in particularity in the conventional search and seizure doctrine. 
    If you identify gambling, paraphernalia for example, just simply by the crime to which it relates that is particularity for a search warrant purposes. 
    And here, the particularity in this order was conversations relating to the transmission of bribe money to the State Liquor Authority in a conspiracy to obtain liquor licenses unlawfully and to that degree of specificity I suggest satisfies conventional search and seizure requirements. 
   
   
   
   Rebuttal of Joseph E. Brill
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="6508.813" stopTime="6511.659">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Brill, you had some time left --
speaker="joseph_e_brill" startTime="6511.659" stopTime="6579.207">
    Mr. Joseph E. Brill 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may I say with respect to the matter of whether or not the eavesdropping orders become a part of the record. 
    In my own experience as both a federal and state prosecutor, I know of no cases in which notification of a matter similar to this kind of situation is given in advance by the prosecutor to his adversary representing a defendant or a proposed defendant. 
    And I am ready to say and do say now to this Court that I know of no case under which an eavesdropping order was obtained in New York County in which prior to the trial, the district attorney advised defense counsel of the existence of such order and of the fact that pursuant to it leads and evidence were obtained. 
    And I say unqualifiedly in this case --
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="6579.207" stopTime="6581.769">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr.

    By making a motion to suppress, Mr. Justice Brennan.

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Do you have to take the initiative, is that it?
speaker="joseph_e_brill" startTime="6587.019" stopTime="6648.369">
    Mr. Joseph E. Brill 
    Exactly so. 
    We took the initiative. 
    We found by examining the record in another case that there had been a bugging order and evidence obtained in that case. 
    That was a case involving a judge of the State Court of Claims. 
    In the course of that case, his counsel, made a motion and demanded a hearing with respect to whether or not there had been a bugging order. 
    It was developed in the course of that case and from the transcript of that case I learned that in fact that in that case there had been an eavesdropping order. 
    Consequently, I made a motion on the assumption that if there had been in that case, there might will be one in my case and I discovered as a result of making that motion that there had in fact been such orders as we have described here and which are the warrants in this case, which are anything but from a reading --
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="6648.369" stopTime="6658.339">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr.

    The prosecution gave us no information at all. 
    They opposed the motion to suppress as the matter of fact. 
    The judge in the -- what is comfortable to special termed who heard the motion denied it with leave to renew.

    I know that it does.

    But I respectfully suggest that it cannot be separated that way based upon the issue of notice along. 
    Now, we -- I think that the situation is aggravated because there can be no notice because it is surreptitious and consequently, there can be no knowledge and there is an invasion of privacy under the protection of the Fourth Amendment. 
    I wanted in passing to make a comment on this issue of standing. 
    The stipulation which was obtained at the outset of the hearing before the trial court on the motion to suppress, integrated both warrants and the proceedings had in connection with both warrants. 
    There was no separation. 
    It was not until after the appellate procedures were instituted that the suggestions was made that the two were separated and to suggest and to acknowledge that there is standing with respect to one but no standing with the respect to the order upon the basis of which the second order was obtained is to request the license, to permit the kind of fraudulent activity which police officers might be capable of committing in order to get to the second order. 
    And I do believe sincerely that we have the right to attack the first order and that issue was before this Court on the application for certiorari. 
    Respondent raised the issue and we interpose the reply brief in which we discuss the matter in considerable detail. 
    Now the other matters to which I wanted to advert in rebuttal, Mr. Chief Justice are that covered by our brief and I will not impinge further upon the time of this Court. 
    Thank you.
