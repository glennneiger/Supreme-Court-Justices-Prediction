    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    May I first return to the question asked by Mr. Justice Fortas towards the close of our Thursday argument concerning the relationship of a ferry operation to our contention that a motor carrier must operate a motor vehicle on a public highway. 
    Ferries are exempted from Part III dealing with water carriers under Section 303 (g) (2) unless the Commission finds that in order to carry out the purposes of the National Transportation Policy, they should be made subject to Part III. 
    Our exploration of that turns up no action by the Commission to make them an ordinary ferry subject to Part III regulation.

    Mr. Miller, I don't think -- perhaps I'm wrong but I don't think that was quite purported, that you and I were exploring. 
    As I understand and as I understood the first part of your argument, it was to the effect that trucks by definition are restricted to the public road system.

    Mr. Thormund A. Miller 
    Yes Mr. Justice Fortas, I am proceeding to get them out from under the regulation under Part III and then go to their position as operating over the public highways if a ferry is considered a part of a public highway by reason of the fact that it's not subject to regulation as a water carrier. 
    And we have in the decision of this Court in St. Clair County versus Interstate Transport Company, 192 U.S. 454 language quoted approvingly by the Court at page 466 that a ferry is a continuation of the highway from one side of the water over which it passes to the other and that consequently an ordinary ferry and I'm distinguishing that from a railroad car ferry or something of this nature is considered a part of the public highway system unless the Commission for some reason concludes that it constitutes a line hole water movement subject to Part III.

    Mr. Thormund A. Miller 
    Our finding with respect to the decisions of the Commission and the courts until the case at bar has been at operations of a common or a contract carrier by motor vehicle within the meaning of Part II do not include the use of other carriers, rail, water or motor under their open tariffs and the first line of cases that arose, came up under the grandfather provisions of the Act where one of the crucial issues was whether purchased transportations from other modes constituted the operations of a motor vehicle over the public highways and the Commission and the courts until the case of bar had held uniformly that it did not. 
    The issue here is similar that is whether or not the purchased transportation from a railroad in TOFC operations constitutes the operations of a motor vehicle over the public highways. 
    This line of cases begins with the Acme Fast Freight litigation which we have reviewed in our brief. 
    There, a forwarder operation was conducted in part by operating motor vehicles directly by the forwarder and in part by the purchase of transportation from rails, water and motor carriers. 
    It was held by Division 5 of the Commission and later by a full Commission decision by Commissioner Eastman that the authority of the motor carrier was limited to operations by motor vehicle upon the public highway and they granted the grandfather right certificate only as to those portions of the operation which they prove they were actually conducting themselves on the public highways. 
    The reviewing court said flatly that a forwarding company could hardly be in operations on a public highway when it contracts for transportation there by independent connecting carriers. 
    This Court affirmed the Acme decision in 309 U.S. and it has been followed in four other court cases involving grandfather rights, three of which have been affirmed by this Court.

    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Mr. Miller, what is the practical reason why the railroads don't want to accept this business in the truck issue?
speaker="thormund_a_miller" startTime="472.480" stopTime="547.172">
    Mr. Thormund A. Miller 
    Well, there are three -- there are a number of reasons but I think I can instance three. 
    One is that these rules have an anticompetitive effect. 
    That is if we published a reduced TOFC rate for the specific purpose of bringing business to the railroads in TOFC service and under Rules 2 and 3, that rate becomes automatically available to our competitors. 
    The goal of competition is certainly blunted. 
    The -- a second reason is that under the rules, under certain of the plans where we publish our rates for the provision of equipment, our equipment would become available to our competitors.A substantial amount of business is rooted by shippers, by those carriers which protect them in the provision of equipment.Here, we would be sharing our equipment under our obligation to provide nondiscriminatory service not only to our ordinary shippers but to our competitors. 
    Third reason --

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well, on that -- on that one, I'm just wondering, could the -- could the motor carriers charge more to carry let's say produce that has been carried part of the way by railroads than it would charge any other person -- any other person who is shipping.

    Mr. Thormund A. Miller 
    Its tariffs -- let me use this as an illustration.

    Mr. Thormund A. Miller 
    I believe, if I understand your question correctly Mr. Chief Justice, that if the motor carrier publishes a tariff for movement from points A to B, and under Rules 2 and 3 elects to move that shipment in part by the use of rail TOFC service. 
    It would charge the shipper the same rate as it would if it had moved it directly all the way by highway.

    Mr. Thormund A. Miller 
    I would assume that if the arrangement is made independently by the shipper with the motor carrier for movement from the railhead to the cannery, the tariff charge would have to be the same regardless of whether it was an ongoing movement having had a prior rail haul as compared with the shipment originating at that point where the rail service terminated. 
    The only instance in which the charges might differ would be in circumstances where there was a joint haul or a partnership arrangement between the motor carrier and the railroad in which they had a through route in a joint rate and in that --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="806.076" stopTime="806.143">

    -- situation, the revenue or compensation received by the motor carrier might differ from the local rate from the railhead to the cannery. 
    But otherwise, apart from that, any shipment originating at that point in terminating at the cannery, moving by the motor carrier, I would assume, would be handled at the same tariff charge.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="831.364" stopTime="856.576">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Now, in principle, how would that be different from this -- from this piggyback situation of the -- of the motor carrier who carries the goods for some distance, puts it on a railroad, carries this another portion at a distance and then takes it off and carries it the rest of the way.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    That's correct sir. 
    That it is not necessary to have a formal publication of a joint rate nor is it necessary to have even expressed arrangements for a through route to be established, it is only necessary for the cooperating carriers to receive and transmit traffic which the two carriers are handling.

speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="943.999" stopTime="1029.897">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    We urge Mr. Chief Justice that Congress has provided in Section 216 (c) for voluntary establishment of coordinated transportation between motor carriers and railroads. 
    And this question of the manner on which this coordination can be affected has risen in these lines of cases that I mentioned, in the Parker case where the problem was the extent to which authority should be granted to railroad motor carrier subsidiaries. 
    They have to consider in the process of determining whether grants of that authority was warranted in the public interest. 
    What kinds of coordination could be created? 
    And in Parker, the Court said, following a number of decisions by the Commission that the -- there was no way to compel motor carrier and railroad coordination. 
    It could only be done on a voluntary basis under Section 216 (c) that that was the congressional policy in the area. 
    And in that case, therefore, they granted certain limited motor carrier rights to the railroad subsidiaries in order to affect this kind of transportation.

    Mr. Thormund A. Miller 
    Well, for an answer to that Mr. Chief Justice, we come back to the definitional provisions of Part II in defining what the authorized service of the motor carrier is and you will recall in defining a motor vehicle, the provisions of the Act specifically exclude the use of a car or vehicle operated exclusively on rails. 
    Therefore, we argue that by definition, those provisions do not permit the motor carrier to utilize a rail car by purchasing transportation from a railroad under its open tariffs in the performance of its authorized service under Part II certificate.

    Mr. Thormund A. Miller 
    We have within the internal areas an exemption which makes certain motor carrier operations in that limited geographical area of Part I or an operation in conjunction with a railroad.

    I would like to mention three things with respect to the National Transportation Policy and the general arguments that have been raised. 
    First, the specific provisions of the Act, of course, cannot be changed by resort to the National Transportation Policy and therefore, the definitions of a motor vehicle and a motor carrier service cannot be amended by a resort to the National Transportation Policy. 
    Secondly, as I mentioned Rules 2 and 3 would have an anticompetitive effect and that Plans II, two and-a-half, III and IV rates covering those services would be available to our competitors under Rules 2 and 3. 
    Thirdly, very broad assertions have been made as to the economic effect of these rules and we believe that since these rules were not before the parties at the time that the fact finding stage of the case was involved. 
    There is no record upon which solid conclusions can be reached as to the economic effect of the routes.

   Argument of Francis M. Shea
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1233.504" stopTime="1234.381">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Shea.
speaker="francis_m_shea" startTime="1234.381" stopTime="1458.174">
    Mr. Francis M. Shea 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    I should like to deal briefly with one of the issues in this case that seems to me dispositive of the case. 
    As I understand Mr. Ginnane, he seeks to derive from the provisions of Section 2 and 3 (1) of the Act, a principle of equality as he puts it. 
    I should note and I'll have more to say this later that the Commission did not rely on 3 (1), a good reason I think. 
    But in any event, what is sought to be derived from these provisions is a principle of equality and I think Mr. Ginnane states it in these terms that one man have looked to the ownership of the goods, one man have looked to the competitive situation, if traffic is tendered by a shipper or a freight forwarder or a motor carrier to a railroad, the same service must be afforded at the same rates. 
    Now, if any such principle is to be derived from the provisions of Section 2 and 3 of the Act, I suggest that that principle condemns rather than supports the rules which had been promulgated by the Commission. 
    Be sure, under these rules, the motor carrier is entitled under the open tariff to move its traffic -- to move the traffic that it's moving for a customer, at the same rate as the shipper or the forwarder. 
    But it's entitled to move it under these rules at a preferred rate, at a better rate. 
    It's entitled to enter into through routes and joint rates and to work out divisions pursuant to which the motor carrier will move the traffic of its customer over the railroad at a lesser rate than the rate at which the shipper may or its competitor, the freight forwarder man, so that in the matter of -- under this principle of equality, on the matter of rates, it is clear under these rules that the motor carrier may move its traffic at something that isn't governed by a principle of equality under divisions and through routes and joint rates at a lesser rate. 
    Moreover, turning to the matter of service --
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="1458.174" stopTime="1459.932">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    It also -- it can also establish a higher rate.
speaker="francis_m_shea" startTime="1459.932" stopTime="1470.893">
    Mr. Francis M. Shea 
    Yes, higher or let's just say a different rate. 
    That is the principle of equality, I take it, is violated as much by a greater as a lesser rate.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="1470.893" stopTime="1477.133">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    But it can do that only with the consent of the railroad, isn't that right Mr. Shea?
speaker="francis_m_shea" startTime="1477.133" stopTime="1478.196">
    Mr. Francis M. Shea 
    That is true, under 216 --
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="1478.196" stopTime="1485.674">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Now, what happens if the railroad doesn't want to enter into a joint through rate arrangement?
speaker="francis_m_shea" startTime="1485.674" stopTime="1547.831">
    Mr. Francis M. Shea 
    As 216 (c) makes it voluntary, I take it that it is clear that if the railroad refuses to enter into it, it doesn't have to enter into it. 
    But I'm suggesting that through the joint route, through -- a joint rate through arrangement which is provided for in these rules by a separate agreement between the railroad and carrier, what would certainly be a rebate if arrived at by special agreement to secure a lesser charge for the movement. 
    These rules authorized a lesser or a different charge at least to be secured by the motor carriers. 
   
   
   
   Rebuttal of Thormund A. Miller
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1547.831" stopTime="1566.595">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    I suppose Mr. Shea that would take us to the point, would it not, where the railroads could say to the motor carriers, “You just can't -- you just can't bring your trucks piggyback on our railroad. 
    We won't let you”.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="1566.595" stopTime="1844.832">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    I suppose that's right. 
    Now, may I note not merely on a matter of rate but a matter of service, the result is also that no principle of equality governed. 
    So far as service is concerned, the shipper can operate at any service point but not the motor carrier, under these rules, he must offer at a joint service point. 
    The shipper or the freight forwarder may say, “You must take it by the most direct route”, but not the motor carrier, he can't use it unless it's at least 85% as roundabout as his highway route. 
    The shipper or the motor -- or the freight forwarder can say, “Take it to the service point nearest destination”, but not the motor carrier. 
    The motor carrier has to say, “Take it to a joint service point”. 
    All I'm saying is that if there is any principle of equality could be derived from 2 and 3, these rules do not carry out any such principle either as to rates or as to service as between the motor carrier and the shipper or the freight forwarder and I suggest that that kind of a principle of -- either of the principle must be wrong or the results are wrong and I think both now. 
    I take it that that he know this agreement, I should hope between Mr. Ginnane and myself that the Commission must find some substantive authority in this Act to justify these rules and if it justifies these rules on any grounds, it's under Section 2. 
    That is the only Section to which reference is made. 
    I should like to ask the Court if it will to read with me the provisions of Section 2 which we find on page 35 of our brief, this is the yellow brief, and I will admit words not critical. 
    If any common carrier subject to the provisions of this part shall charge any person a greater or a less compensation for any service in the transportation of property subject to the provisions of this part, than it charges for doing -- than it charges any other person for doing for him or them a like and contemporaneous service in the transportation of a like kind of traffic under substantially similar circumstances and conditions, such common carrier shall be deemed guilty of unjust discrimination which is prohibited and declared to be unlawful. 
    Now, this is language which says that it shall be an unjust discrimination to charge for a like service a different rate. 
    But how does the Commission read it. 
    If you will turn to page 38, right at the top, we quoted what the Commission said. 
    The Commission says, “Section 2 requires rail carriers to make like and contemporaneous service in the transportation of a like kind of traffic under substantially similar circumstances and divisions available to any person at a charge no greater and no less than received from any other person” and if you'd look to page 8 of the Appendix of our brief, next to the last page. 
    They just adopt that language which they say Section 2 provides as their Rule 2. 
    Now, I suggest to the Court that it is clear on the face of it that what Section 2 and this is the only provision of the Act on which the Commission rely. 
    What Section 2 said is that you may not charge a different rate and what the Commission is saying is that --

    Justice Abe Fortas 
    -- Mr. Shea that there's nothing in this Act that requires a rail carrier to furnish the same service to everybody?

    Mr. Francis M. Shea 
    If the Court -- if -- Mr. Justice Fortas, Section 3 which is in pari materia, Section 2, deals specifically with it. 
    I could understand the language of Section 2 being stretched if it were the only language of discrimination.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="1882.002" stopTime="1882.299">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Well, I --
speaker="francis_m_shea" startTime="1882.299" stopTime="2117.327">
    Mr. Francis M. Shea 
    But Section 3 provides expressly and there's no disagreement that I take it between us that you can't let a preference in service but there's a difficulty with Section 3 which the Chief Justice noted and that is that it has a proviso. 
    And that proviso says that this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to discrimination, prejudice or disadvantage to the traffic of any other carrier of whatever description. 
    Now, I suggest to the Court that that language is clear and it is general. 
    Section 3 doesn't -- can't be construed to apply to any discrimination or disadvantage to the traffic of any other carrier. 
    Mr. Ginnane would have you read it as saying that it may not be construed as applying to discrimination or disadvantage to the traffic of any other carrier if that discrimination or disadvantage is accomplished by undercutting the rates of the other carrier -- the other carrier. 
    Well, I think that no amount of legislative history would permit a rewriting of that proviso to that extent but in any event, there is no legislative history to support any such contention. 
    The one piece of legislative history which is referred to as the statement of Senator Wheeler in introducing this proviso into 216 (d) in Part II but it was taken over from there. 
    And to be sure, Senator Wheeler said, the occasion for putting this proviso in is that some of the motor carriers fear that Section 3 would be construed to extend to discrimination or disadvantage resulting from undercutting the railroads rates. 
    But he goes on to say, this proviso was unnecessary, Section 3 (1) from which 216 is derived, has always been construed as applying only to preferences or discrimination preference or prejudice, the language of 3 (1) between patrons or to the traffic of patrons. 
    And he says this, reading it quite clearly, in contrast of the proviso relating to discrimination or preferences to the traffic of any other carrier. 
    And indeed, the cases construing 3 (1) before the proviso had held that it was not applicable to discrimination against another carrier or the traffic of another carrier but only discrimination relating to shippers. 
    And so I suggest to the Court that the language of this proviso clearly indicates that 3 (1) is not applicable as a basis for requiring that the traffic of competitors be treated the same as the traffic of shippers or --

speaker="francis_m_shea" startTime="2236.874" stopTime="2251.572">
    Mr. Francis M. Shea 
    No, I think Section 2 is not applicable because I think Section 2 likewise is not applicable to the traffic of competing carriers.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2251.572" stopTime="2253.612">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    It doesn't have a proviso, does it?

    Mr. Francis M. Shea 
    Yes, but now, I don't mean that the Congress has ignored altogether this problem. 
    It hasn't. 
    So far as relations between railroads are concerned or the railroads and water carriers are concerned, they've dealt specifically with the problem and they dealt specifically with the kind of a problem which the Government seeks to reach by pressing into service, I think, provisions which were not intended to reach this problem.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2309.608" stopTime="2309.706">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    But is this --
speaker="francis_m_shea" startTime="2309.706" stopTime="2311.036">
    Mr. Francis M. Shea 
    And they've done that --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2311.036" stopTime="2346.813">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Let me ask you one other -- in connection with this -- in accepting the traffic from its own wholly owned subsidiary for transportation to San Francisco, could it -- would it have to do it via the through route or joint rate or whatever you would call it or would it -- or -- or could that -- or -- or -- could that truck -- particular truck line have an open tariff arrangement and make the sail itself originate the traffic and utilize which device, is it V?
speaker="francis_m_shea" startTime="2346.813" stopTime="2382.357">
    Mr. Francis M. Shea 
    Five or one -- well, under -- under Plan I, -- they could originate the traffic and fix the rate. 
    Now, there's -- some of my colleagues consider that a through route and the Commission considered it the through route. 
    Under V, they could establish a through route-joint rate quite clearly.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2382.357" stopTime="2403.438">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    But you think the only way the -- I gather, do you think the only way a truck line can actually have the authority to undertake the -- or to furnish part of its service that it undertakes to furnish by railroad, the only way it can do that is to have a voluntary agreement with the railroad.
speaker="francis_m_shea" startTime="2403.438" stopTime="2634.995">
    Mr. Francis M. Shea 
    Yes. 
    Now, this isn't true of course as between railroads. 
    This isn't true as between railroad and water carriers. 
    There, the Commission has the authority to force through routes and joint rates and it has the authority to see that the railroad provides adequate facility to carry it on and it has the authority under 3 (4) to see that it doesn't discriminate between others and Eastman wanted this in Part II and couldn't get any support for it. 
    And subsequently on several occasions, the Commission is trying to get this authority. 
    Now, these are the appropriate provisions to deal with this kind of problem. 
    I'm not saying that it's wise that there shouldn't be provisions that permits the Commission to require proper coordination of service between the motor carriers and the rails, I'm saying that it is clear that they haven't got it. 
    It is clear that this has been left to voluntary arrangements and I'd like to make one other comment if I may Mr. Justice Fortas, as Mr. Ginnane will know, can the railroads also hand this over to the truckers? 
    Can they use their open tariffs? 
    Mr. Ginnane said, “Yes,” and I suppose there's any principle of equality a railroad can also hand over the traffic it doesn't want to another railroad or to another carrier -- motor carrier when it gets it from a motor carrier, hand it on to another railroad or another motor carrier. 
    The dissenting Commissioner must have a way of thought this introduced an incredible confusion and we didn't know where we're getting. 
    I don't know where it leads. 
    But certainly, the Commission doesn't know where it leads. 
    It's made no record on this and it hasn't addressed itself to it and it certainly hasn't shown the discriminating awareness or the consequences of its acts which appears to be the standard of Burlington and this Court. 
    I think that there is enormous confusion and some of the questions indicate the problems of confusion, in this situation and the reason there is, is that the Commission has not stated clearly what its position is, what support there is for that position and where it leads. 
    And a minimum seems to me that should be returned to tell us that. 
    I'm not sure that it needs to be returned to them. 
    Just let me make this final point, Mr. Ginnane, I gather, says that this is an interpretive rule and I take it what it means by that is that the Commission's opinion is nothing but stating what it understands, Section 2 could mean in this context and if it's wrong, I suppose, the answer of this Court would be that you're wrong and then it's up to them to proceed under some other section if they choose to do it. 
    Now, Mr. Chief Justice I think my time be saved unless there are further question.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="2634.995" stopTime="2667.944">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Mr. Shea, may I ask you this. 
    It seems to me that the way you're reading the proviso of Section 3 cuts very deeply and that would indicate that railroads can disregard Section 3 in any case where it's to their advantage to do so at least with respect to any matter involving truckers or water carriers.
speaker="francis_m_shea" startTime="2667.944" stopTime="2703.255">
    Mr. Francis M. Shea 
    No. 
    I think it can only do so where the issue is -- where this provision is sought to be applied, construed to apply to a situation where it is assertive that a discrimination against the service of the traffic of the -- of another carrier is the violation that is asserted. 
    Now, that may cut deep but to that (Voice Overlap)

    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Here you have though a refusal to -- I suppose refusal to accept -- to provide a service to truckers, namely the service of carrying the trucks on freight cars and I assume that is the Section 3 type of discrimination and that your position is that it's a Section 3 type of discrimination unless it's excused by the proviso.

    Mr. Francis M. Shea 
    Well first, may I note that the record doesn't establish any general refusal.

   Argument of Paul R. Duke
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2917.149" stopTime="2927.024">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well, let's see now. 
    Mr. Duke.
speaker="paul_r_duke" startTime="2927.024" stopTime="3195.321">
    Mr. Paul R. Duke 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    There is no question that the Commission has no power to compel through routes and joint rates between railroads and motor carriers. 
    Now, that's something that I think some find shocking. 
    I know I did when I first discovered it because I thought the Commission could compel a railroad to do just about anything. 
    But I think that lies at the root of this case because I think what the Commission has done by Rules 2 and 3 is try to overcome this lack of power it had to compel through routes and joint rates and supply it through the device of these rules. 
    We submit that Rules 2 and 3 do result in through motor-rail routes and therefore in -- are invalid as beyond the authority of the Commission. 
    Now what is a through route? 
    I think very basically and simply, a through route is an arrangement either expressed or implied between connecting carriers for the carriage, for the continuous carriage of goods over the lines of such carriers. 
    In other words, there's no need for the shipper once he's tendered it to the originating carrier to intervene again, he gets a through movement almost by the name, a continuous movement over the lines of two or more carriers. 
    Now, I would suggest that physically the transportation which Rules 2 and 3 would produce, meets every test of through motor-rail transportation. 
    The motor carrier would pick it up from the shipper under his tariff. 
    He would bring it to the railroad terminal, turn it over to the railroad, ask them to move it to their ramp, take it back and deliver it to the shipper. 
    Now, that is the traditional example of a through motor-rail-motor movement. 
    Now, when we raised this contention before the Commission, they had one answer to it. 
    They said even conceding these were through routes, they weren't compulsory and they said that because the motor carrier didn't have to use the service, well, that's right. 
    But then they also said there was no duty on the railroads to publish any trailer-on-flatcar tariffs. 
    In other words, they were suggesting that we could completely abandon our trailer-on-flatcar business, our tremendous investment in it, if we didn't want the motor carriers to use our tariffs and therefore, the continued maintenance of our tariffs and what I suggest are these through motor-rail routes was voluntary. 
    I suggest that's wrong as a matter of law and ridiculous as a matter of common sense. 
    I suggest that it's wrong as a matter of law because once we have all this equipment and facilities, under Section 1 (4) of the Act, a shipper upon a reasonable request can require us to produce the transportation and publish charges for it. 
    I would suggest that as a matter of common sense, it's like saying that the man who gave up his wallet to the robber on the threat -- your money or your life did so voluntarily because he had a choice. 
    Now on brief, the Government and the Commission and the motor carriers try a new attack. 
    They say, these aren't through routes because there's no holding out so even if compulsory, Rules 2 and 3 don't violate the statute. 
    And for this effort, they cite one sentence from the opinion of this Court in Thompson versus United States which did say that the test of a through route is a holding out by the carriers. 
    But of course, what the Court was examining in Thompson was a voluntary through route. 
    The Commission had decided not to use its compulsory powers in Thompson but had found the existence of a voluntary through route. 
    Well, of course, if you're looking to see whether a voluntary through route has been established, it's quite appropriate to see if there's been a holding out by the carriers. 
    I would also suggest to Your Honors that in this case, there is no holding out by the railroads and that's our real objection, our real complaint. 
    The motor carriers hold it out for us. 
    They're going to hold out without our consent, without our prior agreement, a motor-rail motor service. 
    Now, also in this case --

    I would suggest that a railroad has no more right to ship over a motor carrier than a motor carrier has to ship over a railroad and I say that's none. 
    I would say that if a railroad wants to get a motor carrier to handle part of its business, let's take the iron steel widgets to a point outside the terminal area. 
    Now, we can handle them ourselves inside the terminal area because the Congress specifically gave us that power. 
    But outside the terminal area, we have to find a motor carrier who is willing to enter into a through route arrangement with us just like if he wants to have rail service as a part of his through movement, he's going to find a railroad that's willing to handle it with him. 
    It cuts both ways. 
    And Mr. Justice White, I would suggest that once a railroad holds out or agrees to join in a through route with motor carriers, it couldn't charge its subsidiary a dollar and any other motor carrier $2 because, 216 (c) puts on railroads the duty to establish nondiscriminatory, non-prejudicial divisions among those motor carriers that it does choose to join with.

speaker="paul_r_duke" startTime="3642.297" stopTime="3788.850">
    Mr. Paul R. Duke 
    That's correct because the trucker has no right to ship. 
    I would suspect that the real -- we think we have the best of the statutory and the technical legal arguments but I would suggest that at least what is most troublesome to most people who hear about this is “What's the matter with you railroads, why don't you want this business? 
    Why don't you want motor carriers to come to you and turn trailers over to you under your tariff?” 
    Well, I would suggest that there are many, many practical reasons why railroads want to have the right to agree in advance to enter in the through route arrangements where they can negotiate all of the various provisions that are entailed in a through route service. 
    First of all, now the quite simple answer and that is the railroads are quite naturally weary of their motor carrier competitors bearing gifts but that's no real practical answer. 
    The answer it seems to me is that motor carrier has no obligation to turn all of his business over to us or any specific portion of it. 
    Therefore, the business that he is liable to turn over to us is the business that there is the most difficulty in handling. 
    Now, Mr. Ginnane suggested that the motor carriers are reasonable men and they would make arrangements in advance. 
    Well, I would suggest that the advancement of the railroads piggyback service is not necessarily the principle or a prime aim of the highway carriers in this country. 
    But secondly, there is the practical problem that much freight in this country is one-directional, and one of the principle cost items which raises transportation prices is the problem of empty return that you have to move back to the origin locations where much of the traffic originates empty equipment. 
    Well, the fact is, if a motor carrier can ship via us, he can turn over to us this surplus or one-way business that he has for which he can't set up a balance movement. 
    And therefore, we'll have to confront ourselves not only with our own empty return but with his also. 
    This would tend to raise railroad costs and also consequently raise railroad prices, all to the benefit of our competitor who would be continuing to publish rates for an all-highway service. 
    I will --

    Who originated it? 
    Who thought it up in advanced it?
speaker="paul_r_duke" startTime="3796.222" stopTime="3878.760">
    Mr. Paul R. Duke 
    The railroads Mr. Chief Justice Warren. 
    The first evidence of it was actually boat-on-flatcar service. 
    It began back in 1843 where a railroad was moving canal boats on flatcars. 
    It kind of died out in the late 50s and then in the 1880s, the Long Island Railroad started hauling so-called farmer wagons on flatcars with the team right on the same train in a specially built boxcar. 
    So, I would say the modern resur -- or the modern development of it began in 1926 but the real resurgence came in 1954. 
    After the Commission had laid down all these principles and movement of highway trailers by rail, and the railroads thought, “Okay, now, we have the ground rules, let's go out and start with this thing.” 
    And among those ground rules were that motor carrier or that railroads handled trailers for shippers under tariffs and they handled trailers for motor carriers under through route arrangements voluntarily entered into. 
    I would suggest another principal reason why the motor carriers want to have -- I mean, the railroads want to have a motor carrier as their partners and not as their shippers, is that we get the right to agree in advance how we are going to provide the service. 
    The motor carrier can't just suddenly show up at one of our terminals on a snowy Friday afternoon and say, “Here are our hundred trailers, move them.”

    You're authorized to serve Trenton, New Jersey. 
    We don't want you to turn it over to us at Trenton. 
    You're also authorized to interchange traffic at Kearny, New Jersey up near New York.

    Mr. D. Robert Thomas 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    I do represent these freight forwarder appellees in this case. 
    My clients are the ones who are entirely recognized as having a right to ship and so recognized in the statute. 
    These new rules provide for an invasion of that mode of operation and that's the primary basis of the concern of my clients here. 
    One of the grounds of the decision below was that the rules do violate one of its parts and sections of Part IV of the Act which regulates freight forwarding and moreover, they violate the direct intentions of Congress to keep motor carriers and railroads too, and water carriers out of the freight forwarding business. 
    Now, I do want to explain furthermore to what the forwarder does. 
    A question came up just a moment ago about that. 
    The forwarder company operates by making shipments over these regulated common carriers. 
    This operation of making shipments is the distinctive characteristic of freight forwarder operation. 
    The statute permits the freight forwarder to have his own motor vehicles inside and operate them inside a terminal area such as New York City or Washington but not to operate any of the line or haul transportation in between the terminals. 
    What the forwarder does is to assemble the shipments inside one of the terminal areas and he can do that with his trucks under the provision of the statute and then he takes them and forms a carload shipment out of those. 
    He puts these small shipments together and he consolidates them as the general word, and he makes a carload shipment and then he tenders that shipment to a common carrier and it's almost always a railroad for the distances. 
    He tenders that to a common carrier under the common carrier's tariff rates.

    The carload?
speaker="d_robert_thomas" startTime="4186.151" stopTime="4212.921">
    Mr. D. Robert Thomas 
    Yes, carload rates. 
    Now the carload rates of course -- the carload rate for a single carload is less than the total amount of the rates for each of these individual shipments and the forwarder pays his own expenses and he makes his profit by that spread between the rates. 
    His own rates, the forwarders' own rates must be just and reasonable to the shipper of the small goods. 
    They are regulated by the Interstate Commerce Commission and they must be just and reasonable.

    Could the railroad itself do that same job within the terminal area accumulated cargo?
speaker="d_robert_thomas" startTime="4219.624" stopTime="4362.222">
    Mr. D. Robert Thomas 
    The railroad can do and by -- and the motor carrier, Your Honor, and the water carrier can all do the same job in this respect. 
    Each of them can operate with the pick up and delivery service in the terminal area and they do. 
    There are certain limitations in different places but that's typical. 
    Each one of them does it. 
    But when the railroad collects those small shipments that it has, it takes them and handles them in its own rail service. 
    When the motor carrier collects them, it's authorized to handle them in the Part II type of service and when the water carrier collects them, it takes them by water and down to the destination, and then it comes to delivery. 
    The distinction and the difference between the freight forwarder mode and the thing that Congress has called and recognized in Part IV, has stated in Part IV, to be what it calls the inherent nature of freight forwarding. 
    The inherent nature of freight forwarding is not this matter of the collection of the shipments at each hand because all carriers do that. 
    The distinctive nature of freight forwarding and within the essence of the trouble that these rules get into is that the nature of freight forwarding is to take those shipments that it collects, combine them and then ship them on an operating carrier, but we are not an operating carrier. 
    We ship over an operating carrier and freight forwarders are the only mode of operation of a transportation agency of which there is a statutory provision for that method of operation. 
    That statute is in Part IV, provides that freight forwarders may utilize the services of a railroad or of a motor carrier or a water carrier “for the whole or any part of the transportation of such shipments”, and that is not in anyone of the rest of the sections. 
    And moreover, it's entirely clear if we looked to the congressional history of what Congress intended that Congress expressly when it enacted Part IV, expressly decided and deliberately stated that it did not want these carriers by railroad or carriers by motor carrier or carriers by water carrier to be engaging in freight forwarding which is the matter of the shipping between the terminals.

    Mr. D. Robert Thomas 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    I was mentioning before the recess that Congress had deliberately examined and made its own conclusion as to whether these other carriers should be permitted to engage in the freight forwarding mode. 
    The Freight Forwarder Act was adopted in 1942 and in the legislative history preceding that, the principal report which was reflected in the final form of the Bill was a report made by the House of Representatives Committee. 
    That deliberate -- that Committee deliberately took up this question about the relationship of the freight forwarder mode with the other carriers. 
    And the Committee started off its report by calling attention to the fact or saying that forwarders perform a unique type of transportation service. 
    And then on the first page also, it mentioned that forwarders, they utilize the services of rail, motor and water carriers and ship by whatever means is the best way to do the shipping and that's what makes their form of operation unique.

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Would you mind telling me in verse succinctly how this order affects you as a freight forwarder?
speaker="d_robert_thomas" startTime="4447.551" stopTime="4478.729">
    Mr. D. Robert Thomas 
    Yes, Mr. Justice. 
    As freight forwarders, this affects us in -- in -- in one or two or three different kinds of very sharp ways. 
    One is it permits the motor carriers and the water carrier but particularly the motor carriers they are our primary competitors. 
    It permits them to offer the shippers throughout the country the type of operation that the freight forwarders have been operating under the method of shipping by rail. 
    The rules themselves --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="4478.729" stopTime="4481.797">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    You mean it properly gives them advantage of being forwarders when they're not?
speaker="d_robert_thomas" startTime="4481.797" stopTime="4510.674">
    Mr. D. Robert Thomas 
    It does exactly that, Your Honor. 
    It makes them -- every one of these water carriers, it makes them a freight forwarder. 
    They can choose under the rules as the Commission sets them up, it gives the motor carriers who up to now have been operating -- required to operate under the Act and intended by Congress to operate as motor carriers in the ways the Part II describes or water carriers in this similar kind of way. 
    It gives each one of them the option to add on to that another mode of operation which is the freight forwarder mode. 
    In other words --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="4510.674" stopTime="4514.273">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    They go out and gather it up, collect it together and then ship them in cargo lines?
speaker="d_robert_thomas" startTime="4514.273" stopTime="4539.031">
    Mr. D. Robert Thomas 
    Exactly. 
    Now, all of them can gather and all of them do and all of them have historically gathered these small shipments but then comes the way in which they get it from this concentration point over to the destination concentration point and that's what we have the distinction in the different modes of operation. 
    The forwarders do what their name implies really. 
    They forward the shipment by shipping it over other carriers.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="4539.031" stopTime="4539.043">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Well, isn't there --
speaker="d_robert_thomas" startTime="4539.043" stopTime="4579.359">
    Mr. D. Robert Thomas 
    But that has not been the method of operation of the other carriers, motor carriers or railroads. 
    They do not ship and they are not intended by Congress to be forwarders and to act as forwarders and to -- and to ship. 
    As a matter of fact, that's what the Congress, in drawing up the Act, came to that expressed conclusion. 
    The word it expressed in the Committee Report was that it came to a conclusion that there should be a policy and I'm quoting, “Of not permitting” this is in quotes, “Of not permitting them --” that is the railroads and the motor carriers and the freight -- and the water carriers “-- to engage directly in the freight forwarding business.”

    But isn't there a substantial --
speaker="d_robert_thomas" startTime="4579.423" stopTime="4581.010">
    Mr. D. Robert Thomas 
    And the reason why they -- so they came --
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="4581.010" stopTime="4594.648">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Isn't there a substantial difference in freight rates between carload lots and freight rate that would be applicable to this piggyback service?
speaker="d_robert_thomas" startTime="4594.648" stopTime="4637.223">
    Mr. D. Robert Thomas 
    The freight -- there is a difference in freight rates, Your Honor, yes. 
    What the -- the -- both of those are services held up by the railroads. 
    They hold up the boxcar service and the forwarders use the boxcar for the service for much of the service. 
    They have in the past, historically, as a railroad puts in piggyback service and holds that out, the forwarders are able to use that lower rate basis to what applies to the piggyback service. 
    They either -- the forwarder either puts the goods in the boxcar or consigns that to the destination where it puts the goods in trailers. 
    It takes you -- they took trailers to make up the carload shipment and consigns that to the destination. 
    So that the forwarder will do is use both boxcar service and the TOFC service.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="4637.223" stopTime="4648.336">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    How does the rate applicable to the trailers work in piggyback? 
    That is to say that -- you say it takes two trailers to constitute a carload, is that right?
speaker="d_robert_thomas" startTime="4648.336" stopTime="4649.296">
    Mr. D. Robert Thomas 
    Typically, yes.
speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="4649.296" stopTime="4661.102">
    Justice Abe Fortas 
    But if a single trucking company should put two trailers on a flatcar, would it get a carload lot?
speaker="d_robert_thomas" startTime="4661.102" stopTime="4661.583">
    Mr. D. Robert Thomas 
    Yes it would, Your Honor.

    Justice Abe Fortas 
    Right?
speaker="d_robert_thomas" startTime="4662.060" stopTime="4687.866">
    Mr. D. Robert Thomas 
    That's considered to be a carload lot. 
    And that is the tendering and the rate typically applies. 
    There are some exceptions, but the typical basis is the tendering of two trailers on a single carload and then of course ties in with the economy a little bit but there is room for them on the typical flatcar. 
    And on the typical basis, the two trailers or two containers without wheels constitute the one carload lot.

speaker="d_robert_thomas" startTime="4696.034" stopTime="4742.177">
    Mr. D. Robert Thomas 
    I am against Mr. Ginnane in this because Mr. Ginnane argues as I do that this thing, as a matter of fact, emphasized that these rules would make shippers and forwarders -- he didn't say forwarders, but he said these rules would make shippers out of the motor carriers that they would be acting as shippers, Your Honor. 
    The other day, last Thursday, he emphasized that strongly. 
    They'd be acting as shippers or patrons of the railroads and that's the way they would operate if these rules went into effect but when they become shippers and this is where I'd part company with Mr. Ginnane, when they act as shippers, they are no longer acting in the way in which they are authorized by the Congress to act in the mode of operation for motor carriers. 
    When they become shippers Your Honor, they are then --

    Mr. D. Robert Thomas 
    Your Honor, they -- as a -- it is in a matter of discrimination, I think on that and the discrimination runs in a different kind of direction. 
    It is a wholly different form that Congress for example prohibited. 
    There is a section in the Freight Forwarding Act that actually prohibits these people from becoming -- from being -- pardon.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="4775.162" stopTime="4775.932">

    Which people?

    Mr. D. Robert Thomas 
    The motor carriers and the railroads and water carriers from being permitted by the Commission to operate or to have -- to have as freight forwarders. 
    The Commission made no reference to that in its report. 
    It's a result of this policy, that provision of Section 410 (c) and that's at the back of our brief -- is in the Act that forbids the granting of any freight forwarding permit to these water carriers and railroads and those are the only persons that Congress has forbidden the Commission to grant a freight forwarding permit to. 
    And yet, as Mr. Ginnane said, operating under these rules, these people that is the motor carriers, the water carriers, and the railroad -- they're talking again the rules about motor carriers and water carriers, would be acting as shippers and as patrons, it would be allowed to by the Commission and permitted to by the Commission. 
    And when they are allowed to do that by he Commission and permitted to do it, they were then being permitted by the Commission to do exactly what Congress have said the Commission shall not grant them with the authority to do it and that is to make their operations in the freight forwarding way. 
    They carry on freight forwarding.

    He has said that the railroads could comply with these rules by cancelling the tariff rates or piggyback shipping and that would be a full compliance with these rules and if -- if that happened, our people, our freight forwarders would be entirely out of piggybacking because we cannot do anything except ship on tariff rates, and yet the motor carriers can make these joint rates under Section 216 (c), they can -- they can make joint rates and joint through route arrangements with the railroads and the motor carriers would then be competing by providing piggyback service for their (Voice Overlap) --

    Mr. Robert W. Ginnane 
    May it please the Court. 
    The question was asked this morning, why the railroads --
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="5433.755" stopTime="5435.386">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Why what?
speaker="robert_w_ginnane" startTime="5435.386" stopTime="5718.874">
    Mr. Robert W. Ginnane 
    A question was asked this morning as to why the railroads are unwilling to accept the tender of traffic from a motor carrier at rates which presumably are compensatory. 
    The same rates which they offer TOFC service to the shipping company. 
    You got only one answer and there's only one answer really in the railroads briefs and that is that it would create shipping problems. 
    It's a myth. 
    They conjure up the prospect of the railroad having dump on it at 4 o'clock in a Friday afternoon, a 100 load of trailers by a motor carrier. 
    In today's transportation operations that sort of thing doesn't happen. 
    If a big shipper wants motor carriers -- wants piggyback service on any sort of a scale which is 100 trailers a week. 
    He must sit down with the railroad weeks in advance and they schedule this traffic so that the railroad will have that equipment in position regularly at a certain time everyday. 
    And similarly, any motor carrier that wants to utilize at any significant scale the piggyback service of a railroad, has got to sit down and participate in the same process of planning and coordination. 
    To give you a simpler example, if at 3 o'clock this afternoon I called up Mayflower Van Lines and said, “Now I want to move tomorrow morning at 9 o'clock.” 
    Frankly, I'd be lucky if I've got service within three or four days. 
    These people have to schedule their operations otherwise they're wasting equipment. 
    They don't have it in position. 
    And the railroads operating problems would be just the same in dealing with a motor carrier as it would be in dealing with a big shipper. 
    There is a significant difference between the position of the railroad appellants in this Court. 
    The Western and Southeastern except Southern, the Western, Southeastern and Eastern railroads, while they contend that under the Act, a railroad -- a motor carrier can perform only motor carrier operations in a motor vehicle over the highway. 
    There -- they concede a big qualification of that. 
    They say, except if we concur than they -- than they can operate -- operate, they can utilize piggyback service. 
    And they say, all except southern and the freight forwarders that the motor carrier can participate in piggybacking in two ways, one under Plan V and one under Plan I. 
    Now, Southern and the freight forwarders in taking the same position carry to the -- carry it further, they would knockout motor carrier participation in Plan I and indeed, southern and the freight forwarders have a separate lawsuit to accomplish that pending down on the three-judge court in Dallas, Texas. 
    Now you're told, Congress has provided for joint service between the rail and motor carriers in classical through route and joint rate arrangements and that this will take care of all -- of -- of all in need in this area. 
    I would like to call the Court's attention that in 1965, out of piggyback movement of trailers of one -- over 1,400,000, only 4% took place under Plan V in classical through route joint rate arrangements where the business has done primarily under the All-Rail Plan, Plan II which was related Plan II and a half, 42% of the trailers moved under Plans II and II and a half; Next, under Plan III, the open tariff not available to motor carriers, 26%. 
    The only significant motor carrier participation and utilization of piggyback services was under Plan I which accounted for 23% and as I say Southern and the freight forwarders are trying to knockout Plan I which would mean that the motor carriers in terms of the history to date would participate in about 4% of trailer on flatcar service.

    Justice Byron R. White 
    Mr. Ginnane, isn't the -- hasn't -- isn't the Commission -- hasn't it changed his mind considerably about the acceptability of one carrier operating service by another mode? 
    Hasn't this --It has indeed. 
    Isn't this quite a change in the --
speaker="robert_w_ginnane" startTime="5736.699" stopTime="5757.216">
    Mr. Robert W. Ginnane 
    It is indeed and the appellees make much of it that in 1939 and again in 1959 in the movement of trailers by rail, the Commission said, to act as a common carrier by motor vehicle and as a shipper by rail as to the same service is repugnant to the Act.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="5757.216" stopTime="5758.767">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Has this Court ever touched on that?
speaker="robert_w_ginnane" startTime="5758.767" stopTime="5953.326">
    Mr. Robert W. Ginnane 
    No sir. 
    Neither in 1939, in 1954 or 1956 has the Commission explained the theory -- that theory or repugnancy. 
    As a matter of fact, it didn't even explain why in 1936 it had held the contrary and that is what it is now holding. 
    Back in 1936, the Commission said, we have here a published rail tariff and a motor carrier would have the same right to make shipments there under as any member of a body forwarder. 
    The Commission has indeed changed its position. 
    It's going back to its 1936 position as a result of its most comprehensive investigation of trailer and flatcar services. 
    An investigation made at the time when it is now a reality, at the rate of 1,400,000 trailers a year, whereas in a prior investigation in 1940, piggybacking was just a dream. 
    There was so little bit of going on that we don't even have statistics, nobody kept statistics. 
    I submit to you that this case really represents the railroad's traditional position that a coordinated transportation system which is an objective of the National Transportation Policy can be achieved only on their terms. 
    It's no accident that there a very few rail-motor joint rates in existence in this country and that very few piggyback trailers move under rail-motor carrier joint rates. 
    In 1941, the railroad industry entered into a consent decree outlying concerted refusal to enter into through routes and joint rates with motor carriers. 
    Later in United States against Pennsylvania in 323 U.S., this Court had to sustain the Commission's order requiring the railroads to interchange cars with sea trade thereby making that new technological service feasible. 
    This case involves more than a lot of questions of technical, highly technical statutory interpretation. 
    It means enabling and encouraging motor carriers to divert their trailers from crowded highways to the excess capacity of the railroad system. 
    And at that time, when the nation is confronted with railroad proposals for a restructuring of the rail system, large -- largely on the ground at intermodal competition, mostly motor carrier competition will continue to provide the competitive leaven in the loaf that therefore railroad should be allowed to achieve the admitted economies of restructuring. 
    We submit that this is no time to interpret the Act in such a way as to enable motor carriers to determine -- the railroads to determine the extent of motor carrier utilization of piggyback services.

    Mr. Robert W. Ginnane 
    Well, we don't think so. 
    Now, if they're talking about recently proposed legislation sponsored some of them by the Commission, the Commission has recommended to Congress that it would be given authority to require railroads and motor carriers to participate in through routes and joint rates and also that it would be given authority to require motor carriers to participate in through routes and joint rates with each other. 
    The questions are somewhat different --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="6023.834" stopTime="6026.437">

    Yes sir.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="6031.552" stopTime="6050.847">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    What about the suggestion that if the railroads -- that a railroad -- if it enters into a joint rate with -- or through route with one motor carrier, it must do so with another on the same term. 
    If that were the law, there wouldn't be much problem here, would there?
speaker="robert_w_ginnane" startTime="6050.847" stopTime="6073.868">
    Mr. Robert W. Ginnane 
    I understood the counsel for the Western Railroads to state that under Section 216 (c), if a railroad enters into joint rates with two or more motor carriers that the Commission can require equal divisions that each of the motor carriers get the same division on the same service. 
    Now, we submit that Section 216 clearly does not give such a power to the Commission.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="6073.868" stopTime="6074.019">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, in line --
speaker="robert_w_ginnane" startTime="6074.019" stopTime="6078.904">
    Mr. Robert W. Ginnane 
    It only empowers the Commission to pass upon the division of the joint rate --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="6078.904" stopTime="6079.255">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Between those --
speaker="robert_w_ginnane" startTime="6079.255" stopTime="6082.329">

    -- between the carriers that participate in the particular joint rate.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="6082.329" stopTime="6100.576">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    So you in the example I gave, do you think that the Act would permit -- 216 would permit a -- the railroads entering into an arrangement with one carrier at -- at motor carrier a dollar and another motor carrier at $2?

    Yes sir.

    But that your position is that there -- that there's another section that prevents it.
speaker="robert_w_ginnane" startTime="6107.894" stopTime="6122.847">
    Mr. Robert W. Ginnane 
    I'm not sure there is but I am clear that 216 (c) does not give us the power to do anything about it, after all, the -- the divisions of a joint rate or ordinarily, primarily on a matter of agreement between the carriers.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="6122.847" stopTime="6136.059">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    But you're saying though that if the railroads have an open tariff arrangement for the public that Section -- Sections 2 and 3 require that to be available to the truckers as well.
speaker="robert_w_ginnane" startTime="6136.059" stopTime="6144.458">
    Mr. Robert W. Ginnane

    Mr. Robert W. Ginnane 
    The most important difference is this.

    Mr. Robert W. Ginnane 
    Tenders freight under an open -- a railroad open tariff such as Plan III, in that case, the rate is fixed solely by the railroad by its unilateral act. 
    All -- all we say is that the motor carrier has the same right to use that rate as other shippers do -- as freight forwarders do. 
    In a joint rate arrangement, they agree, the railroad and the motor carrier jointly agree as to what the rate shall be whereas under the open tariff, the railroad fixes its own rate.
